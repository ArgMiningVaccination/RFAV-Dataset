It is hoped that the results w ill be useful in informing the design of future health programs supported by DFID , the Ministry of Health, and other stakeholders . Background: When the ASSP project began in 2012, the DRC was emerging from four decades of conflict and related mismanageme nt that had devastating effects on the economy, institutions, and the people . In the period from 1998 to 2012, it is estimated that over 3.5 million people died as a result of the conflict. In 2011, gross national income per capita was USD 190 and 71 percent of Congolese lived below the poverty line of USD 1.25 per day . Although t he country was relatively more peaceful in 2012, a crisis involving several armed factions persisted in the eastern part of the country and there remained longstanding political tensions. Despite the need for a more responsive health system, the ability of the government to provide access to health, population, and nutrition services of sufficient quality was limited , due to health workforce challenges , lack of transportation and communications infrastructure, security challenges, and limited health financing. At the beginning of this decade, the government spent only about four percent of the national budget on the hea lth sector, which was among the lowest levels of health spending in the world , and there was a large concern that as much as 70 percent of the population had little or no access to the health services resulting from both physical and financial barriers. By the early 2010s, health indicators had improved compared to much lower levels ex perienced during the mid -2000s. Nevertheless, according to the 2013- 14 Demographic and Health Survey, under -five mortality (104 deaths per thousand) and maternal mortality ( 846 per 100,000 live births ) remained very high, while the current use of modern co ntraceptive methods among women of reproductive age was only 8 percent. The nutritional status of children was also found to be extremely poor , with an estimated f orty-three percent of children under age five being stunted, and 23 percent being severely stunted. Program Description: As part of its program to assist the government in strengthening the country's health system, DFID awarded the five -year ASSP project to IMA World Health and its implementing partners and subcontractors in 2012. Aimed to improve reproductive, maternal, neo natal and child health (RMNCH), ASSP was a complex project, consisting of a wide array of population, health, and nutrition programmatic interventions and health systems strengthening interventions with multiple interacting outputs and impacts. ASSP init ially worked in 56 health zones that were purposively select ed. These consisted of all the health zones that were part of the Access to Healthcare Program ( Maniema (10), Kasai C entral (3), Tshopo (3) and Sud Kivu (4)) and 36 additional health zones in Nord Ubangi, Kasai, and Kasai Central , which were considered to have relatively weak health systems . Of these 56 health zones, the four health zones from Sud Kivu were dropped after one year, leaving 52 health zones in the project . An estimated nine million people live in these health zones. 6 Methods: The evaluation employed a mixed- methods design. The quantitative component of the evaluation used a quasi -experimental panel design with constructed treatment and comparison groups. Both descriptive and multivariate analyses were carried out. The multivariate analysis used a difference - in-differences approach based on population- based s urveys consisting of household, women, health facility, and health worker modules administered in 2014 and 2017, which was expected to be the final year of the project. All survey modules were administered face -to-face using paper forms or electronic devic es. The original study design called for the impact evaluation to be carried out in all five ASSP provinces. A baseline survey was conducted in all five provinces as -planned, but in 2017, civil unrest in two provinces, Kasai and Kasai Central, prevented the research team from returning to these provinces for the endline survey. To compensate for the loss of Kasai and Kasai Central, additional sampling areas were selected in the three remaining provinces to preserve the power of the analysis. Qualitative data were also collected at the time of the endline survey using key informant interviews, in- depth interviews , and focus group discussions among a broad range of stakeholders and beneficiaries. The purpose of the qualitative component was to explore perce ptions of stakeholders on project implementation in three areas - maternal health, child health care, and child nutrition - and reasons why selected strategies worked or did not work. Results: Overall, the results of the evaluation suggest that the ASSP project had a positive impact on several outcomes, including reducing the incidence of childhood illnesses (fever and suspected pneumonia), improving rates of deliveries in health care facilities among pregnant women, reducing out - of-pocket expenditure for outpatient care, and increases in improved sources of water and sanitation. However, the effects of the ASSP project were found to be insignificant for most of the outcomes analyzed, and for some outcomes, such the use of ANC services, facility -based trea tment of children with symptoms of ARI and fever, and stunting were found to be negative and significant. The report discusses the weight of the evaluation results by triangulating the results with other sources of evidence, including routine programmati c data made available from the project as well as data from other population- based surveys. Limitations: In interpreting the results of the study, several potential limitations of the research design and data should be noted. First, a \"gold standard\" randomized control trial was not feasible for this evaluation because the target health zones were selected non -randomly. Second, the limited availability of health information system data at the time the study was designed meant that the matching of comparis on groups could be done on only four characteristics. Third, due to unforeseen delays in obtaining approval of the research protocol, data collection for the baseline phase was delayed by ten months after launching of the ASSP project, which meant that the results of the difference -in- differences approach for some outcomes, such as maternal and child health care utilization, outpatient health care utilization, and use of modern contraception services, may be biased towards the null 7 hypothesis. Fourth, while the study was powered to detect overall differences between intervention area and matched comparison areas at the household- and individual -levels, it was not powered to detect differences stratified by population sub- groups (i.e. wealth groups and provinces). Nor was the analysis powered to detect differences in facility -level characteristics. Nevertheless, population sub - group DID models and facility -level DID model were estimated and presented in order to aid in the interpretation of the study findings, and in some instances, the DID results from these models were found to be statistically significant. Fifth, in interpreting the results, it should be noted that the analysis excluded Kasai/Kasai Central, the provinces where ASSP had the highest level of activity, the greatest number of health zones, and a ccording to ASSP routine program data, the most active uptake of some services. Sixth, an assumption of the DID model is that the only systematic difference between the ASSP and non- ASSP groups relates to the exposure to the ASSP project. As mentioned abov e, this assumption may not have been met, as the World Bank introduced its new project Projet de D\u00e9veloppement du Secteur de Sant\u00e9, which focused on performance -based financing to improve the delivery of health and family planning services , in some of the non -ASSP health zones. Although statistical controls were used to account for this possible bias, it must nonetheless be considered a potential limitation. In addition to the research limitations described above, several contextual issues should also be considered when interpreting the evaluation results. Since 2013, political tension and violence repeatedly and significantly interrupted ASSP operations, and in 2016, substantial civil conflict occurred in Kasai and Kas ai Central, which hampered ASSP operations between August 2016 and July 2017, and as mentioned above, prevented the ability of data collectors for this evaluation to return to Kasai to carry out the endline survey . In addition, provinces in eastern DRC Kivu insecurity during the ASSP project due to several instances of political violence . These attacks slowed down ASSP operations as caution was exercised to minimize the exposure of staff members to militia violence. Recom mendations: Based on the study findings, the following are recommendations to consider for future DFID programming. More formative research focused on community perceptions and needs. This recommendation is based on the qualitative research findings indic ating that 1) perceptions of low quality of care as well as cultural practices and social norms are important factors that constrain the use of facility -based maternal and child health care services, and 2) time constraints, lack of availability of caregiv ers, stigma associated with having a malnourished child, and other factors adversely affecting the uptake of the project's home gardening approach to improving child nutrition. More use of formative research would allow for greater consideration of geograp hical and cultural differences, and adaptations in the design of program approaches to better coincide with contextual conditions. More focus on incorporating behavior change and communications strategies in the design of interventions. This recommendat ion is based on limited attention that such interventions 8 received in the ASSP approach, as well as on qualitative research findings that suggested that behavioral factors limited the uptake of key ASSP interventions. More programmatic emphasis on the rol e that changes in provider payment strategies (i.e. changing how facility- and community- based health workers are paid) can play in influencing health worker motivation and incentives, and in turn, service quality and availability. This recommendation is based on the qualitative research findings indicating that reductions in pay in Maniema may have had the unintended consequence of reducing health worker motivation of both community -based and facility -based health workers, and as a result, the quality of health services. More use of piloting to inform decisions on whether and how interventions should be scaled up, particularly for experimental community- based interventions that rely on untested assumptions regarding community and health worker behaviors, and more emphasis on monitoring and evaluation of those interventions. This recommendation is based on the results indicating limited uptake of the home gardening approach as well as the community- based health financing approach, investigated through a se parate operations research study, that was intended to mobilize household pre -paid premiums for local health centers. More programmatic emphasis on supervision of local health officers and health workers and on improving the collection, availability and use of routine data, beyond the data that is available in the DHIS2. This recommendation is based on findings from the qualitative research component of the study that indicated that limited supervision of health workers may have played a role in constraining the use of ASSP -supported interventions, and findings from an operations research study on the project's community -based financing strategy that indicated problems in the quality and use of programmatic data that was reported to the Kinshasa -based ASSP management team. 9 Executive summary [In H ealth DFID Department for International Development DHS Demographic and Health Survey DRC Democratic Republic of Congo EU European Union FBN Faith Based N etwork IRC International Rescue Committee KSPH Kinshasa School of Public Health MERLIN Medical Emergency Relief International MOH Ministry of Health RMNCH Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal and Child H ealth SNIS National Health I nformation S ystem WASH Water, Sanitation, and H ygiene UNFPA United Nations Population Fund USAID United States' Agency for International Development 11 i. Country context Geographic, economic and political context The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the largest country in Sub- Saharan Africa, with borders with nine countries and a land surface area of 2.3 million square kilometers. The country is rich in natural resources, including mineral deposits, forests, water, and arable land. It has a strategic location, and a young population. When the ASSP ( Acc\u00e8s aux Soins de Sant\u00e9 Primaires ) project began in 2012, the DRC was emerging from four decades of conflict and related mismanagement that had devastating effects on the economy, institutions, and the people (World Bank, 2013). In the period from 1998 to 2012, it is estimated that over 3.5 million people died as a result of the conflict. Millions more were pushed into poverty due to displacement and the loss of their economic livelihoods. By 2012, most of the country had returned to relative peace, although in eastern DRC a crisis involving the M23 armed group as well as other armed factions persisted. In addition to armed conflict, the DRC ha d experienced longstanding political tensions. The 2011 presidential and legislative elections were marred by violence and disputes about the results, which reflected deep political divisions and the fragility of DRC's electoral institutions. In 2012, pov erty remained widespread and the country was not on track to reach any of the Millennium Development Goals by the 2015 deadline (World Bank, 2013). In 2011, gross national income per capita was USD 190 and 71 percent of Congolese lived below the poverty l ine of USD 1.25 per day. Individuals living in rural areas were more likely to be impoverished than individuals in urban areas (75 percent vs. 61 percent). In 2012, DRC ranked last among 187 countries in the Human Development Index. Heath system cont ext The DRC's government -run health system is organized on three levels: central, provincial, and peripheral (zone de sant\u00e9 or health zone, the equivalent of a district in most countries). The Ministry of Health at the central level is responsible for ov erall policy direction and stewardship, and the management of national programs. At the provincial level, the provinces are responsible for providing technical support and supervising health zones. At the peripheral level, each health zone covers an aver age population of 110,000 and includes a central health zone office and at least one general reference hospital. The health zone is divided into health areas (aires de sant\u00e9), each of which contains, in theory, at least one health center or health post that is responsible for providing a minimum package of services as defined by the government. As described later in this section, the government had received significant technical and financial support from major bilateral and multilateral partners, including Britain's Department for International Development (DFID), the United States' Agency for International Development (USAID), the European Union, the World Bank, and the United Nations, including the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). 12 In the early 1990's, the DRC health system was considered to be among the best in Africa. However, the system experienced \"a near total collapse\" between 1995 and 2001 when the government disengaged from the health and educatio n sectors as part of a structural adjustment policy that was recommended by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in exchange for macroeconomic assistance. Public funding for the country's decentralized health system was drastically reduced a nd faith- based organizations and other non- government organizations became the principal health care providers at the health zone level. Nevertheless, reduced funding for social services as well as discontent with the government's capacity to manage the e conomic and social crises and address widespread poverty led to pillage in many parts of the country, and as a result, the breakdown of government control and normal societal functioning. In the beginning of this decade, the government spent only about four percent of the national budget on the heath sector, which although higher than in previous years, was among the lowest in the world (World Bank, 2013). Consequently, out -of-pocket health payments from clients and development assistance for health (DA H) had helped to maintain a minimal availability of health services (Zinnen, 2012), but there was a large concern that as much as 70 percent of the population had little or no access to the health services resulting from both physical and financial barrier s (Waldman, 2006). While DAH has steadily increased in recent years, funds have largely been directed to vertical disease control programs such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis control and immunization programs. Although the government welcomed increased DAH provided by international partners, there was concern that the emphasis on vertical programs may have neglected primary health care services outside the scope of the programs and that the programs would not be sustainable once donor support ended (Ma urizzio, 2011). By the early 2010's, health indicators had improved compared to alarmingly low levels experienced during the mid 2000's. The 2013- 14 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) reported a 30 percent reduction in under -five mortality from 2007 to 2013- 14, although the rate remained high at 104 deaths per thousand ( Minist\u00e8re du Plan et Suivi de la Mise de la 2014) . The DHS also reported very high levels of maternal mortality in 2013- 14 - 846 per 100,000 live births, among the highest in the world - while the current use of modern contraceptive methods among women of reproductive age was only 8 percent. The nutritional status of children was a lso found to be extremely poor. Forty- three percent of children under age five were stunted, and 23 percent were severely stunted, an indication of chronic malnutrition. The three leading causes of child death, malaria (25- 30%), diarrhea (16%) and pneumonia (16%) were all preventable diseases (United Nations Population Fund, 2011). History of health programming in the DRC In addition to vertical disease -control programs, there have been several large -scale health systems strengthening projects implemented in the DRC, dating back to 1981. Many of these projects have 13 supported an integrated approach to improving the availabil ity and quality of health care services. These include the following: SANRU I (50 health zones covered from 1981 to 1985) SANRU II (100 health zones covered from 1985 to 1991) SANRU III (56 health zones covered from 2001 to 2006) PMURR (67 health zones covered from 2002 to 2008) AXxes (57 health zones covered from 2006 to 2009) Access to Health Care (20 health zones covered by 2008 to 2012) Integrated Health Project (79 health zones covered from 2010 to 2015). The AXxes project, implemented by IMA World Health, covered Eastern provinces (West Kasai, East Kasai, South Kivu, Maniema, Katanga). The Integrated Health Project, funded by USAID and implemented by Management Sciences for Health, covered health zones in four provinces (East Kasai, West K asai, Katanga, South Kivu). The DFID- funded Access to Healthcare Program was implemented from 2008 to 2012 by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Medical Emergency Relief International (MERLIN) in 20 Health zones located in Kasai Occidental, Ma niema, Orientale, and Sud Kivu provinces. The budget of the program was 80 million pounds (GBP) to support a comprehensive package aimed at improving access to basic health care with a particular emphasis on the vulnerable groups defined as pregnant women, children under five years of age, survivors of sexual violence and indigents. The outputs of the program were: (1) i ncreased access to antenatal and delivery services and the use of modern contraceptives; (2) increased access to child health services i n target areas; (3) improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malaria in target areas; (4) enhanced capacity of local health authorities to effectively manage services and ensure quality health care delivery; and (5) st rengthened community involvement in health activities. Although the aims of the program were similar to those of ASSP, as described below, the Access to Healthcare Program took on a different approach. Like ASSP, the main interventions consisted of support to public primary health car e centers and hospitals through the financing of day -to-day running costs; construction and rehabilitation of health facilities; provision of medical equipment; training of health workers; and provision of medicines and salaries supplements. However, thro ugh this program, the vulnerable groups received free health care while the rest of the population benefited from subsidized services. Moreover, the program also provided supplemental payments to health workers . Workers received a $75 fixed payment and a $25 performance -based payment, which was in addition to any government salaries the workers received. (Under ASSP, the payments were phased out by the implementing partners by $25 each month. Firstly, the $25 performance -based component of the payment was withdrawn two months after the start of the new ASSP project (in June 2013). Then 14 the fixed income component was reduced by $25 every month thereafter, so all these payment s to workers ended in September 2013). Based on routine data extracted from the national health information system (SNIS) at the end of the program, it was has determined that the removal of user fees led to an immediate and sustained increase in service utilization (Maini et al., 2014). Howeve r, while there appeared to be good performance in process -oriented indicators (such as distribution of bed nets, vaccination of children or the holding of meetings and supervision visits), performance in their corresponding outcomes (such as the proportion of children sleeping under a bed net, the absence of measles outbreaks, consistency of drug supplies and adherence to treatment guidelines) appeared weaker than expected. Concurrent project s There were also other large health systems projects that wer e implemented with support from other donors during the period the ASSP project was implemented . Beginning in 2016, the World Bank in collaboration with the DRC government , introduced a performance -based financing (PBF) project in the DRC. The Health Strengthening for Better Maternal and Child Health Results Project (PDSS) was introduced is aimed to improve service delivery by awarding bonuses to health providers for achievi ng pre-specified service quality targets. The program is being implemented in 11 provinces (i.e. Mai - Ndombe, Kwilu, targeting approximately 24 million people . The World Bank is in the process of evaluating the impact of the project. Their evaluation research design includes both health zones covered by PDSS as well as other health zones that are receiving additional health financing not linked to PBF. In addition, in bilateral cooperation with the DRC, Belgium is funding the Support Program for Provincial Divisions . The program covers three provinces , Kwilu, South Ubangi and Tshopo , and aims to improve the performance of health zones in improving planning, the supervision of health facilities and the efficient management in order to health care quality and accessibility. ii. ASSP Project Description Overview, goals and objectives As part of its program to assist the government in strengthening the country's health system, DFID awarded the five -year ASSP project to IMA World Health and its implementing partners and subcontractors in Fall 2012 (Table 1). The primary objective of the ASSP project was to improve RMNCH in the DRC while strengthening the health system through four main outputs: Output 1: Enhanced health service delivery and quality; Output 2: Increased empowerment and accountability in health service planning and delivery; 15 Output 3: Improved access to health services; and Output 4: Incre ased and sustainable access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation. The project was intended to build on DFID's previous projects aimed to improve access to health care and delivering health results in the DRC through its predecessor project, the Acce ss to Health -care program, which ended in December 2012 but adopted a new approach of working more through Faith Based Networks (FBN) to improve the sustainability of the health system. ASSP interventions were designed to align with the government's health sector policy (IMA World Health, 2012). ASSP initially worked in 56 health zones that were purposively select ed. These consisted of all the health zones that were part of the Access to Healthcare Program ( Maniema (10), Kasai C entral (3), Tshopo (3) and Sud Kivu (4)) and 36 additional health zones in Nord Ubangi, Kasai, and Kasai Central , which were considered to have relatively weak health systems . Of these 56 health zones, the four health zones from Sud Kivu were dropped after one year, leaving 52 health zones in the project Figure 1.1). 1 An estimated nine million people live in these health zones. 1 In 2015, the 11 provinces of the DRC were divided into 26 provinces. In this report, we use the current province names. 16 Table 1. 1.

Theory of C hange Figure 1.2 presents the ASSP Project's Theory of Change, which was developed by IMA World Health in consultation with DFID to provide a simplified overview of how the ASSP project was expected to have an impact on reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and chil d health outcomes. The Theory of Change presented here has been adapted from the original design to reflect changes made over the course of the project. As shown in Figure 1.2, ASSP consisted of a broad range of facility - and community -based strategies designed to: 17 1. Strengthen the public health sector at the provincial, health zone, facility and community level though improved availability of infrastructure, equipment, supplie s and improved financial and managerial practices; 2. Improve environmental health in targeted areas via the introduction of \"Village Assaini,\" a WASH approach supported by UNICEF; and 3. Broaden key governance functions, including accountability, governance, st ewardship and leadership. These health strategies, in turn, were expected to improve the availability, quality, and utilization of essential health services including antenatal care, deliveries, family planning services, diagnosis and treatment of malaria, and child health services, as well as to improve environmental health. The ultimate objectives of the overall package of interventions are to improve reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health outcomes. 18 Figure 1.2. ASSP Project's Theory of Change 19 Table 1.2 provides an overview of the types of interventions implemented by the ASSP project. The list of activities is organized by health sector pillars (listed in column 1), which the thematic areas of health systems strengthening that the government uses in its health sector strategy. In addition, each activity is linked to the Theory of Change as activities are targeted toward quality and access of service delivery, commun ity engagement or environmental health. As indicated in the table, ASSP covered a broad range of interventions, including: improving infrastructure and providing equipment to health facilities; enhancing the quality of service delivery and the range of se rvices offered at the facility and community level; improving the medical supply chain procedures; providing trainings to increase human resource capacity; strengthening the health information system and human resource database to improve data quality; ref ining the governance of healthcare delivery to be more responsive to communities; increasing financial access to individual users and creating sustainable financial policies for health facilities; and introducing more innovate intersectional activities suc h as WASH and nutrition programs. Additionally, while certain activities will provide services to the general population, other activities were specifically focused on improving health outcomes for women and children. 20 Table 1.2. Overview of ASSP interventions and activities Health sector pillar Specific interventions or strategies Description of activities and link to Theory of Change Infrastructure and Equipment Renovation and construction of health centers and hospitals The project planned to build new health centers and hospitals, as well as provide the needed major and minor repairs in health establishments and selected nursing schools in supported health zones. The project also planned to build efficient incinerators and placenta pits for selected facilities. This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality and access to healthcare. Provision of equipment to health zones and related facilities The project planned to provid e medical equipment and supplies to 55 hospitals and 962 health centers: Medical equipment and supplies include: Improved cold boxes and solar refrigerators Kerosene and spare parts for cold chain equipment Medical waste management supplies General medical supplies Laboratory equipment and supplies Facility supplies include: Bicycles for community health workers Laptops, networked sim cards and printers Motorbikes and vehicles for selected health offices Solar energy kits This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality and delivery. Service Delivery Provision of a minimum package of services ASSP planned to ensure the minimum packages of services are available at all supported health facilities. This package includ es basic curative care, preventative care, promotional activities, community activitie s, complementary package of activities to be established in hospitals and management/administrative activities . This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality and access to healthcare. Community -based interventions ASSP planned to introduce and/or strengthen several community -based services, including: Immunization: support immunization and Vitamin A distribution activities through the Reach Every District (RED) approach, and strengthen EPI micro pla nning at the health zone level and will facilitate vaccine transport from Kinshasa to the health zones. Modern family planning: support the provision of modern family planning methods and increase their accessibility at the community level. Mosquito -nets distribution: support the distribution of Long -Lasting Insecticide -treated Nets (LLTN) free of charge, and visit homes to help hang up the nets. Community wide behavioral communication campaigns (BCC) to promote a range of healthy behaviors (contracep tive use, immunizations, antenatal care, malaria prevention, etc.). Support groups for breastfeeding mothers 21 This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality and access to healthcare. Medicine Supply Chain Medicine procurement and distribution, supply chain management ASSP also planned to work with the existing regional centers for medicine procurement and distribution (CDR) to strengthen their capacity to continue supply chain management after the project ends. ASSP will planned work with the supported health facilities to ensure that all essential medications of good quality are purchased, properly transported and are reaching the target population. This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality and access to healthcare. Human Resources Pre-service training ASSP will provide the following: Support the nursing schools to produce well trained graduates Provide scholarships for nurses Pre-service training was expe cted to help improve health workers' knowledge and practices and hence improve the quality of services offered. In-service training ASSP also planned to provide the following training or training materials to health personnel in supported health zones: Maternal and Child Health (MCH): Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV/AHDS, fistula repair, breastfeeding, maternal and newborn health, and emergency obstetric care Fami ly planning, reproductive health and post abortion care Sexually transmitted infection care including post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) administration Nutrition Cervical cancer screening Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) management Drug management Lab testing Tuberculosis detection Malaria detection Behavior change communications Financial management In-service training is expected to help improve health workers knowledge and practices and hence improve the quality of services off ered. Health Management Information Strengthen the health information management system (SNIS) ASSP planned to contribute to strengthening the existing SNIS with the following: Provide information technology for electronic reporting Provide SNIS tools and forms to health facilities Implement DHIS2 software in all ASSP supported facilities which will serve as the electronic program for collecting SNIS data Train health facility s taff to use DHIS2 Conduct regular quality audits to assess the routine data being collected by the project. This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality by improving data quality. 22 Human resources information system ASSP planned to establish a human resources information system at the health zones and health facility level. This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality by improving data quality. Governance Norms and guidelines ASSP planned establish norms and guidelines for new programs and, where available, ensure that the national norms and guidelines are disseminated to health office and health facilities. They planned to conduct workshops to ensure that stakeholders are aware of these standards. This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality. Community evaluation and accountability ASSP planned to implement the following activity to ensure that communities have opport unities to participate in evaluating the project and are empowered to hold the health system accountable: Establish a pilot community hotline, encouraging community members to signal poor management practices, mismanagement, fraud, theft, corruption and other dysfunctions; put pressure on health zone officials to improve governance; and hold health service off icials accountable. Develop sustainable mechanisms for collecting information on community expectations and evaluations of health services Develop and promote a guidebook designed specifically for health zone officials on creative ways to actively invite and facilitate community participation in the health zone program Actively promote the theme of community ownership of the local health center through a variety of media including community radio, public billboards / posters, soccer balls and women's batik cloth and scarves. This activity was expected to contribute to increase community empowerment. Community health committees (CODESA) ASSP planned to strengthen the governance and oversight capacity of the community health committees (CODESA) by: Training CODEAS members to organize and moderate village meetings Updating the CODESA guidelines to establish clear roles and responsibilities of the group Training CODESA members on performance improvement Encourage and facilitate training of CODESA members and health center staff in their respective roles and responsibilities in the co -management of health centers and the mobilizing of community partnerships This activity was expected to contribute to increase community empowerment. Planning and management ASSP planned to work with individuals at multiple levels (national, provincial, health zone, community) to ensure the proper planning and management of the project including: Organizing workshops to coordinate the activities of the government, implementing partners, and local facilities Organizing regular informational meetings to engage stakeholders and partners at all levels Supporting provincial and district technical meet ings Ensuring regular supervision is taking place at all levels of the health system including the provincial health offices, hosp itals and health centers Supporting provincial heath districts and health zone teams This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of quality health care and community empowerment. 23 Finance Primes/financial incentives ASSP planned to provide primes (salary supplements) at a reduced rate to health workers and other health p ersonnel in health zones where this practice has been previously established. However, in the course of the project, ASSP primes will be eliminated such that no health worker in ASSP supported zones will receive financial incentives from donors. This act ivity was expected to contribute to the improvement of the access to health care and ensure sustainably. User fees ASSP planned to establish and disseminate guidelines for setting user fees to the provincial health offices This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of access to health care. Mobilization of health financing through Community Health Endowments (CHE) (agricultural cooperatives) ASSP planned to implement a community level income generating intervention that will provide additional finances to the health centers and reduce user fees for participants. This activity was expected to contribute to access to health care and community empowerment. Community Health Education Various ASSP planned to revitalize CODESAs and recruit and train RECOs to delivery health messages to communities. Information campaigns on various health topics were also planned. This activity was expected to contribute to health service utilization. Intersectional Collaboration Water and Sanitation, Hygiene (WASH) ASSP planned to implement a previously established WASH campaign, Village A ssaini, as well as an alternative package of activities yet to be determined. Activities include: Providing equipment and implementing activities related to water and sanitation Training individuals on the Village Assaini approach and providing promotion al materials for Village Assaini Providing water monitoring kits to clusters of supported villages Supporting community mobilization and initial WASH assessment efforts Establishing regular water testing activities for facilities in supported health zo nes Spring capping Building home latrines for individual households and composing latrines at health facilities and schools Building cisterns at schools and public facilities This activity was expected to contribute to the improvement of environmental health. Nutrition/Home gardening ASSP's nutrition project involves promoting home gardening activities indented to produce quality and nutritious food for household consumpti ons. Activities include: Training Community Health Workers (CHW) on how to implement the home gardening project at the household level, nutrition education and home visits to monitor child malnutrition Equip each health zone with a trained nutritionist Provide nutrition educat ion materials to health centers This activity was expected to contribute to access to health care and community empowerment. 24 iv. Linkages to international priorities The ASSP project is in line with DFID's global policy to improve health systems generally, and health outcomes linked to malaria, reproductive, maternal and child health specifically. In addition, the project reflects DFID's commitments to: Honor international commitments to meet health related development goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals and the subsequent Sustainable Development Goals, specifically by (a) increasing access to clean water, sanitation, healthcare and education, (b) reducing maternal and infant mortality, and (c) restricting the spread of major diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Lead international action to improve the lives of girls and women, specifically by leading international action to impr ove maternal health and access to family planning. Although DFID's approach of shifting away from vertical assistance to a more integrated model of service delivery is not new, interest in integrated models has increased, especially because of the desire of many governments to accelerate progress on reaching the health- related Millennium Development Goals and the subsequent Sustainable Development Goals and the promise this model holds on attaining those goals in an efficient manner (Pronyk et al., 2012; Bhutta et al., 2008) . The rationale is that the management and delivery of multiple services (e.g., family planning and immunization) within the same health center i s more efficient than having a client travel to separate specialist clinics for each service because of a reduction in both financial and time costs (Briggs and Garner, 2006) . Integrated delivery can also reduce duplication of services and improve the overall quality of care received (Br iggs and Garner, 2006) . v. Major events that have impacted the implementation of ASSP Political tension and violence Since 2013, political tension and violence have repeatedly and significantly interrupted ASSP operations , with a t least eight occurrences of demonstrations 2 occurring in DRC's major cities and at least five instances of \"dead city\"3 occurring. These events were met with substantial responses by government security forces , resulting in several casualties and the arrests of scores of political and civil society leaders. 2 The eight demonstrations took place in December 2013, January 2015, March 2015, May 2016, September 2016, November 2017, December 2017, and January 2018. 3 Paralysis of administrative and economic activities occurred in August 2013, February 2016, August 2016, October 2016, April 2017, and August 2017. 25 Conflict in Kasai In August 2016, civil war erupted in Kasai Central following the killing of Kamuina Nsapu, a traditional chief. This event triggered violent conflict, characterized by the disruption of normal activities, interruption of health service delivery, and population movements. From Kasai central, the conflict spread to Kasai and Kasai oriental provinces. Of note, ASSP operations in Greater Kasai, specifically in the new provinces of Kasai and Kasai Central, cover 28 health zones representing more than half of the 52 health zones supported by the project. ASSP operations were seriously hampered between August 2016 and July 2017. In consequence, despite a pilot survey being conducted in October 2017, the ASSP impact evaluation was not carried out in Kasai due to inability of data collectors to return to Kasai to carry out the endline survey . Ebola and yellow fever outbreaks During the course of ASSP, two Ebola outbreaks oc curred respectively in Boende, Tshuapa province (July 2014) and in Likati, Bas Uele province (May 2017). They were effectively contained by the Ministry of Health with assistance from international expertise and support. On the contrary, cholera control has been less successful. Large outbreaks have occurred every year in several provinces since 2013. While Ebola and cholera did not particularly affect ASSP operations, the project has contributed staff time and resources to fighting the outbreaks. Program management issues In Year Five 4 of the projects, program management issues led to drastic reduction of ASSP funded activities in Maniema during several months. Th is interruption ended when IMA World Health took over CARITAS, the initial Implementation Partner in Maniema. Another consequence of this event was a delay in transferring funds from Tulane to the Kinshasa School of Public Health (KSPH) for the endline study data collection. Hence, KSPH's supervisors did not receive funds on a timely basis to remunerate data collectors, and they were stranded in Nord and Sud Ubangi, Tshopo, and Maniema, resulting in increased field operation costs. Additionally, during ASSP Year Five, World Vision, the ASSP Implementation Partner in Nord Ubangi, ended collaboration with IMA World Health. This development slowed down the implementation of ASSP activities in the province until SANRU took over. Continued issues in Eastern DRC Throughout the implementation of ASSP, Eastern DRC provinces, specifically Ituri, Nord Kivu, Maniema and Sud Kivu, have experienced insecurity due to several instances of political violence . These attacks 4 ASSP's Year Five covered the period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. 26 resulted in slowing down ASSP operations as caution was exercised to minimize the exposure of staff members to militia violence. 27 References Bhutta, Zulfiqar A, Samana E Black (2008) Alma -Ata: Rebirth and Revision 6 -- Interventions to Address Maternal, Newborn, and Child Survival: What Difference Can Integrated Primary Health Care Strategies Make?.

Purpose, scope, and objectives Tulane University's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (Tulane) is responsible for developing and carrying out a robust, state -of-the-art evaluation of the overall impact of ASSP's comprehensive package of interventions to improve health care se rvice utilization, quality of care and health outcomes. The evaluation is prepared for DFID DRC and IMA, who will use the findings to understand the degree to which the ASSP project met its objectives and to inform the goals and design of current and future programs in the DRC. More widely, this work will be of interest to the DRC's Ministry of Health (MOH) and other international health partners. ASSP is a complex project, consisting of a wide array of programmatic and health systems interventions with mu ltiple interacting outputs and impacts. Therefore, to understand the full impact of ASSP as well as the factors enabling or limiting its success, it is necessary to assess the full range of intermediate outcomes, long -term outcomes, and impacts illustrated within the theory of change using a mix of quantitative and qualitative data sources. All of the activities within the ASSP project are intended to improve one or more of these outcomes and impacts; therefore, the full range of ASSP activities are encompa ssed in this evaluation. Further, the evaluation is conducted using data from a baseline and the final year of ASSP in order to allow the interventions as much time as possible to have an impact prior to the close of the project. It should be noted that at the time that the baseline survey was conducted, some project activities had already taken place. The specific activit ies that occurred before the baseline are listed in each of the results chapters in this report, and the direction of the suspected bias, if any, is discussed. Tulane is committed to the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development's Development Assistance Committee criteria for evaluating development assistance which are relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability (Development Assistance Committee, 1991). The impact evaluation gauges the ASSP's impact on coverage of health services and improved reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health. Sustainability is addressed through other intervention- specific st udies that are part of Tulane's research portfolio for the ASSP project as well as the impact evaluation. 5 This evaluation was conducted in accordance with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Ministry of Health was consulted during the evaluation design and will be engaged again as the results are disseminated. The evaluation measured changes in development incomes including health status, service utilization, and health system functionality. Although the national data system (DHIS2) was installed during the ASSP project and therefore could not be used for this work, the evaluation incorporated local systems by contracting the Kinshasa School of Public Health to lead both waves of quantitative data collection. 5 Tulane also conducted intervention- specific operations research studies (user fees, community health endowment, health workers' s alaries/incentives, family planning, water, sanitation and hygiene, governance, accountability and community engagement studies) that explore ASSP's effectiveness at meeting its objectives in those specific areas. Efficiency is assessed through a value for money analysis. 32 ii. Evaluation objectives The evaluation is designed to assess the impact of the ASSP project in the following areas, and to identify the factors that facilitated or inhibited the project in its effort to meet its goals: Child health and nutrition outcomes Maternal and child health care utilization Household out -of-pocket health expenditures Availability and use of modern contraceptive methods Access to and use of improved environmental health conditions Quality of facility -based services Community's level of participation in health services and health behavior change Gender is of particul ar interest to the MOH, the ASSP project and DFID; therefore, the evaluation also investigates whether ASSP reduces gender disparities in the use of selected health care services and health outcomes. Gender is approached as an issue that cuts across all of ASSP's activities, rather than as a single topic of focus. 33 iii. Outcome indicators Tables 2.1-2.3 list the intermediate output, long- term output, and impact indicators of focus, sorted by the component of the theory of change that they measure.

Study design The evaluation employs a mixed- methods design. Tulane, in partnership with the Kinshasa School of Public Health (KSPH), conducted a population- based survey consisting of household, women, health facility, health worker, and community leader modules in Apri l-May, 2014 and in July- September, 2017, the final year of the project. The endline survey included additional modules for hospitals, hospital workers, pharmaceutical depots, and health zone central offices. All survey modules were administered face-to-face using paper forms or electronic means. Qualitative data was collected at endline from community members, community and facility- based health workers, government officials, and implementing organizations through key informant interviews and focus groups. The quantitative data were analyzed to determine the impact of ASSP on key outcomes and impacts, using statistical techniques described below. Findings from the qualitative data were used to explain the reasons why the expected changes were or were not obs erved in utilization of services within the key areas of maternal health, child health, and child nutrition. The quantitative component of the evaluation used a quasi -experimental panel design with constructed treatment and comparison groups (Figure 2. 1). This was coupled with appropriate data analysis strategies to assess the plausible attribution of ASSP support on outcome and impact indicators. 36 Figure 2.1. Quasi -experimental partial panel design with intervention and matched comparison groups The ASSP project intervened in health zones in five provinces. Unfortunately, civil unrest in two provinces, Kasai and Kasai Central, prevented the impact evaluation from being carried out in those areas; although the baseline survey was conducted in those regions, the endline survey was not. The remaining provinces were treated as two sampling areas for the purpose of this evaluation. The first sampling area 6 consist ed of health zones within Nord Ubangi,7 and the second consisted of health zones within Maniema and Tshopo.8 A matched comparison group consisting of randomly selected villages within matched health areas outside of ASSP -supported health zones that did not receive the ASSP intervention package was also selected.9 Given that socio -demographic and behavioral factors likely differ between the provinces, the creation of two separate sampling areas and two matched comparison groups reduced potential confounding and control for secular trend differences influencing observed changes in outcomes in the respective geographic areas. Furthermore, it allowed for geographically representative estimates of population coverage and outcomes to be made for the intervention s ampling areas. Data was collected within four distinct groups (an intervention sampling area and a matched comparison group in each of the major geographic areas) to ascertain population point estimates for all health and intervention coverage outcomes and impact level indicators at baseline and follow -up. As mentioned above, a quasi -experimental partial panel design was used for the quantitative component of the study. Villages selected for inclusion in the baseline were also visited at endline . 6 In this context, a \"sampling area\" is synonymous with a \"survey domain.\" 7 Formerly Equateur 8 Formerly Province Orientale 9 ASSP -supported health zones in Nord Ubangi were ASSP health zones in Ubangi. ASSP -supported health in Maniema and Tshopo were matched with non- ASSP health zones within those provinces. 37 Where possible, households surveyed at baseline were surveyed again at endline. Those households that could not be located were replaced with a randomly -selected household within the same village. Additionally, new villages were selected at endline to co mpensate for the loss of the Kasai region from the study. By collecting data from additional households and health facilities in the remaining sample provinces that can be revisited, it will be possible to conduct a difference -in-difference approach to estimate impact by comparing intervention areas with matched comparison areas. Health zones in ASSP and non- ASSP areas that were selected for the survey are shown in Figure 2.3. Non -ASSP health zones are coded to indicate the degree to which they received the World Bank intervention. Figure 2.3 . Map of ASSP and non- ASSP health zones selected for the survey The qualitative component employed a mix of research methods including key informant interviews and focus groups, with separate study designs for each sub- component (e.g. maternal health, child health, child nutrition). v. Quantitative component To invest igate the overall impact of the project, Tulane has conducted a population- based evaluation consisting of household, women's, health facility, health provider, and community leader modules in April -May, 2014 (Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, 2015) and at the end of the project in July -September, 2017. The endline survey included additional modules for hospitals, regional centers for medicine distribution and procurement (CDRs), and health zone central offices (BCZs). Questionnaires w ere pretested in a rural health zone outside of Kinshasa. Data collection was conducted in French or local languages (Lingala in Nord and Sud Ubangi and Swahili in Maniema and Tshopo) by 38 data collectors local to the survey areas. All data collectors underw ent training on interview techniques, privacy, confidentiality and consent procedures. The study team obtained oral informed consent from each survey respondent. No incentives were offered for participation, and apart from participants' time, there was no cost to participate. Each module is described in detail below. Household module: Description: The household module covers major health topics of interest under the ASSP project including access to safe drinking water, immunizations, child malaria parasite prevalence, and child nutrition and well as community engagement, health care utilization for acute and chronic health problems and health care financing. Wherever appropriate, the module uses similar indicators and collection protocols as the Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Cluster Survey, to ensure comparability of data and processes. It also draws on questionnaires used by IMA and DFID in previous Knowledge -Practice -Coverage studies in the DRC. This module was administered at baseline and endline. Sampling: At baseline, a two -stage sampling strategy was used in intervention areas. At first stage, the sampling frame consisted of a full list of all villages with population estimates for each ASSP supported health area provided by IMA's needs assessment, which was conducted in June 2013. Villages were then dividedto create two s eparate lists of all possible villages in Nord Ubangi and Maniema/Tshopo. 10 Next, for each sampling area, 35 villages were selected using probability proportional to size to maximize sampling efficiency. This means a total of 70 villages were selected (35 i n each of the two sampling areas) for the intervention area. The second -stage sampling frames were created in the provinces where the survey teams mapped village boundaries and then enumerated all households in the village. Following complete enumeration, a constant number of 20 households was systematically selected from each village at the second stage to meet the desired sample size of 700 households in each sampling area. A three -stage sampling design was necessary in matched comparison areas, as a com plete list of villages with population estimates was not available. At the first stage, a comparison health area was matched to each health area that contained a selected village in the corresponding intervention sampling area. This was done using a list o f health areas with population estimates obtained from the MOH. Health areas were matched based on four criteria: geographic location, health area population size, health area urban/rural status, and health zone vaccination coverage. 11 Matched health areas were then randomly selected within each comparison group from listings of all health areas with the same four characteristics as the selected health area in 10 This process was also carried out in Kasa i; however, an evaluation of Kasai is not in the scope of this report. 11 Health zone vaccination coverage was used as a proxy as information on health area coverage was not available. Information on vaccination coverage was obtained from the national Extended Programme on Immunization. 39 the corresponding intervention sampling area. Thirty- five matched health areas were selected within each comparison group, one for each of the health areas containing a selected village in the corresponding intervention group (none of the health areas selected at baseline contained more than one village). This means a total of 70 health areas were selec ted (35 in each of the two comparison groups) for the comparison area. At the second stage, once teams were deployed, a detailed list of villages with population estimates was obtained from the health area office in the selected matched comparison health areas. One village was randomly selected from the list using simple random sampling. All households within each selected village were then enumerated in the same manner as in intervention sampling areas. In the third stage, 20 households were systematically selected from each village to meet the desired sample size of 700 households in each comparison group. The sample size calculation can be found in the study protocol in Appendix A. At endline, it was necessary to expand the sample size to compensat e for t he loss of Kasai, which could not be revisited due to security concerns. An additional 35 intervention villages and 35 matched comparison villages were selected in the two sampling domains (18 pairs in Nord Ubangi and 17 pairs in Maniema/Tshopo). Intervent ion villages were selected PPS, and control villages were matched using the original four criteria. The sampling procedures described above were carried out to select a total of 700 additional intervention households and 700 additional matched comparison households. Data collection procedures: The head of each selected household was interviewed. All individuals who slept in the household last night (the de facto population), as well as usual household members (the de jure population) were considered household residents. Information for all children under five years of age who are household members was also be collected. When possible, this was done by interviewing the mother. However, in a case where no mother was present, the primary caregiver was intervie wed to take into account vulnerable children, orphans and child- headed households. Height and weight data for children 0 to 59 months of age was collected using standard scales and height measurement tools in order to assess child nutrition status. This information was used to generate standardized measures for weight -for-height, weight -for-age and height -for- age. Finger pricks were performed on all children age 1 to 59 months who were household members and whose guardian consented to the procedure. The blood drops were tested for hemoglobin level and for malaria using a rapid diagnostic test. Children who tested positive for malaria, anemia, or edema were referred to the nearest health center. Women's module: The women's module collected data related to reproductive health, family planning, the health and nutrition of their children, mar riage and sexual activity, work, and attitudes toward violence against women. Wherever appropriate, this module also used similar indicators and collection 40 protocols as the Demographic and Health Survey. The women's module was administered at baseline and endline. All female household members of reproductive age (15- 49 years) residing in selected households were invited to participate in this survey module. When possible, the questions were administered out of earshot of other members of the household. Health facility module : The health facility module obtained information about staffing, patient volume, services performed, maternal and neonatal care, vaccination, infrastructure, equipment, laboratory, pharmacy, availability of drugs and supplies, medical w aste treatment, management and supervision, and community financing initiatives. It was administered to the government health center designated to serve each village selected for the household module . Data collectors administered the questionnaire to the n urse in charge of each facility. The health facility module was administered at baseline and endline, with the same facilities visited in both waves. Hospital module : The hospital module included all applicable questions from the health facility module. Additional questions related to user fees and health information technology are included. Tulane took a random sample of 32 health zones containing villages had been chosen for the household survey. The sample was taken to contain 8 health zones in ASSP are as and 8 health zones in non- ASSP areas in both the Nord/Sud Ubangi and Maniema/Tshopo survey domains. The government hospital within each health zone was surveyed. Data collectors administered the questionnaire to the physician in charge of each facility. This module was administered during the endline wave. Health worker module: The health worker module contained questions related to training, job duties, supervision, compensation and sources of income, and job satisfaction and motivation. This module wa s administered at baseline and endline; however, the individuals who responded to the baseline wave were not necessarily the same respondents in the endline wave. All health workers on duty at selected health facilities the day of the survey were invited to participate in the health worker survey. Individuals responsible for providing health care services (e.g., doctors, nurses, midwives) are considered to be health workers. A random sample of 4 physicians and 4 nurses at each selected hospital were also surveyed at endline only. Community leader module: The community leader module collected community- level data on community characteristics, sources of water, access to health care, development projects operating in the area, and communi ty participation in development. A minimum of two community leaders were surveyed in each selected village. Attempts were made to survey one health zone or health area official and one CODESA member. If no CODESA member was available, another prominent mem ber of the community such as a village chief or teacher was interviewed. This module was administered at baseline 41 and endline, however, the individuals who responded to the baseline wave were not necessarily the same respondents in the endline wave. Healt h zone central office module: This module was used to collect organization- level information and assess ASSP's level of influence on the performance of the BCZ. Specifically, the module covered staffing, infrastructure, user fee policies, supervision and c ommunity engagement, community funding initiatives, health information systems, and support and assistance from ASSP. Data collectors surveyed the central offices within the randomly -selected subset of 32 health zones. 12 The Chief Physician of the Health Zo ne or a designee responded to the survey. This module was administered during the endline wave. Regional centers for medicine distribution and procurement (CDR) module: The CDR module contained questions related to the CDR's infrastructure, staffing, stoc k management, product availability, procurement and distribution systems, quality assurance practices, sources of financing, challenges faced, and support and assistance from ASSP. All seven regional centers for medicine procurement and distribution that s erve the sampled health zones were surveyed. The director of the CDR or a designee responded to the questionnaire. This module was administered during the endline wave. Analytic approach The evaluation employs a quasi -experimental research design based on population- based household survey data linked with health facility survey data . This design is complemented by a qualitative research component, as explained below. The use of multiple data analysis methods pro vided a robust and comprehensive assessment of the plausible impact of the overall package of ASSP -supported interventions on a range of indicators. Analyses were conducted at the individual -, household -, facility -, and health worker -levels, depending on t he outcome of interest. (See Table 2 for a summary of outcome indicators and their respective units of analysis). All point estimates from surveys were weighted to correct for differences in sampling area sizes and inaccurate estimates of village sizes. A ll standard errors were empirically estimated to account for correlated data at the village -level. Differences in key outcome indicators of interest between intervention areas and comparison groups and between baseline and follow -up surveys w ere assessed with multivariate regression modeling to account for potential confounding factors. This approach is necessary, given the non- randomized study design. Such models will also allow us to assess the association of exposures to interventions and risk factors on health outcomes. In order to assess the impact of the ASSP project, a difference -in-differences analysis with a multiplicative interaction term in models for representing time*group assignment was used. In this way, the net program effect can be distinguished from the gross program effect, thereby limiting the bias of 12 The same health zones were visited for the hospital and health zone central office modules. 42 secular drift, external confounding factors , and potential confounding factors, to the extent possible. For all models, the different levels of analysis (e.g. village or individual) can have an impact on how one needs to adjust the standard errors. To account for this, standard errors were adjusted for clustering at the village -level using the survey commands in Stata. Many of the analyses, when appropriate, was stratified by gender , wealth groups, and province, to assess whether the project had differential impact s across various sub -groups. Additionally, controls for the presence of the World Bank intervention were included in all models. To assess the impact of ASSP on the amount of out -of-pocket expenditure, a generalized linear model (GLM) with log link was used, which can account for zero expenditures as well as the skewed distribution of spending. The results are reported as marginal effects and statistical tests are against the null hypotheses of equal spending between the ASSP and non- ASSP groups. A guide to interpreting the statistical results in this report can be found in Appendix B. It is important to point out that the difference- in-differences modeling approach hinges on the assumption that the effects of selection conditional on unobservable factors is solely through a time - invariant trend term. This is admittedly a strong assumption, which is difficult for us to verify in the absence of suitable pre -baseline t rend data for ASSP and non- ASSP areas. For example, it is possible that if the treatment areas had worse health outcomes at baseline than the matched comparison areas, then they might also have had slower rates of improvement than matched comparison areas. Unfortunately, this assumption could not be rigorously tested due to the unavailability of survey data prior to the baseline. After conducting the baseline survey, the Tulane team learned that the World Bank planned to assist the government to introduce a performance -based financing (PBF) project in some of the matched comparison areas covered by the ASSP baseline survey. Tulane later learned that the contracts that stipulate the payment of performance -based bonuses to health staff in health zones that w ere included in the ASSP impact evaluation were not signed until the summer of 2017, around the time the endline survey was carried out. Because there is a possibility that the program may have influence d the results of the ASSP impact evaluation, we incl uded in our regression models an indicator that controls for exposure to both modes of World Bank support. Of the 62 health zones in non- ASSP areas surveyed for the endline, 9 received cash only and 12 received the full PBF intervention. vi. Qualitative component The qualitative component is focused on aspects of the ASSP theory of change related to a) the delivery and utilization of maternal services , b) the delivery and utilization of child health services, and c) child nutrition. The resear ch used theme -specific conceptual models to examine ASSP -supported strategies in these thematic areas. 43 The three -delay model (Thaddeous & Maine, 1994) is applied to the examination of facility- based services (maternal health care, treatment and preventi on of child illness). The three -delay model identifies the following elements identified as key determinants of health service utilization: Decisions whether to seek health care and the type of services to seek (influenced by socio - economic, cultural factors) Accessibility of services (financial and physical accessibility) Quality of care (adequate and appropriate treatment and preventive care, interpersonal communications with the health provider) The UNICEF conceptual framework designed to assess determinants of child malnutrition was used to analyze child nutrition services (United Nations Children's Fund, 2015). These determinants include: Dietary intake focusing on changes in food consumption related to the ASSP activities Access to fo od, care for women and children, health services Access to resources and control of health care and food intake (human, economic, and organizational resources) Data and Sampling A mix of qualitative research methods was employed, with separate study designs for each sub- component (e.g. maternal health, child health, child nutrition). The research was carried out in the provinces of North Ubangi and Maniema where percentages of women delivering in health facilities vary from 61 percent in North Ubangi to 27 percent in Maniema (Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, 2015). In each province, one high performing health zone (where facility -based deliveries have increased during the ASSP intervention) and one low performing health zone (where facility -based deliveries have plateaued or decreased during the ASSP intervention) were selected. Additionally, interviews with IMA staff, DFID staff, and MOH officials in Kinshasa were conducted. Data collection for all study sub- components was carried out in the same research zones but in different health areas over a two -week period, with the maternal health component carried out in one health area, the child health component in a second health area, and the child nutrition component conducted in a third health area in the same health zone. Data collectors conducted interviews and focus groups with the aid of pre -developed discussion guides; these guides were pre -tested in Kinshasa prior to data collection. Efforts were made to identify differences between ASSP project approaches and actual implementation and why these discrepancies occurred. A description of the study design and target population for each sub- component is as follows: Maternal health The sampling framework included women who either delivered in a health area facility or at home within the last six months. In -depth interviews were carried out to examine a range of topics including knowledge of antenatal and facility -based care, househol d decision -making regarding utilization of facility -based maternity care, the number and timing of ANC visits and why these visits were made, barriers to accessing antennal and delivery care , perceptions of quality of care in the health facilities , 44 and the cost of maternity care and how costs were covered. In addition, in- depth interviews were conducted with facility -based service providers including the Infirmier Titulaire de l'Aire de Sant\u00e9 (IT) and midwife and relais communautaires (RECOs) to assess ASSP project activities such as e quipment and supplies received , training, w orkload, salary support or other forms of motivation , referral systems during complicated deliveries and s upervision of health workers. In- depth interviews were administered with membe rs of the CODESA to evaluate training they have received, changes in their role in overseeing health activities, and perceptions of the ASSP approach. Key informant interviews were conducted to assess program implementation since the inception of the project, perceptions of ongoing activities, opinions related to barriers to achieving outcome indicators, and recommendations for future activities. Key informants included representatives of the MOH at the MCZ, provincial, and national levels, implementing partners collaborating on activities, and IMA representatives. Women who have delivered in the area health facility or at home in the past six months were interviewed to assess barriers and motivations to delivering in a health center or at home. The sampling framework in each of four health zones included 2- 3 women who delivered in a health area facility within the last six months and 2- 3 women who delivered at the household level in the last six months to understand factors affecting decision making regarding place of delivery. All respondents were permanent residents of the health area. Women who had delivered in the health facilities were purposively selected from facility records. Women who delivered in households were identified through records ma intained by the RECOs. In-depth interviews were conducted with facility -based service providers involved in maternal health care including the IT and a midwife or nurse and 1- 2 randomly- selected RECOs in each of the four health zones to assess ASSP project activities. In addition, one CODESA member was interviewed. Key informants were selected purposively based on their expertise in maternal healt h and involvement in the ASSP project activities. Respondents included representatives of the MOH at the BCZ (1- 2 in each of the four health zones), provincial (1 in each of the two provinces), and national level (1), implementing partners collaborating on activities (1 -2 in each province), and IMA representatives (1- 2). Child health services In-depth interviews were carried out with facility -based service providers (the IT and other nurses working in the facilities) offering services for children under five years of age and RECO to assess a range of activities designed to strengthen the provis ion of curative and preventive care implemented at the facility and community level according to the ASSP project design. Discussion topics included training and perceptions of training conducted; supplies, equipment and medication received during the cour se of the project; salaries or other factors motivating health workers to provide services; and obstacles to the provision of preventive and curative care. Once again, CODESA members were questioned about any training they have received, changes in their r ole, and perceptions of the ASSP approach. 45 Focus group discussions were conducted with two groups of caregivers (mothers and grandmothers) of children under five years of age in each health zone. Each group was carried out in a different village either near to or far from the health center. Topics examined included decision making to seek health care, barriers to care -seeking (e.g. cost, distance, perceptions of services, etc.), descriptions of the health facilities, quality of care related to waiting t ime to receive care, communication with health providers, supplies/medications available, and cleanliness, cost, and satisfaction with the care. Health providers offering preventative care and treatment to children under five years of age working in the health area center were purposively selected for the in -depth interviews. Respondents included the IT and possibly one other nurse, depending on the health center. We will interview 1- 2 randomly- selected RECOs in each of the four health zones to assess ASS P project activities, as well as one CODESA member. In each health zone, one village closest to the health center and one village farthest away from the health center were identified as sites for focus group discussions with child caregivers including mo thers and grandmothers. Each group was comprised of 6- 12 participants. Caregivers must have had a child under five years of age living in their household and be a permanent resident of the health area. Caregivers were purposively selected by the RECOs work ing in their village; experienced caregivers who are willing to share their opinions and experiences related to child health and care -seeking in a group setting were recruited. 13 Child nutrition In the same health zone, RECOs assisted with the sel ection of children between 12- 60 months of age identified as malnourished within the last six months whose mothers were invited to enroll in project activities and who at the time of the interview either a) maintain a garden; or b) do not maintain a garden (either never started or quit). In- depth interviews were administered to mothers who maintain a garden to assess when they started gardening, why they decided to have a garden, the time they spend gardening, training, tools, and seeds received as part of the project, vegetables/crops produced in the garden, family members involved and their time commitment, utilization of garden produce, particularly related to feeding the young child, decision making regarding what to do with the food produced, perceived benefits to the malnourished child, and overall perceptions of the gardening approach. Mothers of malnourished children who chose not to maintain a garden were asked about whether they ever tried to maintain a garden, the duration of gardening activities a nd foods produced, and decisions related to whether or not to garden. In addition, mothers who do and do not garden were asked about the frequency of household visits carried out by the RECOs and what they entail. An additional set of questions related to health facility visits were also posed, including the frequency of visits to health facilities, services provided (e.g. weighing, education sessions or counseling, distribution of supplies such 13 Due to budgetary and time constraints, interviews were not conducted with key informants representing the MOH, implementing partners, or IMA for this component of the study. 46 as plumpy nut) and perceptions of the services provided. Infor mation on perceptions of changes in the child's condition, perceptions of the nutrition approach, and understandings of malnutrition and appropriate feeding for the malnourished child were also collected. In addition, in- depth interviews were administer ed to facility -based service providers and RECOs who have participated in training related to the child nutrition project. Topics explored included their role in the project, the training received and the perceived quality of the training, equipment or supplies they have received in order to carry out their work, views on participation of the beneficiaries, supervision of the health workers, monitoring and evaluation of the child nutrition activities, challenges they face in carrying out the nutrition activ ities, and their perceptions of the approach. We also conducted key informant interviews with implementing partners working in the province, MOH staff at the provincial and zonal level, and IMA representatives to understand perceptions of program activit ies related to planned and actual implementation, challenges faced, and recommendations for improvement of the ASSP project activities. A MOH staff at the national level will be interviewed to assess the government perspective of child nutrition programs, including the ASSP approach, and visions for the future. In the same health zone , children between 12 -60 months of age identified as malnourished within the last six months whose mothers were invited to enroll in the nutrition project activities were purposively selected. Malnourished children were identified through lists maintained by the health workers in the health facilities. Subsequently, the RECOs advised as to which mothers a) maintain a garden; or b) do not maintain a garden (either never start ed or quit) at the time of the study. Two to three mothers who have a garden and 2- 3 mothers who do not have a garden were approached for interviews in each of the health zones studied. Facility -based service providers who have been trained on the child nutrition activities for interviews were purposively selected. One or two RECOs who have received training on the nutrition project activities were randomly selected for in -depth interviews. Purposive sampling was used to identify implementing partners working in each province (1- 2), BCZ staff at the zonal level (1 -2), and IMA representatives (1 -2) overseeing the child nutrition activities, and a MOH staff member in each province and in the country capital who was primarily working on child nutrition pro grams. Table 2.4 presents the sample sizes for each topic. Table 2.4. Targets for key informant and in- depth interviews and group discussions by research theme and respondent type.

Initial data collection involved key informant interviews at the provincial and zonal level. Interviews were carried out in respondent's offices or in another location where privacy could be maintained. During initial key informant interviews, guides were used. As the study progressed, subsequent questioning of the key informants focused on clarif ication and interpretation of information gathered through the other data collection methods. An iterative process involving the review of completed interviews and additional questioning continued until data saturation is reached. Research assistants were each assigned a theme (e.g. maternal health, child health, or child nutrition) on which to focus during data collection, with one research assistant primarily responsible for carrying out the required in- depth interviews and focus group discussions for each study theme. In- depth interviews with health providers were carried out in the health area facility, while interviews with mothers will be conducted in their homes. Data collectors followed a semi -structured guide. Group discus sions were comprised of 6 -12 child caregivers and held in a space where relative privacy can be maintained, such as a school or church. Discussions were led by a moderator who guided the questioning; a second research assistant recorded notes to facilitate data transcription. A guide based on the research objectives and primary themes and preliminary study results procured through the other data collection methods w ere used. Data analysis Data from focus groups and key informant and in- depth interviews wa s recorded, transcribed, and translated. For each sub -study, data transcripts of the key informant, in- depth interviews and focus group discussions generated were reviewed and a coding system was developed. Coding categories were derived from the initial r esearch themes and questions, as well as from key concepts that emerged during data collection. Content analysis was used to identify trends of concepts in and across individual codes. The combination of data, environmental and methodological triangulation allows for the analysis of data across different research methods (e.g. key informant and in- depth interviews) and sites and across and between respondents. Ethics and the protection of human subjects Equity in selection All potential respondent meeting selection criteria were invited to participate in the evaluation , irrespective of health status or other characteristics . No sub- population was deliberately included or excluded from the study. Risk mitigation and reporting 49 Physical risks to the household participants/respondents associated with a finger stick from blood drop collection were not considered more than minimal . Blood was collected using standard hygienic practices (e.g., one needle per child, disinfecting finger using alcoh ol swabs, etc.) and materials were disposed of according to national guidelines. The risk to data collectors of needle sticks involving HIV positive individuals and the risks of transmission were minimized as the study will use trained health personnel. Results from the anemia testing and malaria RDTs were available immediately. Anyone testing positive for malaria or found with hemoglobin levels of less than 7g/dl were given written results and referred to the nearest health facility where treatment will be provided based on national guidelines. Anyone with severe malaria was referred to the closest hospital. The risk of breach of confidentiality or privacy during the data collection or storage process; processes to mitigate these risks are detailed below . Household interviews were conducted in the respondent's home. Data collectors verified that no males were present before asking sensitive questions in the women's module. Focus groups were held in a semi -private location without non-participants present. Data was kept in data collectors' possession during fieldwork. Electronic data was transmitted to a secure server. Only key personnel and data managers had access to collected data. The use of unique identifiers ensure d that no data were linked to individ uals. Informed consent The study team obtained verbal informed consent from each survey respondent and provided a local investigator's contact informatio n. Respondents did not receive remuneration for their participation and there was no cost to participate . Language While the DRC's official language is French, the four national languages, Kikongo, Swahili, Tshiluba , and Lingala, are the languages predominating spoken in different regions of the country. For the propose of this study, all survey instruments , discussion guides, and consent transcripts were professionally translated from English to French and reviewed by the Tulane ORIE Research Director based in Kinshasa, as well as the KSPH researchers. The household, woman's and community leader's surveys and accompanying consent transcripts were then translated from French into Swahili, Tshiluba , and Lingala by local translation teams consisting of professional multi -lingual translators whose first language was the local language of interest. Selected questions were back -translated, and the local language translations were reviewed for accuracy. Household members and community leaders will be given the choice of language for the interview. Health facility and health worker surveys, the CDR and the BCZ surveys were administered in French. All data collectors were fluent in French as well as the dominant local language spoken in the area to which they are assigned. Data collector training and supervision 50 All data collectors underwent extensive training on interview techniques, privacy, confidentiality , and the consent procedure. Health personnel were trained on the collection of biological samples. Trainings utilized standard materials developed by USAID's MEASURE/DHS Project, which carried out nationally representative household surveys in DR-Congo in 2007 and 2013. Stakeholder involvement and investigator independence Tulane consulted with DFID and IMA in the development of research questions and the scope of the evaluation; however, the researchers remain independent in decisions pertaining to research procedures. The methods used, strategies and activities assessed, data collection sites visited, subjects interviewed, types of data collected, and results and analysis reported are at the sole discre tion of Tulane. KSPH was contracted to plan and carry out quantitative data collection. A team of independent medical anthropologists was retained to design and conduct the qualitative component of the endline. Tulane consulted with faculty members at KSPH and other Congolese experts in the interpretation of results. Structure of the report The first two chapters of this report describe the background and methods of the impact evaluation. Following these, the General Characteristics chapter summarizes descriptive statistics from the baseline and endline surveys. The results chapters that follow summarize the quantitative and, when available, the qualitative findings related to the impact of the ASSP project on specific topical areas. Each results chapter summarizes ASSP's approach in that area, summarizes the findings from the analyses, and concludes with a discussion explaining the findings in context and offering recommendations for future health programming in the DRC. The results chapters are designed to stand alone so tha t readers with interest in a specific topic area are not required to read the full report. Figures are integrated into the body of the chapter, while tables are annexed at the end of each chapter due to the large quantities of tables. The report concludes with a discussion chapter that synthesizes the findings from each of the topic areas. 51 References OECD Development Assistance Committee. (1991).

Health facility characteristics Characteristics of the health facilities surveyed at baseline and endline are summarized in Table 3.6. At both baseline and endline , there were significant differences in whether there was a health worker present at all times for emergencies. In both waves, ASSP facilities were more likely to have a health worker on duty at all times. Table 3. 6.

Health zone central office (BCZ) characteristics Among the BCZs serving the villages selected for the household survey 15 were randomly selected for the BCZ module. Twelve were in ASSP areas and 13 were in non- ASSP areas. The survey covered topics including basic infrastructure, partici pation in training, health information systems, supervision, user fee guidelines. ASSP -supported facilities were asked about ASSP support and participation in ASSP initiatives. Table 3.15 shows the level of basic infrastructure of each BCZ. ASSP areas wer e significantly less likely to have cell phone reception and more likely to have internet access in the office.

The survey assessed whether BCZs had guidelines for user fees, both generally and for indigent patients, and if so where the guidelines originated (Table 3.19). All ASSP -supported BCZs reported having user fee guidelines in place, the majority of which were established by the DPS. Interestingly, none of the guidelines in the non- ASSP areas came from the Provincial Health Division ( DPS).

Overview of the ASSP approach Accordi ng to the government's official approach, maternal health consists of four components : the prenatal consultation, childbirth assistance, the postnatal consultation, and community- based activities that include home visits. The prenatal consultation consists of four visits, the initial consultation - where pregnancy is confirmed - and consultations 2, 3, and 4. All four prenatal consultations are used to detect signs or symptoms of malaria or other health conditions , identify chronic ill nesses, detect pregnancy complications, estimate the delivery date or the gestational age, and determine whether the evolution of the pregnancy is normal and the fetus is growing and moving properly. The fourth prenatal consultation additionally serves to identify multiple pregnancies , detect complications , evaluate the pelvis, determine whether a vaginal delivery is likely to take place , encourage women to develop a birth plan with skilled birth attendants, and schedule a possible additional visit in case the delivery does not take place within 10 days of the anticipated date. D elivery assistance includes provision of quality care for the pregnant wom an during labor and childbirth, as well as for the new mother and newborn during the immediate post partum period. The goal is to provide delivery and postnatal care that best ensures a favorable outcome for the mother and newborn, thereby contributing to reduced maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality . The goal of the community -based interventions is to promote the participation of individuals, families, and communities in best practices related to prenatal care, childbirth and neonatal care. In order to carry out prenatal consultations , childbirth assistance, and postnatal consultation s, at least two mid wives at the A1 or A2 level are necessary, or, failing that, two nurses at least at the A2 level . Qualified health workers should be trained in Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth (IMPAC) and Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Ill ness (IMAI), including Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL), Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (EmONC) and Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT). The Access to Primary Health Care (ASSP) maternal health approach included elements related to prenatal consultation, assisted childbirth, and postnatal consultation, as well as community services involving home visits , health education, a breastfeeding support group, and trainings. T o support improved access to and utilization of health care services, ASSP program interventions sought to address gaps in drug suppl ies, management capacity, and health worker motivation w hile also tackling physical, cultural and geographical barriers to obtaining maternal health care . Other activities such as data monitoring and evaluation, supportive supervision, behaviour change communication (BCC) involving awareness -raising campaigns a nd home visits, and reductions in fees for maternal health services were established to increase utilization . From the outset, and in keeping with the goals of the National Health Development Program (PNDS), construction activities were launched to rehabi litate and equip health facilities in ASSP -assisted health zones . During this initial period , health facility equipment was procured, which included supplies aimed to ensure that maternities were better equipped. Specifically, ASSP renovated and constructe d maternities, and provided equipment, medication, and training for health providers to improve the readiness of at least five health facilities per zone to deliver the Ministry of Health (MOH) paquet compl\u00e9mentaires d'activit\u00e9s (package of complementary a ctivities) including basic emergency obstetric and newborn care (B -EmONC) and comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (C -EmONC). 81 Solar lighting was supposed to be installed in the delivery rooms of all maternities (for night -time labor and deliveries), and operating rooms in hospitals were improved and equipped for emergency deliveries. Large referral hospitals received anaesthesia machines and held trainings for staff in the use of new equipment. Ultrasound equipment was distributed to more than 65 health facilities, a nd training of at least three staff in each ASSP- assisted hospital - typically the hospital director (a physician) or the chief of staff (also a physician), the head nurse and the maternity ward nurse - was provided on the use of obstetric ultrasound for monitoring pregnant women and their unborn babies . The project also provided refresher courses for healthcare workers on safe deliveries and revised the user fee schedule to make services more affordable. Following focus group discussions in Nord Ubangi conducted by Pathfinder in collaboration with IMA World Health , which revealed the cultural importance of being well dressed when leaving the maternity center, a six -month pilot distribution of birth delivery kits was launc hed to encourage increased utilization of maternity services. The birth delivery kits included soap, towels, a scalpel, wire cord, and compresses . Hats, baby clothes, and a blanket were included for the baby and, for the mother, a pagne (i.e. a two -by-six-yard cut of patterned cotton fabric) was added to approximately half of the kits to assess whether they provided an additional incentive to women to come to the health facility for assisted deliveries. To further address cultural barriers, the ASSP program trained community leaders and community relays t o sensitize the population about the benefits of deliveries assisted by skilled birth attendants. The project also continued working with health workers and community health volunteers (RECOs) to improve com munication strategies, launching a major radio campaign with Development Media International to promote improved care -seeking behaviors. To support improvements in the quality of reproductive health and neonatal care, trainings for health providers and supervisors were conducted with a focus on EmONC, including assisted births and the use of the World Health Organization (WHO) partograph tool. A facility assessment of the provision of C - EmONC in ASSP -assisted health zones was conducted and followed by a tr aining program, which was implemented in collaboration with the National Reproductive Health Program (PNSR) and clinical experts from the University Clinics of Kinshasa and Congolese Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Refresher trainings for provi ders were held, in addition to the distribution of additional supplies and equipment, to cover gaps and improve provision and quality of EmONC in the targeted referral facilities. A seminar on BCC was also held to support the reinforcement of information, education, communication (IEC)/BCC activities to promote reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health in the ASSP -supported health zones. Finally, collaboration with different donor representatives - including, the Global Fund and the President's Mala ria Initiative (PMI) - was established to improve logistics for the distribution of malaria commodities, to prevent stockouts despite supply chain delays and, generally , to support the ASSP drug supply. In addition to routine distribution of insecticide -treated nets (ITNs) in PMI -supported health zones, IMA World Health, in partnership with the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Against Malaria Foundatio n (AMF) , launched a mass distribution campaign for long- lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) using a hang- up strategy. This \"hang- up\" initiative , which aimed to ensure that LLINs were properly used , was complemented by post -distribution check -ups (PDCU) to as sess bed net 82 distribution, utilization and condition. Check -ups were supposed to be performed every 6 months after the mass distribution campaign. BCC interventions were initiated during check -up visits to improve household awareness about the importance o f using mosquito nets, proper use of mosquito nets, and maintenance principles for preserving functional nets in the home. Notably, throughout years 1 through 4 of the ASSP project, program support for malaria interventions targeted 19 health zones (8 in M aniema, 1 in Kasai Central and 10 in Kasai). As noted previously, Kasai and Kasai Central were excluded from all analyses due to civil unrest which precluded endline data collection. Summary of ASSP activities prior to the baseline survey According to ASS P's quarterly reports, t he project extended assistance to an additional 36 health zones , 11 of which were in North -Ubangi, Equator provinces. The majority of these new ASSP -assisted health zones had received limited or no assistance over the last decades, which inevitably resulted in lower performance compared to health zones supported by the preceding Access to Health Care (AHC) project . Notably, the 20 HZs which we re assisted by the prior AHC project maintained acceptable performance for both preventive and curative activities, including delivery in the presence of a skilled attendant, pregnant women's receipt of two doses of intermittent presumptive treatment for m alaria (IPTp), pregnant women's receipt of at least three doses of iron folate, and provision of Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) in assisted health facilities, including general referral hospitals. Figure 4.1 below depicts quarterly progress on births atte nded by skilled health personnel . The chart (taken from April - June 2014 quarterly report ) depicts results by quarter, up until the baseline survey in Quarter 1 Year 2. Figure 4.1.

The ASSP program also supported routine distribution of LLINs to pregnant women during ANC consultations. However , due to overlapping geographical targeting with the Global Fund and PMI , ASSP reduced its malaria programming to Maniema (8 HZs). By the end of Year 1 - following a decision by provincial authorities in Maniema to cease bed net distribution in Q3 while a mass distribution was expected to be implemented - monitoring data suggested that the ASSP program met 57 percent of target, resulting in coverage of 17 percent of the total targeted population at risk. Figure 4. 2 below depicts quarterly progress on routine distribution of bed nets to pregnant women and children less than 1 year of age.

Quarterly progress on distribution of bed nets to pregnant women and children under -1. Data on ANC consultations are all reported through the National Health Information System (SNIS ) and later keyed into the District Health Information System (Software) (DHIS 2). While all data are now extracted from the DHIS2, IPs would previously c ollect data from local EPI antennas with a parallel data collection system (before the DHIS2 was fully functional in all ASSP -assisted health zones) and report these to IMA when confronted with low reporting rate s and /or completeness. ANC tracking tools include an ANC card or form which is kept at the health facility, an ANC appointment card kept by the woman, and an ANC register kept at the facility. In addition, there is an ANC reporting form used to forward health facility ANC data to the h ealth zone central office where it is 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000 35,000 40,000 45,000NetsBednets Routinely Distributed to Pregnant Women and Children Under -One 84 ii. Quantitative findings Maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum pe riod. This chapter presents findings on several service coverage indicators including antenatal care (ANC), facility deliver ies and postpartum care. The use of ITNs by pregnant women and data on women's perceptions of the quality of care during delivery ar e also presented. ASSP modules collected information on all live births that occurred in the five years prior to the module . In an effort to minimize recall bias, however, information on ANC as well as the amount of money spent on delivery was only collected for the most recent live birth. While some indicators (e.g. mean expenditure on ANC during pregnancy for the most recent birth) were calculated using data on the most recent live birth in the five years prior to the su rvey, other indicators (e.g. percentage of women with a live birth in the last two years who reported four or more ANC visits) are limited to live births in the two years preceding the survey. Probit models, using a difference -in-differences (DID) estimat ion strategy, were fit for each maternal health indicator, except those indicators related to out-of-pocket cash expenditures. Specifically, for the out-of-pocket cash expenditure analyses, responses to questions on the total amount spent on ANC (includin g consulting fees, drugs, tests , and transportation) were dichotomously categorized based on whether the woman incurred any expenses. Continuous indicators reflecting the total amount spent per ANC visit (in US dollars) were also created, using exchange ra tes of 900 Congolese Francs per US dollar and 1,400 Congolese Francs per US D ollar for the years 2014 and 2017, respectively. Out -of-pocket expenditures on delivery were similarly treated based on information regarding the total amount spent on the most re cent delivery, including the consulting fee and any expenses for other items such as drugs, tests , and transportation. For these health expenditure analyses, a generalized linear model (GLM) with a log link function was estimated, using the DID estimation strategy. These GLM log- link models account for zero expenditures as well as the skewed distribution of spending. The results of these DID models allowed for assessment of the ASSP project impact on relevant maternal health outcomes, with the DID estimator being represented by a multiplicative interaction term between the time (i.e. survey wave) and group assignment (i.e. ASSP vs. non- ASSP) variables. All DID models controlled for potentially relevant confounding factors, including sampling domain, setting (i.e. peri -urban or rural) and wealth quintile. The World Bank introduced a performance -based financing (PBF) project in some non- ASSP areas with an aim to improve service utilization, quality of care, and health behaviors. Given the potential of t his World Bank program to influence results of the ASSP impact evaluation, all DID models include a categorical indicator to control for the two modes of World Bank support (i.e. cash support only or the full PBF intervention). DID models for sub- groups of the population (based on wealth, and sampling domain) are also presented. While the study was powered to detect overall differences between intervention and control groups however, it was not powered to detect differences according to sub- groups, which ma y have required a larger sample size. Finally, in addition to results from DID models, descriptive tables are also presented for each maternal health indicator, illustrating changes in the relevant outcome, at endline compared to baseline, in both ASSP and non-ASSP areas. 85 Antenatal care Receiving regular and comprehensive care during pregnancy can reduce risks and complications both during delivery and postpartum (World Health Organization, 2007) . The WHO recommends a minimum of four ANC visits for women with an uncomplicated pregnancy, in addition to timing the first visit early so that potential complications can be detected in the early stages of p regnancy. Specifically, the WHO recommends the first visit occur in the first trimester or within the first three m onths of pregnancy (World Health Organization, 2007) . Findings from the fully- adjusted DID models indicated that while the ASSP program had no statistically significant impact on mean expenditure per ANC visit or receipt of the first ANC visit within the first trimester of pregnancy , it decreased the likelihood of a wom an receiving four or more ANC visits (Figure 4.3). Figure 4.3. Direction of impact of ASSP overall and on antenatal care by wealth and domain.

First of all, the fully adjusted DID model indicated that the probability of receiving at least 4 ANC visits declined by 10.8 percentage points in ASSP areas compared to non- ASSP areas (Table 4. 1, p = 0.015). Sub-analyses revealed that the probability of receiving at least 4 ANC visits declined in ASSP areas compared to non -ASSP areas, among those in the top 60 percent wealth quintile (Table 4. 3, marginal effect: -12.1, p=0.025) and those in Maniema/ Tshopo (Table 4. 5, marginal effect: - 12.7, p=0.019). There was no statistically significant program effect on receipt of at least three ANC visits, among women with a birth in the past two years (Table 4. 7). Furthermore, sub- analyses revealed no statistica lly significant differences in receipt of at least three visits by wealth (Tables 4. 8 and 4. 9) or domain (Tables 86 4.10 and 4.11 ). Both models, however (i.e. examining receipt of at least 4 ANC visits vs. receipt of at least 3 ANC visits), indicated that inc reasing wealth and higher levels of education among mothers were significantly associated with receipt of multiple ANC visits (Table 4. 1 and Table 4. 7). With regard to the timing of ANC visit s, the fully- adjusted DID model indicated no significant program effects on receipt of the first ANC visit within the first trimester of pregnancy (Table 4.13). However, a significant inverse association between timing of the first visit and birth order was evident, suggesting that women were less li kely to receive their first ANC visit within the first trimester of pregnancy for their later -born children (Table 4.13, p <0.05). Moreover, sub- analyses indicated that the probability of receiving the first ANC visit within the first trimester of pregnancy declined in ASSP areas compared to non-ASSP areas, among women from Maniema/Tshopo (Table 4.17, marginal effect: - 9.6, p=0.042). There w as no statistically significant program effect on mean cash expenditure per ANC visit (Table 4. 19) and s ub-analyses rev ealed no statistically significant differences in mean expenditure per ANC visit by wealth quintiles (Tables 4.20 and 4.21 ) or domain (Tables 4.22 and 4.23 ). Descriptive data indicated that there w as no statistically significant change in utilization of AN C services in ASSP areas (Figure 4.4 ), although some variation in ANC service use did occur in non- ASSP areas, at endline compared to baseline (Figure 4.5 ). Figure 4.4. Changes in ANC service utilization indicators in ASSP areas, by year . *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels statistically significant at p <0.05 Figure 4.5.

There was no statistically significant difference in the timing of the first ANC visit, at endline compared to baseline, among women in ASSP areas (Table 4.18). In non- ASSP areas, however, a significantly greater proportion of women received their first ANC visit within the first trimester of their pregnancy (Table 4 .18, 2014: 9.9 percent vs. 2017: 16.8 percent ; p = 0.013). There was no change in mean expenditure per ANC visit at endline compared to baseline, in ei ther ASSP or non -ASSP areas ( Figure 4.6 and Table 4.25) . Figure 4. 6. Changes in mean expenditure per ANC visit in ASSP and non-ASSP areas, by year . A registration fee was required for ANC consultations, although this fee was minimal and reported to be set at around 500 Congolese francs. Further, t he absolute changes in ASSP and non- ASSP areas, from 2014 to 2017, suggest that a significantly greater proportion of women incurred ANC expenses (i.e. did not receive services free of charge or make an in -kind payment) (Table 4 .24). Robustness checks As a robustness check, the DID models for all ANC indicators were estimated with the inclusion of a variabl e indicating the straight -line distance between the woman 's household and the nearest governmental health facility. While the distance variable was a significant predictor in some of the models (i.e. increasing distance was inversely associated with receip t of at least 4 ANC visits and receipt of at least 3 ANC visits), neither the significance nor direction of the DID estimate was affected by inclusion of this variable.

There was n o statistically significant program impact on receipt of the first ANC visit within the first trimester of pregnancy or on mean expenditure per ANC visit. 88 significant differences in distance to the hea lth facility , between baseline and endline, i n either ASSP or non-ASSP areas (results not shown). Use of ITNs The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is one of the largest malaria -endemic countries in sub- Saharan Africa, with pregnant women, children under five years of age , and marginalized or mobile/migrant populations among the high- risk populations susceptible to morbidity from the disease (United States Agency for International Development (USAID), 2015) . Notably, s leeping under ITNs has proven to be one of the most effective and cost-effective ways of reducing malaria incidence in sub- Saharan Africa (Lengeler, 2004; White, Conteh, Cibulskis, & Ghani, 2011; Yuk ich et al., 2008) . Respondents were asked whether t hey possessed a bed net and, among those who owned at least one bed net, information on the number and type of bed net was obtained. Interviewers asked to see each net to confirm ownership and respondents were also asked to list everyone who slept under ea ch bed net the night before they were questioned . Findings from the fully- adjusted DID models indicated that the ASSP program had no impact on pregnant women's use of an ITN the previous night or household ownership of at l east one ITN (Figure 4.7). Figure 4.7. Direction of impact of ASSP overall and use of ITNs by wealth, and domain.

Similarly, the fully adjusted D ID model indicated that there was no statistically significant program effect on household ownership of at least one ITN (Table 4. 32). Notably, however, the DID model indicate d that household ownership of at least one ITN was significantly associated with increasing wealth ( p <0.001), increasing education ( p <0.001) , and increasing size of the household ( p<0.05). Furthermore, sub-analyses indicated that the probability of household ownership of at least one ITN declined in ASSP areas compared to non -ASSP areas, among those living Nord/Sud Ubangi (Table 4.35 , marginal effect: -16.3, p<0.001). Descriptive data indicated that use of ITNs by pregnant women did not change in eithe r ASSP areas or non -ASSP areas (Figure 4.8). On the other hand, absolute changes in household ownership of at least one ITN suggested improvements from 2014 to 2017, in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas, although the difference was only statistically significan t in non- ASSP areas (Table 4.37, 2014: 73.5 percent vs. 2017: 88.5 percent ; p=0.001). Figure 4.8. Changes in use of ITNs in ASSP and non- ASSP areas, by year . *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels statistically significant at p <0.05 Delivery Location and assistance in delivery care are very important factors for improving maternal and child health outcomes. Delivering in a health facility and having a birth assisted by a skilled birth attendant can reduce the risk of death during delivery and better manage complications that may arise (Gabrysch 54.2 60.8 54.767.2 050100 Pregnant women who used an ITN last nightHouseholds with at least one ITNpercentageASSP areas 2014 201774.0 73.566.188.5 050100 Pregnant women who used an ITN last night*Households with at least one ITNpercentageNon- ASSP areas 2014 2017Key Points There were no statistically significant program effects on the use of ITNs among pregnant women or household ownership of at least one ITN. 90 & Campbell, 2009; Ronsmans, Graham, & Lancet Maternal Survival Series ste ering group, 2006) . Following revision by the WHO, and endorsement by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Bank, the term skilled birth attendant has been noted to refer only to \"an accredited health professional \u2014 such as a midwife, doctor or nurse \u2014 who has been educated and trained to proficiency in the skills needed to manage normal (uncomplicated) pregnancies, childbirth and the immediate postnatal period, and in the i dentification, management and referral of complications in wom en and newborns\" (Adegoke & van den Broek, 2009; World Health Organization, 2004) . The definition does not include trained birth attendants. The woman's questionnaire allowed a mother to report all persons present at delivery, with options including a (1) docto r, (2) nurse, and/or (3) trained birthing attendant/midwife. The woman's questionnaire thus did not allow for distinctions to be made between trained birth attendants and midwives. Further, the literature notes that trained birth attendants often have mini mal schooling and receive limited training (Garces et al., 2012; ten Hoope -Bender, Liljestrand, & MacDonagh, 2006) . Accordingly, given WHO criteria, in addition to the fact that identification of the type of attendant at delivery was based only on the m other's subjective report and not on any objective records of the attendant's training and proficiency level, only doctors and nurses were included in the definition of skilled birth attendant. In keeping with ASSP's goal to increase the number of deliveri es occurring within a health facility, however, we also examined changes in the number of facility deliveries as an additional outcome. Notably , although the period soon after childbirth poses substantial health risks for both mother and newborn infant, po stpartum and postnatal care often receive less attention than pregnancy and childbirth (World Health Organization, 2010) . As a critical yet often neglected phase in the lives of moth ers and newborn babies, postpartum and postnatal care delivered by skilled providers is especially important to ensur e improved maternal and newborn health outcomes (World Health Organization, 2010, 2014) . For the follow ing analyses, a postpartum care visit was defined as an examination of the mother 's health by a doctor or nurse, in the two da ys following childbirth, while a postnatal care visit was defined as a health examination of the baby, by a doctor or nurse, in th e two days following delivery. Findings from the fully- adjusted DID models indicated varying impact s of the ASSP program on delivery care (Figure 4. 9). 91 Figure 4.9. Direction of impact of ASSP overall and on delivery care by wealth, and domain.

The fully adjusted DID model indicated that the ASSP program had a statistically significant and positive impact, increasing the likelihood of a facility delivery by 14.1 percentage points in ASSP areas compared to non -ASSP areas (Table 4.38, p <0.001). Fur thermore, the model suggested that facility deliver ies were significantly and positively associated with increasing wealth ( p<0.001) and higher education levels of mothers ( p<0.01). The DID model further suggested that the World Bank PBF initiative, which was being implemented in non- ASSP areas, was associated with an increased likelihood of facility delivery ( p<0.01). Notably, sub- analyses indicated that the probability of a facility delivery increased in ASSP areas compared to non -ASSP areas, among those in the bottom 40 percent wealth quintile (Table 4.39, marginal effect: 32.6, p <0.001). With regard to delivery assistance, however, the fully adjusted DID model indicated no statistically significant program impact on the presence of a skilled attendant at delivery (Table 4.44) and sub- analyses revealed no statistically significant differenc es according to wealth (Tables 4.45 and 4.46) or domain (Tables 4.47 and 4.48). 92 Regarding the period soon after childbirth, the fully adjusted D ID model revealed that the ASSP program had no statistically significant effects on receipt of post -partum care (Table 4.50). S ub-analyses also revealed no statistically significant differences in receipt of at least one post -partum care visit, according to wealth (Tables 4.51 and 4.52) or domain (Tables 4.53 and 4.54). However, the fully adjusted DID model indicate d that the probability of the baby receiving a post -natal care visit within two days of delivery declined by 4.6 percentage points in ASSP areas compared to non- ASSP areas (Table 4.5 6; p<0.01). Here, sub- analyses revealed that the probability of the baby r eceiving a post -natal care visit within two days of delivery declined in ASSP areas compared to non -ASSP areas, among those in the top 60 percent wealth quintile (Table 4.58 , marginal effect: - 4.9, p=0.016). There was no statistically significant program effect on mean cash expenditure for delivery (Table 4.62 ) and sub- analyses revealed no statistically significant differences according to wealth (Tables 4.63 and 4.64 ) or domain (Tables 4.65 and 4.66 ). Changes in delivery care indicators at baseline and endline, are illustrated in Figure 4.10 and Figure 4.1 1, for ASSP and non- ASSP areas, respectively. Figure 4.10.

Changes in delivery care indicators in non- ASSP areas, by year . *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels statistically significant at p <0.05 In both ASSP and non- ASSP areas, the proportion of live births delivered within the past two years in a health facility increased at endline compared to baseline. Although the magnitude of this change was larger in ASSP areas, it was only statistically sig nificant in non- ASSP areas (Table 4. 43). Among these facility deliveries, the proportion of women reporting the presence of a skilled birth attendant increased significantly at endline, compared to baseline, in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas (Table 4.49). Trends also suggested an increase in receipt of postpartum care (Table 4 .55) and post -natal care (Table 4.61), in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas, from 2014 to 2017. However, these differences were not statistically significant except in non- ASSP areas with r egard to receipt of at least one post -natal care visit for the baby. Specifically, in non- ASSP areas, a significantly greater proportion of babies received a health examination from a doctor or nurse within two days of delivery ; notably, these differences were based on relatively few observations (Table 4 .61, 2014: 0.6 percent vs. 2017: 2.9 percent ; p = 0.004). There was no change in mean cash expenditure on delivery , at endline compared to baseline, in either ASSP or non-ASSP areas ( Figure 4.12 and Table 4.67). 74.665.8 16.8 0.681.7 79.9 22.8 2.9 020406080100 *Delivery within a health facility*Delivery within a health facility by a skilled birth attendantAt least 1 postpartum care visit for mother*At least 1 postnatal care visit for babypercentageNon- ASSP areas 2014 2017 94 Figure 4. 12. Changes in mean expenditure on delivery in ASSP and non-ASSP areas, by year . Robustness checks As a robustness check, the DID models for all delivery indicators were estimated with the inclusion of a variable indicating the straight -line distance between the woman's household and the nearest governmental health facility. While the distance variable was a significant predictor in some of the models (i.e. increasing distance was inversely associated with facility deliveries), neither the significance nor direction of the DID estimate was affected by inclusion of this variabl e. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in distance to the health facility , between baseline and endline, i n either ASSP or non -ASSP areas (results not shown). Perceptions of quality during delivery Quality of care, defined by the Institute of Medicine as \"the degree to which health services for individuals and population increases the likelihood of desired health outcomes\" , is most commonly evaluated using the triad of structure, process, and outcome, originally proposed by Donabedian (Ayanian & Markel, 2016) . This Donabedian model posits that the attr ibutes of the setting in which care is delivered (i.e. the structure) affect the care deliver ed and adherence to good medical practices (i.e. processes) which in turn affects the health status (i.e. outcome s) that reflect improv ed quality of care (Donabedian, 1966) . Structural and process - level elements of quality care are often readily assessed using either objective measures of quality or patients' perceptions of quality. When the latter approach is used, research cautions 11.5 8.2 020406080100 Mean expenditure on delivery (USD)mean (USD)ASSP areas 2014 20177.5 6.9 020406080100 Mean expenditure on delivery (USD)mean (USD)Non- ASSP areas 2014 2017 Key Points The ASSP program had a significant and positive effect on the probability of facility deliveries in ASSP areas compared to non - ASSP areas (marginal effect: 14.128; p <0.001). The ASSP program had a significant, negative impact on the probability of receipt of at least one post -natal care visit for the baby (marginal effect: - 4.471 ; p =0.00 8). There was no statistically significant program effect on receipt of at least one post -partum care visit for the mother or mean expenditure on delivery. 95 that patient expectations of health services, including personal and environmental -level factors , also be considered as important drivers of patients' perceptions of qua lity (Wisni ewski, Diana, Yeager, & Hotchkiss, 2018) . Given ASSP program investments in health worker trainings , facility infrastructure and provision of commodities, analyses sought to assess the project impact on women's perceptions of structural and process -level elements of quality, including equipment availability, adequacy of drug supplies, nature of the healthcare interaction, and overall facility cleanliness. The DID models for indicators regarding patient perceptions of quality al l controlled for personal (e.g. needs of the patient, individual characteristics, knowledge of what to expect) and environmental -level factors (e.g. reputation of provider, social/cultural norms) known to affect patient's expectations of the healthcare exp erience and potentially influence their perceptions of quality (Wisniewski et al., 2018) . Findings from the fully- adjusted DID models indicated varying impacts of the ASSP program on perception of quality during delivery (Figure 4. 13). Figure 4.13.

The ASSP project had no statistically significant impact on the perceived competence of persons assisting with delivery (Ta ble 4.68) and sub- analyses revealed no statistically significant differences accord ing to wealth (Tables 4.69 and 4.7) or domain (Tables 4.71 and 4.72). 96 Notably, however, the DID model indicated that the ASSP program had a significant and positive impact, increasing the probability of perceived adequa cy in availability of equipment by 8.6 percentage points in ASSP areas, compared to non -ASSP areas (Table 4.7 4; p<0.01). Sub- analyses revealed that the probability of perceived adequacy in availability of equipment increased in ASSP areas compared to non-ASSP areas, among those in the top 60 percent wealth quintile (Table 4.76 , marginal effect: 10.4, p=0.002) (Table 4.78 , marginal effect: 16.8, p <0.001). With regard to perceived adequacy in the availability of drugs, the fully adjusted DID model indicated no statistically significant project impact (Table 4.8) and sub- analyses similarly revealed no statistically significant differences according to wealth (Tables 4.8 1 and 4.82 ) or domain (Tables 4.83 and 4.84 ). With regard to whether the health provider explained the health situation adequately, however, while the fully adjusted DID model indicated no statistically significant project impact (Table 4.86) , sub- analyses revealed that the probability of perceived adequacy of the health care interaction increased in ASSP areas compared to non -ASSP areas, among those in Maniema/Tshopo (Table 4.90 , marginal effect: 4.1, p=0.026). Finally, the fully adjusted DID m odel indicated that the ASSP program had a significant and positive impact, increasing the likelihood of reporting adequate cleanliness of the health facility by 14.3 percentage points (Table 4.92 ; p<0.001). However, s ub-analyses revealed no statistically significant differences according to wealth (Tables 4.93 and 4.94 ) or domain (Tables 4.95 and 4.96 ). Figures 4.14 and Figure 4.15 below illustrate changes in perceptions of quality of care at baseline and endline, for ASSP and non- ASSP areas, respectively. Figure 4.14.

Specifically, p erceptions of ade quate competence of the person assisting delivery were initially high at baseline, in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas, but significantly declined in both areas, by endline (Table 4.73; p<0.00 1). There were no statistically significant differences in perceived availability of equipment (Table 4.79) or perceived availability of drug supplies (Table 4.85), at endline compared to baseline, in either ASSP areas or non -ASSP areas. With regard to percept ions of the health care interaction, initial reports were high, with 96.4 percent and 96 percent of participants in ASSP areas and non- ASSP areas, respectively, reporting at baseline that the health care provider explained the situation in an adequate manner. However, perceptions of adequacy of the health care interaction significantly improved in non- ASSP areas only (Table 4.91). Finally, perceived cleanliness of the health facility significantly improved at endline compared to baseline, in both ASSP and non -ASSP areas (Table 4 .97; p<0.01). Robustness checks As a robustness check, the DID models for all perceptions of quality during delivery indicators were estimated with the inclusion of a variable indicating the straight -line distance between the woman's household and the nearest governmental health facility. While the distance variable was a significant predictor in some of the models (i.e. increasing distance was inversely associated with perceived adequacy of equipment and perceived adequacy of availability of drugs ), neither the significance nor direction of the DID estimate was affected by inclusion of this variable. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in distance to the health facility , between baseline and endline, i n either ASSP or non -ASSP areas (results not shown). Key Points The ASSP program had a positive and significant effect on perceptions of adequate availability of equipment during delivery (marginal effect: 8.580; p<0.01). The ASSP program had a positive and significant effect o n perceptions of adequate cleanliness of the health facility (marginal effect: 14.263; p <0.001). There were no statistically significant program impacts on perceptions of adequate competence of the person assisting delivery, perceptions of adequate availability of drugs, or perceptions of adequacy in which the health care provider explained the situation . 99 iii. Qualitative findings Research methods Fifty respondents participated in the qualitative study. We interviewed sixteen key informants working on maternal health including national and provincial level government health representatives, IMA staff at the national and provincial level, representatives of the IMA implementing partners, and chief medical doctors and nurse supervisors working at the health zone level. Sixteen in- depth interviews were conducted with health workers including four head nurses, three midwives, four members of the Community Health Development Committee (CODESA), and five community health workers. In addition, in-depth interviews were carried out with eighteen mothers who had given birth either in a health facility or at home within six months prior to the interview. Health Workers & Key Informants Implementation Respondents reported that m aternal health activities were launched in 2013 in the four research sites. Of the sixteen interviewed service providers, two head nurses and one midwife had completed training on providing care during uncomplicated births , prenatal consultations , EmONC , the BCC approach, and community support groups ; one midwife ha d completed tra ining on HIV/AIDS , and one community health worker ha d completed training on family planning. The other health worker respondents had arrived in the health areas after the start of ASSP and training on maternal health had been completed, highlighting the high turnover that occurs among health workers. Those respondents who participated in the training noted that t he duration of the ASSP trainin gs ranged from between 5 and 7 days . Common complaints about the training included: (1) supplies (e.g. suctions c ups and resuscitation kits) were promised but never deliver ed; and (2) topics were covered superficia lly, with essential details not provided. In addition, s ome key informants indicated that the training sessions were over ly ambitious for the short time frames allotted, indicating that too much information was provided at once and raising questions about the ability of the trainees to ret ain the information provided. Some participants from North Ubangi reported that training s failed to consider cultural practices and how to deal with them, often making it difficult to successfully implement approaches as recommended during the training sessions. Facility -based respondents indicated that t hey were able to provide prenatal consultations and childbirth assistance for normal deliveries a s recommended according to the official ASSP approach. All health centers included in the study had established a referral system for complicated cases that exceed ed the capabilities of the health center. It was noted that transport for r eferral cases is the responsibility of the pregnant woman and her family and that referrals are typically made to the General Reference Hospital of the health zone in which the health center is located. Respondents noted that the distance to the Reference Hospital is variable, generally ranging from 5 and 50 km , with some indicating that the distance can be greater than 50 km. In one of the health zones studied, one health center was 200 km from the General Refer ence Hospital. 100 In most of the health centers included in the study , Thursdays we re reserved for the first prenatal consultation (i.e. new cases), while prenatal consultations 2, 3, and 4 generally took place on Fridays. Respondents noted that while consul tations were scheduled to start at 6.30 am, women tended to arrive later in the morning, thus forcing consultations to start around 10 am and end between 11 am and noon. All of the health providers included in the study reported to have the basic equipment necessary to carry out prenatal consultations and non-complicated deliveries, although frequent shortages of medicine s and materials were reported . Furthermore, it was observed that centers often did not have comfortable and adequate seating to a ccommodate pregnant women attending prenatal consultation. For example, in one health center located in a low-performing zone, we observed that pregnant women were forced to sit on a wall while waiting to be called for antenatal consultations . During obse rvations, we also noted that the place where ANC was offered was frequently both messy and dirty. Respondents indicated that postnatal consultation s, breastfeeding support groups, and health education sessions often did not take place. In general, respo ndents described shortages of supplies needed for postnatal consultation s such as vitamin A, folic acid, and especially iron , noting that many service providers refuse d to offer this activity because they ha d nothing to give women who might attend. At the time of this study, a respondent based at the central health zone level reveal ed that one zone comprised of seventeen health areas had been out of iron and folic acid for over six months. I n North Ubangi, it was reported that postnatal consultation s were not attended due to a widespread cultural practice called Buakel\u00e9. The practice stipulates that women remain in the household for a year after giving birth, with the mother (and newborn) returning to and living in her parents' house during this period . After completion of the reclusion period , the husband organize s a party to celebrate the lives of his wife and their baby and to welcome the mother and child back into his household. In regard to health education sessions, we were told that sessions are not given at the community level, while health providers only occasionally conduct educational sessions at the time of antenatal consultations. Respondents also clarified health worker roles within the ASSP program. It was noted that t he h ead nurse plans the maternal health activities and schedules , consults patients, assists childbirth, delegates responsibilities to other service providers, and supervises health workers . With assistance from the CODESA president , the head nurse is also responsible for program ming awareness campaigns and household visits . In addition, the head nurse is in charge of writing monitoring report s submitted to the Central Health Zone offices on a monthly basis . Midwi ves consult patients and administer treatment, assist deliveries, lead prenatal and postnatal consultations, and provide family planning. T he CODESA president co-manages the health center with the service providers, verifies the drug requisitions and deliveries, resolves conflicts between health center personnel and the community, assures that pregnant women are accompanied by either a RECO or the CODESA president when transferred to the General Reference Hospital or elsewhere, and assigns communi ty health workers activities and tasks as part of the health center strategy . Respondents noted that t he community health workers are supposed to identify pregnant women in the community, raise awareness with pregnant women about the importance of attending prenatal consultations and delivering in the health center, promote exclusive breastfeeding of babies up to 6 months, and provide information on appropriate care for young babies. Community health workers also try to motivate men to get involved in the c are of their wives and 101 children by encouraging them to follow the evolution of pregnancies of women participating in prenatal consultation s, to attend prenatal consultation sessions, and to take part in meetings convened by the head nurse or the CODESA pre sident . Respondent explained that t here are two types of supervision: (1) those carried out by the Central Health Zone Office s; and (2) those conducted by the Provincial Department of Health and implementing partners. The latter take place once per trimes ter while t he supervisions conducted by the Central Zonal Offices are conducted month ly. Respondents indicated that t he duration of supervisions depend on the purpose, with supervisory visits focusing on a range of issues including an assessment of materials and supplies available in the health centers , the development and implementation of activities, and /or the way in which medicines are prescribed . Monitoring and evaluation of data collected at the community and health center level focuses on a variety of activities related to maternal health such as new ly pregnant women, numbers of women attending prenatal consultations, receipt of vaccinations, facility - or home -based childbirth, and postnatal consultations. Respondents admitted that they fail t o receive information on many women giving birth at home , particularly women who set up temporary camps adjacent to their fields and miss being detected due to the long distance s that community workers must travel to reach them and the fact that only a lim ited number of community health workers are dedicated to maternal health. In order to identify recently pregnant women to participate in prenatal consultation s, local women are asked to report pregnant women, with those women identified advise d to attend the prenatal consultation s. Respondents reported challenges in identifying women early in the pregnancy due to taboos about sharing a new pregnancy with other people, especially men, during the first three months when the pregnancy is still not visible. Further, respondents indicated that newly pregnant women are reluctant to share their condition with m ale community health workers carrying out home visits , making it difficult to locate and motivate women to attend prenatal consultations during the first tr imester . The management teams in the two health zones in North Ubangi reported organiz ing awareness campaigns twice a month, which involved carrying out home visits to share information on appropriate maternal health care . However , no awareness -raising activities were reported by the respondents working in the Maniema health zones. Moreover, while e ach head nurse was supposed to implement a BCC strategy , only one head nurse from North Ubangi ha d developed a formal plan, which involv ed broadcasting information on maternal health by local radio station twice a week and household visits. While household visits were supposed to be an integral part of the BCC approach, t he data suggest that they are not conducted systematic ally, with respondents even unable to clarify what exactly is done during home visits. We found that a very small number of the community health workers were assigned specifically to maternal health activities, with th e vast majority of community health workers primarily in charge of nutrition but also expected to engage in activities related to maternal health. Respondents informed us that it was not possible for them to cover both nutrition and maternal health activities simultaneously. In addition, m ost of the communit y health workers were men and therefore experienced limitations with regard to promoting maternal health care . Respondents indicated that different approaches to building and renovating maternity clinics were used, reporting that IMA appeared to have a lar ger budget and to pay better rates to contractors bidding on 102 construction contracts, while the implementing partners had smaller budgets and were , therefore, able to offer smaller salaries and invest less in construction projects . This was particularly pr oblematic when contracts were being offered by both IMA and the implementing partners in the same geographic area. In general, thre e difficulties affect ing construction and re novations were reported : (1) a conflict between the IMA and NGO partners related to differences in their construction budgets which affected the selection of contractors and construction contracts; (2) discontent among health workers with respect to the selection of sites where new maternity clinics were to be built or repaired; and (3) cases of maternity clinics where construction began but was never completed or construction was promised but never carried out. Across sites, questions were raised about the criteria used to determine when a new maternity o r renovation would be carried out , with health workers expressing frustration about the non-transparency of the selection process and claiming that decisions were inequitable. Our respondents indicated that often maternities selected to be renovated were in comparatively better condition than those which were not provided assistance, raising questions about the approach. In addition, there were complaints about unfulfilled promises or the fact that some construction projects were never completed. For exa mple, one of the high- performance health zones in the study had not benefitted from the construction or renovation of any maternity clinics. While two maternity clinics were supposed to be built and four others repaired, construction on the two new materni ty clinics had started but stopped after the structure foundations were installed , and work on the four maternity clinics had never even started. The ASSP program provided the studied health structures with furniture and equipment to carry out maternal h ealth activities . The project distributed solar panels to the four health centers included in the study, of which t hree had functional solar kits (one is in a high- performance zone and two in low - performance zones ) at the time of the study . Only one of the four health center s included in the study ( a high- performance health zone ) had received a refrigerator (actually, they had received two refrigerators because the first refrigerator stopped working) . Respondents reported that some equipment provided to the health centers proved to be inadequate or inappropriate . For example, one birth ing bed delivered to a health center was never placed in the delivery room because the door was too small for the bed to enter . In certain maternity clinics, respondents report ed that the beds we re insufficient for the numbers of women giving birth. In addition, c ommunity health workers reported difficulties raising awareness due to lack of visual aids. Fees for maternal health services were reduced subsequent to agreement s made between community members and the implementing partners. Specifically, prenatal consultation fees were fixed at 500 CF in North Ubangi and the rural site in Maniema , while the peri -urban site in Maniema charged 600 C f. In addition, fees for a normal facility -based delivery were fixed at 1000 C f. Postnatal consultation s were free of charge. While the approach mandated that rates be posted in all of the ASSP supported health centers , our respondents reported complications in volving the rates : (1) the long lag time for health authorities to authorize the rate s; (2) certain health centers refusing t o post the fee schedule; and (3) non-adherence to the fee schedule, w hich was detected in the health structure s studied. The ASSP project implemented a strategy which involved using revenue generated through the health center on a monthly basis for payment of health workers and ongoing needs to ensure proper 103 functioning of the health structure. Specifically, the project propose d use of monthly revenue as follows: 73 percent goes to salaries of service providers, 10 percent to the medicine supply, 15 percent to the functioning of the structure, and 2 percent to the Community Health Development Committee. Government health personnel participating in project activities were generally dissatisfied that they did not receive regular salary supplements through the project. Specifically, health zone and DPS personne l had the opportunity to receive a performance -based prime, while those at the national level only received per diems during field missions. Health area health workers reported that the monthly revenue generated by the health centers wa s insufficient , part icularly since the vast majority of facility -based personnel are not paid by the government . They indicated that it is not possible to survive on revenue obtained from prescriptions and user fees, which must be divided amongst other health workers, particu larly in rural areas where utilization of services is lower and people are extremely poor . Furthermore, regular stock -outs affected health care utilization and the revenue generated. As a result, the majority of service providers expressed discontent regarding compensation and job satisfaction. Reports indicated that t he drugs suppl ied for prenatal consultations , childbirth, and postnatal consultation s followed general IMA policy . Specifically, health center head nurses are responsible for generat ing drug requisitions under the supervision of the CODESA president , which are sent to the Central Health Zone offices and subsequently forward ed to the Provinc ial Health Department. The Provincial Health Department then submi ts all drug orders to the provincia l medicine distribution centers . Drugs are deliver ed follow ing the same procurement chain, with the last step involving drug distribution to the health center s. Respondents noted that even though the health structures submit drug requisitions on a month ly basis , drug deliver ies are rarely made each trimester , with some respondents indicating that drugs can arrive 6- 7 months after submitting orders, thus leading to drug shortages in the he alth centers . Three major problems concerning drug orders and distribution were reported : (1) shortages ; (2) failure to respect the drug orders ; and (3) late deliveries. In three sites, respondents felt that supply shortages constitute d the primary obstacl e to utilization of health services , including maternal health care . The majority of head nurses and CODESA presidents affirm ed that the drugs received were frequently deficient in relation to the orders, and at times, essential medicine s were not deliver ed, which was reported to interfere with delivery of appropriate care to pregnant women and during child birth. In the majority of instanc es, it was reported that drug deliveries were delivered late and did not follow a trimester -based schedule. For exampl e, at the time of this study, several respondents noted that, although it was the end of the fourth trimester, drug deliveries for the third trimester still had not been received. Perception of the Approach Health providers receiving training and many key informants reported that the ASSP project ha d helped to improve the ability of trained personnel to provide appropriate care due to the knowledge they had attained during trainings . A majority of the health workers trained claimed to be satisfied with the subjects t hey were taught, the duration of the training, and the quality of the instructors. However, the research team speculated that the stipends paid after each training may have contributed to their satisfaction , especially for personnel not paid by the government or who are volunteers. Moreover, the 104 majority of our respondents had arrived after the start of the ASSP project and therefore had not participated in training on maternal health activities. All the service providers indicate d that supervisions were very important because they identified weaknesses in the implementation of maternal health services and served to motivate health workers to make appropriate changes and better apply themselves . The community he alth workers, however, stated that supervisors did not visit the community and therefore they were not supervised . Some also noted that the supervisors need to get to the field to better understand the context. Several respondents indicated that the mate rnal health program had improved accessibility to maternal health services , particularly with the changes in prenatal consultation and delivery fees, which are more affordable . Some claimed that before ASSP, particularly in North Ubangi, most women gave birth at home , with many not know ing that pregnant wom en were supposed to deliver in the presence of a trained service provider. However, information regarding increased accessibility of maternal health services was based on perception s rather than evidence. In fact, our data suggest that many women are still giving birth at home, with those living in more remote areas not monitored by the program, and that most women do not attend postnatal consultation s. All respondents showed appreciat ion for improve ments in the deliver y infrastructure and availability of quality equipment needed for maternal health services . Nevertheless, the majority o f respondents contended that th e project was not able to resolve all problems associated with maternal health in the sites studied due to several weaknesses as follows : The majority of health providers interviewed were not stationed at the health facility where the interviews took place at the beginning of the ASSP activities. As a result, the vast majority of respondents interviewed had not received training specific to maternal health. Those who did participate in training stated that t he series of tra ining sessions and the superficial treatment of training topics made it impossible to master all of the information taught to the service providers. Weaknesses in the background of the health providers interfered with their ability to supervise other work and the overall quality of services provided; There was an insufficient number of trained community health workers assigned to maternal health, especially female community health workers. As a result, community activities appeared to be limited, particu larly in more remote locations. As a result, it is likely that many women are not monitored during pregnancy and childbirth; In certain places (e.g. North Ubangi ), being assisted by a man during childbirth continues to be a major obstacle to utilizati on of health facilities, causing women living in health areas where there are no female midwives to choose to giv e birth at home . Furthermore, the project fails to consider many cultural practices that can interfere with utilization of formal health servic es; Shortages of supplies and drugs influence the quality of care provided and likely affects utilization of maternal health services by pregnant women; The late application and failure to respect the reduced fee schedule likely affects utilization of maternal health services; According to respondents, a limited number of maternities were constructed or renovated, with several construction projects started but never completed. 105 Recommendations It was recommended that future trainings be provided at a less rigorous speed , ther eby allowing instructors to evaluate the retention capacity of trainees and make adjustments as needed . Other recommendations included that t he project trains and engages community health workers to work specifically on maternal health care, thus enabl ing maternal health approaches to function at full capacity . Respondents indicated that in order for community health workers to function well, they need to be motivated or remunerated in some way. It was also noted that, especially for maternal health, there should be more female community health workers than males. Respondents from all sites voiced frustrations regarding the repeated shortages of medicine s. Respondents suggest ed that decisions regarding construction and re novation be based on real needs , also proposing an increase in beds in certain maternity clinics , which will save women from travel ing long distances in search of a maternity clinic. Mother Respondents Participation in ASSP Maternal Health Activities Of the eighteen mothers interviewed , eleven ha d given birth in a health center and seven had delivered at home . Of the women who had delivered at home, one was living in the high- performance zone in N. Ubangi and the others were all in low -performance zones. In the high perfor ming zone in Maniema, we were unable to identify women who had delivered at home within the past 6 months. I t should be noted that, while many women in the N. Ubangi high- performance zone had delivered at home, only one woman was available to participate at the time of the study. Of the seven women who gave birth at home, all had planned on delivering in the health center, with s ix women reporting that the sudden onset of severe labor contractions prevented them from reach ing the maternity clinic . Two of these women gave birth on the way to the health center, and four gave birth in the ho mes of trained midwives and were therefore assisted by skilled attendants of their respective health centers during childbirth. Only one wom an gave birth in her own home ; this woman claimed that she did not have transportation to get to the health center , and therefore decided to give birth at home. Notably, in both of the Maniema study zones, the research team learned that, when a woman gives birth at home, the police may threaten to arrest her and institute a fine. Among women who delivered in the health facility, o nly two of eleven women paid the 1000 C f official rate fixed by the project. In one of these cases , the family had a relationship with the head nurse , and in the second instance, the woman who gave birth was related to the head of a secondary school who paid the health center free for the woman. All of the other women interviewed paid more than 1000 C f, with fees paid ranging from 3,600 to 30,000 Cf. Some women admitt ed that they did not know the official fee for childbirth in a health facility . The data suggest that the women delivering at home paid the midwives assisting the birth with a chicken. Women report ed paying from 500 Cf to 1000 Cf for ANC , which was officially 500 Cf. Although all respondents reported attending prenatal consultations, only 3 started consultations during the first trimester as is officially recommended. Most (10 of 18) started prena tal consultations during 106 the second trimester, with fewer (5 of 18) beginning in the third trimester. When asked why they do not start the prenatal consultations during the first trimester, most respondents stated that they avoid making many trips between their houses and the health center due to the time and energy involved. Respondents also suggested that, since the service providers d o not start prenatal consultations until there is a large number of women waiting to be seen for consultations, they avoid arriving in the health center early in the morning. Some women reported that it was not possible to plan other activit ies on the day of the prenatal consultation , with many women complain ing that the service providers take a lot of time during consultati ons. In three of the four sites studied, the respondents indicated that the setting was good and there was adequate seating. In all sites , the women maintain ed that the personnel were welcoming, friendly, and courteous. Of note, n one of the eighteen women interviewed reported having participated in postnatal consultation s. Perception of the Approach All women interviewed appreciated the interpersonal approach used by the health providers during childbirth, once again stating tha t they are respectful and friendly. However, no information was presented regarding the services provided. One woman reported the following about the midwife's services: With this midwife, I have never had any problems giving birth. I have four children; I have given birth here since the second. The first one was born in the general hospital, but ever since I found out about this woman, I have never gone elsewhere. She knows what she is doing, she does not insult the women giving birth, and she talks to th em with respect. She is really a good woman. In N. Ubangi a commonly cited limitation to delivering in a health facility related to the fact that many birth attendants are male, with women showing a strong preference for female birth attendants. In their view, men were often rough and did no t treat women with respect . Treatment of the placenta constitutes another barrier to delivering in health centers. Specifically, 6 of 8 women from N. Ubangi interviewed described cultural norms related to bur ial of the placenta, specif ying that cultural norms dictate that the placenta be buried either under a tree or at the crossroads of two paths. The belief is that if buried under a tree, the child will flourish and grow like a tree. If buried where two paths cross , the child will have many work opportunities. However, health center protocol mandate that the placenta be discarded in a hole or even in an incinerator, which according to local beliefs, can disrupt the future of the child. For this reason, even women who attended CPN refused to deliver in the hea lth center so that they c ould deal with the placenta according to local customs. Women in N. Ubangi also indicated that some women chose not to deliver in the facilities because they lack appropriate clothing for themselves and the newborn to wear when leaving the health center. Women delivering in the health centers also frequently c omplained that the delivery environment was dirty. 107 iv. Limitations Timing of baseline survey: The baseline survey was conducted in April 2014, well after ASSP maternal health activities had begun in April 2013. Thus, 2014 baseline estimates may not reflect the situation prior to ASSP intervention but may provide a slightly improved representation o f the in -country situation, and potentially underestimate true program impact. Service interruptions: Since community education and home visits were not reliant on ASSP funding following completion of training , it is not expected that the project's serv ice interruptions impacted rates of outreach activities to sensitize mothers to the importance of early initiation of ANC consultation, facility deliveries or post -natal care . However, t he provision of medicines and supplies to health facilities may have b een impacted , affecting health worker motivation and capacity to provide (quality) care ; medication stock -outs are discussed in Chapter 8. Power to detect differences in outcomes: As described in Chapter 2, the analysis was powered to detect overall diff erences between intervention and control groups . It was not powered to detect differences between sub- groups. Nevertheless, some differences in the sub- analyses were found. v. Discussion Overall, the results from the DID models suggest that the ASSP program positively impacted facility deliveries, equipment availability and health facility cleanliness but negatively affected receipt of the recommended 4 or more ANC visits as well as receipt of a postna tal care visit for the baby within two days of delivery. N o statistically significant program impacts were detected for other maternal health indicators. The quantitative analy ses indicat e limited program impact on antenatal care . While the DID estimate from the model on receipt of the four recommended ANC visits suggest ed a negative impact , there was no statistically significant program impact on timing of the first ANC visit or the mean expenditure per ANC visit. Qualitative data help shed light on these findings with reports that efforts to improve access to and uptake of maternal health services was constrained by drug and supply shortages as well as an insufficient number of trained and female community health workers assigned to maternal health. At the same time, limited outreach activities of community health workers, particularly to women living in remote locations, likely restricted health service utilization. Mother -respondents included in the qualitative study also complained about the time involve d in traveling to the health centers and participating in ANC, with some claiming that there is often a long waiting period and that participation in ANC consultations generally consumes an entire day. Furthermore, with regard to the timing of the first A NC visit, in particular, reports from health care workers, key informants and mothers consistently noted that women do not tell others (especially men) of their pregnancy during the first three months while it is not visible. These cultural traditio ns thus likely affected uptake of ANC services as wel l as the ability of community health workers to effectively pro mote early initiation of ANC consultations. 108 Still, th e reason why a negative program impact on receipt of at least 4 ANC visits was found is unclear . Results on t he timing of the first ANC visit , however, may offer some insight . As noted above, qualitative results informed of challenges with motivating women to attend ANC consultations early in their pregnancy, noting both cultural taboos and reluctance of women to share a new pregnancy (especially with in the first three months) with male health workers. I ndeed, during qualitative interviews with mothers, less than 1/5 of women reported starting ANC consultations during the first trimester as is officially recommended. Further, while descriptive data suggest no change in the number of women in ASSP areas wh o received their first ANC visit within the 1 st trimester of pregnancy (absolute change= - 2.0; p=0.537), results from non- ASSP areas show a significant increase in the proportion of women who initiate their first ANC consultation early (absolute change=6.9; p=0.013). This may be indicative of another initiative at work in non- ASSP areas (e.g. the World Bank program , or another program that we are not aware of ) which was able to encourage women to attend all 4 recommended ANC visits, including the early visit within the first trimester of pregnancy. Alternatively, gains made prior to the baseline study could potentially explain the result seen here , such that the timing of the baseline study (subsequent to implementation of ASSP activities in 2013) may have b iased results. It is also acknowledged that the result may simply be a false negative. Findings from quantitative analyses were also compared with DHIS2 data . DHIS2 data from 2014 (baseline) were not available for comparison but the re was little consistency with 2017/2018 (endline) data. For example, according to DHIS2 data, a large proportion of pregnant women (>60 percent ) throughout Maniema, Nord Ubangi & Tshopo, attended at least 4 ANC visits in early 2017, with general improveme nts across all sampling domains, with each successive quarter. Similar ly, when looking at women who received at least 3 ANC visits, DHIS2 data indicate that a large proportion of pregnant women (>70 percent ), throughout Maniema, Nord Ubangi & Tshopo, attend ed at least 3 ANC visits in early 2017, with general improvements across all sampling domains, with each successive quarter. Further, although DHIS2 data similarly suggest ed modest declines across quarterly periods in the proportion of women initiating their first ANC visit within the first trimester throughout Maniema, Nord Ubangi & Tshopo, the absolute proportion of women initiating ANC consultations in their first trimester (>30 percent ) was still larger than estimates from endline survey analyses. Despite these observed discrepancies, however, it is useful to note that all b aseline survey point estimates align with 2013/14 Demographic and Health Survey ( DHS ) estimates (i.e. among women who had a live birth in the last five years prior to the survey, 48 percent at least c ompleted the four recommended visits; 17 percent of women made their first visit before the fourth month of pregnancy) (Minist\u00e8re du Plan et Suivi de la Mise en uvre de la R\u00e9volution de la Modernit\u00e9 (MPSMRM), 2014) . Limited project performance was also observed for the use of ITNs and postnatal care services. With regard to ITNs , results from the DID model show that the ASSP program had no statistically significant impact on pregnant women's use of ITNs or household ownership of at least one ITN . The p rogram scope is important to note here, howe ver, as data from quarterly reports suggest that ASSP was not responsible for purchasing mosquito nets in either mass or routine campaigns. ASSP's q uarterly reports also mention that throughout years 1 through 4 of the ASSP project, program support for mal aria interventions targeted 19 health zones - the majority of which were in Kasai and thus excluded from analyses - with organizational challenges also potentially disrupt ing the availability of malaria 109 commodities. Indeed, during qualitative interviewers with caregivers of malnourished children, participants in Maniema claimed to have not received mosquito nets since the time that Merlin was the implementing NGO in the health zone. No effect ive comparisons with DHIS2 data were possible since log frame data were only available for Kasai Central, Kasai and Maniema, with the indicator focused on the number/percentage of pregnant women and children under -one year provided with ITNs. However, baseline point estimates were noted to align with 2013/14 DHS estimates (i.e. 60 percent of pregnant women slept under an ITN in 2013; 70 percent of households own at least one ITN) (Minist\u00e8re du Plan et Suivi de la Mise en uvre de la R\u00e9volution de la Modernit\u00e9 (MPSMRM), 2014) . Results on receipt of post -natal care for babies were less than favorable , with DID estimate s suggesting that the program had a negative impact on the likelihood of the newborn receiving a post -natal care visit within two days of delivery . Findings from the qualitative analysis echoed these findings with health worker and key informant interviewees noting that the post -natal consultations often did not take place. Respondents acknowledged that service providers often refused to offer the post -natal consultation because t hey did not have the necessary materials (e.g. vi tamin A, folic acid, iron) with which to care for women who might attend. Respondents also informed of cultural practices that challenged uptake of these services, including Buakel \u00e9 in Nord Ubangi , where a wom an stays home for a year after birth to first protect and then celebrate the preservation of her life and that of her baby. Mothers who were interviewed similarly affirmed that they had not attended any post -natal consultations. Notably, among ASSP's program goals was to increase the length of time a woman stayed in the facility (to at least 3 days) to allow for post -partum and post -natal visits to take place . Considering the limitation of the post -partum care and post -natal care indicators in reflecting this goal, w e conduc ted additional analyses, exploring the proportion of women who spent at least 3 days in the facility after delivery. This indicator included women who were discharged early but reported receiving a health visit from a doctor or nurse, within 3 days of deli very. Results suggested no statistically significant program impact on the likelihood of a woman staying in a facility for at least 3 days. On the other hand, t he ASSP program was shown to have significant and positive impact s on delivery outcomes, including increased probability of facility deliveries as well as improved perceptions of quality of care during delivery. Quarterly reports note a six -month pilot distribution of birth delivery kits, containing items for mother and baby, to encourage maternal service use and ensure that women and their newborn could be seen leaving the facility well -dressed. While there is no survey data available to evaluate the impact of this initiative, it is possible that this program strategy, combined with other ASSP investments including reduced delivery user fees, contributed to the positive effect observed here. Quantitative results were consistent with DHIS2 reports of increases in facility -based deliver ies; although survey point estimates are lower. (Survey point estimates are also lower than 2013/14 DHS estimates. ) On another note, a lthough many mother -respondents expressed reservations about cleanliness, results from the DID model indicate d that the program was also associated with increased perceptions of the adequacy of equipment availability and facility cleanliness . All in all, results suggest that future endeavors would benefit from a mid -point evaluation to better monitor and assess study progress , and direct c hanges in the project 's approach and implementation as needed. F uture interventions would further benefit from formative research to better understand how 110 cultural traditions and provincial practices affect attitudes and service use so that BCC messages and outreach activities can be more effectively tailored and implemented. 111 References Adegoke, A., & van den Broek, N.

Overview of the ASSP approach The official Access to Primary Health Care (ASSP ) approach include d efforts to strengthen the health system in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) , and ha d two global goals with respect to children's health: 1) improving the quality of and access to health services targeting children less than five years of age, and 2) improving the demand for health services. These two goals we re specifically implemented through the following measures: Strengthening the capaci ty of health center personnel and community health workers (RECOs) via trainings and supportive supervision; Improving the infrastructure and equipment in the health stations , enhancing software and providing regular supervision to the Regional Distribution Centers (CDRs) and Health Zone Executive Teams (ECZSs) to address management capacity weaknesses ; Providing medicine and essential commodities; Increasing behavioral change communication (BCC) with r espect to detection and early care of ill children in households, the community, and local health facilities ; Implementing a negotiated and reasonable fee system for the treatment of children under five years of age. All things considered, child health intervention s involve d basic curative services, preventive care, and training, with immunization and the fight against malaria being specific focus areas f or the child health approach. Basic curative care ha d the goal of improving access to and usage of the health centers , through training and retention of staff, provi sion of adequate equipment for diagnosis and treatment, implement ation of a system of continuous supply of essential medicine, and availability of services at reasonable rates. In accordance with the policies of the Ministry of Health (MOH), other important focal areas include d creat ing functional centers of medicine distribution, rehabilitat ing and furnishing the health structures, construction of new buildings with lasting materials, and providing essential equipment. In particular, the project provide d microscopes and spectrophotometers to the General Reference Hospital, as well as resuscitation kits for children, scales, sterilizers , and solar refrigerator s to the health centers . Integrated Management of Childhood Illness ( IMCI ) guidelines were supposed to be followed during treatment, with the program committed to providing artemisinin -based combination therapies (ACTs) and other malaria drugs for malaria tre atment, zinc combined with oral rehydration salts (ORS) for the treatment of diarrhea, and amoxicillin for the treatment of pneumonia. Preventive services involve d growth -monitoring consultations with services including weighing children, vitamin A distribution, deworming with mebendazole, distribution of insecticide -treated nets (ITNs) , and Mother and Child weeks, as well as immunizations and health communication s essions. Prevention also involve d several community -based approaches , led by RECOs who were responsible for implementing BCC strategies through household visits, group meetings, and mass awareness -raising activities, with a focus on prompt care -seeking. The community- based IMCI approach aimed to address geographical barriers and extend access to care in ASSP -assisted health zones , via outreach activities in hard -to-reach 183 communities. Further, via the establishment and reinvigoration of community care site s (CCSs), trained relays were supported in the provision of basic treatment for the three most common childhood diseases, namely malaria, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infection (ARI). Training had the goal of capacity building for the service providers working in health centers and the community health sites , to ensure quality diagnosis and care . Such training was provided by the implementing partners (IPs) , with content including resuscitation of newborns , use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria, and treatment of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia . Other training themes included utilization of IMCI guidelines at the health center level , as well as managing cases on a community basis, extension of the immunization program, integrated training of laboratory technicians about blood security, malaria , and tuberculosis diagnos tics and topics related to health service delivery (e.g. hospital hygiene, integrated supervision of endemic diseas es, nutrition, and clean villages and schools). Strategies designed for immunization and malaria, central interventions to the ASSP child health approach, include d: The immunization strategy . In the DRC, immunization campaigns are predominantly supported by MOH partner organizations such as the GAVI Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation), the United Nations Children' s Fund (UNICEF) , and the World Health Organization (WHO). To support the national immunization program, ASSP committed to improving cold chain efficiency via a shift in reliance on expensive petrol refrigerators and freezers to sustainable and cost -effective solar equipment. Accordingly, until all solar units were in place, ASSP provided diesel fuel to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) antenna (clusters of health zones) and/or local provincial vaccines storage antennas, distributed kerosene to health facilities for existing vaccine refrigerators, a nd provided parts to repair kerosene refrigerators, in order to maintain the cold chain as needed. To avoid shortages of vaccines and syringes, a system of rapid alerts was implemented . The project aimed to ensure the quality of data , in collaboration with provincial institutions such as the Provincial Department of Health , to guarantee that vaccines we re provided as reported. To support the solar investment and improve overall reach and efficiency, bicycles and motorbikes were purchas ed and distributed to health facilities to improve transportation of vaccines and drugs from the health zones. Solar equipment (i.e. solar refrigerators, freezers , and lighting kits) was used to support vaccine storage at both the health zone and health fa cility level, in addition to blood and drug conservation at hospitals and drug depots. Solar refrigerators were procured and installed in ASSP - assisted health zones, along with tool kits for refrigerator repair and maintenance, replacement parts, and, per WHO requirements, fridge -tags for continuous temperature monitoring in refrigerators. To encourage long- term use of these solar fridges, Sundazer was recruited to organize a three -day training focused on good practice s for solar system and cold chain equipment installation as well as basic preventive maintenance and compressor replacement. Training in refrigerator installation, maintenance , and design of essential tools was then facilitated by a cold chain engineer with over 20 years' experience at UNICEF and involved MOH staff and Interchurch Medical Assistance (dba IMA World Health) consultant technicians. By ensuring local capacity to conduct routine maintenance and system 184 monitoring, this training served to further strengthen the immunization program at the national and local levels. Monitoring and formative supervision by IPs were also provided as needed. Ultimately, several vaccination campaigns (e.g. polio vaccination campaigns, the \"reach every zone\" vaccination strategy; African Vaccination Week (i.e. Semaine Africaine de la Vaccination) , polio vaccination campaigns) were organized and/or facilitated by ASSP, through participation in coordination meetings, support for supervision activities , and provision of technical and logistic al assistance. During Semaine Africaine de la Vaccination, activities organized by ASSP -supported clusters included the administration of the injectable polio vaccination as well as the introduction of \"Penta 3\" as routine vaccination, coupled with vitamin A supplementation and deworming campaigns using m ebendazole. A three -month catch -up program was also organized, using the Mother and Child week strategy and involving RECOs making visits to villages to identify children who missed immunization appointment s. Campaigns targeting maternal and neonatal tetanus were also launched - although this activity was mainly funded by UNICEF with the ASSP program providing logistical support - while other immunization -related activities included support for an urgent yel low fever vaccination campaign. Combatting malaria. ASSP set a goal to reduc e malaria fatalities by half. To achieve this, the project aimed to offer preventive and curative treatments with an emphasis on increasing prevention and quality diagnosis . Increased prevention and improved care were to be achieved via training and supervision of service providers, at the health center level and the community health sites ; provision of RDTs and antimalarials in health center s and community health sites ; utilization of BCC strategies to increase treatment compliance; distribution of long -lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) to children under five who completed the vaccination series ; deployment of RECOs to help community members attach mosquito nets correctly and advise them about usage ; and implementation of a community- based IMCI program with an emphasis on detection, early case management , the recognition of danger signs, and the promotion of presumpt ive intermittent treatment and LLINs . ASSP investments were consolidated via partnership with the Global Fund and the President 's Malaria Initiative (PMI), which supported the provision of antimalarial drugs to functional CCSs, and also reinforced the su pply of malaria commodities, including availability of ITNs for distribution in PMI - supported health zones. In addition to routine distribution of ITNs, IMA World Health launched a mass distribution campaign for LLINs, using a \"hang -up\" strategy which aime d to provide more certainty that LLINs were being properly used. Funded through a partnership with IMA, the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF), this \"hang- up\" initiative was complemented by post -distrib ution check -up module s to monitor bed net distribution, condition, and utilization, following reports of poor conditions and limited net usage. Notably, in years one through four of the ASSP project, program support for malaria interventions targeted 19 health zones ( eight in Maniema, one in Kasai Central , and ten in Kasai). As noted previously, Kasai and Kasai Central were excluded from all analyse s due to civil unrest which precluded endline data collection. 185 Summary of ASSP activities prior to the baseline survey According to ASSP's quarterly reports, by the end of Year 1, ASSP provided substantial support to the vaccination program by supplying kerosene for existing refrigerators, dispatching 144 eco -friendly solar refriger ators (36 of which were installed), and distributing 1,186 bicycles to improve the reach and efficiency of vaccination campaigns. Children under 1 year of age were vaccinated against measles and other infectious diseases, and campaigns targeting maternal a nd neonatal tetanus were launched in 4 health zones in Nord Ubangi. This latter activity was mainly funded by UNICEF, with the ASSP program providing logistical support. Data on i mmunization s received (i.e. measles) are reported through the National Health Information System (SNIS ) and later keyed into the District Health Information System (Software) (DHIS 2). While all data are now extracted from the DHIS2, IPs would previously c ollect data from local EPI antennas with a parallel data collec tion system (before the DHIS2 was fully functional in all ASSP - assisted health zones) and report these to IMA when confronted with low reporting rate s and /or completeness. Figure 5.1 below depicts quarterly progress on vaccination of children under 1 agai nst measles . The chart (taken from April - June 2014 quarterly report ) depicts results by quarter, up until the baseline survey in Quarter 1 Year 2 . Figure 5.1. Quarterly progress on measles vaccination among children under -1. Routine distribution of LLINs to children under one was also supported during immunization visits. Of note, the ASSP program reduced its malaria programming to 8 HZs in Maniema with other ASSP HZs receiving support from two major in -country malaria donors (i.e. the Global Fund and the PMI). In Kalehe and Kabare health zones, RECOs were trained on the correct utilization of RDTs for malaria diagnosis as per ministry protocol. Community -based health care services were offered throughout community care sites o perational in Sud Kivu, Maniema and Orientale, treating 1,896 cases of malaria, diarrhea and respiratory infections in children under five years of age. In addition, over the course of Year 1, performance primes, running costs and supervision expenses were paid, and changes in user fees were 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000ChildrenChildren Under -One Vaccinated Against Measles 186 ii. Quantitative findings This chapter presents findings on several important child health indicators including the prevalence of diarrhea, symptoms of ARI and fever , among children under five , as well as the tre atment of these common illnesses . The prevalence of a nemia , as well as the results of a n RDT test for malaria, among children 6- 59 months of age, are also discussed. The chapter concludes with findings on vaccination coverage among children 12- 23 months of age. Probit models were fit for each child health indicator, using a difference -in-differences (DID) estimation strategy. The results of these DID model s allowed for an ASSP project impact assessment on relevant child health outcomes, with the DID estimator being represented by a multiplicative interaction term between the time (i.e. module wave) and group assignment (i.e. ASSP vs. non- ASSP) variables. All DID models are controlled for poten tially relevant confounding factors , including sampling domain, setting, wealth quintile , and maternal education. DID models for sub- groups of the population (based on sex, wealth, and sampling domain) are also presented. Of note, the study was powered to detect overall differences between intervention and control groups ; however, the study was not powered to detect differences according to sub- groups which may have required a larger sample size . In addition, the World Bank introduced a performance -based fi nancing (PBF) project in some non- ASSP areas with an aim to improve service utilization, quality of care , and health behaviors. Given the potential of this World Bank program to influence results of the ASSP impact evaluation, all DID models include a cate gorical indicator to control for the two modes of World Bank support (i.e. cash support only or the full PBF intervention). In addition to results from DID models, descriptive tables are also presented for each child health indicator , illustrating changes in the relevant outcome, at endline compared to baseline, in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas. Child illness Diarrhea, symptoms of ARI and f ever Diarrhea and ARI, including pneumonia, are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality for children under five in the DRC (Minist\u00e8re du Pl an et Suivi de la Mise en uvre de la R\u00e9volution de la Modernit\u00e9 (MPSMRM), 2014) . Moreover, fever is a major presenting symptom in many childhood illnesses including ARI, malaria, and measles, among others (Minist\u00e8re du Plan et Suivi de la Mise en uvre de la R\u00e9volution de la Modernit\u00e9 (MPSMRM), 2014) . Prevalence of each of these three childhood illnesses (i.e. diarrhea, symptoms of ARI , and fever) was assessed via mother's self -report. Respondents were asked whether the child had been ill with diarrhea in the two weeks preceding the module and also whet her the child had suffered from a fever in the two weeks prior. To assess the prevalence of symptoms of ARI, mothers were asked if the child had been ill with a cough in the two weeks prior to the module and, if so, whether the cough was accompanied by short, rapid, or difficult breathing. For the purpose of this analysis, children who had a cough accompanied by short, rapid, or difficult breathing were considered to have symptoms of ARI. It should be noted that these measures were subjective (i.e. based on the mothers' perception of the symptoms/illness) and not validated by any medical examination. 187 Findings from the fully- adjusted DID models indicate d that the ASSP program had no impact on diarrhea prevalence, but resulted in improvements in both symptoms of ARI and fever prevalence among children under five (Figure 5.2 ). Figure 5.2. Direction of ASSP impact overall and on child illness by sex, wealth, and domain.

With regard to diarrhea prevalence, th e fully adjusted DID model indicated no statistically significant program effects (Table 5.1 ). Further, sub- analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in diarrhea prevalence by sex (Tables 5.2 and 5. 3), wealth (Tables 5. 4 and 5. 5), or domain (Tables 5. 6 and 5.7). The DID model did, however, indicate a significant inverse association of diarrhea prevalence with increasing age of the child (Table 5. 1, p<0.01), consistent with evidence of increased burden of diarrhea in younger age -groups (Fischer Walker et al., 2013; Fischer Walker, Perin, Aryee, Boschi -Pinto, & Black, 2012) . With regard to symptoms of ARI , the fully adjusted DID model indicated that the ASSP program had a significant positive impact on the prevalence of symptoms of ARI, decreasing the probability of illness by 5.4 percentage points in ASSP areas compared to non- ASSP areas (Table 5. 9, p<0.001). Sub- analyses also revealed significant program impacts, with a decreased probability of ARI symptoms among male children under five (Table 5.11, marginal ef fect: -8.6, p<0.001), those in the top 60 percent wealth 188 quintile (Table 5.13 , marginal effect: - 7.1, p<0.001) living Maniema/Tshopo (Table 5.15 , marginal effect: - 4.7, p<0.01). For fever , the fully adjusted DID model indicated a positive and significant program impact, with the probability of fever in children under five decreasing by 4.6 percentage points in ASSP compared to non- ASSP areas (Table 5.1 7, p=0.043). Notably, sub- analyses revealed statistically significant differences in fever pr evalence according to wealth, with a decreased probability of fever among those in the top 60 percent wealth quintile (Table 5. 21, marginal effect: - 5.4, p=0.049) . There were no statistically significant differences in fever prevalence by sex (Tables 5.18 and 5. 19) or domain (Tables 5.22 and 5.23 ). Finally, as further support to findings from the DID models, d escriptive data indicate d that, in ASSP areas, the preva lence of several childhood illnesses declined at endline compared to baseline (Figure 5.3). Figure 5.3. Prevalence of diarrhea, symptoms of ARI , and fever in ASSP and non -ASSP areas, by year *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels statistically significant at p <0.05 Specifically, a smaller propor tion of children aged 0- 59 months in ASSP areas experienced diarrhea in the past two weeks, at endline compared to baseline. However, this difference was not statistically significant (Table 5. 8, 2014: 10.5 percent vs. 2017: 8.2 percent ; p=0.242) . Similar to diarrhea, a smaller proportion of children aged 0-59 months in ASSP areas experienced symptoms of ARI at endline compared to baseline; this difference was not statistically significant (Table 5. 16, 2014: 6.7 percent vs. 2017: 4.7 percent ; p=0.200). There was , however, a statistically significant decline in the prevalence of fever in ASSP areas, at endline compared to baseline (Table 5.24, 2014: 21.8 percent vs. 2017: 14.9 percent ; p=0.020). There were no significant differences in prevalence of these three childhood illnesses, in non-ASSP areas, between baseline and endline. 10.5 6.721.88.2 4.7 14.9 050100 Diarrhea Symptoms of ARI*FeverpercentageASSP areas 2014 3.917.2 10.6 050100 Diarrhea Symptoms of ARIFeverpercentageNon- ASSP areas 2014 2017 Key Points There was no statistically significant program impact on diarrhea prevalence. The ASSP program had a positive and significant effect on the prevalence of symptoms of ARI among children under five years (marginal effect: - 5.434; p<0.001). The ASSP program had a positive and significant effect on the prevalence of fever among children under five years (marginal effect: - 4.590; p <0.05). 189 Malaria and anemia Malaria is an endemic disease among the DRC populace, with year -round transmission, and one of the top contributors to under -five morbidity and mortality in the country (United States Agency for International Development (USAID), 2015) . To assess malaria parasite prevalence, an RDT for malaria was administered to children under five years \u2014 SD Bioline Malaria Ag P.f/Pan (Standard Diagnostics Inc., Suwon City, South Korea), a screening test for P. falciparum and other Plasmodium species \u2014 with the permission of their parent or gua rdian. Anemia prevalence in children 6 -59 months of age w as also assessed via a blood test following consent from the parent or guardian. Anemia is a known complication of malaria (Oladeinde et al., 2012; World Health Organization & UNICEF, 2004) . It is estimated to affect half of all pre -school children in developing countries, and its effects on cognitive and physical development in children as well as child mortality are well documented (World Health Organization & UNICEF, 2004) . Findings from the fully- adjusted DID models indicate d that the ASSP program had no statistically significant impact on malaria parasite prevalence or anemia prevalence among children 6- 59 months of age (Figure 5. 4). Figure 5. 4. Direction of impact of ASSP overall and on malaria and anemia by wealth, and domain. Malaria Anemia Overall DID results No impact No impact Wealth Low & Low middle wealth quintiles No impact No impact Middle, High -middle, and High wealth quintiles No impact No impact Domain Nord/Sud Ubangi Improved Improved Maniema/Tshopo No impact Worsened *Impact is determined by statistical significance (p<0.05). Results of the fully adjusted DID model indicated no statistically significant program impact on malaria parasite prevalence among children aged 6- 59 months (Table 5.25 , p=0.063). The DID model did indicate , however, that malaria parasite prevalence among children 6- 59 months was positively associated with advancing age ( p<0.001) and inversely associated with household ownership of at least one bed net ( p<0.001) and cash only support from the World Bank initiative ( p<0.001). Sub- analyses 190 indicated that in Nord/Sud Ubangi, malaria parasite prevalence declined by 30.3 percentage points in ASSP areas compared to non-ASSP areas (Table 5.2 8, p=0.009). Descriptive data suggested similar trends in malaria parasite prevalence, across ASSP and non- ASSP areas, with a significantly larger proportion of children aged 6- 59 months testing positive for the antigen for at least one species of malaria at endline compared to baseline (Figure 5.5 ). Of these, the majority tested positive for P. falciparum and/or other species infections (i.e. Plasmodium and/or mixed) in comparison to very few who tested positive for other malaria species only. The proportion of children who tested positive for Plas modium and/or mixed species of malaria significantly increased at endline compared to baseline, in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas ( p<0.05). Figure 5. 5. Malaria parasite prevalence among children aged 6- 59 months in ASSP and non -ASSP areas, by year *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels statistically significant at p <0.05 Notably, the magnitude of the absolute change in malaria parasite prevalence was larger in non- ASSP areas than that in ASSP areas (Table 5. 30). Comparison of the se absolute changes between ASSP and non-ASSP areas, at endline compared to baseline, suggest that the ASSP program may have positively influenced the prevalence of malaria among children 6- 59 months. With regard to anemia, the fully -adjusted DID model in dicated no statistically significant program impact on illness among children aged 6- 59 months (Table 5.31 , p=0.053). The DID model did indicate , however, that anemia prevalence was significantly and inversely associated with advancing age ( p<0.01) and increasing wealth ( p<0.05). Sub- analyses revealed differences in anemia prevalence according to domain. Specifically, in Nord/Sud Ubangi, anemia prevalence declined by 28.6 percentage points in ASSP areas compared to non -ASSP areas (Table 5.3 4, p=0.049) while, in Maniema/Tshopo 0.944.3 42.8 1.5 050100 malaria species onlypercentageNon- ASSP areas 2014 2017Key Points There was no statistically significant program impact on malaria parasite prevalence among children under 6 -59 months of age . There was no statistically significant program impact on anemia prevalence among children under 6 - 59 months of age . 191 prevalence increased by 10.9 percentage points in ASSP areas compared to non- ASSP areas (Table 5.35 , p=0.001). Similar to the findings on malaria parasite prevalence, descriptive data indicated that the proportion of children aged 6- 59 months with anemia significantly increased at endline compared to baseline in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas (Figure 5. 6), with a greater absolute change in anemia prevalence from 2014 to 2017 in non- ASSP areas compared to ASSP areas (Table 5.3 6). Figure 5. 6. Anemia prevalence among children aged 6- 59 months in ASSP and non- ASSP areas, by year *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels statistically significant at p <0.05 Robustness checks The baseline and endline surveys were conducted in different months and the potential impact of seasonal variation on childhood illness burden must be considered. Crossed by the Equator line, there are three main \"season zones\" in the DRC, corresponding to areas North of Equator line, along the Equator line, and South of Equator line. North of the Equator line, the ra iny season spans from April to November while the dry season runs from December through March. South of the Equator line, however, the rainy season is observed from October through May while the dry season spans June to September. Accordingly, at the time of baseline collection (April- May 2014) there were rains everywhere while, for endline data collection (July - September 2017), Nord Ubangi and Tshopo were experiencing rains while Maniema had rains near the Equator line and was drier in the southern part . In response to concerns regarding survey timing and seasonal variation in Maniema , the endline prevalence of diarrhea, symptoms of ARI, fever, malaria, and anemia were compared between ASSP areas of northern and southern Maniema. There were no statistical ly significant differences in prevalence of any of the five childhood illnesses between the rainy northern region and the dry southern region of Maniema (results not shown). 68.576.7 050100 *AnaemiapercentageNon- 2017 192 Treatment of childhood i llnesses Mothers who self -reported experiences of common illnesses among their children, were additionally asked about treatment -seeking behaviors for those illnesses. Specifically, mothers of children with diarrhea were additionally asked whether they sought advice or treatment for the diarrhea and whether the child was given any treatments or supplements for diarrhea. Mothers of children with symptoms of ARI and/or fever were additionally asked whether they had sought treatment for the child from a health facility or health provider and whether the child took antibiotics and/or anti -malarial drugs, regardless of seeking treatment from a facility or provider of care. Findings from the fully- adjusted DID models indicate d that the ASSP program had no statistically significant impact on either treatment of diarrhea, or symptoms of ARI or fever (Figure 5. 7). With regard to treatment- seeking behavior for children with symptoms of ARI and/or fever, however, the program was shown to have a negative impact, reducing the likelihood of seeking care at a health faci lity or from a health care provider (Figure 5.7 ). Figure 5. 7. Direction of ASSP impact overall and on child illness by sex, wealth, and domain.

Notably, however, sub- analyses revealed significant program impacts among female children under five (Table 5. 38, marginal effect: 34.6, p =0.014) and those in the top 60 percent wealth quintile (Table 5.41 , marginal effect: 31.1, p=0.008), suggesting an increased probability of those subgroups receiving either ORS or RHF in ASSP areas compared to non -ASSP areas. When expanding the diarrhea treatment portfolio to include supplementation with increased fluids, the fully adjusted DID model similarly suggested no statistically significant program effect on the treatment of diarrhea with ORS, RHF and/or increased fluids (Table 5.45 ). There were no statistically significant differences in the treatment of diarrhea i n children under five years of age with either ORS , RHF or increased fluids by sex (Tables 5. 46 and 5. 47) or wealth (Tables 5. 48 and 5. 49). However, s ub-analyses indicated that, in Nord/Sud Ubangi, children under five years in ASSP areas were less likely t o receive either ORS, RHF , and/or increased fluids for treatment of diarrhea , compared to under -five children in non-ASSP areas (Table 5.50 , marginal effect: - 31.9, p=0.006). There were no statistically significant program effects for the treatment of sym ptoms of ARI with antibiotics (Table 5.53 ). Furthermore, s ub-analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in treatment of symptoms of ARI with antibiotics by sex (Tables 5.54 and 5.55 ), wealth (Tables 5.56 and 5.57 ), or domain (Tables 5.58 and 5. 59). Notably, w hile no statistically significant program effect was detected for the treatment of fever in children under five (Table 5.61 ), sub- analyses revealed significant differences according to wealth and domain. Specif ically, the probability of children under five receiving treatment with antimalarials for fever significantly declined in ASSP areas compared to non- ASSP areas among those in the bottom 40 percent wealth quintile (Table 5.64 , marginal effect: - 25.6, p=0.022) , but significantly increased in ASSP areas compared to non -ASSP for those in the top 60 percent wealth quintile (Table 5.65 , marginal effect: -18.1, p=0.018). In Maniema/Tshopo, children under five years in ASSP areas were more likely to receive antimal arials for treatment of fever compared to under -five children in non-ASSP areas (Table 5.6 7, marginal effect: 18.5, p =0.016). With regard to treatment- seeking behaviors, the fully adjusted DID model indicated that the probability of seeking treatment for symptoms of ARI and/or fever declined by 11.5 percentage points in ASSP compared to non -ASSP areas (Table 5. 69, p=0.030). However, s ub-analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in treatment -seeking behavior by sex (Tables 5.70 and 5.71 ), wealth (Tables 5.72 and 5.73 ), or domain (Tables 5.74 and 5.75 ). Key Points There was no statistically significant ASSP program impact on treatment of the three common childhood illnesses (i.e. diarrhea, symptoms of ARI, or fever) . The ASSP program had a negative and significant effect o n treatment - seeking behavior, reducing the likelihood of seeking care at a health facility or from a health care provider for children with symptoms of ARI and/or fever (marginal effect: - 11.517 ; p=0.030). 194 Overall, d escriptive data indicate d somewhat dissimilar t rends in treatment of diarrhea, symptoms of ARI and fever, between baseline and endline, in ASSP compared to non- ASSP are as. In ASSP areas, significantly fewer children received treatment for diarrhea or symptoms of ARI, while a significantly greater proportion of children in ASSP areas received antimalarials for fever , at endline compared to baseline (Figure 5. 8). Figure 5.8. Changes in treatment of childhood illness in ASSP areas , by yea r *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels statistically significant at p <0.05 In non- ASSP areas, there were no statistically significant changes in receipt of treatment for any of the childhood illnesses (Figure 5.9 ). Figure 5.9. Changes in treatment of childhood illness in non- ASSP areas, by year *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels statistically significant at p <0.05 Of note , treatment- seeking behaviors were very high and favorable at the start of the program, with 99 percent and 91.1 percent of mothers, in ASSP and non- ASSP areas, respectively, reporting that they sought treatment at a health facility or from a health provider for their children with symptoms of ARI and/or fever ( Figure 5. 8 and 5. 9).

Overall, the proportion of mothers reporting that they sought treatment at a health facility or from a health provider for their children with symptoms of ARI and/or fever remained high at endline in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas (85.2 percent vs. 88.3 percent ). Immunizations Having effective coverage of child immunizations for vaccine -preventable diseases is one of th e most important preventive measures for child morbidity and mortality, espe cially in developing countries (Bloom, Canning, & Weston, 2005; et al., 2003; Fotso, Ezeh, Madise, Liu et al., 2012) . Basic vaccinations included in the definition of full vaccination coverage are Bacillus Calmette - Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), three doses of Diphtheria, Pertussis, and Tetanus (DPT), three doses of Polio (excluding the dose given immediately after birth, Polio 0), and measles. Following the Guide to DHS Statistics (Rutstein & Rojas, 2006) , the DPT 1, 2, and 3 doses were assumed to have been given at the same time as the Polio 1, 2, and 3 doses. Vaccination coverage was assessed via this module in two ways. The first, and the preferred method, was to copy each child's vaccination card. Whe re vaccination cards were not available or if the vaccine had not been recorded on the card as being given, the mother gave an oral history of vaccinations received. In ASSP areas, the proportion of mothers who reported not having a vaccination card signif icantly increased at endline compared to baseline (Figure 5.10, 2014: 40.3 percent vs. 2017: 55.4 percent ). Similar changes were observed in non- ASSP areas with a significant increase in the proportion of mothers reporting that they did not have a vaccinat ion card (Figure 5.10, 2014: 28.4 percent vs. 2017: 50.1 percent ). At baseline, only 4.7 percent of children 12- 23 months of age in ASSP areas had vaccination cards that mothers were able to produce for the interviewers; this increased to 7 percent of children 12- 23 months of age by endline, although the change was not statistically significant. Conversely, in non- ASSP areas the proportion of children 12- 23 months of age whose mothers were able to produce vaccination cards, significantly declined from 24.5 percent to 5.4 percent (Figure 5. 10). Figure 5. 10.

Notably, the fully adjusted DID model suggested that higher levels of education among mothers ( Table 5.77, p<0.05) were significantly associated with receipt of all basic vaccinations among children 12- 23 months of age. Sub-analyses suggested no differences in receipt of all specifi ed vaccinations by sex (Tables 5.78 and 5. 79) but revealed significant differences according to wealth and domain. Specifically, the probability of children 12- 23 months of age receiving all basic vaccinations significantly increased in ASSP areas compared to non -ASSP areas among those in the top 60 percent wealth quintile (Table 5. 81, marginal effect: 16.398, p=0.044) as well as those in Maniema/Tshopo (Table 5. 83, marginal effect: 15.801, p=0.044). There were no statistically significant differences in receipt of all basic vaccinations among those children 12- 23 months of age for who m mothers were able to produce a vaccination card (Table 5.84). 197 All in all, descriptive data suggest ed that, in both ASSP (Figure 5.12 ) and non- ASSP areas (Figure 5.13 ), vaccination coverage decreased at endline compared to baseline . However, this change was only statistically significant in n on-ASSP areas (Table 5. 85, 2014: 52.5 percent vs. 2017: 38. 7 percent ; p=0.035 ). Figure 5 .12.

Changes in immunization coverage in non -ASSP areas, by year BCG = *Difference between 2014 Points There were no ASSP program effects on the vaccination coverage. 198 Of the eight specified vaccinations, children aged 12- 23 months in A SSP areas received an average of 5.7 vaccines at baseline while those in non- ASSP areas received an average of 6.4 vaccines (Figure 5. 14). At endline, the average number of vaccinations received significantly declined in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas to 4.3 and 5.2 vaccinations, respectively. Figure 5. 14. Changes in immunization coverage in non- ASSP areas, by year *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels statistically significant at p <0.05 Robustness checks As a robustness check, the DID models for treatment of childhood illnesses and receipt of immunizations were estimated with the inclusion of a variable indicating the straight -line distance between the child's household and the nearest governmental health facility. The distance variable was not a significant predictor in any of the models, and the significance and direction of the DID estimate were not affected. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in distance to the health facil ity, between baseline and endline, i n either ASSP or non- ASSP areas (results not shown). iii. Qualitative findings Research methods Methods included in- depth interviews with facility -based service providers including nurses (N=5) and midwives (N=1), RECOs invo lved in implementing de l'aire de sant\u00e9 (CODESA) members (N=4) . Focus group discussions were also conducted in each of the study health areas with caregivers of children under five years of age (N= 8), with one group discussion carried out near the health facility area and a second focus group discussion conducted far from the health center. Focus groups included 8- 10 participants and were comprised of mothers or other caregivers of young children under five years of age who had visited a health facility within the past six months. The majority of participants were housewives and farmers. 5.7 4.3 050100 *Mean number of vaccines receivedpercentageASSP of vaccines ASSP areas 2014 2017 199 Health Worker In -depth Interview Respondents Implementation across the research sites Respondents generally agreed that ASSP activities began in 2013. Child health activities were comprised of curative and preventive care, with curative care entailing treatment of common childhood illnesses such as pneumonia, malaria , and diarrhea using medications available through the program. In several instances, health providers in Maniema mentioned that the medications offered by the previous IP (Merlin) were more abundant and free while, with ASSP, essential drugs needed to treat childhood illnesses were not always available. If health providers determine d that the illness was too complicated to treat in the health center, children we re transferred to a general hospital. In these cases, patients were responsible for arranging and paying for transport, which often involve d transporting the sick child over difficult roadways and long distances (participants mentioned from 15 to 22 km) by bicycle, motorcycle or foot. Respondents reported that children often die on the way to the hospital. They maintained t hat families face difficulties providing food for the child and caregivers while in the hospital. Participants reported that main preventive activities include growth monitoring sessions, vaccinations, behavioral change and communication approaches, and community- based activities involving the RECOs. Growth monitoring sessions we re held once a week and involve d weighing the child and providing vitamin A supplements, mebendazole, and vaccinations as needed. During growth monitoring visits, educational sess ions were given by the RECOs focusing on such topics as the vaccination calendar, vitamin A supplementation, child feeding and nutrition, and the importance of rapid care -seeking to the health facility during fever or other childhood illnesses. Distributio n of mosquito nets to children under five years of age was also part of the approach. Behavioral change strategies were devised locally by the health providers and include d dissemination of messages during community meetings (one site mentioned monthly m eetings) and home visits by the RECOs. However, at least one health center admitted to not yet having developed a strategy. While health providers contended that communication efforts are important to increase community mobilization related to both curativ e and preventive health services, implementation of behavioral change interventions appeared to be limited and did not follow a set schedule. The research suggest ed that there was no systemized approach to home visits and that these visits were infrequent. In one zone in Maniema and one zone in North Ubangi, RECOs reported giving messages by megaphone on the importance of Services de Sant\u00e9 de l'Enfant (CPS). With regard to specific responsibilities, the health care providers we re noted to have been respo nsible for treating children with illnesses, coordinating and implementing growth monitoring sessions, and providing training and overseeing the work of the RECOs, with two nurses mentioning that they also participate d in community -based child nutrition ac tivities. The RECOs we re responsible for community sensitization related to issues around child health such as hygiene and handwashing, caring for newborns, vaccinations, treatment of sick children, and the importance of attending CPS. Their work include d carrying out home visits to raise awareness about child health, particularly during disease outbreaks, and to identify sick children and refer them to the health center. When sick children we re iden tified, RECOs we re supposed to conduct follow up household visits to monitor the child's health. RECOs were also responsible for monitoring vaccination coverage in communities, and children not up- 200 to-date on vaccinations we re reported to the health nurse. While household visits we re designed to be an important component of the community- based approach, respondents indicated that only when there were reductions in the utilization of health center services or during mass campaigns did RECOs actively carry out household visits. The CODESA s coordinate d RECO activities, particularly related to home visits , monitor ed monthly meetings when health center data we re compiled, and act ed as a link between community members and the health center. They also participate d in activities such as the Bulletin de Performance Communautaire (BCP) and vaccination campaigns. Most facility -based workers had participated in multiple training sessions since the start of ASSP. The exception were workers who had recently been transferr ed to the health area. Trainings focused on revitalization of CPS, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), vitamin A supplementation, IMCI, vaccinations/EPI, revitalization of CODESAs, and management of malaria. CODESAs reported participating in training rel ated to CODESA revitalization and child nutrition, and RECO trainings included sessions focusing on malaria prevention and the malaria RDT , diarrhea management, WASH, child nutrition, and community outreach and support. Trainers were from the national leve l (respondents mentioned IMA staff or representatives of government health programs), provincial capital (District Provincial Health Office (DPS) representatives and personnel representing different government programs like EPI or malaria) and the zonal of fices, and sessions lasted three to seven days. Respondents generally felt that the length of the trainings was appropriate, the trainers were competent and the content helpful, thus improving their knowledge and ability to provide care. Respondents also appreciated the per diem received during the trainings. In each health area, there had been a high turnover of RECOs ranging from three to five , and as a result many RECOs had not received all of the training. Reasons for leaving included lack of remune ration, the RECO had moved or died, or pursuit of studies. Two of the four health centers had been renovated, one was newly constructed, and no renovations had occurred in the f ourth . In this last site, the health workers claimed they had been promised that the building would be renovated. Three of the four centers had received solar kits , one of which reported that the solar panels did not function properly. A second site located in a more urban location relied on local electricity and did not use the solar panels they had received. Two sites had received a refrigerator to store vaccines; the other two sites had to obtain vaccines from nearby health centers where the refrigerator and solar panels functioned, with RECOs traveling to these health centers on days that CPS sessions were held to acquire the vaccines. Other equipment that respondents reported receiving included weighing scales for growth monitoring, communication aides, vaccination cards, and monitoring forms. All of the health cente rs reported regular shortages of both essential supplies such as syringes and vaccines, as well as medications. When medicine stock -outs ar ose, health workers would prescribe medications which could be purchased in private pharmacies or patients were requi red to go to other health centers. Respondents reported receiving fewer supplies and drugs than ordered, and even sometimes receiving empty boxes. Respondents also reported that frequent stock -outs of medicines affect health staff morale. 201 Respondents r eported that routine data we re collected through a health center registry that tracks patient information and a register maintained by the RECOs which monitors vaccine coverage of children under five years collected during household visits. Respondents mentioned that they follow ed several performance indicators, including the number of curative consultations and CPS participation. During monthly monitoring meetings attended by facility -based health personnel, CODESA members, and RECOs, information from the patient and community registers was compiled and reports submitted to the zonal offices. These records we re used to determine drugs and supplies needed for future child health activities. Medical provisions we re supposed to be sent every trimester , but re ports indicated that this schedule was determined by the availability of drugs stored in warehouses and the zonal distribution schedule, with medical supplies often received less frequently. Reports on supervision were varied, with supervision in Nor th Ubangi reported to have carried out by zonal staff, while in Maniema respondents reported being supervised by people stationed at the national, provincial , and zonal level. Zonal staff supervising activities in North Ubangi included the chief medical officer and nurse supervisor. While it was reported that supervision by zonal staff was supposed to be carried out twice monthly, respondents noted that these v isits occur red once a month or less frequently. Supervisors were reported to review records related to treatment of childhood illness, CPS and EPI, with supervisors providing feedback aimed at improv ing child health activities, as well as monitoring record s. Respondents in North Ubangi did not report being supervised by national or provincial level staff. In Maniema, respondents mentioned that they we re monitored by supervisors from the national, provincial , and zonal level, with respondents reporting that supervisions focus ed on EPI records, the number of vaccines stored, the way vaccines were refrigerated, storage and distribution of mosquito nets, and CPS activities, as well as the patient registry and receipt and use of pharmaceutical supplies. Respondents maintained that supervisions by national -level staff (e.g. IMA, DFID, or national program personnel) we re infrequent, while provincial staff ( IP, DPS , and government program representatives) conduct unannounced visits approximately e very trimester . Whil e the zonal nurse supervisor attempt ed to visit each month, it was reported that the frequency of these visits depended on the availability of a motorcycle and fuel. Supervisors were reported to identify and correct errors and motivate health workers to im prove the quality of the work. Some described supervision as a means to receive additional training and improve their knowledge, with many indicating that supervisory visits we re informative. Only in one of the high performing sites did health workers tal k about holding community meetings designed to sensitize community members about child health issues such as common illnesses and care for sick children, as well as the importance of growth monitoring. In this same site, it was mentioned that a breastfeedi ng support group was convened. In three sites, the hotline was available, and in two of these sites the hotline number was displayed. In one of these sites, phone networks were not functioning, and the hotline could only be accessed in a neighboring health station. In the final site , respondents were not aware of a hotline. No -one reported ever using the hotline, with some suggesting that they feared that there would be consequences if they used it. 202 Perceptions of the project Respondents were generally positive about the child health activities, stating that they we re able to provide curative and preventive care as designed by the ASSP program. In the site in North Ubangi where a new facility had been constructed, respondents s uggested that morale and work ethic had improved. Several respondents contended that the program led to increased health care access and reductions in child mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition, although they did not make reference to actual data. In the high performing site in Maniema, respondents were more critical, suggesting that the previous IP provided higher salaries/primes, transport, and an endowment fund to the health center, and medications were abundant. While some respondents praised the comm unity -based initiatives , they only referenced activities related to child nutrition. A general lack of formal behavioral change strategies appear ed to limit the effectiveness of community outreach and communication, with respondents particularly in North U bangi indicating that they face d a lot of resistance from community members to adhere to ASSP program child health strategies such as immunizations or accessing facility- based care, with residents often opting for traditional or religious healers. In addit ion, regular shortages of medications and essential supplies, including vaccinations, were reported to pose a problem, with respondents mentioning that stock -outs affect willingness to access facility -based services. RECOs indicated that they have not been provided with essential materials, such as a bag to carry their documents or bicycles to allow them to cover the long distances they had to travel to obtain vaccinations or carry out community outreach. Low salaries or lack of compensation were uniformly cited as problems across the health areas. Commonly reported challenges included: Regular shortages of medications or supplies (e.g. vaccinations, syringes, bed nets) Insufficient payment of facility- based health workers Lack of compensation/limited motiva tion for RECOs and CODESA members Promised materials such as bags have not been provided No solar power or refrigerator; reliance on another center for vaccines (high performing, North Ubangi) Lack of involvement of fathers in childcare Local beliefs align ed with traditional beliefs and practices, rather than modern care (North Ubangi) Lack of transport of complicated cases to referral facilities Recommendations/solutions to guide future activities Commonly made recommendations across the sites included pr oviding appropriate compensation for facility workers and motivation for community -based workers, as well as regular and adequate provision of medicines and critical supplies. Other recommendations included providing a bicycle for use by the RECOs and chil dren who need to be transferred to a reference hospital, ensuring continuous training of health workers, and reestablishing provision of Ready to Use Foods/Therapeutic Foods (RUTFs) in health 203 centers. Specific recommendations made by respondents working in one health center included building a separate room for medical treatment of sick children, posting a medical doctor to the health center, and providing a refrigerator and solar panel (high- performing N ord Ubangi). Caregivers of Malnourished Children Health care- seeking and treatment In three of four sites, most participants claimed that they first go to the health center for treatment when their children fall sick, with caregivers claiming that the facility -based health providers are well - qualifie d and trained to assess the child's condition and determine appropriate care to treat the illness. In the low performing facility in North Ubangi, where a new facility had been built, participants were also persuaded by the cleanliness of the facility. In the final site, the majority of participants stated that they first resort to self -medication using drugs at home or purchased in a pharmacy, and subsequently obtain traditional medications, and only if the condition becomes critical will they go to the health facility. A minority of participants in the other three health areas mentioned using religious healers or traditional medicines, particularly if biomedical treatment was not effective and spiritually based illnesses are suspected, or buying medications in the local pharmacy, especially if money is limited. Barriers to care -seeking in health facilities included distance (most travel by foot) and road conditions, lack of money (Maniema), concerns about insecurity or having to deal with police en route, and difficulties in carrying the child long distances. In the low performing site in Maniema, respondents also mentioned lack of medications or the fact that health personnel we re often absent from the health center. Mothers were generally reported as the primary decision- makers related to care- seeking or providing medications at home. If the child require d care at night or the condition wa s considered serious, fathers we re more likely to be involved. Perceptions of the health center treatm ent and quality of care varied across the sites. In the high performing site in North Ubangi, services were highly appreciated, with health providers reported to ask questions about the child's health, condition, and any medication s/he may be taking, be friendly, courteous and respectful , explain how to treat the illness at home , and provide effective treatment. A different scenario was described in the other sites, with caregivers indicating that some providers we re friendly, while others were described a s abrupt, disrespectful and rude. In the low performing site in Maniema, health providers were generally described as lacking politesse and compassion, and frequently berating patients. In this site, the head nurse was drunk during our interactions. Resp ondents reported that patients were treated according to a queue with only caregivers in one area in North Ubangi complaining of a long waiting time. Caregivers indicated that an initial physical assessment involving checking the eyes, mouth, and abdomen w as conducted and the child's temperature was taken, and lab tests may have been done to determine the illness. Most participants stated that they we re given a prescription to purchase medications, with some complaining that treatment fees were supposed to cover drug costs. While health providers were generally perceived to be capable and well trained to treat child illnesses, workers in the low performing zone in North Ubangi were sometimes described as poorly qualified and frequently ineffective in treating illnesses, with some 204 speculating that because they did not do lab tests they were perhaps less able to identify the illness. Except in the site where a new building had been constructed, the space where children were treated was described as narrow and crowded, unclean, and very public. Children were examined on the same bed used for adults, with several indicating that these beds are frequently dirty. Participants reported that fees were posted, with care for young children at 1,500 Cf. However, in the remote health area in Maniema, participants admitted to being illiterate and thus unable to understand the fee schedule. In North Ubangi, caregivers indicated that they were permitted to receive care on credit or pay in installments and that they s old crop s to obtain cash or other family members may have contribute d to costs. In contrast, in Maniema, payment was required before treatment; in these sites, participants complained that the displayed fees we re not necessarily followed, with costs reaching as much as 15,000 Cf . While most participants expressed satisfaction that the hea lth workers effectively treat ed childhood illnesses, dissatisfaction was reported in relation to the failure to follow listed health care fees, the fact that medications had to be purchased, the frequent rude demeanor of the health workers, and, in Maniema, that the health workers w ould only treat if payment was provided upfront. Some recommendations are as follows: Construct a health facility with adequate space and equipment (high- performing N ord Ubangi, low-performing Maniema) Ensure that all health centers have adequate laboratory facilities Provide adequate essential medications to centers; eliminate prescriptions Provide a bicycle to RECOs to transport medications and vaccines Provide separate examination beds for adult and child patients Ensure that health workers are compassionate and accountable Provide salaries to health worker, which will improve quality of care Equip facilities with supplies such as bed, mattresses, mosquito nets, etc. Preschool consultations Most participants claimed to have attended CPS on a m onthly basis starting soon after the child's birth, with the majority stating that they participate d to ensure that their children were vaccinated and thus protected against disease. Fewer caregivers mentioned attending CPS to monitor their children's grow th and learn about child feeding. Many caregivers admitted to having stopped participating in CPS consultations after the child reached nine months and was fully vaccinated, noting that they return ed to the health center when immunization boosters wer e available. In the high performing zones, caregivers reported that community RECOs promote d the importance of attending CPS, while in the low performing sites they stated that it was the health workers who encourage d participation. Caregivers reported that REC Os often led educational sessions during CPS consultations providing information on 205 topics such as the importance of rapid care -seeking to the health center, exclusive breastfeeding, complementary child feeding, the importance of using bed nets, handwashing, and immunizations. Caregivers indic ated that they trave led to CPS on foot. Cited barriers to attending CPS included lack of money, lack of clothes for the mother and child (North Ubangi), distance, and bandits or police who might accost or harass them on the road. In one site in each province, a major barrier was related to the fact that vaccines were stored in another health center several kilometers away and, as a result, vaccines were not always available. Caregivers were generally satisfied wit h the CPS visits, with many underlining the importance of immunizations which are provided for free as part of the initial 500 CPS fee. Some mentioned that during CPS, children can also be treated for illnesses. Other benefits included knowledge gained dur ing health education sessions. Perceived problems included that vaccines we re not available in the health center (high- performing N ord Ubangi, low -performing Maniema) and thus they ha d to wait a long time to receive the vaccine, the place where CPS is held was cramped, and benches for seating we re inadequate. Recommendations regarding CPS included: Renovate the area where CPS is held so that it is bigger and can accommodate more people Assure that adequate benches are available Equip the facility with a r efrigerator where vaccines can be conserved (high -performing Nord Ubangi, low -performing Maniema) Provide RECOs with bicycles, which will make it easier to pick up medicines and vaccines Provide motivation to the RECOs Other activities Across sites, the majority of focus group participants maintained that they had not received a home visit from the RECOs related to child health. When asked about the RECOs community activities, many stated that their main role was to promote immunization of young children, with RECOs in the low performing site in North Ubangi reported to have used a megaphone to convey messages. In all sites, respondents indicated that RECOs sometimes hold meetings after Sunday church w here different topics including those related to health such as handwashing, exclusive breastfeeding, child feeding, and malnutrition were discussed; however, many participants admitted to never participating in these meetings. Generally, participants gave the impression that RECOs ha d little visibility in communities, except for activities related to child nutrition. In North Ubangi, the vast majority of participants received a mosquito net during prenatal or growth monitoring consultations or directly after childbirth. In contrast, in Maniema participants claimed to have not received mosquito nets since the time that Merlin was the implementing NGO in the health zone. Some stated that when they asked for bed nets, the health providers claimed that they did not have bed nets available. 206 In both sites in North Ubangi, caregivers reported that a mass campaign involving vaccinations, vitamin A distribution, rapid screening for malaria, and provision of deworming medication had been held in June 2017. However, in Maniema, only groups from the hi gh performing zone reported that a mass campaign took place. Participants across all sites were not aware of community- based curative outreach sites ( site de soins communautaire). Some caregivers from the high performing zone in North Ubangi were aware of the hotline, which they believed was available to call authorities in Kinshasa when equipment was not working. Participants in other group discussions were unaware that a hotline existed. Caregivers uniformly stated that there was no assistance provided fo r vulnerable population members who had to pay the same health care fees required of other residents. iv. Limitations Timing of baseline survey: The baseline survey was conducted in April 2014, well after ASSP child health activities had begun in April 2013. Thus, 2014 baseline estimates may not reflect the situation prior to ASSP intervention but may provide a slightly improved representation of t he in- country situation, and potentially underestimate true program impact. Seasonality: With regard to childhood morbidity , available evidence suggests variation in disease prevalence according to season and pathogen (Armah et al., 1994; Findley, et al., 2017; Shah et al., 2016) . In the DRC, one generally expects an increase in diarrhea incidence (due to water contamination) and an increase in malaria incidence (due to mosquito proliferation) during the rainy season, but an increased pneumonia frequency during the dry season (due to a relative drop of tempe rature and an increased incidence of respiratory tract infections). Th is pattern can be confounded by several factors, including disease outbreaks , however, and the impact of seasonality on childhood illness burden in the DRC is somewhat less clear, due to limited published evidence on the diverse pathogens responsible for infectious disease in -country. A lthough additional a nalyses of childhood illness burden in ASSP areas within southern and northern Maniema (result not shown here) indicated no statistical ly significant differences at the p <0.05 level , the potential bias resulting from seasonal variations is acknowledged. Service interruptions: Since community education and home visits were not reliant on ASSP funding following completion of training , it is not expected that the project's service interruptions impacted rates of childhood morbidity. However, t he provision of medicines , vaccines and malaria commodities (e.g. ITNs) may have been impacted; medication stock -outs are discussed in Chapter 8. Power to detect differences in outcomes: As described in Chapter 2, the analysis was powered to detect differences among children under five overall. It was not powered to detect differences between sub- groups. Nevertheless, some differences in the sub- analyses were found. 207 v. Discussion All in all, results from t he fully -adjusted DID models suggest that the ASSP program was successful in reducing the likelihood of symptoms of ARI and fever among children under five. There were no statistically significant program impacts on morbidity from other childhood illnesses (i.e. diarrhea, malaria or anemia ), treatment of childhood illness or immunization coverage. In these analyses, symptoms of ARI were used as a proxy for pneumonia and considered present if a mother self -reported that her child had a cough accompanied by s hort, rapid, or difficult breathing. While the limitation of using subjective data ( not validated by any medical examination) to determine disease prevalence is noted, several factors support the plausibility of findings and the likelihood that the observed decline was indeed attributable to the presence of the ASSP program . First of all, underlying determinants of morbidity from pneumonia include poverty, under -nutrition, poor hygiene and deprived home environments , with e vidence -based preventive strategies often targeting scale -up of immunization coverage for measles and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), nutritional interventions supporting breastfeeding promotion, and environmental innovations such as reduced household air pollution and adequate WASH infrastructure (Bhutta et al., 2013) . ASSP investments included roll -out of vaccination campaigns to support full immunization coverage (i.e. BCG, DPT /HepB/Hib , Polio, and measles), implementation of WASH activities to improve hygiene and excreta disposal, introduction and adoption of clean cookstoves, initiation of home gardens to encourage dietary diversity and better nutrition, and BCC activities to promote h ealthier behaviors . Qualitative results suggest that BCC activities were informal and limited ; that drugs were not readily available, with frequent shortages of essential medicines, supplies , and vaccines; and that home visits were seldom. However, it is p lausible that while implementation of individual interventions was not as far -reaching or strong as hoped, the comprehensive nature of the ASSP program and the combined effect of various strategies targeting different risk factors (e.g. nutrition, immuniza tion, sanitation) could have resulted in the observed decline. Indeed, results from WASH activities (Chapter 10) note significant program impacts related to improved sources of household drinking water and improved sanitation. In addition, while research suggests that vaccine effectiveness is dependent on proper vaccine storage, distribution, and maintenance of cold chain requirements (Doshi et al., 2015) , qualitative results inform that supervisory visits that focus on EPI records, the number of vaccines stored and the way vaccines were refrigerated, allowing for motivation to improve quality of work, additional training and improve d knowledge . Accordingly, ASSP's commitment to improving cold chain maintenance via supportive supervision in addition to provision of solar technology and refrigerators could have supported improved quality of vaccines, boosting vaccine effectiveness and thereby contr ibuting to reduced disease prevalence, in spite of lower than anticipated vaccination coverage rates. Finally, given that fever is a common presenting symptom in respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, the statistically significant decline in fever preval ence - of similar magnitude to the observed decline in prevalence of symptoms of ARI - suggests that the DID effect estimate is true. Although a statistically significant program impact on diarrhea prevalence was not detected , descriptive data suggested a reduction in two-week point prevalence rates of diarrhea in ASSP areas, at endline compared to baseline - although thi s difference was also not statistically significant. Conversely, while 208 trends suggested a significant increase in malaria parasite prevale nce at endline, compared to baseline, in both ASSP areas and non- ASSP areas, the magnitude of the absolute change was larger in the latter, suggesting that the ASSP program may have positively influenced malaria morbidity among children aged 6- 59 months. A s a known complication of malaria, trends in anemia prevalence mirrored the results for malaria, as were expected. Specifically, descriptive data indicated a significantly greater prevalence of anemia at endline compared to baseline in both ASSP areas and non -ASSP areas , with a greater absolute change in disease burden in non- ASSP area. Th e fully -adjusted DID model s indicated that the re were no statistically significant ASSP program impacts on either malaria or anemia prevalence among children 6- 59 months . There was little consistency between results from quantitative analyses and DHIS2 data. In the case of diarrhea prevalence, DHIS2 data indicate d a higher absolute burden of childhood diarrhea in 2017, with rates as high as 28 percent in Nord Ubangi. With regard to symptoms of ARI, DHIS2 data also indicate d a higher absolute burden of suspected childhood pneumonia in 2017, ranging from 25 percent in Tshopo to 31 percent in Nord Ubangi and 32 percent in Maniema. Furthermore, DHIS2 data suggest ed modest fluctuations between Quarter 1 2016 and Quarter 4 2017, with a trend toward increasing prevalence of diarrhea and suspected pneumonia over time. DHIS2 data for 2014 were not available and there were no DHIS2 data on fever prevalence among children under -five. However, baseline survey point estimates of morbidity from childhood illnesses all align ed with 2013/14 D emographic and Health Survey (D HS) estima tes (i.e. 17 percent prevalence of diarrhea in the 2 weeks prior to the survey, among children under 5 years of age ; 7 percent prevalence of symptoms of ARI in the 2 weeks prior to the survey, among children under 5 years of age ; 30 percent prevalence of f ever in the 2 weeks prior to the survey, among children under 5 years of age ) (Minist\u00e8re du Plan et Suivi de la Mise en de la R\u00e9volution de la Modernit\u00e9 (MPSMRM), 2014) . For malaria prevalence, quantitative results were s omewhat consistent with DHIS2 data, which indicate d a high burden of malaria among children that generally increased between 2016 and 2017, ultimately ranging from 61 percent in Maniema to 74 percent in Tshopo to 120 percent in Nord Ubangi. DHIS2 data for 2014 were not available and there were no DHIS2 dat a on anemia prevalence among children aged 6-59 months . However, baseline survey point estimates for both malaria and anemia were somewhat comparable with 2013/14 DHS estimates (i.e. 31 percent children tested positive for the malaria rapid diagnostic test ; 60 percent prevalence of anemia, among children aged 6- 59 months ) (Minist\u00e8re du Plan et Suivi de la Mise en de la R\u00e9volution de la Modernit\u00e9 (MPSMRM), 2014) . While data suggest that the ASSP project may have had a significant and positive impact on reducing child morbidity due to symptoms of ARI and fever , however, there were no statistically significant impact s on the uptake of curative interventions for such illnesses. Indeed, trends between endline and baseline suggested a decline in use of ORS and/or RHF for diarrhea, a decline in the use of antibiotics for pneumonia, as w ell as a decline in treatment -seeking behavior, with significantly fewer mothers reporting seeking treatment from a health facility or health provider for their children with symptoms of ARI and/or fever. Qualitative findings from in- depth interviews and f ocus group discussions help shed light on results regarding treatment of childhood illnesses , with data indicating that lack of formal behavior change strategies limited the effectiveness of communication efforts to sensitize parents and 209 caregivers about t he importance of curative health service use for child illnesses. Qualitative data further suggest that willingness to access facility -based services was affected by drug stock -outs, perceived unavailability and cost of medications, failure of health cente rs to adhere to listed user fees, long distances to the hospital and challenges navigating hard- to-travel routes, as well as cultural practices which favored traditional remedies and/or religious healing. Another deterrent to health- care seeking , which eme rged from the qualitative findings , was the quality of care received at some health centers, with facilities reported to be crowded, unclean, and lacking privacy while providers were often described as lacking politesse and compassion. Furthermore, p artici pants across all sites reported not being aware of CCSs which plausibly limited their seeking care at these facilities. Finally, in assessing the lack of impact on the treatment of childhood illnesses, the World Bank PBF initiative being implemented in non- ASSP areas should be borne in mind, as results from fully- adjusted DID models indicate a significant association of this PBF project with increased use of therapeutic interventions (i.e. ORS and/or RHF for diarrhea; antibiotics for pneumonia) and the goal s of this project were likely to have influenced changes in child health outcomes in non- ASSP areas . Findings from quantitative analyses were again compared with DHIS2 data. Despite consistency between quantitative and qualitative findings, there little c onsistency with 2017/2018 (endline) DHIS2 data ; DHIS2 data from 2014 (baseline) were not available. Specifically , DHIS2 data indicated that a higher absolute proportion of children receiv ed ORS or RHF for diarrhea (86 percent - 96 percent ) and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia (90 percent - 99 percent ), with modest declines between 2016- 2017 in all sampling domains except Tshopo (where improvements were observed). Similarly, DHIS2 data indicate d that a higher absolute proportion of children receiv ed antimalarials for fever (96 percent - 98 percent ), with mini mal changes between 2016- 2017. Notably , baseline survey point estimates all align with 2013/14 DHS estimates (i.e. 42 percent of children who had diarrhea received ORS packets or recommended home solution; 29 percent of children who had fever treated with antimalarials ; advice or treatment sought from an establishment or healthcare provider for 42 percent of children with symptoms of ARI and 40 percent for cases of fever ) (Minist\u00e8re du Plan et Suivi de la Mise en de la R\u00e9volution de la Modernit\u00e9 (MPSMRM), 2014) . With regard to child immunizations, the ASSP program appear ed to have had no statistically significant impact on vaccination coverage, with trends suggesting that a smaller proportion of children received all specified vaccinations at endline compared to baseline, in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas. Again, qualitative evidence proves useful in understanding these findings, with data indicating that home visits to promote uptake of child health services were infrequent, while shortages of essential supplies such as vaccines and syringes were regular, and limited availability and/or sharing of solar power or refrigerators necessitated reliance on other centers for v accines. Qualitative data also informed of challenges in Nord Ubangi , with respondents noting that lack of formal BBC strategies limited communication effectiveness and resulted in great resistance from community members to make use of health services in general . Notably, however, immunization coverage r esults from these analyses are discrepant from DHIS2 data. DHIS 2 data indicate that the percentage of 1- year -old children vaccinated against measles was high at baseline (>85 percent ) and has been increasing up until endline , with over 90 percent of children under 1 (in Maniema, Nord Ubangi, and Tshopo) vaccinated against measles. Survey data, on the other hand, 210 indicate that full immunization coverage was low at baseline (43.7 percent ) and declined at endli ne (31.3 percent ) - although this change was not statistically significant. Full immunization coverage includes BCG, three doses of DPT, three doses of Polio (excluding the dose given immediately after birth), and measles. When analyses were limited to mea sles only, to allow greater comparability with DHIS2 data, results indicated baseline measles vaccine coverage of 73.7 percent among kids 12 -23 months of age, in ASSP areas, compared to 51.2 percent coverage at endline ( p<0.001). Further, there was no statistically significant program impact on receipt of measles vaccination among children 12- 23 months of age. Of note, survey data and DHIS2 data used different denominators, with the latter based on children under 1 year of age. For the survey data, analyses focused on children 12- 23 months who received all specified vaccines at any time before the survey, as recommended in the Guide to DHS Statistics (Rutstein & Rojas, 2006) . Notably, additional analyses explored receipt of all basic immunizations among children 0- 11 months of age and found similar results, with low coverage rates that did not show any statistically significant differences over time. Aside from the use of different denominators, however, it is generally accepted that, although neither facility nor survey data are perfect , a high- quality household survey with an adequate national sample provides the best estimate of immunization coverage (Worl d Health Organization, 2011) . For service statistics , key challenges include incomplete and inaccurate reporting of the number of vaccinations and uncertainty about the true size of the denominator (World Health Organization, 2011) . On the other hand, household surveys collect information on the vaccination status of children by asking the mother to provide the child's health card and copying the vaccination dates from the card (World Health Organization, 2011) . In this case, less than 10 percent of women were able to produce a vaccination card and data on child vaccinations received was largely dependent on mother's self -report, which is subject to recall bias that is also likely to increase with the length of the recall period. In considering possible explanations for the discrepancy between survey and DHIS2 dat a, it is also noted that service statistics regarding immunization -related activities may include persons from neighboring health areas who travel to participate in Semaine Africaine de la Vaccination or other mobile campaigns around which the immunization activities were organized. These persons would not have been captured during household surveys but could have potentially been included in the DHIS2 numerators (although the denominator would have stayed the same). In assessing ASSP project performance related to goals of improving child health, lack of impact may be explained by differences in the strength of implementation in different regions and among different groups . For example, sub- analyses indicate that among the wealthier groups (i.e. the top 60 percent wealth quintile) , improvements were observed in the prevalence of symptoms of ARI, prevalence of fever, receipt of ORS or RHF for treatment of diarrhea, receipt of antimalarials for fever, and receipt of all basic immunizations. In Maniema/Tshopo, sub- analyses revealed si milar gains in areas related to symptoms of ARI, receipt of antimalarials for fever, and receipt of all basic immunizations. In keeping with evidence of differential impact among wealthier sub- groups, throughout qualitative interviews, caregivers uniformly mentioned that there was no assistance provided for vulnerable population members , for example, who had to pay the same health care fees required of other residents. These results support utility of a mid- point evaluation to assess study progress and dire ct changes in the project approach and implementation as needed. Finally, reports from qualitative interviews speak to 211 the need for formative research to better understand cultural preferences which affect receptivity and uptake of program messages and ser vices. 212 References Armah, G.

Overview of the ASSP approach As part of the larger package of interventions, ASSP implement ed a component aimed at combating malnutrition in children under five. Child nutrition activities were not part of the original business plan but were included after experts participating in initial field assessments insisted that child nutrition be part of the ASSP program . The m ain goals of the nutrition approach include 1) to identify malnourished children early before the condition becomes severe and 2) to empower caregivers to care for their children with locally available produce . ASSP's primary strategies to accomplish this are improving facility -based care, community screening of malnourished children, promotion of home gardening, and proper child feeding practices among care givers of malnourished children. Improving facility -based care . In the DRC, s everely malnourished children with medical complications are referred to a reference hospital where they are supposed to be provided with Ready to Use Foods/Therapeutic Foods (RUTFs) and therapeutic milk. Children severely malnourished without complications can receive treatment in one of the three reference heal th centers providing Ambulatory Therap eutic Nutrition Unit ( Unit\u00e9 Nutritionnelle Th\u00e9rapeutique Ambulatoire) services in each health zone. Other children who present to the health facility with moderate malnutrition have their status confirmed using anthropometric measurements and are medically treated. F acility -based nurses counsel caregivers to follow ANJE ( Alimentation de Nourrisons et Jeunes Enfants ), an internationally recognized model promoting best feeding practices relative to the age of the c hild. Key messages conveyed through the program involve exclusive breastfeeding up to six months, preparation of enriched porridge made from ingredients grown in home gardens or purchased in local markets, providing children with a balanced diet , and adding a supplemental meal each day. During the first two years of the program, ASSP vehicles were used to transport RUTF s in the form of plumpy nut provided by UNICEF from health zone offices to health centers located in the program health zones for distributi on to caregivers of malnourished children. Community screening. The child nutrition approach aims to have ten RECOs per health area, two nurses from each health center , and one nurse from each maternity receive training. Malnourished children may be ident ified in health facilities or by RECOs who use middle upper arm circumference measurements to screen children at the community level. The goal wa s for each RECO to screen 20 children per month, referring those children with a middle upper arm circumference (MUAC ) under 125mm to the health center where anthropometric measures we re taken by a nurse to determine whether the child was eligible for enrollment. RECOs we re expected to enroll two newly eligible children in the program monthly , which program organiz ers and RECOs believed was a reasonable caseload based on the scheduling of household visits (five visits for each child spaced out at two -week intervals over three months). I nitially, there was not a systematic approach employed to ensure that all childre n living in health areas were screened; rather, the schedule was supposed to be determined by the health area RECOs, head nurse , and partners involved. As a result, program coordinators were unable to ascertain what percentage of children 6- 59 months of age were being screened and the frequency of 270 screening. Present changes are being made to try to ensure that all children between 6- 59 months of age are screened four times annually. Those children identified as malnourished by community volunteers we re re ferred to the nearest health center where their health and nutritional status was assessed. Nurses carr ied out examinations which were supposed to include anthropometric measurements and a physical examination, with nurses responsible for providing medicat ions such as mebendazole, vitamin A, iron, folic acid, and antibiotics as needed. Once a malnourished child was enrolled in the program, the RECO and facility -based nurses were to work with the child caregivers on a variety of skills, including how to plant a mixed garden comprised of perennial and short -term green leafy vegetables and fruit trees , how to prepare an enriched porridge, and when and how much to feed a malnourished child, as well as danger signs to look for as the child is treated. RECOs were supposed to visit each enrolled child's household five times over a three- month period, which given the enrollment schedule mean t they should make ten household visits per month , assuming that two new cases we re identified monthly . At the outset of the project, this was determined to be a reasonable amount of time that RECOs could commit to household visits given other work activities (e.g. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene ( WASH) , family planning, vaccinations, growth monitoring visit s, etc.) they were engaged in through the health center. Nurses we re also encouraged to visit households of malnourished children whose arm circumference measurement d id not increas e after two household visits . During household visits, progress information was recorded, including information on relapse, death , and dropout rates, as well as counseling on child feeding and gardening. The nutritional status of other children in the household between 6 -59 months of age was also supposed to be assessed. If a child did not improve after two weeks (as determined by upper arm circumference measurements and/or the presence of edema or other illness), the child was referred back to the facility for further evaluation. Home gardening and nutrition education . The project promote d home gardening as a way to have vegetables and fruits readily available year -round for child feeding or to sell for cash to buy other foods to improve children's diets. Model gardens we re supposed to be grown adjacent to the health centers and homes of RECOs, with the project encouraging gardening local vegetables (e.g. amaranth, sweet potato, spinach, red sorrel) as well as non- indigenous plants such as moringa and c haya ( a drought - tolerant plant that produces green leaves year -round which are cooked in a similar way to cassava leaves) . The project also promotes planting fruit trees such as papaya and avocado. Initially, seeds and cuttings of moringa and chaya were given to the RECOs to plant in the health center and home demonstration gard ens. Subsequently, RECOs we re supposed to distribute plant seeds and cuttings of moringa and c haya that had been grown locally in the demonstration gardens to caregivers of children enrolled in the approach. As part of the nutrition approach, education ses sions on child nutrition we re to be carried out by RECOs, perhaps with assistance by nurses, during growth monitoring sessions in the health center. RECOs were also tasked with conducting two demonstrations on how to make an enriched porridge in the homes of families enrolled in the program, with the first demonstration designed to teach the caregiver how to make the porridge and the second to observe and assess whether the caregiver underst ood how to make the porridge appropriately. 271 Project monitoring. At the outset of the project, monitoring and evaluation involved supervision of activities by provincial health officials and the zonal community animators (referred to as ACs) and monthly reporting based on the compilation of information collected through individual monitoring forms of malnourished children and RECO registers . Children who did not recover after the three -month period were encouraged to stay in the program . No monitoring was done on children who receive d program support and recover ed from m alnutrition . Training, support, and supervision. Starting in 2013, a series of trainings w ere carried out across the ASSP target provinces which involved training program implement ers, health professionals at the provincial and zonal levels, and facil ity-based nurses on the approach, followed by subsequent training of RECOs. During the training, RECOs were supposed to receive basic work materials such as counseling tools, registers, monitoring forms, and a bag to carry documents. Gardening tools, which were purchased by the implementing partners and delivered to the health zones responsible for getting the materials to the health area RECOs, were intended to only be distributed at the outset, with the vision that once home gardening was widely accepted, people would use their own gardening tools. Preliminary project activities in Tshopo and Maniema showed that the first group of RECOs recruited and trained did not meet the program selection criteria and were not fulfilling their work responsibilities. Following \"revitaliz ation\" of CODESA involvement, which started in the second year of the program and was gradually rolled out across the target provinces, active and new RECOs were identified following a more democratic and rigorous selection process and a dditional training was conducted including certification of successfully trained RECO s. Other adjustments made in the project approach involved the inclusion and briefing of a RECO coach to oversee RECO routine activities, train RECOs when needed, and prov ide a link to the health center staff; the training of the MCZ ( M\u00e9decin Chef de Zone ) on nutrition hiring of ASSP -supported AC's trained in agronomy to carry out visits each trimester to all health areas; and the institution of formative supervision designed to entail a more intensive approach to monitoring of field activities and capacity building of technical skills required of RECOs and health zone staff implementing the approach. More recently, efforts were focused on systematizing scree ning and engaging community opinion leaders in nutrition activities. Specifically , a more formalized screening approach has been implemented, which involves community mapping to determine the number of children 6- 59 months in each village as well as traini ng and engaging local women participating in the Groupe de Soutien (support group) ANJE to take MUAC measurements to assist with screening for malnutrition. The revised strategy aims to ensure that every child between 6- 59 months is screened four times a year. According to ASSP staff, the nutrition approach is constantly evolving based on field realities and needs. ASSP activities prior to the baseline survey. According to ASSP's quarterly reports, prior to the baseline survey t he ASSP nutrition team, in conjunction with the National Nutrition Department (PRONANUT) staff, trained a core group of trainers in infant and young child feeding, case management of families with malnourished children, and home gardening. Through a series of trainings, nurses and community relays were then trained by this core group, using a very hands -on approach involving mak ing raised bed 272 gardens, one-on-one counseling during home visits , measuring arm circumference of children, and filling out the case management forms used to track growth. A series of briefings were held to ensure that one relay from each health area thoroughly understood how to complete the home visit forms and would be able to \"coach\" the other relays in their health area. ASSP routine nutrition data. ASSP's routine monitoring system reported annual numbers of screenings conducted through the nutrition program, numbers of children referred to the health center for malnutrition, the proxy prevalence rate of malnutrition (referrals/screenings) , and the rate at which children who were referred to the health center recovered. This data was disaggregated by health zone. \"Malnutrition\" and \"recovery\" were based on MUAC measurement. In Nord Ubangi, 10.7 percent of screenings were positive for malnutrition. Of these , 65.1 percent recovered, and 34.9 percent did not. Based on their screenings ASSP found the pr evalence of malnutrition to be lower in Maniema/Tshopo at 7.4 percent. Overall, a mong malnourished children identified, nearly 80 percent recovered. At the beginning of the project, the number of times that individual children were screened was not tracked . Therefore, it is possible that a single child was screened multiple times per year while another child was not screened at all. The system of systematic screening introduced later in the project (with the goal of screening every child four times per year ) was not yet operating at the time of the endline survey. The number of children who tested positive who actually presented at a health facility was also not tracked. ii. Quantitative findings This section presents findings from the baseline and endline modules on child nutrition status including stunting, wasting, and underweight, as well as breastfeeding indicators such as initiation and prevalence. Dietary diversity is also discussed. Child nutritional status In surveyed households, a ll children under five were weighed, measured , and assessed for the presence of edema , with caretakers' consent. For the purpose of this analysis, only children age 6- 59 months we re included. Stunting, wasting, underweight rates were calculated. Stunting, or low height -for-age, results from poor nutrition and/or repeated infection in children. Wasting, or low weight -for-height, is an indicator of inadequate nutrition over a relatively short time period. Underweight, calculated as low weight -for-age, encompasses both stunting and wasting. Figure 6.2 displays the degree of ASSP impact on nutritional outcomes both overall and for subsets of the population (based on sex, wealth, and sampling domain). Results of the sub -analyses show that for all subgroups examined, the ASSP project had either a negative or no impact on the nutritio nal status of children. 273 Figure 6.2 .

White shading indicates that no impact was detect ed. Figure 6.3 shows the prevalence of stunting, wasting , and underweight at baseline and endline separately for ASSP non- ASSP areas. Rates of stunting were \"very high\" across both waves (IPC Global Partners, 2016) . Rates of wasting indicated that both ASSP and non- ASSP areas were experiencing moderate/borderline food insecurity at baseline and endline, although rates decreased in both areas (IPC Global Partners, 2016) . 274 Figure 6.3 . Prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight among children a ge 6 -59 months in ASSP and non- ASSP areas by year. *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels is statistically significant at p<0.05. Stunting Results of the fully adjusted difference -in-difference model ( Table 6.1 ) showed that after controlling for relevant variables, rates of stunting increased significantly more in ASSP areas than in non- ASSP areas. Household -level characteristics that appeared to be protective against stunting belonged to the highest wealth quintile and non- ownership of agricultural land. Protective child- level characteristics included being female, younger , and larger size at birth. Maternal characteristics that appeared to be protective against stunting were education ( primary or higher) and ma ternal age (35 -49 years ). The project resulted in worsened rates of stunting for both subgroups of females and males (Tables 6.2 and 6.3) , for those in the two poorest wealth quintiles (Table 6.4) , and for those in Maniema/Tshopo (Table 6.7) (Figure 6.2). Table 6.8 displays the prevalence of stunting by selected characteristics at baseline and endline within ASSP and non- ASSP areas. Overall, r ates of s tunting increased significantly in ASSP areas. Stunting also increased in non- ASSP areas; however, this change was not statistically significant. At baseline in ASSP areas, the prevalence of stunting was higher in Nord Ubangi than Maniema/Tshopo. However, by endline , the prevalence stunting in Maniema/Tshopo had increased significantly while Nord/Sud Ubangi stayed relatively stable. At endline, the prevalence of stunting in ASSP areas was higher in Maniema/Tshopo than in Nord Ubangi. Rates of stunting de creased significantly in non- ASSP areas of Maniema/Tshopo. The majority of the increase in stunting in ASSP areas occurred in rural areas, where stunting increased from 44.1 percent to 56.2 percent. Further, rates of stunting increased for both males and females within ASSP areas. Although males exhibited higher rates of stunting at both baseline and endline (49.9 275 percent and 56.3 percen t, respectively), by endline females had nearly closed the gap, increasing from a prevalence of 36.4 percent to 52.5 percent . Wasting The fully adjusted model (Table 6. 9) did not detect a significant impact of the ASSP project on rates of wasting . Househo ld-level characteristics that appeared to protect against wasting included being located in Nord/Sud Ubangi or in an area in which the World Bank -supported Performance Based Financing (PBF). In terms of child- level characteristics, larger size at birth was associated with a lower probability of wasting. Ascending age also appeared to be associated with a lower probability of wasting with the exception of the oldest age bracket (48- 59 months) which was more likely than the next -oldest age bracke t to experience wasting. The sex of the child did not appear to have an impact, nor did the maternal characteristics included in the model. The project worsened rates of wasting for the subgroup of those in the poorest wealth quintiles ( Table 6.12 and Figu re 6.2). Overall, rates of w asting decreased in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas but the change was only significant in non- ASSP areas. Table 6. 16 shows the prevalence of wasting by selected characteristics. ASSP areas did not experience significant changes in rates of wasting within Nord Ubangi or Maniema/Tshopo or in rural or peri -urban areas. Rates of wasting decreased significantly in the non-ASSP areas of Maniema/Tshopo and in rural areas. There were no significant changes within the subsets of males or females in ASSP areas. In non- ASSP areas, the prevalence of wasting decreased within both sexes, although it decreased more for females. Underweight Again, results of the fully adjusted difference -in-difference model (Table 6. 17) did not show that ASSP had a significant impact on the prevalence of underweight . Children in Maniema/Tshopo had a higher probability of experiencing underweight, as did male children and older children. Higher birth weight appeared protective against underweight, as did having a mother who had completed secondary school compared to those with no formal education. The ASSP project worsened rates of underweight in Maniema/Tshopo ( Table 6.23 and Figure 6.2). Overall, underweight rates did not change signifi cantly in either ASSP or non- ASSP areas between baseline and endline. Table 6.24 shows the prevalence of underweight by selected characteristics. There was no change in underweight rates within ASSP areas in Nord Ubangi between baseline and endline; however, underweight rates increased significantly in ASSP areas of Maniema/Tshopo. As was the case with stunting, underweight was higher in Nord Ubangi at baseline, but higher in Maniema/Tshopo at Key Points Rates of stunting increased significantly in ASSP areas compared with non- ASSP areas (p<0.05) . Overall rates of wasting and underweight did not change significantly in ASSP areas. For all subgroups examined, the ASSP project had a negative or no impact on the nutritional status of children. Stunting and wasting have worsened in Maniema/Tshopo since 2014. 276 endline in ASSP -supported areas. non- ASSP areas in Nord/Sud Ubangi did not experience significant differences in underweight. In contrast to the findings on stunting, t here were no significant changes in peri -urban or rural ar eas in either ASSP or non -ASSP areas. The prevalence of underweight increased in both males and females in ASSP areas, although only the change in females was significant. There was no significant change by sex in non- ASSP areas. Middle- Upper Arm Circumference MUAC was measured at endline only. Overall, the prevalence of a MUAC of 12.5 cm or less was 15 percent in ASSP areas. The prevalence was 10.3 percent in ASSP areas Nord Ubangi and 17.5 percent in Maniema/Tshopo. This compared with an overall prevalence of 12.1 percent in non- ASSP areas (13.1 percent in Sud Ubangi and 8.7 Maniema/Tshopo). There were no significant differences between ASSP and non- ASSP areas with regards to MUAC at endline. Robustness checks The baseline and endline surveys were conducted in different months, creating the potential that differences due to the seasonality of malnutrition indicators may influence the results of the impact evaluation. This was primarily a concern in southern Maniema, which experienced the rainy seaso n during the baseline survey and the dry season at endline. Therefore, the endline prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight was compared between ASSP areas of northern and southern Maniema. There were no significant differences in any of the three malnutrition indicators between the rainy northern region and the dry southern region of Maniema (results not shown). As a robustness check, the difference -in-difference models for stunting, wasting, and underweight were estimated with the inclusion of a variable indicating the straight -line distance between the child's household and the nearest governmental health facili ty. There were no changes in the direction or significance of the impact of ASSP in any of the models, and the distance variable was never significant. There were also no significant differences in children's distance to the health facility between ASSP an d non-ASSP areas at baseline or endli ne (results not shown). Child feeding practices Mothers were asked to report the types of foods and liquids (apart from breastmilk) that each of her children under five living with her in the household consumed during the day and night preceding the module . These foods were categorized into seven food groups: 1) grains, roots, and tubers, 2) legumes and nuts, 3) dairy products, 4) flesh foods, 5) eggs, 6) vitamin- A rich fruits and vegetables, and 7) other fruits and vegetables (Indicators for assessing infant and young child feeding practices , 2010). ASSP's impact on three indicators, minimum dietary diversity, minimum meal frequency, and minimum acceptable diet was assessed. Figure 6.3 displays the degree of the impact of ASSP on child feeding practices both overall and for subsets of the population (based on sex, wealth, and sampling domain). 277 Results of the sub- analyses show that for subgroups based on sex and wealth, the ASSP project had no impact on child feeding practices.

Results of the fully specified models did not detect a program impact on achievement of MDD (Table 6. 25). Overall, the achievement of MDD was associated with living in Nord/Sud Ubangi, living in urban areas, living in a household in the high- middle or high wealth quintile , and living in a World Bank -supported health zone. Being age 12- 23 months, having a mother in the highest maternal age bracket, and having a mother who reported being married or in a partnership were associated with achievement of MDD. Sub- analyses did not detect ASSP impact within individual sexes, wealth groups, or sampling domains (Ta bles 6.26- 6.31). In ASSP areas, approximately one in four children achieve MDD. The proportion of children achieving MDD did not change significantly between baseline and endline in ASSP areas. MDD improved significantly in non- ASSP areas. Table 6. 32 shows the prevalence of MDD in ASSP and non- ASSP areas by selected characteristics. In ASSP areas, approximately one in four children achieved minimum dietary diversity. Minimum meal frequency (MMF) is the \"proportion of breastfed a nd non- breastfed children 6- 23 months of age who receive solid, semi -solid, or soft foods (but also including milk feeds for non- breastfed children) the minimum number of times or more.\" For breastfed children, the minimum number of times is two for those a ge 6- 8 months, and three for those age 9- 23 months. For children who are not currently breastfeeding, the minimum number of times is four, regardless of age (Indicators for assessing infant and young child feeding practices , 2010). The fully adjusted model (Table 6.33) did not show a significant ASSP project impact on this indicator. Children age 6 -12 months and those living in households with five or more children under five were significantly more likely to achieve MMF. Sub -analyses did not detect ASSP im pact within individual sexes, wealth groups, or sampling domains (Tables 6.34- 6.39). Table 6.4 shows the prevalence of MMF in ASSP and non- ASSP areas by selected characteristics. Overall, t he proportion of children receiving the MMF decreased significantly in ASSP areas ( 49.9 percent to 38.5 percent ). There was no significant change in MMF in non- ASSP areas. Minimum acceptable diet (MAD) is a measure of children who achieve both minimum dietary diversity and minimum meal frequency in the 24 hours prior to the module . Among children not currently breastfed, it also involves two milk feedings during those 24 hours. Overall, proportions of children with a MAD were low ( Figure 6.4). One of the key drivers of these low rates appeared to be a lack of supplemental milk feedings for non- breastfed children (results not shown) . There were no significant changes in rates of MAD in either ASSP or non- ASSP areas. Table 6. 48 shows the prevalence of M AD in Key Points Three in four children under five do not have a minimum dietary diversity. There was no significant change in this indicator. Minimum meal frequency declined significantly in ASSP areas. There was no significant change in minimum accep table diets in ASSP or non -ASSP areas. 279 ASSP and non- ASSP areas by selected characteristics. The fully adjusted model ( Table 6.41) did not detect an ASSP project impact. Overall, living in Nord/Sud Ubangi and being female were positively associated with achievement of a MAD . Breastfeeding The World Health Organization advises that exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life promotes the health of the infant by providing adequate nutrition and antibodies, and for the health of the mother through the reduction of the risk of uterine bleeding after birth, as well as ovarian cancer (\"Breastfeeding\", 2018). Early initiation (within the first hour of a child's life) of breastfeeding is important for both mother and child. Breast milk is high in nutritional value, and the breast milk produced in the first few days after delivery (colostrum) is rich in antibodies that can provide the infant with natural immunity ( Minist\u00e8re du Plan et Suivi de la Mise en oeuvre de la R\u00e9volution de la Modernit\u00e9, 2014). Women who had given birth in the two years preceding the module were asked whether they breastfed their youngest living child and if so, how long after giving birth they initiated breastfeeding. The vast majority of women (>97 percent) reported breastfeedi ng their child at both baseline and endline, and there were no significant changes in the prevalence of breastfeeding between baseline and endline in either ASSP or non -ASSP areas. Similarly, rates of initiating breastfeeding within the first hour of birth did not change significantly in either ASSP or non- ASSP areas. Figure 6.5 illustrates the differences in prevalence and timing of breastfeeding at baseline and endline. 280 Figure 6.5 . Timing of breastfeeding of youngest child born within two years preceding the module , ASSP and non- ASSP areas. Non -indigenous crops An emphasis of the ASSP project's nutrition strategy was the introduction of moringa and chaya . Therefore, heads of households who reported having a home garden were asked whether they were cultivating these crops . Both crops were quite rare at baseline . The prevalence of moringa in home gardens increased significantly in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas ; while not statistically sign ificant, an increase in the prevalence of chaya was also observed (Figure 6.5). The prevalence of chaya did not change significantly in ASSP areas , but did increase in non- ASSP areas. Overall, the presence of both crops was low; less than two percent of ga rdens had moringa and less than one percent of gardens had chaya . 59.1540.120.73ASSP 2014 Initiated within first hour Initiated later than one hour Never breastfed56.7141.222.07ASSP 2017 Initiated within first hour Initiated later than one hour Never breastfed 67.4731.141.39Non -ASSP 2014 Initiated within first hour Initiated later than one hour Never breastfed56.7441.202.06Non -ASSP 2017 Initiated within first hour Initiated later than one hour Never breastfed 281 Figure 6.5 .

Qualitative findings Qualitative research was carried out in the provinces of Nord Ubangi and Maniema between November and December 2017 in ASSP program health zones . In conjunction with ASSP program managers, we identified one high- performing (where child nutrition indicators had improved) and one low -performing (where child nutrition indicators had decreased) health zones according to changes that took place during the course of the ASSP intervention. Data collection was carried out in one health area in each of the four zones. A mix of qualitative methods w as employed by two research teams each comprised of one supervisor and three research assistants to collect inf ormation from people involved in the implementation and beneficiaries of the project. Methods included key informant interviews with health officials and program implement ers working at the national, provincial , and zonal level s (n=15); these included in-depth interviews with facility -based service providers (n=6) and RECOs involved in implementing child nutrition activities (n=8) and in- depth interviews with caregivers of malnourished children enrolled in ASSP child nutrition activities within the last six months (n=10). Key Informants and Health Worker In -depth Interview Respondents Implementation across the research sites Due to the high attrition rates, particularly among the RECOs, many health area level study respondents had not participated in the early phases of project implementation. Those who had participated reported separate training of nurses (generally one per health cent er) and RECOs, with topics focusing on screening of malnourished children, identifying signs and symptoms of malnutrition, home gardening, child feeding, how to make an enriched porridge, reporting of nutrition activities, and for the health workers, how t o handle acute and serious cases of malnutrition. Many perceived the initial 0.2 0.44.3 1.2 0246810 areas Baseline Endline 282 training to be highly theoretical, with some RECOs complaining that the trainers led sessions in French, and they were therefore unable to fully understand the content. Although t he training included orientation on proper procedures to carry out monitoring, completing the monitoring forms was consistently reported as a challenge. High turnover of health workers was attributed to the transfer of facility -based nurses to other areas and lack of RECOs' motivation, who we were told originally agreed to participate based on the assumption that they would be remunerated. There were also reports of female RECOs who married and left the health area. As a result, activities had to be carrie d out with fewer than 10 RECO s per health area (study areas reported between 2-7 RECO s). In 2017, additional training led by the ASSP ACs was conducted to orient RECOs previously involved in the approach and train new recruits. This additional training was perceived as both informative and practical , permitting the health areas to increase the number of formally trained RECOs working on nutrition activities. In two of the four health areas studied, none of the health center nurses had received formal traini ng on the nutrition approach. Since nurses' trainings only occurred at the beginning of the project, if trained nurses left the health area their replacements did not receive any training and therefore would not be familiar with the approach. Nutrition a ctivities were implemented in early 2014 shortly after training, which first involved training trainers followed by training nurses and RECOs . In Maniema, meetings designed to sensitize community members about the approach were reported to take place during the early phases of implementation. At the time of the study, activities entailed community screening of malnourished children, with most RECOs reporting screen ing 20 children and identifying 1-3 new cases eligible for enrollment once a month. While most RECOs indicated that children eligible for additional health center level screening should have an upper arm circumference measurement under 12.5 cm., nurses were not clear about the cut-off. Once identified, parents who agree d to take their children to t he health center where a physical examination and anthropometric measure ments were taken to confirm that the child was eligible for enrollment. We were told that some parents refused to go to the health center due to time constraints or distance, but the n umber of refusals was not monitor ed. Malnourished children we re also identified in the health center, particularly during growth monitoring sessions. During the initial examination, the provision of medications to children appeared to be variable, with nur ses reporting that the drugs supposed to be provided we re not always available. Health workers reported frequent stock -outs or not always receiving all of the medications they order ed through the project. While severely malnourished children were referred to a reference center or hospital, we were told that plumpy nut and therapeutic milk is often not available in the reference facilities; parents are responsible for transport, though it was not always possible for them due to the cost. In Maniema, health o fficial and providers said that children sent to the reference hospital frequently die. During the initial stages of the project, malnourished children were given plumpy nut in the health centers weekly, but in three of the four research sites this had been discontinued. The final site had refugees and thus the health center receiv ed regular plumpy nut and maize flour for distribution to malnourished children. Several of the health workers claimed that it was difficult for caregivers to obtain ingredients to make an enriched porridge and that recovery from malnutrition is more successful when plumpy nut is available. 283 If the child wa s deemed moderately malnourished and eligible for enrollment, health personne l reported that they complete d a child monitoring form and provide initial information to caregivers on the ASSP approach. Once enrolled, the frequency of household visits varied across the sites, with some RECOs claiming to follow the official two -week sc hedule, while others either carried out more (2- 4 times a month) and some, less frequent (one head nurse advised RECOs to only visit \"negligent\" parents regularly) visits. During visits, RECOs reported assessing the child's nutritional status and counseling parents on appropriate feeding practices according to the age and needs of the young children; as part of the approach, they instruct ed parents on how to make different types of enriched porridge using locally available protein -rich ingredients, or for o lder children, promote d vegetable- based dishes, advocating for a balanced diet utilizing four food groups. Household visits continue d up to three months after enrollment. An ongoing difficulty was finding caregivers, who spend much time away from the house hold, at home. It was not clear what is done for children who do not recover from malnutrition during the three -month enrollment period. In three sites, home gardens were not planted, with respondents from the two sites in Nord Ubangi claiming that gardening was not possible during the dry season which was ongoing during data collection; in these sites, RECOs were no longer promoting home gardens. Interestingly, many respondents reported that stigma is attached to families with malnourished children, which may dissuade people from planting home gardens. Only one health center maintained a garden ; both of the RECOs interviewed in this health area also had home gardens. In all of the other health areas, we were told that the health center garden was abandoned and none of the RECOs had a home garden. We identified one moringa tree in two sites, four in one site , and none in the final health area; chaya was not found in any of the research areas. In regard to materials, each RECO received gardening tools including one spade, rake , and watering can subsequent to the original training. Across all sites, respondents complained that the tools were insufficient and of poor quality, breaking quickly. Some seeds were distributed after the first training, but respondent s claimed they were either insufficient, infiltrated with bugs, or had expired and did not germinate, or that the seeds conserved after the initial harvest did not grow. As a result, families were encouraged to plant local seeds. Some areas did not receive moringa seeds until recently and others claimed that most of the moringa seeds did not germinate; c haya cuttings were either never received or dry and did not produce plants. RECOs reported receiving arm circumference bands, a notebook (used as the regist er), a pen or pencil, folders, counseling guides , and monitoring forms, but in one health area they had run out of monitoring forms. None of the health area RECOs received bags to carry their work materials or identification badges to distinguish themselve s from other inhabitants, which they perceived as disappointing. Nurses were given training modules and a height measure ment board . RECOs h eld monthly meetings during which monitoring data was compiled and the status of nutrition activities may have been discussed. Monthly reports we re submitted to the head nurse and sent to the central health zone office and entered into the computerized database. Provincial -level DPS and Pronaunut staff in Maniema and Nord Ubangi claimed that some monthly nutrition reports were not regularly received. Several respondents reported that RECOs have problems completing the registers and child monitoring forms correctly, and Interchurch Medical Assistance ( IMA) staff admitted that the 284 data quality needed improvement. RECOs indicated that they did not receive feedback on monthly reports or interact with zonal staff. We were told that the head nurse was responsible for supervising the RECO coach and the RECO coach supervise d RECO field activities. Zonal su pervisory visits we re carried out monthly or every two months during which health facility records, including those related to the nutrition approach, we re reviewed; however, these supervisions d id not involve interactions with community health workers. In Nord Ubangi , visits from the ASSP AC appeared to be carried out every three months. Supervisions by other provincial staff were not reported. In Maniema, the health areas reported receiving multiple visits by health officials working at the provincial lev el; however, Ministry of Health 's National Nutrition Department staff d id not participate in these supervisions. In Maniema, health area respondents claimed that trimester or bi -annual visits we re carried out by the ASSP AC, which may have involve d other a ctivities such as training or community meetings. In both provinces, zonal ACs did not accompany the IMA AC during supervisory visits claiming they lacked transport. Respondents complained that supervisors other than the ASSP ACs failed to spend time in the communities and thus we re unable to get an accurate assessment of activities. It was also mentioned that during visits , promises were often made about provision of materials that we re never fulfilled. We were told that educational sessions on child malnutrition and appropriate feeding practices we re conducted during prenatal care and growth monitoring sessions (Consultation Pre- Scolaire , or CPS ); only one respondent claimed to lead support group meetings. Mother and child campaigns were not reported. The hotline was available in three of four sites; across sites, respondents universally reported that the hotline was never used. Perceptions of the project Respondents generally felt that nutrition counseling improved caregivers' understandi ngs of child nutrition and appropriate age -specific feeding practices, albeit only reaching a small percentage of the population. Several maintained that nutrition counseling alone c ould not make a major difference in rates of malnutrition, and while garde ning was perceived as a strong approach theoretically, they admitted that it had failed. Nurses claimed that the project had not reached its objectives, with most stating that malnutrition persists as a major problem. However, references to rates of malnut rition were based on anecdotal evidence and not data. Key informant interviews at the zonal and provincial levels suggested that the data collected was not reviewed by health officials. In Nord Ubangi , respondents were particularly negative about the appro ach, citing many impediments to implementation. The general consensus was that few community members we re actually subscribing to the nutrition strategy, which respondents contended failed to provide the assistance needed for malnourished children to recover. Respondents raised many weaknesses in the approach, including the following: 285 Project inception No formative research or piloting of the nutrition activities; the approach did not coincide with the community needs. \"I would only like to ask the authorities not to plan activities from a distance, it would be better to come first to the field to understand the details and reality in communities instead of planning everything at the national or provincial level. It's like a project that has just been thrown at us.... That's the problem we have, the authorities just bring us projects that do not take into account the needs of the community. \" (RECO respondent) Project implementation The project repeatedly failed to deliver promised materials such as cuttings, seeds, badges, and bags Supervisor visits are infrequent and most often limited to the health center RECOS RECOs are not remunerated, causing high turnover; other projects pay RECOs Lack of other incentives (no identification, inadequate materials) limit RECO motivation RECOs have not received adequate training, causing deficiencies in the approach Inadequate numbers of RECOs handicap the work; RECOs are often required to cover m ore than one village necessitating that they travel long distances and work in sites where they are not known and may not be accepted Health workers Little financial incentive for facility health workers, who receive limited pay, to get involved in nutrition activities Few facility -based worker s were trained in nutrition activities; as a result, health worker personnel had limited understanding of activities Treatment of malnutrition The approach does not provide therapeutic foods for severely malno urished children Community members have difficulties buying ingredients recommended for enriched porridge Plumpy nut is more acceptable and effective in treatment of malnutrition Outreach Community members still do not understand malnutrition Mothers are difficult to reach in their households Limited efforts are made to target fathers of young children Home gardening Gardening materials distributed were of poor quality and inadequate, diminishing interest in gardening Water is not easily acces sible during the dry season (Nord Ubangi) Domestic animals get into the gardens Community members are accustomed to gardening in their fields where they spend the day; home gardening leads to additional work Some of the vegetables promoted (moringa and c haya) are foreign to the community and would not necessarily be accepted for consumption Local vegetables proposed for home gardens are already available and not appropriate for porridge Residents did not understand the need to conserve seeds for future plan ting 286 Recommendations/solutions to guide future activities There was agreement that RECOs should be compensated, with respondents suggesting that only if RECOs were remunerated w ould the project succeed. Across sites, respondents underlined the need for increased training to motivate RECOs and improve their unders tanding of the child nutrition activities; the provision of sufficient and quality gardening materials; and the distribution of basic materials such as a badge and bag to boost RECO morale. Other specific recommendations included that the project be tailor ed to local needs and contexts, therapeutic foods be available for severely malnourished children, supervisors interact more with community members, and community leaders be better engaged. Caregivers of Malnourished Children Participation in project activities Most children were identified by RECOs 1- 3 months prior to the interview during household visits and subsequently sent to a health facility for enrollment. Several children were being cared for by their grandmothers. Caregiver respondent s indicated that community members perceive d parents of malnourished children to be irresponsible and that stigma is attached to these families. While all children were examined by health personnel, in one site the health workers did not take anthropometr ic measures to confirm that the child's nutritional status. During the health center visit, personnel were reported to provide medications and counseling on child feeding, including how to make an enriched porridge. In the site where plumpy nut was distributed, nutrition activities and counseling revolved around obtaining and feeding the young child plumpy nut, with respondents claiming never to have received information on gardening. Most caregivers living in the other sites asserted that they had received frequent household visits by the RECOs who were reported to measure the child's arm circumference, inquire what foods the child was receiving, provide information on child feeding and porridge preparation, and promote gardening. Only two respondents menti oned that a porridge demonstration was carried out in their homes; training or demonstrations on gardening were not conducted. One grandmother maintained that she had never received counseling from the RECO, indicating that she works during the day and the RECO had only interacted with the child's maternal aunt when making household visits. Across three sites, only two caregivers had a home garden at the time of the study; one only grew eggplant, claiming eggplant was not consumed by pigs which infiltrate gardens, and the second only planted sweet potato, which she sold to buy other foods. Explanations for limited gardening included lack of access to water, limited space next to their home, difficulties in keeping domestic animals out of home gardens, lack of seeds and gardening materials, and time constraints, with many caregivers indicating that they spend their days farming and the local practice is to plant a garden in the agricultural fields. None of the caregivers were aware of or had ever participated in a support group for breastfeeding mothers or for mothers of malnourished children. 287 Caregiver perceptions While caregivers appreciated what they had learned through nutrition counseling, many expressed frustrations that the project did not provid e more assistance with respondents mentioning plumpy nut, as well as seeds and other gardening materials to enable them to follow the counseling messages. In the one site (peri -urban area) where respondents were more positive about the project benefits, care givers mentioned that the RECOs provided them with hope, which served as a motivation to follow the recommended feeding practices. Those caregivers who incurred big bills for expenses related to treatment of the malnourished children lamented that the heal th center did not maintain the appropriate drugs and they therefore had to purchase medications. Respondents in Nord Ubangi claimed that it was impossible to garden during the dry season; overall, gardening was not perceived as beneficial, with respondents highlighting the many challenges to maintaining a successful garden. Many caregivers also stated that it was difficult to follow the child feeding recommendations, particularly related to the preparation of an enriched porridge, due to lack of money. Caregivers living in the area where plumpy nut and maize flour were provided were generally positive about the assistance recei ved, despite complaints that they often did not receive the recommended quantity. We received mixed reports in regard to changes in the child's health status, with some caregivers claiming that changed feeding practices were helping their child regain his or her health, while others expressed disappointment that the health center did not have good solutions to reverse malnutrition. In the peri -urban site, respondents were more positive , with all stating that ASSP activities (e.g. nutritional counseling, pr ovision of medications, RECO assurances) had led to improvements in the child's health and nutritional status. iv. Limitations Timing of baseline survey: The baseline survey was administered after ASSP project activities had begun. However, in the arena of nutrition, no community -based activities appeared to have been carried out in survey areas. One would not expect the nutrition outcomes assessed in this chapter to be impacted. Seasonality: Patterns of child malnutrition are seasonal, so it cannot be rule d out that the fact that the baseline and endline surveys occurred in different months impacted the results. An analysis of rates of stunting, wasting, and underweight in northern Maniema, which was rainy at endline, and southern Maniema, which was dry, di d not detect significant differences. It is difficult to ascertain the direction of the potential seasonality bias without longitudinal malnutrition data from these regions, as the impact of season may vary based on climate, variation in disease prevalence , types of crops grown, prevalence of agriculture as a food source, the economic status of the region, and other factors. Service interruptions : As the community education, screenings and home visits were not reliant on ASSP funding once trained occurred and the approach was launched, it is not expected that the project's service interruptions impacted rates of malnutrition or child feeding practices. The provision of 288 medicines and supplements to malnourished children at health facilities may have been impacted; medication stock -outs are discussed in Chapter 8. The introduction of moringa and chaya and the home gardening practices may have slowed due to the interruption in funding; however, routine data on these activities was not available. ASSP's routine data , presented in the Year 5 Quarter 2 report, did show that overall the project exceeded its targets for the number of children who were identified as malnourished and who received five home visits during the first two quarters of Year 5 (i.e. during the service interruption) . However, Maniema was at 61 percent of its target and Tshopo was at 75 percent in the second quarter. (The results from Nord Ubangi were not provided in the quarterly report .) Power to detect differences in outcomes: As described in Chapter 2, the analysis was powered to detect differences among children under five overall. It was not powered to detect differences between subgroups. Nevertheless, some differences in the sub -analyses were found. v. Discussion This chapter describes the performance of the ASSP project relative to i ts goal of improving child health through increased access to nutritious food and providing treatment for those who are malnourished. Overall, findings from the household module indicate th at rates of malnutrition not only did not improve significa ntly in ASSP or non- ASSP areas but are in fact at emergency levels . While malnutrition is typically worse in boys, for some indicators the gender gap has narrowed. R ates of stunting have increased significantly in ASSP areas relative to non -ASSP areas , particularly in rural settings . The nutrition situation in Maniema/Tshopo in particular has worsened . The reasons for this are likely complex but may include both difficulties in the implementation of the approach and weaknesses of the approach itself. The approach would benefit from formative research focused on community perceptio ns and needs , and pilot testing. The qualitative analysis identified difficulties in implementing ASSP' s nutrition approach, the impacts of which were seen in the quantitative findings. The project promoted enriched porridge; however, the caregivers interviewed were not making the time to prepare it due to time and financial constraints. Dietary diversity did not improve; although RECOs reported stressing the importance of children eating at least four food groups, none of the mothers of malnourished children reported receiving this information. In fact, the rates at which children achieved minimum meal frequency worsened. RECOs were trained to advise adding an extra meal to malnourished children's diets, but none of the staff or mothers mentioned this message. Overall, findings suggest that RECOS, the backbone of the nutrition approach, did not perform as hoped. This may be attributed to the fact that RECOs struggled to understand the content of trainings conducted in French, exhibited high levels of attrition, particularly early in the project , and reported being under -motivated by the lack of supervision, compensation, and supplies. Further, the approach's reliance on volunteer RECOS and on health facilities providing nutrition services which do not generate re venue , particularly in this resource -poor setting, appears to be limiting its effectiveness. Overall, the approach required that caregivers of small children make changes to child feeding practices which would likely n ot be successful without support from a strong behavior al change framework based on formative research in the local context . 289 The home gardens, which respondents thought were a good idea in principle, fell short of their potential . Women explained that it was difficult to have a garden at home due to the fact that they spend their days in the agricultural fields, livestock ruin s the gardens, water is not always accessible, and gardening create s extra work. Relocating gardens to be adjacent to agricultural fields could mitigate these difficu lties. Additionally, there were reports of stigma associated with having a malnourished child and therefore a home garden. Moving the gardens to the agricultural fields and encouraging all households to garden as a strategy to prevent malnutrition could be beneficial. However, any new approach should be informed by communities and health workers and pilot -tested prior to mass implementation. There was evidence of success in some respects. The project, particularly the home gardening, appeared to be better received in peri -urban areas. Finally, the prevalence of moringa increased over the course of the project. While moringa is not currently prevalent, it may have the potential to become more widespread. Research into the extent to which moringa and chaya are accep table as food or an addition to porridge across the project areas would inform efforts to introduce these non- indigenous crops. ASSP's approach was to identify and treat cases of malnourishment, defined as having MUAC measurements under 12.5 cm. MUAC correlates to some extent with stunting and wasting. However, these types of impacts were not observed in the quantitative data, and qualitative findings suggested that service providers and community members still co nsidered malnutrition a significant problem in 2017. Further, ASSP's routine data did not track the intervention coverage (i.e. the percentage of all children who were screened and/or malnourished) , the percentage of those identified as ma lnourished who sought care, and did not track individual children over time. Children who were screened multiple times and/or who experienced recurrent cases of malnutrition would therefore appear multiple times in the routine data's prevalence and recover y data , potentially overstating the project's impact . The home gardening strategy would have prevented recurrent cases of malnutrition or clusters of malnutrition within families; however, it remains that the small numbers of children living in households that started a home garden would be unlikely to make significant change in population- level malnutrition prevalence. The level of malnutrition in project areas and particularly the trend in Maniema is alarming. As ASSP's nutrition activities in the community had not yet begun when the baseline was conducted, this type of contamination can be ruled out as an explanation f or the decline. T he baseline rates were comparable to those found in the 2013/14 Demographic and Health Survey, lending credence to the conclusion that malnutrition is worsening. 1 This conclusion is also supported by a 2018 assessment by IPC Global Partner s that found that 22 percent of the population of Maniema were experiencing crisis or emergency levels of malnutrition. Although the nutrition situation is worsening nationwide, the evaluation found that t he ASSP project significantly increased levels of stunting, specifically in Maniema. This m ay be explained by differences between ASSP and the predecessor project. If the predecessor project took a humanitarian approach 1 One exception is the estimate of wasting at 22.7 percent in Maniema/Tshopo, which is likely an anomaly in the DHS data. 290 that included the provision of food, it would be plausible that malnutrition would inc rease when ASSP , which did not provide food, was implemented. ASSP's approach of identifying and t reating cases of malnutrition would not be expected to decrease the prevalence of stunting, as children who are stunted do not typically recover the lost height . Nord Ubangi, in contrast, had not had a predecessor project. Therefore, as was indeed observed in the data, one would not expect ASSP to have an adverse impact on malnutrition. In fact, the ASSP project significantly improved rates of children receiving a minimum acceptable diet in Nord Ubangi. More careful analysis of the differences between prior strategies and ASSP intervention s in Maniema is urgently needed to ensure that future programs are tailored to the situation in that region. Anthropometric indicators capture the multi -factor determinants of nutritional status. Morbidity and dietary intake are the immediate determinants of stunting, wasting, and global acute malnutrition . This chapter explored the relationship between direct nutrition interventions and nutritional outcomes, suggesting that program design and implementation factors might account for the lack of impact on, and in fact backsliding of , nutritional status in some project areas. A larger question, thoug h, is whether the comple ment of components f rom the ASSP intervention package was designed and implemented such that diet and infection c ould be managed effectively. It is particularly important to identify those differences over time in Maniema that might explain the ne gative change in nutritional outcomes. This will be particularly useful in the design of strategies to promote the transition from humanitarian to development programming in DRC and elsewhere. 291 References Breastfeeding. (2018).

Overview of the ASSP approach Expanding access to family planning services is the primary objective of global family planning efforts and has been a driving force behind family planning programs in recent years. Especially after the London Summit in 2012, the goal of \"expanding access to family planning information, services, and supplies to an additional 120 million women and girls in the world's poorest countries by 2020\" became prominent in the family planning global community (FP2020, 2013 Choi et al, 2016) . More recen tly, goal 3.7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SD G), calls for: \"By 2030, to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programs\" (UN General Assembly, 2015) . Consistent with this priority, the Acc\u00e8s aux Soins de Sant\u00e9 Primaires project (Access to Pri mary Health Care Project, ASSP) supports family planning as part of a package of integrated health services , including malaria, nutrition , antenatal care , immunization, and child health. F amily planning and maternal health services are highly complementary and often provided together in low and middle -income country (LMIC ) settings. As a result of family planning programs in the last decade , maternal mortality rates have decreased by 26 percent in developing countries (Cleland et al., 2012). According to the same study , contraceptive use is responsible for averting 10 percent of child deaths. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is among the countries with the highest fertility rate s and lowest level s of modern contraceptive use in Sub- Saharan Africa. The DRC has the third -highest fertility rate worldwide, with 6. 6 birth s per woman (DHS 2013- 14). Fertility varies from 5.4 children per woman in urban areas to 7.3 in rural areas. Modern contraceptive use among all women of reproductive age differs among 26 different provinces, ranging from 1.4 percent in Sankuru province (formerly part of Kasai -Oriental) to 16.0 percent in Kongo C entral ( formerly Bas Congo) (DHS 2013- 14). The most re cent survey in Kinshasa showed modern contraceptive prevalence rate (MCPR ) to be 22.0 percent among all women in reproductive age (PMA2020, 2018) . In an effort to strengthen the health system and assist the Congolese government in improving the delivery of family planning services in the DRC, IMA World Health and local partners implemented the ASSP between 2013 and 2018. During this period, ASSP provided a set of interventions focus ed on increasing access to contraceptive services that included: Family planning service delivery: ASSP offered support for family planning services to facilities including 55 general reference hospitals, 114 reference health centers, and 803 health centers in intervention areas. All ASSP -supported facilities were expected to provide family planning service (including contraceptive methods and counseling) by a trained provider. In addition to facility -based family planning services, in each health zone, ASS P supported community- based distribution of pills, condoms, and C yclebeads. If a woman was interested in a long -acting method, the community - based distr ibutor would refer her to a facility offering family planning services. Human resources for family planning services: To ensure providers were capable of offering family planning services, ASS P trained 64 national -level \" Master Trainers\". Master trainers were selected from 10\u00e8me Direction, National Reproductive Health Program ( PNSR ), Roi Baudin H ospital, and other hospitals and maternity clinics in Kinshasa, the Centre de Formation en Sant\u00e9 de la Reproduction Aboubakar Tour\u00e9, as well as the Maternal and Child Health ( MCH ) focal point from 334 each ASSP i mplementing partner. Master trainers were expected to conduct a 14- day training at the provincial and health zone level. Commodities , specific inputs/ infrastructure , and equipment: P roviding a wide range of family planning methods was a priority for the ASSP project. Methods provided by the project include d: condom s, pills, and male condom s. In addition to family planning commodities, ASSP provided facilities with reproductive health equipment including scales, blood pressure monitors, and gynecological tables. ASSP als o supported selected hospitals wi th surgical instruments needed for male and female sterilization. Additionally, w hen the Syst\u00e8me National d'Information Sanitaire (National Health Information System , SNIS ) started to use the web -based health data information system DHIS2 as the platform for collecting health information in the DRC, ASSP provided training on DHIS2 in ASSP -supported health zones. ASSP activities prior to the baseline survey . According to ASSP's quarterly reports, prior to the baseline survey , the ASS P started the training for \"Master trainers\" selected from the 10\u00e8me Direction PNSR, Roi Baudin Hospital, and other hospitals and maternity clinics in Kinshasa, the Centre de Formation en Sant\u00e9 de la Reproduction Aboubakar Tour\u00e9, as well as the MCH focal poi nt from each ASSP implementing partner. Also, most general reference hospitals, reference health centers, and health centers in intervention areas that were supported by the ASSP project initiated the family planning service and contraceptive provision. ASSP routine family planning data. Performance in family planning programs in developing countries is generally measured in two ways: in terms of the outputs produced by the program (measured at the program level with routine service statistics) and by the outcomes (measured at the population level through population- based survey s). In the ASSP project , the two outputs of interest are couple -years of protection (CYP) and MCPR . Couple -years of protection is the estimated protection provided by contraceptive methods for a one -year period, based upon the volume of all contraceptives sold or distributed free of charge to clients during that period. CYP is calculated by multiplying the number of each type of contraceptive sold or distributed free of charge by a c onversion factor, to generate an estimate of contraceptive protection by unit of each method. CYP represents a measure of output (\"the volume of contraception dispensed to clients\"), which can be reported for a single health facility or aggregated to the district, provincial, or national level. Routine service statistics were reported on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis . Figure 7.1 shows the CYP generated by different domains during the first 4.5 years of the ASSP project. Analysis of the routine ser vice data shows that more than 66 percent of the total CYP generated over 18 trimesters of the project (four and a half years) were in the Kasai/Kasai Central domain. Kasai/ Kasai Central was the largest domain among the three domains of the ASSP project which of the 52 health zones supported by ASSP, 28 health zones (54 percent) were in this domain. Thus, t he majority of family planning output in the ASSP project occurred in Kasai/Kasai C entral domain. The rest of the CYP was 335 generated in Nord Ubangi (14 percent ) and Maniema/Tshopo (20 percent ). The routine service statistics show ed that the ASSP supported facilities inserted 12,464 IUDs during the first 18 trimesters of the project. Of al l IUDs inserted, 6 9 percent of IUDs were administered in Kasai/ Kasai Central domain. The rest of the IUDs were distributed in Nord Ubangi (11 percent ) and Maniema/Tshopo (17 percent ). Furthermore, in Maniema/Tshopo domain, 73 percent of the IUDs were distributed in 6 ASSP -supported health zone s (out of 13 supported health zones). Similarly , in Nord Ubangi , 93 percent of the IUDs were distributed in 5 health zones (out of 11 health zones) ( results not shown). Figure 7.1 . Total CYP by d omain from April 2013 (Q1) - September 2017 (18) generated from routine service statistics This chapter of the report summarize s the findings from the family planning section of the baseline and endline survey . We assess the impact of the ASSP project by comparing change in the treatment (ASSP - supported) area versus comparison areas (not supported by ASSP) . And we examine whether the project achieved the 1.8 percentage point increase per year expected by Department for International Development (DFID) in the modern contraceptive prevalence rate. ii. Quantitative findings Difference -in-differences model This chapter presents key findings from the family planning section of the women's survey s conducted in 2014 and 2017. The analysis assesses the impact of the ASSP project on two main contraceptive - 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 knowledge of women of reproductive age of modern contraceptive methods and use of modern contraception. In the field of family planning, MCPR and other indicators are calculated based on two different populations: married women of reproductive age and all women of reproductive age. In this analysi s, we follow the indicator championed by the FP2020 initiative and use all women of reproductive age, which reflects the goal of increasing access to and use of contraceptives by both married and unmarried women. For reasons explained earlier and in greate r detail, the endline survey was limited to only two domains (Nord Ubangi and Maniema/Tshopo), due to political unrest in Kasai/Kasai Central. To assess the impact of the project on modern contraceptive use, we used the difference -in-difference (DID) method. The DID model compares the difference in the outcome variable (modern contraceptive use) over time (between 2014 and 2017) between ASSP and non- ASSP areas. The adjusted DID models for modern contraceptive use are shown in T ables 7. 1 to 7. 4. Table 7.1 displays the fully adjusted DID model for modern contraceptive use among women of reproductive age in ASSP and non- ASSP areas. There was no significant program effect on modern contraceptive use. The fully -adjusted model indicates that, of seven independe nt variables tested as possible correlates of contraceptive use, four were significant. Women living in Maniema (compared to Nord Ubangi ), in peri -urban settings (compared to rural area s), having more children (3- 4, +5), and those who were more educated ar e significantly more likely to use modern contraceptive s. Since the descriptive analysis showed an increase in the proportion of women using long- acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods (i.e., implants and IUDs), we performed a separate DID analys is to assess the impact of the program, with use of LARCs among women of reproductive age as the dependent variable. Table 7. 2 illustrates the fully adjusted DID model for modern contraceptive use limited to LARC methods. Our analysis showed a significant effect of the project on the use of LARCs. Specifically, women in the intervention areas in 2017 had a significantly higher probability of using LARCs compared to their counterparts (p=0.045). The same model shows that women in peri -urban areas, with some primary, completed primary, or completed secondary education, married or in union, and/or women with 5+ children have significantly higher probabilities of using LARCs compared to the reference groups. In another attempt to capture the impact of the progr am on modern contraceptive use and to control for any other differences at village level (which could affect the outcome), we jointly used DID and fixed- effects methods. Results from village fixed- effect model also showed no significant program effect on m odern contraceptive use among women in the treatment area (data not shown). Key Points Overall, the impact evaluation did not show a significant increase in MCPR. The overall result masks the significant effect in Nord Ubangi that was not found in Maniema/Tshopo. The project achieved the 1.8 percentage points increase per annum in MCPR in Nord Ubangi , consistent with DFID's expectation. The project showed a significant impact o n LARC method use. 337 Since there was a significant correlation between modern contraceptive use and the sampling domain, we conducted further analysis to assess the DID model for each sampling domain ( Table 7.3 ). Results from these two fully adjusted models suggest that there w as a significant effect in Nord Ubangi (marginal effect: 3.6 percent , p=0.025), while a significantly negative effect was detected for Maniema/Tshopo ( marginal effect: - 6.3 percent , p=0.002). In short, ASSP had the expected effect on modern contraceptive use in Nord Ubangi (that was not found in the non- ASSP area s), but no such effect occurred in Maniema/Tshopo. Specific to the family planning intervention, in 2015 DFID indi cated to ASSP project staff an expectation of an increase of 1.8 percentage points per year in MCPR in the ASSP treatment areas, consistent with goals set by the 2012 London Summit for different countries. The descriptive statistics shown in Table 7.2 show that in the three -year period between 2014 and 2017, MCPR in Nord Ubangi increased from 2.7 percent to 8.1 percent . This increase of 5.4 percentage points over the three years equates to 1.8 percentage points per year, exactly the level of change that DFI D expected from this project. However, the same results were not evident in Maniema/Tshopo, for reasons discussed elsewhere. Table 7.4 illustrates ASSP's program effect on different wealth categories of the women population. The analysis was carried out to assess the DID model limited to constructed wealth categories based on wealth quintile. The respondents were re-coded as two levels of wealth; 1 - Low and low- middle qui ntile, 2- middle, high- middle, and high quintile. Results from these two fully adjusted models suggest that there was no significant program impact on modern contraceptive use in any of the wealth categories. Figure 7.2 summarizes the results of DID models by survey domain and wealth. To assess the potential impact of seasonality on the results, we calculated the difference between MCPR in northern Maniema, which was experiencing the rainy season, and southern Maniema, w hich was experiencing the dry season at endline. There were no significant differences found. Furthermore, as a robustness check, we included a variable in the DID models for modern contraceptive use that estimated the straight- line distance between the wo man's household and the nearest governmental health facility. There were no changes in the direction or significance of the impact of ASSP in any of the models, and the distance variable was never significant. Also, there was no significant association related to woman's distance to the nearest health facility between ASSP and non- ASSP areas at baseline or endline (results not shown). 338 Figure 7.2 .

Descriptive statistics Results of the descriptive analysis of the baseline and endline survey on knowledge of women of any modern co ntraceptive method appear in Table 7.5, and on contraceptive use in Table 7.6 and T able 7.7. Percent of women who know specific method s Table 7.7 reports the comparison of knowledge of women on modern contracep tive method s at baseline and endline . The total number of known methods w as calculated for each woman in each survey . The mean number of methods known for women increased from 5.1 in 2014 to 5.5 in 2017 in ASSP area s, and from 5.3 to 6.0 in non -ASSP area s, which is statistically significant at the 0.05 level in both areas . The percent age of women in ASSP areas familiar with the injectable and implant methods increased significantly between the baseline (2014) and endline (2017) survey s, whereas no significant change was detected on knowledge of these methods in non- ASSP areas (2014: 51.3 p=<0.001). Paradoxically, in ASSP areas, the percent of women who knew any modern method significantly declined between the 2014 and 207 survey s by 5.1 percentage points ( p=0.015) , despite the increase in the mean number known. Percent of reproductive- aged women using modern contraception among all women of reproductive age and mix method Table 7.8 shows the change in MCPR between baseline in 2014 and endline in 2017 separately for the ASSP areas (two domains combined) and the non- ASSP areas. MCPR changed f rom 8.9 percent to 9.2 339 percent in the ASSP area s and from 4.8 percent to 5.8 percent in the non- ASSP; neither change was statistically significant. Table 7.9 provides detail on contraceptive method mix in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas at baseline and endli ne. The percent of women using implants and injectables increased in ASSP areas between two survey s (0.9 percent vs. 3.1 percent for implant s, 0.2 percent vs. 0.9 percent for injectables), whereas male condom use declined by 2.6 percentage points in ASSP areas but increased in non- ASSP areas. Although not taken into consider ation in measuring MCPR, t he proportion of women using traditional methods in ASSP areas decreased s lightly from 7.8 percent to 3.6 percent , whereas it increased from 2.7 percent to 4.4 percent in non- ASSP areas. The change in the percentage of use of specific methods was not tested for significance due to the small numbers of women using each method. Figure 7.3 . Percent age of all reproductive -aged women using modern contracepti on in ASSP and non- ASSP areas, by year. *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels is statistically significant at p <0.05. iii. Qualitative findings The qualitative research conducted on other aspects of the ASSP project, (e.g., maternal health, child health, and child nutrition) to further explain the findings from the impact assessment, was not carried out for family planning. However, we did conduct qualitative research in two ASSP -supported health zones in 2015 to better understand cultural norms regarding fertility and barriers to contra ceptive use among both adults and young people in these communities. The results of these qualitative studies appear in two peer -reviewed journal articles (Muandu et al., 2017: Muandu et al., 2018). iv. Limitations The analysis had several limitations, though not specific to family planning alone: Timing of baseline survey . The baseline survey was administered after ASSP project activities had begun (in quarter 5 of the project). This means that family planning service delivery had begun one year before 8.9 4.89.2 5.8 0246810 ASSP areas Non-ASSP areas 2014 2017 340 the baseline survey . Although the primary activities were not carried out as intensely as in later quarters, the project activity before the baseline survey might have some impact on the finding of the baseline survey (thus reducing the observed effects of the project). Seasonality. While the entire sampling area was experiencing the rainy season at baseline, one area, southern Maniema/Tshopo, was in the dry season at endline. This may have biased the findings toward an ASSP impact, as commodities may be more likely to be in stock during the dry season. Although a comparison of wet and dry regions did not find significant differences in MCPR, this potential bias cannot be ruled out. Service interruptions . Over the 4.5- year intervention period, the project experienced multiple implementation challenges in service delivery, financing, transfer of commodities, and related issues. This can be found in the family planning stockouts reported at baseline and endline. The majority of the sampled facilities in ASSP areas were most likely to have condoms (60 percent in Maniema/Tshopo and 39 percent in Nord Ubangi ). Also, more than 97 percent of the facilities in Nord Ubangi and 78 percent in Maniema/Tshopo were stocked out on IUDs on the day of the endline survey . Additionally, 60 percent of facilities in Maniema/Tshopo and 97 percent in Nord Ubangi were stocked out on oral contraceptive pills on the day of the endline survey (results are shown in detail in chapter 3). Also, the service statistics data from DHIS2 shows that family planning commodities were not distributed in equal amounts between health zones and consistent between quarters of the project. In other words, there is a pattern of high- volume distribution at some quarters and some heath zones, while service data shows very few activities in other quarters and health zones. Exclusion of Kasai/ Kasai Central from endline survey . The project was implemented in 52 health zones, divided into three sampling clusters or domains. Because of political unrest in Kasai/Kasai Central, it was not possible to collect endline data in one of the three domains. However, Kasai/Kasai Central had t he largest number of ASSP -supported health zones and the most active uptake of contraception, based on routine service statistics converted to couple -years of protection. For example, in the first 18 quarters of the project (four and a half years), more than 65 percent of the CYP generated in ASSP -supported facilities were in Kasai/Kasai C entral domain. Also, the analysis of service data shows that 69 percent of the IUDs were distributed in the Kasai/Kasai C entral. A major limitation of the study is the abs ence of data at the endline from this domain. All these issues make the comparison of ASSP and non- ASSP areas more difficult and may have diminished the observed impact of the family planning intervention. v. Discussion This chapter describes the performance of the ASSP project relative to the objective of improving modern contraceptive use through increased access to family planning services. Overall the impact evaluation did not show a significant increase in MCPR in ASSP areas that can be attributed to ASSP. This finding masks the fact that in one of the two domains (Nord Ubangi) , the project did have a significant effect on MCPR, whereas in the other , MCPR showed no improvement. Moreover, the project achieved an increase of 1.8 percentage points per year in Nord Ubangi, consistent with the goal that DFID 341 stipulated in 2015. This finding is particularly noteworthy since Nor d Ubangi started at the very low end of the \"S curve,\" where increases in MCPR are most difficult to achieve (Track 20, 2018). Another noteworthy result was the effect of the pro ject on the use of LARC methods. Given the importance of LARCs on the continuity of contraceptive use, this result was also positive in terms of project impact . The third finding of interest was higher knowledge of and use of modern contraceptive methods among women in Maniema/ Tshopo as compared to the other sampling areas in the ASSP baseline. One possible explanation is that women from Maniema/ Tshopo were significantly higher on the wealth index than their counterparts in Nord/Sud Ubangi . Also, this higher M CPR most likely reflects the effects of previous family planning interventions in this area. For future projects we propose the following recommendations: 1) Reduce/avoid sto ckouts of all contraceptive methods, but in particular the implant, given its widespread popularity in the DRC . 2) Conduct a mid- term process evaluation to ensure that the project is being implemented as planned and to identify problems that require mid -course correction. 3) Improve the data quality through training of the personnel on the importance of routine service data. 4) Improve data quality through monitoring and data quality control using a bottom -up data validation system. In conclusion, both des criptive analysis and fully adjusted DID models highlight that the ASSP project has significantly increa sed use of LARC methods. Specifically, the ASSP project had a significant impact on implant use. Also, the descriptive analys es show that the project achieved the increase of 1.8 percentage points per year in MCPR in Nord Ubangi. Furthermore, b oth descriptive analysis and fully adjusted DID models suggest that the ASSP project had a significant impact on modern contraceptive use in Nord Ubangi . However, this impact was not detected in Maniema/Tshopo. T he analysis did not show a significant increase in knowledge of modern contraception, in part because the percentage of women that knew specific methods in ASSP and non-ASSP areas varied over survey s in ways that were difficult to interpret (e.g., loss of knowledge in terms of Cycle Beads and female condom ). 342 References Choi, Y., Fabic, M.

Overview of ASSP approach In the Access to Health care Program, the Department for International Development (DFID) -funded health systems strengthening project that preceded Access to Primary Health Care ( ASSP ), a key aim was to minimize the financial burden of health care costs to users. Health services were provided free of charge to pregnant women and children under five ye ars of age , and nominal fees were charge d to other categories of patients , consistent with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) government 's policy that users participate in health care financing. The Access to Health care Program also provided supplement al payment s to health workers, in addition to the government salary that they receive d. In order to improve the availability and quality of health services , as well as to make progress towards the financial sustainability of the health system, the ASSP pr oject introduced an array of health financing initiatives in project -assisted health zones . These include d the following: Elimination of primes for health workers. In the health zones that were previously receiving financial and technical assistance from DFID 's Access to Health care Program , ASSP eliminated supplemental primes paid to health workers in addition to their government salaries . Introduction of human resource information system. At the same time, ASSP implement ed a complex intervention to improve the payment and distribution of health workers in Kasai Central and Kasai provinces . This was done through introducing a human resource information system, in order to remove ghost workers from the payroll , improve the ti meliness of salary payments to health workers, and updating staff norms to enable more efficient staffing of facilities . This intervention was also supposed to be introduced in Maniema and Nord Ubangi , but this had not occurred by the time the endline surv ey was administered . Mobilizing community financing . In selected health zones, ASSP introduced community -based income generation schemes (Community Health Endowments [CHE]) that were aimed to provide financial risk protection to community members . The CHEs were intended to be a new source of funds for the health system, thereby permitting a reduction in user fees charged to clients . In 2015, routine program data and operations research suggested that the enrollment rates in the program were low due to a number of factors, and in response, ASSP's project management team made a number of changes. These include: improving the program's communication strategy, discontinuing technical support for community -based agricultural income -generation activities, and improving the quality of health services offered at the health center by strengthening health center management and supervision. Standardizing user fees. In all project health zones, ASSP introduced guidelines aimed at standardizing the user fees setting approach, while allowing for differences in fees level across health z ones. Provincial health departments (divisions) participate in the exercise. The guidelines include d provisions to exempt the poor and other vulnerable populations for curative care in all ASSP health zones and delineate selected services to be free of cha rge for all populations. The covered services (services exempt from user charges) included : immunizations, growth monitoring, administration of Vitamin A, distribution of long- lasting insecticide -treated nets (LLINs) to pregnant 355 women and infants during antenatal care and immunization visits, distribution of LLINs in campaigns, prevention of mother -to-child transmission (PMTCT), and basic family planning services. In addition to the financing interventions described above , ASSP carried out other strategies that aimed to improve health service utilization , including those that aimed to improve a) the availabi lity of medicines and equipment and b) community engagement in the management of health services . These strategies are described in the Service Quality chapter of this report . ASSP activities prior to the baseline survey . A key activity initiated during from the very first three months of the project (but which would take several quarters to complete) was negotiation with the communities for a ne w pricing of health services for health centers and hospitals. In most places, the project reported that this initiative was well -received, with prices being decreased by 25 percent to 50 percent; in some health zones, however, where health services previously free, the prices were set too high to be affordable. Data from ASSP's routine project monitoring system suggests that, over the course of Year 1, an increase in health service utilization was noted, with identified well -performing health zones in Maniema (3), P rovince Orientale (3), and South- Kivu (2). Specifically, when disaggregated by the former Access to Healthcare Program and new ASSP health zones , trends over Year 1 suggested that initially decreasing utilization in the former A ccess to Healthcare Program health zones began stabilizing, while the new ASSP health zones continued to experience modest increases in utilization rates. The ASSP program also provided primes and support to the health zone central office . Given that primes as implemented by the A ccess to Healthcare Program were very high and included primes for health facilities so they could provide reduced cost or free health services , IMA requested that the health zones that were part of the Access to Healthcare program progressively decrease primes during the last 6 mon ths of the project. Ultimately, Merlin reduced the primes in the Maniema area to 25 percent, but IRC continued paying 100 percent of primes to the end of the project. ASSP ai med to maintain primes for the district provincial health o ffice and health zone c entral office until the end of the project, but progressively decrease primes for health services as other mechanisms for health financing, such as the CHE strategy described above, increased. As of quarter 3, routine project monitoring data indicated that performance primes, running costs , and supervision expenses were paid to all ASSP assisted health zones on time. ASSP routine data on outpatient services. ASSP's routine monitoring system included an indicator of the annual number of new curative consultations in health facilities per capita. Services included in the indicator include those that were provided by health centers, reference general hospitals, and reference health centers suppo rted by ASSP. The indicator was disaggregated by health zone and was reported every month. As indicated in Figure 8.1, the number of new services provided by ASSP -assisted health facilities increased between 2014 and 2017 in both Maniema/Tshopo and Nord Ub angi. 356 Figure 8.1. Reported annual number of new curative services per capita by sampling domain, 2014 and 2017 ASSP routine data. ii. Quantitative findings Below, we present findings on several dimensions of outpatient health service utilization , including the prevalence of illnesses and injuries, health service utilization , out of pocket health expenditures, and client perceptions of care. We analyze the overall impact of the ASSP strategies on outpatient health service utilization among individuals of all ages as well as among sex, wealth, and survey domain subgroups. It was beyond the scope of the chapter to separately assess the impact of each of the interventions described above. However, it should be noted that separate evaluations of ASSP 's CHE intervention, the human resource information system intervention, and the community engagement intervention were completed b y Tulane as part the Operations Research and Impact Evaluation component of ASSP. In addition, other chapters of this report focus on the effects of the ASSP project on specific types of maternal and child health service utilization . The p revalence of illnesses and injuries was assessed by asking the household representative if each member of the household, including the representative, had been sick or injured without being hospitalized during the four -week period prior to the survey . Indi viduals who had an illness or injury without being hospitalized were eligible for the outpatient module of the questionnaire. (Another module focused on inpat ient health services , but those results are not reported here) . Interviewers asked the household r epresentative a series of questions about the type of illness and injury of each 27.836.059.0 51.4 010203040506070 Maniema/Tshopo N. UbangiAnnual number of new curative services per capita 2014 2017 Key Points The results do not provide empirical evidence of an ASSP program effect on the utilization of outpatient services. The ASSP project was found to have had a statistically significant impact on decreasing the probability of paying a) a non- zero amount for any type of outpatient health care cost and b) a non- zero amount for outpatient consultation. The ASSP project was found to have had a significant impact on improved perceptions of both equipment availability and the cleanliness of the facility, but not on im proved drug availability. 357 eligible household member, whether health services were sought, and if so where, how much was spent on health services , and the perception of several dimensions of health care. Household representatives were encouraged to consult with other household members if they were unsure of the response. Illness and injuries In the adjusted DID models, there was no ev idence that the AS SP project had a significant impact on the prevalence of illnesses and injuries in the past four weeks ( Figure 8.2 and Table 8.1), both for the total population and for each of the subgroups of the population analyzed (based on sex, wealth, and sampling do main). Figure 8.2.

Impact is determined by statistical significance (p<0.05). Green shading indicates that the impact was in the desired direction, and orange shading indicates that the impact was in the undesired dir ection. White shading indicates that no impact was detected. The d escriptive results of the change s over time indicate that, in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas, the prevalence of illness and injuries declined between ba seline and endline (Table 8.2) . In ASSP areas, the 358 percentage of individuals sick or injured in the four weeks prior to the survey declined from 16.0 percent at baseline to 12.3 percent at endline , a reduction that was marginally significant (Table 8.2; p = 0.052) . In non- ASSP areas, the percentage dropped from 16.1 percent to 13.9 percent and did not emerge as statistically significant (Table 8.2; p = 0.535) . Robustness checks The baseline and endline survey s were conducted in different months, creating the potential that differences due to the seasonality of some illnesses may influence the results. This was primarily a concern in southern Maniema, which experienced the rainy season during the baseline survey and the dry season at endline. Therefore, the endline prevalence of illness was compared between ASSP areas of northern and southern Maniema. The results indicate that illnesses more frequently reported in southern Maniema, which was experiencing the dry s eason at endline, compared to northern Maniema, which was experiencing the rainy season (53.4 percent vs. 46.6 percent, p<0.001). Treatment Regarding the treatment received for illnesses and injuries over the one -month period before the survey , there was no evidence of an ASSP program effect on the utilization of outpatient services, as the coefficient for the DID term in the adjusted DID model was not found to be statistically significant among all individuals reported to have been ill or inju red, or for the various subgroups analyzed (Figure 8.3). For the other variables included in the full model, individuals living in Maniema were more likely to utilize health services than individual s living in Nord Ubangi (Table 8.2; p < 0.001), as were individuals living in peri- urban areas compared to individuals living in rural area s (Table 8.3, p = 0.001). 359 Figure 8. 3.

Descriptive results o f the changes in outpatient health service utilization in ASSP a nd non- ASSP areas helps explain why ASSP was not found to have had an impact on the use of outpatient services. Among those individuals who were reported to have been ill or injured, the percentage of individuals who received outpatient treatment dropped i n both ASSP and non- ASSP areas (Figure 8.4). In ASSP areas, the percentage dropped by 14.5 percentage points (Table 8.3; p = 0.001), and in non- ASSP areas, the percentage dropped by 11.7 per centage points (Table 8.4; p = 0 .007). 360 Figure 8.4. Percentage of individuals reported to have been ill or injured in the past four weeks who utilized health services in ASSP and non- ASSP areas by year. *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels is statistically significant at p<0.05. Robustness checks We also estimated a DID model that included as an additional independent variable the distance from households to the closest health facility , to assess whether the exclusion of distance in the models reported above help explains the lack of impact of the ASSP project on health service utilization . Distance was measured by the average straight -line distance of households in each village surveye d to the closest facility, based on GPS coordinates collected from households and health facilities . While distance was found to have had a statistically significant on service utilization, the effect of the ASSP project remained statistically insignifican t. In addition, we also investigated whether the endline utilization rates were different in southern Maniema, which was experiencing the dry season, then in northern Maniema, which was experiencing the rainy season. The results indicate that the percentag e of the ill or injured who used services was larger in southern Maniema (57.9 percent) than among those in northern Maniema (42.1 percent) (p<0.05) ). Out-of-pocket health expenditures To explore the impact of the ASSP project on out of pocket expenditures for outpatient care, the baseline and endine surveys included questions on the total amount spent on outpatient visits . In addition, item -specific questions on the amount spent on consultations , drugs , tests, and transportation were asked . For this analysis, we analyzed two dichotomous indicators and two continuous indicators. T he first dichotomous indicator measures whether the client spent any non -zero amount on the first visit associated with the i llness and injury . This can include the amount spent on travel, consultations, drugs, and tests. T he second indicator measures whether the individuals spent any non -zero amount on 74.968.0 consultation fees for the visit only. The first continuous indicator measures the total amount spent on the first visit in US dollars , and the second measures the amount spent on consultation fees in US dollars . Households paid for health services using both Congolese Francs and US d ollars, but all costs were converted to US dollars for this analysis using the prevailing exchange rates at the time of the survey s. The rates were obtained from the OANDA website (https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/ ). For 2014 and 2017, the exchange rates used were 900 Congolese Francs per US dollar and 1,400 Congolese Francs per US dollar, respectively . To assess the impact of ASSP on the amount of out -of-pocket expenditure, a generalized linear model (GLM) with log link was used, which can account for zero expenditures as well as the skewed distribution of out -of- pocket health spending. The results are reported as marginal effects and statistical tests are against the null hypotheses of equal spending between the ASSP and non- ASSP groups. The results of the adjusted DID model s of the determinants of spending any non- zero amount on health service costs and consultations suggest that the project did have a financially protective effect on households , as indicated by Figure 8.5 (second and fourth columns). For example, the ASSP project was associated with a 4.9 percent decrease in the probability of spending anything for ou tpatient care , and a 17.1 percent decrease in the probability of spending anything for the consultation service, compared to those living in non- ASSP areas (Tables 8. 5 and 8. 7). For the latter outcome, the results on impact were also found to be significan t among each of the sex, wealth, and survey domain subgroups analy zed (Figure 8.5). 362 Figure 8.5. Direction of the impact of ASSP on out of pocket spending for outpatient services overall and within subpopulations based on sex, wealth, and sampling domain.

Impact is determined by statistical significance (p<0.05). Green shading indicates that the impact was in the desired direction, and orange shading indicates that the impact was in the undesired direction. White shading indicates that no impact was detect ed. For the models of the determinants of the level of spending, the results of the GLM DID model suggest that the ASSP project had a statistically significant impact in reducing the amount spent on consultations (Table 8.11), as on average, ASSP clients spent 1.7 US Dollars less than their non-ASSP counterparts, after controlling for other factors . The question of how much households pay for outpatient consultations is of particular interest as guidelines on what consultation fees health facilities should charge were introduced in ASSP health zones with technical support from IMA World Health and its implementing partners . Of course, this indicator excludes other expenditures items, such as drugs, tests, and transportation. This protective effect was also evident among individuals in Nord/Sud Ubangi, but not among those in Maniema/Tshopo. However, it should be noted that t he results on ASS P impact were not found to be significant among any of the sex and wealth groups analyzed. 363 Interesting, despite the fact that the ASSP project was found to have had an impact on decreasing the probably spending anything for consultations , the descriptive results on changes in these health expenditure indicators suggest that the percentage of outpatient clients who paid any non- zero amount for the consultation increased in ASSP areas but by much less than clients in non- ASSP areas . As reported i n Figure 8.6 and Table 8.8, the percentage increased by 12.8 percentage points in ASSP areas (Table 8.8, p = 0.007) and by 45.4 percentage points in non- ASSP areas (Table 8.8, p <0.001) . Figure 8.6. Percentage of clients who reported paying anything for consultations in ASSP and non- ASSP areas by year. *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels is statistically significant at p<0.05. Satisfaction with care among clients Respondents were also asked about their satisfaction with the care that members of the household had received. Respondents were asked whether or not they felt providers had the adequate skills, equipment, and medication necessary to treat the injury or illness, as well as their degree of satisfaction with the time it took to reach the facility and the time the patient spent waiting to be treated. Respondents were also asked about their impressions of the way providers explained the situation to the patient and their impression o f the general cleanliness of the facility, including the rooms and toilets. Responses were collected on a scale which consisted of \"excellent,\" \"good,\" \"acceptable,\" \"bad,\" \"very bad, \" and \"don't know.\" For the purposes of this report, we analyzed three indicators of satisfaction - perceptions of equipment available, perceptions of the drugs available, and perceptions of the cleanliness of the facility. As indicated in Figure 8.7 , the results of the DID models suggest that the ASSP project had a significant impact on improved perceptions of both equipment availability and the cleanliness of the facility, after controlling for other factors . For perceptions of cleanliness, the estimate of ASSP impact also emerged as statistically significant for all of the se x, wealth, and sampling domain subgroups analyzed . For the outcome, satisfaction with equipment, there was evidence of impact among female clients and among individuals living in poorer households, but not among individual in the other subgroups. However, as 56.3 54.5 also indicated in Figure 8. 8, the ASSP project was not found to have had a significant impact on drug perceptions , as the DID term was not statistically significant. Figure 8. 7. Direction of impact of ASSP on perceptions of specifie d aspects of service quality overall and within subpopulations based on sex, wealth, and sampling domain.

Impact is determined by statistical significance (p<0.05). Green shading indicates that the impact was in the desired direction, and orange shading indicates that the impact was in the undesired direction. White shading indicates that no impact was detected. As can be seen from Figures 8. 8, 8.9, and 8.10, the percentage who rated the facility as good or excellent on these three dimensions increased in ASSP areas, and the increase was found to be statistically significant for the indicators of equipment and cleanliness (Table 8. 13, p = 0.001, and Table 8.17, p = 0.001, respectively) . In non-ASSP areas, client ratings of equipment declined significantly, by 10.4 percentage points, between baseline and endline (Table 8.13, p = 0.004), while client ratings of drug availability and cleanliness did not significantly change between baseline and endline. 365 Figure 8.8.

Limitations Several potential limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings. Timing of baseline survey : The baseline survey was administered after ASSP project activities had begun, which could potentially bias the estimates of the impact of the project on utilization rates . As described earlier in this chapter, ASSP -supported activities during Year 1 included the procurement and distribution of drugs and equipment in all ASSP health zones, and the phasing out of primes to health workers in Maniema. According to ASSP's quarterly reports, routine data collected by the project shows that utilization rates declined in Maniema over the course of Year 1 , but increased in Nord Ubangi. The decline in Maniema is noteworthy and may partially reflect the effects of decreased health worker motivation caused by the withdrawal of health worker primes, a premise that is consistent with the results of an operations research study on health worker motivation (Maini et al. 2016). If utilization did in fact decrease in Maniema and increase in Nord Ubangi, as indicated by ASSP's routine data, this suggests that estimates of impact is overstated in Maniema and understated in Nord Ubangi. The direction of the bias in the overall estimates of impact on outp atient health service utilization is unclear. Seasonality: Patterns in the reporting of illnesses are seasonal, with malaria being more common in the rainy season, and some raspatory illnesses being more common in the dry season. More over, seasonality may affect the likelihood that households took advantage of facility -based health services if traveling to health facilities was more difficult in the rainy season. Seasonality may also be associated with temporal variations in household income, and as a result, the ability to pay for services. To explore these issues, we compared the percentage of individuals reporting illnesses and utilizing services in northern Maniema, which was rainy at endline, and with those of southern Maniema, which was dry . We found that the reporting of illnesses and percentage utilizing services was higher in southern 29.231.7 31.057.4 than in northern Maniema. This provides an indication that administering the endline s urvey in the dry season in southern Maniema may have resulted in understating the estimated impact of the project on the prevalence of illnesses and injuries while overstating the estimated impact on outpatient health service utilization . Service interru ptions: The fact that the endline survey was conducted during a period when ASSP was experiencing implantation disruptions could have potentially bias ed the evaluation findings if the disruptions led to a decrease in health service utilization rates . To explore this issue, we conducted a review of quarterly service statistics for outpatient health service utilization from January -March 2016 to October -December 2017 and did not find any evidence that the number of services provided dipped during the period of the disruptions . While this finding does not lend support to the premise that project interruptions resulted in drops in utilization rates, we cannot rule out this possibility . Power to detect differences in outcomes: As described in Chapter 2, the study was powered (80 percent ) to detect statistically significant differences of 10 percent or lower for a series of population - based interventions and health outcomes. For other indicators, such as the percentage of children with fever, diarrhea, and suspected pneumonia who received treatment (between 12 and 20 percentage points) , the study has less power . However, the analyses of outpatient health service utilization are based on a much bigger sample size, the sample of de facto household members of all ages , which would increase the power of the analysis. It should be pointed out that the study was not powered to detect differences by province, or within subgroups, which may help explain the insignificance of subgroup program effects (although a number of these effects did emerge as statistically significant). iv. Discussion This chapter focus es on the impact of the ASSP project on several dimensions of outpatient health service utilization among all individuals who reported an illness or injury in the one -month period prior to the survey . Regarding the use of outpatient services, the results of the DID models do not provide empirical evidence that ASSP had a program effect on the utilizati on of outpatient services , as the estimated impact of ASSP was statistically in significant . In fact , in ASSP areas, the percent of those ill or injured who report using outpatient utilization services was found to have declined from 2014 to 2017 (although declines were also found in non- ASSP areas as well). In addition, when the model was restricted to various population subgroups - defined by province, wealth groups, and sex - the results were also insignificant. It should also be noted that an operations research study on the demand for health services based on data collected from the baseline survey found few statistically significant differences in care- seeking behavior s for recent illnesses across genders, levels of education, wealth, and geographic areas (Hutchinson 2016) . In none of the age groups are men and women in ASSP areas statistically diff erent in their care- seeking behavior s, and while differences were evident for wealth quintile but in no cases are these differences statistically significant. 368 That ASSP was not found to have had a significant impact on utilization rates appears to be inconsistent with the results that the ASSP project had a significant impact on improv ing financial protection and on the quality of services in ASSP areas (the latter results are presented in the service utilization chapter) . For example, the results of the outpatient health care expenditure models suggest that the ASSP program decreased the probability of paying for outpatient consultations compared to non- ASSP areas . This is likely due to the introduction of user fee guidelines in ASSP areas, one of the hea lth financing strategies of the ASSP project. In addition, as reported in the next chapter, several dimensions of service quality were found to have improve d in ASSP areas. These include the percentage of facilities with malaria diagnostic capabilitie s, adequate equipment, an adequate drug supply, and the minimum package of curative services. Perceptions of quality of care among clients also improved between 2014 and 2017, as the results of the DID models suggest that the ASSP project had a significant impact on improved perceptions of both equipment availability and the cleanliness of the facility, after controlling for other factors . However, the project impact on perceptions of improved drug availability was not found to be statisti cally significant. However, t here are a number of possible explanations for why ASSP did not have an impact on t he use of outpatient services. First, findings from an operations research study conducted as part of the ASSP project found that job satisfac tion of health workers and other factors related to health worker motivation decreased in ASSP areas that had been exposed to the DFID project that preceded ASSP, the Access to Healthcare Program (Maini et al., 2016) . These areas include all the ASSP healt h zones in Maniema. This dampening effect of health worker motivation , which may have adversely affect ed the quality of services , was likely due to ASSP withdrawing the primes and performance -based payments that health workers had received under the Access to Healthcare program. However, the withdrawal of payments occurred prior to the baseline survey in 2014, so this factor does not seem to be a plausible explanation for why outpatient health service utilization declined over the study period. A second potential reason for why ASSP was not found to have had an impact concerns the timing of the baseline and endline survey s. The baseline surve y occurred almost one year after the project ha d started, and as a result, some increases in utilization rates due to the ASSP project may have already occurred prior to the baseline survey . Moreover , the endline survey occurred during a time when the ASSP project areas were experiencing disruptions in the support received by ASSP, as descri bed in the background chapter. While t hese disruptions could have reduced health service utilization , an analysis of quarterly data in ASSP areas did not yield any e vidence that utilization rates dropped during the period of inte rruptions . Other possible explanations for why the project did not have an impact on outpatient health service utilization rates include the fact that the implementation of the CHE intervent ion, which was one of the key elements of ASSP's strategy, was not found to be working as planned to mobilize community financing and further protect households from out -of-pocket health payments , as reported by Blum, Hotchkiss, et al. (2015), and the pers istence of various forms of demand- side barrier s to health service utilization , as supported by the results of the qualitative analysis that focused on treatment of childhood illnesses. 369 Finally, it should also be noted that, although information was collect ed on self-reported symptoms of illnesses and injuries , clinical diagnose s were not made , and as a result, we were unable to quantify individuals' need for health services . To explore how the measure of outpatient care compares with the results of other household survey s in the DRC, we compared our baseline data with the 2013/14 DHS, which included a question for all de facto household members on whether, in the four weeks preceding the interview, the person had been treated by a health care provider, a pharmacist or a tra ditional without being hospitalized, that is to say, outpatient care. This involved recalculating our measure of outpatient care to reflect the number of persons who used services relative to the entire population, rather than the population who were repor ted to be sick or injured. The results of the two survey s were somewhat similar. In Nord Ubangi, the percent of the population that used health services was 9.3 for the ASSP baseline survey vs. 18.1 in the DHS, and in Maniema, the percent was 12.2 for the ASSP baseline survey vs. 13.1 for the DHS. It should be noted that DHS indicator included health care visits that were in addition to consul tations treat illnesses and injuries, including maternal health care and preventive care. As mentioned above, the ASSP project tracked a different indicator of outpatient health service utilization as part of the project's internal project monitoring system. The indicator measures the annual number of services new consultations provided per capita, and as reported in Figure 8.1, the routine data shows that service provision in ASSP areas increased, which conflicts with the finding that utilization decreased. It should be noted that the indicators are very different - the indicator based on routine data counts services and not individuals , is measured over one year and not one month, and is based on the entire population, not the more restricted population of those reporting illnesses and injuries. Moreover, the quality of sources both the service statistics and the population estimate s used to calculate the indicator is unknown, as the DHIS2 is relatively new in the DRC and has not been subject to a data quality audit. These issues make it difficult to make careful comparisons between the two sources of infor mation that would be needed to explain the discrepancy in the findings. 370 References Blum, Lauren, David Hotchkiss, Anicet Yemwini, Cel\u00e9 Manianga, Paul Lusamba, Ann Marie Yongho, and Travis Porter. 2015.

Overview of the ASSP approach One of Access to Primary Health Care Project 's (ASSP's ) strategies for improving child nutrition and maternal and child health is to enhance service delivery and quality at supported health facilities. In this evaluation, this improvement is measured by the availability of medical equipment and supplies, increase in the services offered, and improvement in the diagnostic capabilities within the health facilities. The ASSP project was designed to strengthen the medicine and equipment supply chains in several ways. Information systems, including the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS 2), were implemented to support resource allocation and stock management; trainings on these topics were held at regional drug distribution centers and he alth zone offices. Further, data quality assurance procedures were instituted. Purchasing strategies such as gap purchases, expanded drug offering, and expedited delivery times were employed to decrease the incidence of stock -outs in health facilities. ASS P also supported the construction of new health facilities as well as the renovation of existing facilities. As a result, increases in the facilities' capabilities to offer services were intended. At the time of the 2017 endline survey , 202 health faciliti es had been either renovated or constructed. Community participation and satisfaction with health services are also important components of quality. The ASSP project sought to increase these indicators through Comit\u00e9 de d\u00e9veloppement de l'aire de sant\u00e9 (Health area development committee, CODESA) revitalization, the Community Health Endowment, and the Simplified Community Scorecard. CODESAs serve as liaisons between health centers and the community. While CODESAs have a long history in the DRC, many had beco me inactive by the start of ASSP in 2014. ASSP sought to revitalize the CODESAs through recruitment, training, and support. An active CODESA brings community needs and concerns to the health facility and carries messages from the health facility out to res idents. The Community Health Endowment was an arrangement in which community members were encouraged to raise revenue, either through farming, other income -generating activities, or cash contributions, which w as given in support of the health facility. Those who participated were to benefit from reduced user fees. Participants were expected to increase their sense of ownership of their health services, among other outcomes. The Simplified Community Scorecard was an intervention in which communi ty members came together to rate their health center on a series of service quality indicators. At the same time, the health workers rated their facility on the same set of indicators. The groups then came together to discuss the results and make an action plan to improve service quality in their community. This was also designed to improve communication between the health facility and the community and foster a sense of community ownership. Finally, ASSP's activities , aimed at improving service quality as well as the health financing interventions described elsewhere, may also have an impact on health worker satisfaction, which can have a synergistic relationship with service quality and patient satisfaction. ASSP's activities prior to the baseline survey . To improve health services delivery and management, ASSP's quarterly reports stated that trainings and continuing education were provided to health care providers and managers throughout the first year of the ASSP project . Subject matter themes included 410 (1) management of primary health care; (2) f inance and essential drug management; (3) f amily planning, care and treatment of sexual and gender -based violence survivors; (4) post -abortion care; (5) e ssential and emergency obstetrical care, assisted births, essential and emergency care for newborns; (6) vaccination campaigns (reach every zone); (7) t reatment protocols (including training for prescribing drugs); (8) l aboratory technical training on blood security, malaria and TB diagnostics; and (9) antenatal care and nutrition. Implementing partners conducted joint supervision missions, focusing mainly on drug supply and financial management, while health zone management teams conducted integrated supervision missions to health centers, with an aim to improve the delivery of the minimum package of activities in all assisted health centers. Preparatory workshops were initiated at the national level, culminating in the training of 33 people as national trainers, and followed -up with onsite trainings in reproducti ve health and family planning in different clusters. Furthermore, the human resource information system and computerized health information system (i.e. District Health Information Software or DHIS2) components of the program continued to evolve positively with the major activities concentrated on the consolidation of information, harmonization of stakeholder priorities, and organization of frequent training sessions and multi -stake holder workshops (USAID, JICA, Ministry of F inance and Planning, Ministry of Health, and others). Contracts for the rehabilitation of six health facilities were awarded and, in preparation for launching the construction work, IMA received 10 manual brick presses. While waiting for rehabilitation and construction, all functioning health facilities received the first batch of basic equipment, composed of operating tables and mini -kits (including stethoscopes, fetal stethoscopes, scales for babies, young children and adults, sphygmomanometers, thermometers, forceps , and other small supplies). In addition, IMA received 28 L and Cruiser pickups to improve drug availability in health facilities, facilitate field supervisions , and help move cons truction materials throughout the health zones. Finally, a study was undertaken during Year 1 to analyze the health centers in the project area to determine t he level of construction intervention needed per building. By the end of Year 1, there were three new construction sites underway, with another five active major renovation projects underway. ASSP routine data . To track the availability of drugs in health facilities, ASSP reported the \" average quarterly number and percentage of health facilities reporting stock -outs of one day or more of any of the following 5 drugs within the quarter: Depo Provera, Oxytocin, SP, Zinc, Amoxicillin 250. \" The time of the endline, the quarterly report indicated that overall, 61 percent of facilities reported such stock -outs. Equipment was not explicitly tracked, but the number of health facilities with functional cold chain and solar lighting was reported. ASSP also reported that at the time of the endline survey , 202 health facilities had been rehabilitated or constructed in project areas, which included Kasai. Health worker compensation was tracked through an indicator of the \"number of health zones in w hich at least 80 percent of health personnel have had their pay (salaries, prime de risque and prime locale) captured in the human resources information system.\" Health worker and community satisfaction were not tracked. 411 ii. Quantitative findings This section presents findings from the baseline and endline health facility survey s on service quality including basic infrastructure, equipment, drug supply, availability of a minimum package of preventive and curative services, malaria diagnostic capabi lities, and job satisfaction among health workers. Findings from the household survey related to the degree to which communities are informed about health services and satisfaction with involvement in health service decision -making are also presented. The sample size of the health facility survey was lower than others in this report; therefore, significance in analyses of facility -level data is considered at p<0.10. Basic infrastructure As described in Chapter 3 , basic infrastructure improved in ASSP -suppo rted facilities. The percentage of ASSP facilities with functional electricity on the day of the survey increased from 17.4 to 26.4 percent. Water and sanitation infrastructure at ASSP health facilities also improved between baseline and endline. The perce ntage of facilities with drinking water from an improved source increased from 3.8 to 19.5 percent, and the percentage with sanitary toilets increased from 59.4 to 77.0 percent. Health facility service readiness Figure 9.1 displays the impact of ASSP on measures of health facility service readiness both overall and within sampling domains. For all measures assessed, ASSP either improved or had no impact; in no areas did ASSP have a negative impact. Figure 9.1.

Impact is determined by statistical significance (p<0.05). Green shading indicates that the impact was in the desired direction, and orange shading indicates that the impact was in the undesired direction. White shading indicates that no impact was detected. 412 Adequate equipment Representatives from health facilities were asked whether the facility had pieces of basic equipment and if so how many were in working order. Using this information, the percentage of the recommended equipment (defined as having all six pieces of basic equipment [thermometers, stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, adult scales, pediatric scales, and timers ] in working order and in the minimum recommended quantities ) present on the day of the survey were calculated for each health facility (Kaur & Hall, 2001) . Health facilities were considered to have \"adequate equipment\" if they had at least 75 percent of this equipment. No significant ASSP program impact on adequacy of equipment was detected in the difference -in- difference (DID) model either overall ( Table 9.1 ) or within Nord/Sud Ubangi (Table 9.2) or Maniema/Tshopo (Table 9.3). Overall, within each domain and survey wave, no more than 13 percent of health facilities had adequate equipment (Table 9. 4 and Figure 9.2) Figure 9. 2. Percentage of facilities with adequate equipment on the day of the survey in ASSP and non- ASSP areas , by year. *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels is statistically significant at p <0.05. Adequate drug supply Respondents were asked to report whether specific drugs were in stock on the day of the survey. Three of ASSP's designated tracer drugs w ere assessed; t hese tracer drugs are Oxytocin, S ulfadoxine - pyrimethamine , and Amoxicillin. The number of drugs (out of three) that were in stock was tabulated for each facility. Facilities were characterized as having an adequate drug supply if all three drugs were in stock on the day of the survey . Overall, n o ASSP program im pact on adequacy of the drug supply was detected ( Table 9.5 ). However, the ASSP project had a significant and positive impact on the drug supply in Nord Ubangi (Table 9.6). No such impact was found in Maniema/Tshopo (Tabl e 9.7). Table 9.8 and Figure 9.3 show the percentage of 11.612.5 02468101214161820 2014 2017ASSP areas 9.08.4 02468101214161820 2014 2017Non adequate in ASSP and non- ASSP areas. In 2017, 44.4 percent of ASSP - supported health facilities had an adequate drug supply. Overall, there was no significant change between 2014 and 2017 in either ASSP or non -ASSP areas. Figure 9. 3. Percentage of health facilities with all three tracer drugs on the day of the survey in ASSP and non-ASSP areas , by year. *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels is statistically significant at p <0.05. Minimum package of preventive services Respondents reported whether their facility was currently offering a range of services. The percentage of facilities offering all preventive services as defined by the DRC's essential package of services was calculated (Wright, 2015) . These preventive serv ices are antenatal care , family planning consult ations , postnatal care, vaccination, and growth monitoring. The DID model found that the ASSP project had a significant impact on the prevalence of the minimum package of preventive services relative to non -ASSP areas (Table 9.9 ). Facilities in Maniema/Tshopo, peri -urban areas, and those that were reference health centers were significantly more likely to offer the minimum package of preventive services. The ASSP project had a significant positive impact on the availability of preventive services in Nord Ubangi (Table 9.10. ) Between baseline and endline , the percentage of ASSP facilities offering all preventive services increased significantly, from 63.8 percent of facilities in 2014 to 95.0 percent in 2017 (p<0.001) (Figure 9.4 ). This majority of this increase was due to the addition of family planning servic es (results not shown), 42.044.4 01020304050 2014 2017ASSP areas 40.3 30.5 01020304050 2014 2017Non -ASSP areas Key Points The ASSP project improved the availability of preventive services and malaria diagnostic capabilities. ASSP did not have an impact on adequacy of equipment, drug supply, curative services, or community participation. Overall, community participation and t imeliness of health worker salary payments increased significantly in ASSP areas. 414 particularly in Nord/Sud Ubangi (Table 9.5 ). There was no significant change in preventive services in non-ASSP areas. Minimum package of curative services The percentage of facilities offering the minimum package of curative services was also calculated (Wright, 2015). The definition of \"curative services\" includes treatment for tuberculosis, treatment of sexually -transmitted infections, minor surgery, and skilled birth attendance. Nutritional rehabilitation and c urative services are also included in the definition; however, the survey did not contain these items and they are not included in the analysis. No program impact on the minimum package of services was detected overall (Table 9.13) or within survey domains (Tables 9.14 and 9.15) . Facilities located in Maniema/Tshopo , in peri-urban areas , and those that were reference health centers were significantly more likely to offer the minimum package of curative services. The percentages of facilities offerin g the minimum package of curative services are shown in Figure 9.4 . In 2017, 12.5 percent of facilities in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas offered the minimum package of curative services. This percentage did not change significantly between baseline and endl ine ( Table 9.16). Malaria diagnos tic capabilities Respondents reported whether the facility had the capability of diagnosing malaria on the day of the survey . ASSP had a significant positive impact on rates of malaria diagnostic capabilities (Table 9.10). Facilities in peri- urban areas, reference health centers, and facilities with four or more beds were significantly more likely to be able to diagnose malaria ( Table 9.17). This impact was not detected within individual sampling domains (Table 9.18 a nd 9.19). Figure 9. 4 shows the percentages of facilities with th ese capacit ies. The percentage of ASSP -supported facilities with malaria diagnostic capabilities increased from 60.9 percent to 70.0 percent, although this increase was not statistically significant. Facilities in non -ASSP areas decreased from 58.2 percent to 50.0; again, this change was not statistically significant ( Table 9.20). 415 Figure 9. 4. Percentage of health facilities with the minimum package of preventive services and curative services, and malaria diagnosis capabilities in ASSP and non- ASSP areas , by year. *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels is statistically significant at p<0.10. Robustness check Seasonality may have an impact on the availability of medicines and supplies, as wet conditions make transportation more difficult. Therefore, comparisons of the availability of tracer drugs in the northern (i.e. rainy) and the southern (i.e. dry) regions of Maniema at endline were made. Findings indicate that dry regions were significantly more likely to have tracer drugs in stock. Forty- six percent of facilities in dry regions had all tracer drugs in stock, compared with 21 percent of facilities in rainy regions (p=0.051). Community participatio n Figure 9.5 displays the impact of ASSP on measures of community participation in health services, both overall and within sampling domains. Overall and within subgroups based on the sex of the head of household, ASSP had no significant impact. ASSP significantly worsened satisfaction with community participation in health services in Nord Ubangi and significantly areas 2014 2017 416 Figure 9.5.

Impact is determined by statistical significance (p<0.05). Green shading indicates that the impact was in the desired direction, and orange shading indicates that the impact was in the undesired direction. White shading indicates that no impact was detected. Information about health services offered in the community During the household survey , heads of households were asked whether they agreed that communities are informed about the availability of health services offered in the community. Overall, the ASSP project had no impact on whether heads of households agreed that they were informed ( Table 9.21) ; there was also no project impact found within samp ling domains and sexes (Tables 9.22- 9.25) . Figure 9. 6 shows the percentages who agreed i n ASSP and non- ASSP areas. The percentage who agreed that they were informed increased significantly in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas; this increase was particularly prominent in Nord/Sud Ubangi ( Table 9.26). Again, these increases were not found to be asso ciated with the ASSP project as non- ASSP areas experienced similar improvements. Satisfaction with community involvement in decision- making about health services Heads of households were also asked whether they were satisfied with community involvement in decision -making about health services. Overall, the ASSP project had no impact on satisfaction with community involvement (Table 9.27) . There was also no project impact found within sampling domains (Table s 9.28 & 9.29) . ASSP had a negative impact on the satisfaction of female heads -of-household (Table 9.30) and a positive impact on male heads -of-household (Table 9.31). 417 Again, the percentage who were satisfied (defined as either \"very satisfied\" or \"satisfi ed\") increased significantly in both ASSP non- ASSP areas ( Figure 9. 6). In 2017, over half of respondents were satisfied. ASSP areas in Maniema/Tshopo saw significant increases, as did non- ASSP areas in Nord/Sud Ubangi ( Table 9.32). Figure 9. 6.

Health worker satisfaction and salary payment Figure 9.6 shows the impact of ASSP on health worker satisfaction and timeliness of salary payment , both overall and within sampling domains.

Impact is determined by statistical significance (p<0.05). Green shading indicates that the impact was in the desired direction, and orange shading indicates that the impact was in the undesired dire ction. White shading indicates that no impact was detected. Health workers, defined as those workers at surveyed health facilities who provide direct patient care, were asked to indicate their level of overall job satisfaction. No program impact was detec ted ( Table 9.33). The percentage of health workers who reported being either satisfied or very satisfied was calculated ( Figure 9. 7). Levels of health worker satisfaction did not change significantly in ASSP areas overall, although it declined in the subsets of health workers in Maniema/Tshopo , in reference health centers , and in facilities with four or more beds (Table 9.36). Health workers were also asked to report whether their salary payments were up -to-date on the day of the survey (Figure 9. 7). No program impacts were detected overall (Table 9.37) , although the ASSP project had a significant positive impact on the subset of respondents in Nord Ubangi (Table 9.38) . Health workers in Maniema/Tshopo and at facilities with observation beds were si gnificantly less likely to have an up- to-date salary than health workers in other settings , while working in a rural setting was positively associated with having an up- to-date salary. The percentage of health workers in ASSP areas who reported that their salaries were up -to-date increased significantly from 32.8 percent to 52.8 percent (p<0.001) ( Table 9.40). Non -ASSP areas also experienced increases, but they were not statistically significant. 419 Figure 9. 7. Health workers' overall satisfaction with their jobs and reports of timeliness of salary payments in ASSP and non- ASSP areas , by year. *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels is statistically significant at p<0.05. iii. Limitations Timing of baseline : At the time the baseline survey was conducted, the AS SP project had just completed its first delivery of equipment and supplies to supported facilities, and supportive supervision had begun to occur. This may cause ASSP's impact on equipment and supplies t o be understated. Seasonality : The implication of the seasonality analysis is that the impact of ASSP on drug supply in the Maniema/Tshopo domain may be slightly overestimated, as part of that region was experiencing a dry season at endline. The dry season was found to be correlated with availability of drugs. Service interruptions : ASSP was experiencing service interruptions during the endline survey , which may have impacted the flow of supplies and drugs to the facilities. This may have indirectly i mpacted health worker satisfaction, as they were on the front lines of the interruptions. Again, this would result in an understate ment of the project's overall impact. Power to detect differences : The analysis was not powered to detect differences at th e health facility or health worker level. Therefore, it is plausible that impacts occurred that could not be detected in the DID model. The p -value considered statistically significant has been adjusted to p<0.10 in the health facility analyses to compensate for the lower sample size. iv. Discussion This chapter describes indicators of service quality in ASSP and non- ASSP areas in 2014 and 2017, as well as impacts of the ASSP project on these outcomes. The DID analysis found that the ASSP project had a positive impact on the percentage of health facil ities offering the minimum package of preventive services . All things equal, the probability that a facility in an ASSP area offered the minimum package of 60.9 32.857.0 54.8 020406080 Satisfaction with 2017 420 preventive services at endline was 41.1 percent higher because of the ASSP project. This program impact was driven by Nord Ubangi , where the probability was 73.8 percent higher . The improvement i s largely attributable to the increase in family planning services facilitated by ASSP and described in Chapter 7 . In Nord Ubangi, facilities in ASSP and non- ASSP areas had similar ly low levels of coverage of preventive services at baseline; by endline, fa cilities in ASSP areas had improved while those in non - ASSP areas had worsened. As there had been no predecessor project in Nord or Sud Ubangi , this region had a lot of potential to improve when a project was implemented. In contrast, levels of coverage in the Maniema/Tshopo region, which has historically received more donor attention, were quite high at baseline and remained high throughout the project. ASSP areas experienced increases in the percentage of facilities with adequate equipment , while similar trends were not observed in non- ASSP areas. The improvements in ASSP -supported facilities were not statistically significant, which may be due in part to the relatively low number of facil ities in the sample. Facilities that were newly -constructed through the ASSP project were not surveyed . Therefore, endline estimates of the prevalence of equipment may be understated. Further, at the time of the baseline survey , the ASSP project had just completed its first delivery of equipment and supplies to supported facilities while at the time of the endline survey the ASSP project was experiencing service interruptions. Overall, though, the positive direction of the trend in ASSP areas is promising. ASSP -supported facilities also saw improvements in the drug supply. These changes were not statistically significant which may be due to the timing of the baseline and the service inte rruptions occurring during the endline survey . The sub- analys es by domain show that while the ASSP project was not found to have a significant impact in Maniema/Tshopo, the project's impact in Nord Ubangi was strong. This may indicate that the ASSP project maintained the service levels of the predecessor project in Maniema/Tshopo while making gains in Nord Ubangi, where no project had been operating. While progress has been made, the availability of drugs is still low, with 45 percent of facilities or less having all three tracer drugs in stock on the day of the survey . The ASSP project did not improve the percentage of patients satisfied with the drug supply at the facility (Chapt er 8). Data from interviews conducted for an evaluation of ASSP's Si mplified Community Scorecard approach found frustration on the part of health workers and community members regarding the availability of drugs in the facility; patients reported being required to purchase drugs elsewhere at added cost. However, there was evidence that changes to the system could have an impact; o ne health facility had arranged to receive larger shipments of drugs (three months' worth as opposed to one month), which had all eviated the stock -out issue. Continued emphasis on supply chain improvements , strengthening physical and information infrastructure, and the use of data -driven procurement systems for both equipment and the drug supply may result in significant change in t ime. In terms of community satisfaction and participation, there were positive and significant trends in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas. Again, while no ASSP impact was detected overall , the trends are encouraging; the subgroup analysis found that ASSP increased satisfaction with community participation in Maniema/Tshopo. The impact of ASSP on community empowerment and participation is explored in two separate operations research reports focused on the Community Health Endowment and Simplified Community Scorecard. Incorporating more community education and outreach into ASSP's activities (in 421 conjunction with a behavior change communication strategy) could further strengthen community satisfaction and participation. Employees' satisfaction with their jobs has the potential to impact service quality and patient satisfaction . Overall, ASSP did not have an impact on j ob satisfaction among health workers ; this measure declined slightly in ASSP areas and greatly in non- ASSP areas. An AS SP project impact was detected in Nord/Sud Ubangi. This may be related to the finding that a larger proportion of health worker salaries are being paid on time in ASSP areas compared with non-ASSP areas , particularly in Nord/Sud Ubangi . In general, satisfaction remains rather low at 57 percent in ASSP areas . The ASSP project consists of a range of interventions that may have differing impacts on health worker satisfaction. For example, ASSP's efforts to improv e the punctuality of salary payments likely improved job satisfaction . Job training also typically improves job satisfaction, as employees feel valued by their employer and more competent in their work. On the other hand, a n operations research study of the impact of ASSP's removal of performan ce-based -financing payments found that the project may also worsen job satisfaction by adding tasks for which there is no additional compensation. The study also found that perceived unfairness in the process by which health workers were selected for training could worsen job satisfaction as well. It seems clear that improving the timely payment of health worker salaries is a key strategy for improving job satisfaction. As limited research into determinants of job satisfaction among Congolese health workers has been conducted, more evidence should be generated and used to inform interventions specifically focused on improving health worker satisfaction in this setting. Further, any complex health project should include monitoring for interventions' unintended negative impacts on health worker job satisfaction . 422 References Wright, J. (2015).

Overview of the ASSP approach As part of the strategy to improve health outcomes in the DRC, the Access to Primary Health Care Project ( ASSP ) project incorporated a community -level WASH intervention to complement its health systems strengthening approach. The intervention was intended to provide access to safe drinking water through several mechanisms including spring protection, well drilling, cistern installation, and distribution of household- and community- level water filtration devices, as well as, increase use of improved sanitation through the installation of hygienic household latrines and household waste pits . The intervention also incl uded WASH education, BCC activities, and strengthening community capacity through the development of WASH volunteer committees and community action plans. WASH education and BCC activities focused on handwashing, proper feces and waste disposal, and other identified areas of need. The exact activities undertaken in each village varied depending on the needs and availability of resources. ASSP's WASH program consisted of two intervention models, the Village Assaini (Healthy Village) Phase 2 (VA2) model (which is the National approach) and the Hybrid model, with the primary contrast s being the allocation of greater responsibility and leaders hip of WASH activities onto communities in the Hybrid model , as well as, the construction of cisterns and distribution of life straws. The Hybrid model was primarily implemented in Kasai, which is not included in this analysis. A small number of villages i n Maniema/Tshopo participated in the Hybrid model; however, none of these were selected in the survey . The VA2 intervention consists of a series of 10 steps known as Pas \u00e0 Pas (Step -by-Step) that form a uniform process of getting a village certified by the Health Zones as a \"healthy village.\" However , these steps may vary in how they are implemented from village to village depending on local input and water and sanitation risk assessments. The process for VA2 consists of the following: Step 0: Community decision - to participate is made between villages and h ealth zones. Step 1: Mutual engagement - Awareness raising at the community level and signing of a memorandum of understanding between Zonal Chief Medical Officer (CMO) , Zonal WASH supe rvisors , and the community to participate in the VA2 program. Step 2: Initial evaluation - Implementing an initial Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey by the local WASH supervisor and a community representative . Step 3: Participatory analyses - Completing a participatory analysis of current WASH conditions in the village. Step 4: Local governance - Establishing a local (village level) WASH volunteer committee. Step 5: Community planning - Developing a community action plan (CAP) including the s election of interventions, which can be implemented to alleviate the identified problems. Step 6: Community action - Implementing the CAP , including strengthening of community capacity, the construction of appropriate water and sanitation infrastructure , and delivery of BCC interventions. BCC focus es on handwashing, proper faeces and waste disposal , and other identified areas of need. The exact activities to be taken, including infrastructure, vary from village to village depending on the needs and available resources in the village. In general, VA2 453 provide s a community water source, household latrines , and household waste pits in each village. Step 7: Final evaluation - Conducting a final KAP survey to determine changes in WASH infrastructure, behavior, and practices in the village. At this step, the community also elaborate s maintenance and local c ontingency plans. Step 8: Certification - Conducting a final visit by a Zonal CMO to determine if VA2 program standards have been achieved and certification of the village as a \"Healthy Village .\" Post -Certification - Follow up on the progress of the village every 12 months and evaluate whether the village still meets the healthy village criteria. ASSP activities prior to the baseline survey : In the first year of the ASSP program, ASSP quarterly reports detailed efforts to start- up the WASH component that focused mainly on coordination with other national, regional , and provincial authorities rather than direct program activities. This included planning field activities with different stakeholders, hosting several meetings and consultations, procuring necess ary equipment for field activities, monitoring and scale -up, and developing a training and post -training plan in collaboration with key partners. To support the planned launch of WASH activities in April 2014, IMA World Health completed the following preparation activities: (1) a site visit to Gbadolite, Nord Ubangi to initiate planning, mapping, and validation discussions of local activities; (2) participation in a workshop for the validation of the tools and new survey s in the Pas \u00e0 Pas tra ining curriculum; (3) organization of a briefing workshop on the WASH program for new field personnel recruited to manage the ASSP activities; and (4) launch of a training series, including training of trainers for the Pas \u00e0 Pas survey s. ASSP routine env ironmental health data: ASSP's quarterly report showed that at the time of the endline survey , 88 of the 1 ,360 villages in Nord Ubangi and 152 of the 2,454 villages in Maniema/Tshopo had initiated the VA2 approach. Of these, 32 in Nord Ubangi and 66 in Maniema/Tshopo had achieved Healthy Village certification. i. Quantitative findings This section presents findings from the baseline and endline survey s on WASH outcomes including use of improved water sources, use of improved sanitation, and handwashing, specifically, the percentage of heads of households who reported that they wash their hands after using the toilet. The results presented are limited to responses provided by the head of household, which totaled 6, 841 responses . Figure 10.1 displays the degree of ASSP impact on use of improved water sources, improved sanitation, and on prevalence of handwashing after us ing the toilet , as determined by difference -in-difference (DID) models . Results are shown overall and for subsets of the population based on sampling domain and wealth. Overall, and for each sub- group examined, with the exception of Nord/Sud Ubangi the ASS P project significantly improved use of improved sources of household drinking water. 454 Sources of household drinking water The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) categorizes sources of drinking water into i mproved and unimproved categories. Improved water sources include piped water systems into an individual's home, yard, or plot, public taps, tubewells and boreholes, protected springs, protected wells, and collected rainwater (WHO, 2017). Unimproved water sources include surface water, unprotected springs, unprotected wells, water from tanks on carts, water from tanker trucks, and bottled water. The JMP also defines a 30- minute standard for the maximum amount of time it should take, for a roundtrip, to coll ect water (WHO, 2017). Figure 10.1 . Direction of the impact of ASSP on water and sanitation outcomes overall and within subpopulations based on wealth and sampling domain. Notes: Each line represents a fully -adjusted DID probit model. Impact is determined by statistical significance (p<0.05) . Green shading indicates that the impact was in the desired direction, and orange shading indicates that the impact was in the undesired direction. White shading indicates that no impact was detected. Results from the fully adjusted difference -in-differe nce model (Table 10.1) show t hat the probability of households in ASSP areas having an improved water source was 10.295 percent higher than households in non- ASSP areas , indicating a statistically significant positive ASSP project impact. Model results Access to improved water source Access to improved sanitation facility Reported handwashing after using toilet Overall Increased Increased No impact Sampling Domain Nord/Sud Ubangi No impact Increased No impact Maniema/Tshopo Increased Increased No impact Wealth quintile Low and Low middle Increased No impact No impact Middle, High- middle, and High Increased Increased No impact 455 indicate that h ouseholds located in Maniema/Tshopo had a significantly higher probability of use of an improved water s ource , as did households in peri -urban areas and female - headed households . Household wealth was also strongly and significantly associated with using an improved water source and the magnitude of association strengthened with each successive wealth quintil e. Results from the sub- group analyses indicate that the ASSP project had a significant impact on use of improved water sources in Maniema/Tshopo (Table 10.3) , but not in Nord/Sud Ubangi (Table s 10.2 and 10.3). ASSP also had a significant impact on both wealth groups, although the impact was larger for those in the low and low -middle wealth quintiles (Tables 10.4 and 10.5). Table 10.6 displays changes in the use of improved water sources by selected characteristics at baseline and endline within ASSP and non- ASSP areas. Overall, use of improved water sources increased in ASSP and non- ASSP areas; however, neither change was statisticall y significant. At baseline in ASSP areas , the proportion of households with use of an improved water source in Maniema/Tshopo was more than double that in Nord/Sud Ubangi. A lthough use of improved water sources increased in both sampling domains and was st atistically significant in Nord/Sud Ubangi , the proportion of household s using improved water sources remained higher in Maniema/Tshopo than Nord/Sud Ubangi at endline in AS SP areas . In non- ASSP areas, use of improved water sources increased significantly i n Nord/Sud Ubangi but did not change significantly in Maniema/Tshopo . Figure 10.2: Percentage of households using improved water sources, improved sanitation facilities, and whose head of household reported handwashing after using the toilet, in ASSP and non- ASSP areas by year . Key Points The ASSP project had a significant positive impact on use of improved water sources and improved sani tation facilities. WASH infrastructure was consistently better in Maniema/Tshopo compared with Nord/Sud Ubangi. Though improvements were observed, use of improved water and sanitation remains low. No impact on handwashing was found. 456 *Difference between 2014 and 2017 levels is statistically significant at p <0.05. Sanitation The JMP categorizes sanitation facilities into improved and unimproved categories. Improved sanitation includes flush/pour flush latrines to a piped sewer system, septic tanks or pit, pit latrines with slabs, ventilated improved pit latrines, and composting toilets, none of which should be shared among different households (WHO, 2017). Unimproved sanitation includes any public or shared latrine, flush or pour/flush latrines to elsewhere (not to a pit, septic tank, or sewer), pit latrines without slabs, buck et latrines, hanging latrines, and open defecation (OD) (WHO, 2017). Figure 10.1 summarizes the impact of ASSP on use of improved sanitation facilities overall and for subsets of the population based on sampling domain and wealth. Overall, the ASSP proje ct significantly increased use of improved sanitation facilities . Results from the sub- analyses show that the ASSP project had a significant positive impact in Nord/Sud Ubangi and in Maniema/Tshopo, as well as the higher wealth group. There was no impact i n the lower wealth group (low and low -middle wealth quintiles). Results from the fully adjusted difference -in-difference model (Table 10.7) show the probability that household in ASSP areas used improved sanitation facilities was 5.359 percent higher than households in non- ASSP areas; this difference was attributable to the ASSP project. As with use of improved water sources, m odel results indicate d that households located in Maniema/Tshopo had a significantly higher probability of having use of an improved sanitation facility . Position in the highest wealth quintile , being in a peri -urban setting, and having a head of household who had completed sec ondary education were also significantly associated with use of improved sanitation . 20.8 5.432.1 33.1 7.154.9 01020304050607080 areas 2014 457 Sub-group analyses showed while there was an ASSP program impact within both sampling domains, the impact was much stronger in Maniema/Tshopo compared with Nord/Sud Ubangi (ME= 15.180 versus 2.453) (Tables 10.8 and 10.9). The sub- group analysis also indicated that the ASSP project had a significant impact within the top three wealth quintiles , but no impact in the bottom two quintiles (Tables 10.10 and 10.11). Table 10.12 displays changes in the use of improved sanitation facilities by selected characteristics at baseline and endline within ASSP and non- ASSP areas. Overall, the proportion of households with use of improved sanitation was low at baseline and endline in ASSP and non- ASSP areas; less than 8 percent of households had use of an improved sanitation facility. Overall , use of improved sanitation increased in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas ; however, neither i ncrease was statistically significant . Within ASSP areas, access decreased significantly among households in the low wealth quintile and increased among those with a head of household who had completed secondary education. 458 Handwashing Table 10.13 shows the impact of ASSP on the prevalence of handwashing after using the toilet. No project impact was detected. Respondents in Nord/Sud Ubangi and those in peri -urban settings were more likely to report washing their hands. Wealth and education were also positively correlated with handwashing. The sub- analyses did not detect an ASSP project impact within sampling domains or wealth groups (Tables 10.14 through 10.17). Changes in handwashing behavior over time are shown in Table 10.18. Handwashing increased in all of the categories examined , and in most cases , these increases were statistically significant . Nord/Sud Ubangi and Maniema/Tshopo both experienced significant increases, as did rural areas, all wealth quintiles except for the highest, both male - and female -headed households, and households headed by someone with primary education or higher. Robustness checks The impact s of seasonality on use of improved water sources and sanitation facilities and on handwashing were tested by comparing these outcomes in northern and southern Maniema at endline. There were no significant differences by season. It is plausible that households closer to health facilities had better access to improved water and sanitation, as households nearby to facilities may have gone to rehabilitated facilities for these needs. The difference- in-difference models were run with a variable for the mean dis tance between households and the health facility within the village. There was no change in the direction or significance of the ASSP impact, and very little change in the magnitude of the effect. iii. Limitations Timing of baseline: Although the baseline surv ey was conducted after the start of ASSP, the activities related to WASH that occurred before the baseline were limited to preparation and training. No community- level intervention had occurred, and so this limitation is not expected to impact the results of the environmental health analysis. Seasonality : It is plausible that households' sources of water and the amount of time it takes them to access their water vary by season. For example, the use of rainwater and improved source s may occur during the rainy season but not the dry. The use of sanitation fac ilities may vary as well; for example, someone may be willing to walk further to use an improved facility during the dry season. Handwashing may be less prevalent during seasons in which water is scarcer. Statistical tests did not find significant differen ces by season. However, the possibility that seasonality confounded the results cannot be ruled out, and it is difficult to ascertain the direction of the potential bias. 459 Service interruptions : Access to improved water and sanitation and handwashing behav iors are relatively stable indicators. Therefore, they are not expected to have fluctuated with interruptions to ASSP's funding. Power to detect differences in outcomes: The analysis was powered to detect household- level differences within the overall sa mple. It was not powered to detect differences in sub- groups such as sampling domains and wealth groups ; nevertheless, significant differences were found in some of the sub- analyses. iv. Discussion This chapter describes the performance of the ASSP project relative to its goals of increasing use of improved water sources and improved sanitation and promoting handwashing. Overall, the ASSP project increased use of improved water sources. While use of improved water sources increased in both Nord/Sud Ubangi and Maniema/Tshopo, the proportion of households using an improved water source was consistently higher in the latter in ASSP areas at baseline and endline. This may be explained by results from the sub-analyses, which found a project impact in Maniema/Tshopo but not in Nord/Sud Ubangi. Further, in comparison to rural settings , use of improved water sources was substantially greater in peri -urban locations for both ASSP and non- ASSP areas. Finally, use of improved water sources was also associated with household wealth; a ccess increased significantly across all wealth quintiles and the likelihood of having use of improved water increased with ascending wealth. These contrast s are commonly observed throughout the developing world and are consistent with other countries with developing WASH infrastructure. Based on reports from implementing partners, increasing us e of improved water sources was accomplished primarily through drilling boreholes equipped with man- powered or solar -powered pumps and developing natural water resources such as springs. The rehabilitation of pre -existing wells was also performed but to a lesser extent. These methods likely represent some of the most effective ways to increase use of improved sources of household drinking water in the DRC as it is estimated that groundwater makes up 47 percent of the DRC's internal water renewable resources (Partow, 2011). Protection of natural springs is particularly important in rural locations given that the majority of rural populations in the DRC use springs as their main source of drinking water. In addition to increasing use of improved water sources , ASSP had a positive impact on use of improved sanitation facilities. This appears attributable to Maniema/Tshopo, as use of improved sanitation in ASSP areas significantly increased in Maniema/Tshopo but re mained stable in Nord/Sub Ubangi . Additionally , the sub- analyses found a strong project impact in Maniema/Tshopo (ME=15.180) but a small impact in Nord/Sud Ubangi (ME=2.453). In comparison to the associations observed between household wealth and use of improved water sources, use of impro ved sanitation in ASSP areas significantly increased for those in the highest wealth quintile only . 460 ASSP's approach to increasing use of improved sanitation was to construct hygienic household latrines with household- , community- , and program -level support. This was manifested by household and community- level contributions of labor and locally supplied materials for the latrine superstruct ure, and manufacturing of sanitation platform slabs, which cover defecation pits, with direct project financing. Through this method, each household latrine was constructed utilizing a combination of household inputs, and \"as -needed\" community and program -based support, showcasing a potentially susta inable framework for future sanitation interventions. In contrast to use of improved water and sanitation, ASSP did not appear to have an impact o n the prevalence of handwashing. However, handwashing behaviors increased significantly in both ASSP and non-ASSP areas. The effectiveness of this indicator to measure the impact of ASSP's BCC activities is limited in that it relies on the self -report of one member of each household, repr esents only one occasion in which handwashing is recommended, and does not indicate whether handwashing was properly conducted. Other indicators from the survey were considered but not used due to gender specificity (handwashing before breastfeeding or coo king) or due to low response rates (observation of handwashing demonstration). Qualitative data on handwashing may be more useful for assessing this behavior; however, this was not collected. Levels of use of improved water and sanitation remain low throughout the study areas. However, ASSP's WASH program was found to have had a positive impact on these measures (no impact on handwashing was detected .) This seems to indicate that the approach was effective and that future investment would yield more gains in the WASH sector. Focus on Nord/Sud Ubangi , which lagged behind Maniema/Tshopo in terms of coverage of improved water and sanitation in both ASSP and non- ASSP areas is warranted . Further, considerable disparities in improved sanitation were observed between peri-urban and rural settings . Developing strategies specifically aimed at reducing this gap would not only improve WASH coverage in the DRC but also throughout other developing countries. The V A2 approach was implemented by other organizations in a sub- set of health zones in non- ASSP areas. As a robu stness check, the impact of the VA2 model , agnostic to the implementing organization, was calculated (results not shown) . The models showed that the VA2 model had no impact in non- ASSP areas (i.e. when implemented by other organizations) , but a significant positive impact in ASSP areas (i.e. when implemented by ASSP). An understanding of the differences in ASSP's imp lementa tion that led to its differential success could inform improvements to the National guidelines for VA2. The fact that these impacts were observed despite the relatively low penetration of the WASH intervention in ASSP areas may give some insight. ASSP's br oad health system approach included improvement to health facilities' sources of water and sanitation ( Chapter 3), training of community health workers and health facility staff , and community empowerment initiatives. This approach i n addition to the targe ted WASH intervention may have led to significant improvements where a WASH intervention alone did not. 461 References Partow H. (2011).

Interpretation of findings: The following are the key findings of the empirical and qualitative analysis . Service quality and community participation The ASSP project was found to have had a significant impact on improved the availability of preventive services and malaria diagnostic capabilities in health centers/posts . However, ASSP was not found to have had an impact on adequacy of equipment (thermometers, stethoscop es, blood pressure cuffs, adult scales, pediatric scales, and timers ), drug supply (Oxytocin, S ulfadoxine -pyrimethamine , and Amoxicillin) , the availability of curative services, or community participation in health centers/posts. Maternal health care utilization The ASSP project was found to have had a negative and significant effect on the receipt of at least four ANC visits (the number of visits recommended by the World Health Organization) among women who gave birth in the prev ious two years. This is largely due to the drop in the percentage of women in Maniema/Tshopo who received four or more ANC visits, from 37.9 percent in 2014 to 27.1 percent in 2017. There was no ASSP project impact on receipt of the first ANC visit within the first trimester of pregnancy , also largely explained by the drop in the percentage of women who received ANC care during the first trimester . The ASSP project had a significant and positive effect on the probability of delivering in a health care facility. The results of the qualitative analysis suggest that improving access to and uptake of maternal health services in ASSP health zones was challenged by perceived shortages of supplies , an insufficient number of trained and female community health workers assigned to maternal health , and a lack of formal behavioral change strategies to address cultural practices and social norms related to pregnancy and childbirth (taboos about sharing the pregnancy during the first trimester, disposal of the placen ta, unwillingness to deliver with a male attendant, inappropriate clothing to attend the health center). While fees for childbirth were officially reduced, the qualitative research highlights failure to follow the official fee schedule, with findings showi ng the health providers often increase fees for delivery care substantially 469 Child illnesses The ASSP project was found to have had a positive and significant effect on reducing the prevalence of symptoms of ARI and fever among children under five years of age . There was no ASSP project impact on diarrhea prevalence on children under five years of age, malaria parasite prevalence or on anemia prevalence among children 6 to 59 months of age. Treatment of child illnesses There was no ASSP project impact on treatment of three common symptoms of child hood illnesses - diarrhea, symptoms of ARI, and fever. The ASSP project had a negative and significant effect on the likelihood of seeking care at a health facility or from a health care provider for children with symptoms of ARI and/or fever. The results of the qualitative analysis ( in-depth interviews and focus group discus sions ) indicate that the effectiveness of ASSP's approach was affected by the lack of formal behavior change strategies and limited community outreach, drug stockouts, perceived unavailability and cost of medications, failure of health centers to adhere to listed user fees, long distances to the hospital and challenges navigating hard- to-travel routes, as well as cultural practices which favored traditional remedies and/or religious healing. Immunization The study results suggest that there was no ASSP pro ject impact on vaccination coverage among children 12 to 23 months . The results of the qualitative analysis suggest that home visits to promote uptake of child health services were infrequent, shortages of essential supplies such as vaccines and syringes w ere regular, and limited availability and/or sharing of solar power or refrigerators necessitated reliance on other centers for vaccines. Child nutrition Stunting among children under five years of age increased more significantly in ASSP areas compared with non- ASSP areas , while w asting and underweight among children did not change significantly in ASSP areas compared to non- ASSP areas. Findings from t he qualitative analysis suggest that there were difficulties in implementing ASSP's nutrition a pproach, including: time constraints and lack of availability of caregivers, who spend their days in agricultural fields, which limited the uptake of the strategies to encourage the preparation of enriched porridge and the home gardening strategy; lack of consideration of local practices such as planting vegetable gardens in agricultural fields; the stigma associated with having a malnourished child, which also affected home gardening uptake; and the limited ability to implement behavioral change strategies as designed in the ASSP approach. In addition, respondents reported that RECO's struggled to understand trainings that were conducted in French, exhibited high levels of attrition, and were undermotivated due to the lack of 470 supervision, compensation, and supplies. Limited training was provided to facility -based health workers, who generally lacked motivation to get involved in providing nutrition services. Use of insecticide -treated nets (ITNs) There were no ASSP project impacts detected on the use of ITNs among pregnant women or household ownership of at least one ITN. Qualitative data suggest that ITNs were not distributed in Maniema while summaries from quarterly reports highlight challenges with net condition and utilization among res idents , as well as organizational challenges that potentially disrupted the availability of malaria commodities and shifted the focus of implementation activities to other regions (e.g. from Maniema to Kasai). Modern contraceptive use Overall, no ASSP pro ject impact on the use of modern contraceptive methods among women of reproductive age was detected . The overall result masks the significant program impact in Nord Ubangi that was not found in Maniema/Tshopo. Outpatient health care utilization The ASSP project was not found to have had an impact on the utilization of outpatient services among individuals of all ages . The ASSP project was found to have had a statistically significant impact on increasing the likelihood of receiving outpatient consultations free of charge. The ASSP project was found to have had a significant impact on improved perceptions of both equipment availability and the cleanliness of the facility, but not on improved drug availability. Water, sanitation, and hygiene The ASSP project was found to have had an impact on increasing access to both improved water sources and improved sanitation. The ASSP project was not found to have had an impact on reported handwashing technique. Limitations: In interpreting the results of the study, several potential limitations should be noted, some of which were explored by conducting additional analysis of the baseline and endline data and the DHIS2 data made available by the ASSP project . First, a \"gold standard\" randomized control trial was not feasible for this evaluation because the target health zones were selected non -randomly. A step- wedge design was considered but was determined to be not appropriate due to IMA World Health's approach to introduce and scale up the inte rventions as rapidly as possible. While the quasi -experimental design allows for the plausible attribution of the outcomes to the project, it does not allow for observed changes (impact) to be definitively attributed to ASSP interventions only. Indeed, oth er projects and initiatives might also explain changes in the 471 observed value of indicators . Although the model controls for the presence of a World Bank -supported project in the control areas , as described below , there may have been other projects in the control areas that we are not aware of that were not taken into account. Second, the limited availability of health information system data at the time the study was designed meant that the matching of comparison groups could only be done on four charact eristics. The limited number of matching variables may have hindered the comparability of the invention areas and matched comparisons groups. To account for this, descriptive comparisons of demographic and community characteristics were assessed which help ed ensure all covariates are appropriately controlled for in the difference- in-difference analysis. Third, due to unforeseen delays in obtaining DFID approval of the research protocol , data collection for the baseline phase was delayed by almost by ten m onths after launching of the ASSP project, which meant that the results of the difference- in-differences approach for some outcomes, such as maternal and child health care utilization, outpatient health care utilization, and use of modern contraception services, may be biased towards the null hypothesis. However, it should be noted that this issue is not a concern for the evaluation of the impacts on child nutrition and WASH outcomes, as ASSP had not yet implemented community -based activities by the time t he baseline survey was administered. Further, the surveys were not conducted in the same months (April -May 2014 and July- September 2017), which may have potentially bias ed the analyses on outcomes that fluctuate seasonally. Nord/Sud Ubangi was experienci ng the rainy season during both the baseline and endline surveys, as were the regions of northern Maniema/Tshopo close to the equator (i.e. north of Kindu). Southern Maniema was experiencing the dry season at endline. Key outcomes in north versus south Maniema at endline were compared to test for seasonal differences; these results are discussed in the report as appropriate. Fourth, w hile the study was powered to detect overall differences between intervention and matched comparison at the household- and individual -levels, it was not powered to detect differences according to population sub- groups (i.e. wealth groups and provinces) . Nor was the analysis powered to detect differences in facility -level characteristics. Nevertheless, population sub- group DID models and facility- level DID model were estimated and presented in order to aid in the interpretation of the study findings, and i n some instances, the DID results of these models were found to be statistically significant. Fifth , in interpreting the results, it should be noted that the analysis exclude d Kasai/Kasai Central, the provinces where ASSP had the highest level of activit y, the greatest number of health zones, and according to ASSP routine program data, the most active uptake of some services. For example, contraception, based on routine service statistics converted to couple -years of protection (CYP, the most widely used measure of outputs in international family planning programs) was higher in Kasai/Kasai Central than in the other sampling domains. However, because of political unrest in Kasai/Kasai Central, it was not possible to collect endline data in this domain. 472 Sixth, programmatic disruptions in the months leading up to the endline survey in the two domains may have affected the results. Specifically, an audit of the management of the project's operations in Maniema led to a drastic reduction of ASSP funded activi ties during several months, and in Nord Ubangi, World Vision, the ASSP Implementation Partner in this province, ended collaboration with IMA World Health . To explore the importance of this issue, we analyzed DHIS2 quarterly data from eight quarters, from January -March 2016 to October -December 2017, for several types of service maternal and child health care services but did not detect any dips in service statistics that were associated with the ASSP disruptio ns. Seventh , an assumption of the DID model is that the only systematic difference between the ASSP and non-ASSP groups relates to the exposure to the ASSP project. As mentioned above, this assumption may not have been met, as the World Bank introduced its new projec t Projet de D\u00e9veloppement du Secteur de Sant\u00e9, which focused on performance -based financing to improve the delivery of health and family planning services , in some of the non -ASSP health zones. Although statistical controls were used to account for this po ssible bias, it must nonetheless be considered a potential limitation. Finally, it should be noted that there were differences between the ASSP areas in Maniema/Tshopo and their matched comparison areas, as all the ASSP areas had been exposed to the pre decessor project to ASSP, the Access to Healthcare Program, while the matched comparison areas had not. Ideally, we would have included matched comparison areas that had been exposed to this project, but this was not possible, as all the DFID supported hea lth zones in Maniema/Tshopo transitioned into the ASSP project. Whether this factor biased the results, and the direction of the bias, are unclear. Interpretation of findings: In each of the chapters that present the results, the empirical findings are discussed with respect to many of the limitations described above, as well as to a number of other factors, including the variable power of tests of indicators at different nested levels (i.e. household- , individual -, and facility -levels), the variable quality of indicators in terms of their relationship to impact, the consistency between indicators that are expected to be conceptually linked, and the absolute changes in ASSP and m atched comparison areas over time as context for the DID results. Below is a summary of some of the key issues that emerged from these assessments. Consistency with other programmatic area findings . For many of the programmatic areas investigated , such a s maternal health care and child health care, the DID results appear to be consistent within the programmatic area. For example, the ASSP project was found not to have had an impact on any of the indicators of antenatal care, on any of the indicators of ITN use , or on any of the indicators of treatment of childhood illnesses. The insignificant findings on service utilization were also consistent with limited changes over the study period in the availability of equipment and drugs but were inconsistent wi th the impacts on other facility -level factors that can influence the quality of care. For example, the ASSP Project was found to have had an impact on improved availability of equipment and the cleanliness at the health center level. 473 Consistency with other sources of data. When possible, the population- based survey results were compared with DHIS2 data available from the DRC's health management information system. For many types of services, there were inconsistencies. For example, the DHIS2 data indicated higher levels of individuals served (i.e. for the proportion of women receiving antenatal care during the first trimester of the pregnancy) and higher levels of child vaccinations than the population- based service results. However, for many of the o utcome indicators, the differences in the two data sources make many of the comparisons problematic. For example, for vaccinations, the DHIS2 provides data on the percentage of 1 -year old children vaccinated against measles, while the ASSP surveys provide data on children who received all basic vaccinations, and for child nutrition, the DHIS2 presents data on the number of child nutrition screenings, while the ASSP data provide measurements of child anthropometry. In terms of the comparisons with the 2013/14 DHS, the 2014 baseline point estimates for the indicators of maternal health care, child health care, outpatient service utilization based on the ASSP baseline survey are in close alignment with the DHS estimates, supporting the validity of the ASSP survey data. Consistency with qualitative findings. For the three programmatic areas in which the evaluation included a qualitative research component - maternal health care, treatment of childhood illnesses, and child nutrition - the quantitative and qu alitative results are, for the most part, in alignment. For example, for maternal health care, the qualitative findings that suggested that efforts to improve access to and update of maternal health care services were constrained by drug and supply shorta ge are consistent the results on the insignificance of ASSP in influencing the use of antenatal care, and for child nutrition, the qualitative findings that indicated problems in the implementation of the home gardening approach align with the fact that the ASSP project was not found to have had a positive impact on child anthropometry. On the other hand, the qualitative findings on persistent barriers to increasing the percentage of women that deliver in health care facilities were inconsistent with the q uantitative finding that the ASSP project was found to have had an impact on the proportion of women who had facility- based deliveries in the two years prior to the survey. Of particular concern are the findings that the ASSP project was found to have ha d a negative impact on some outcomes, including stunting, the use of antenatal care, and the treatment of childhood illnesses. The results on stunting were primarily due to the increased prevalence in Maniema, from 42.0 percent in 2014 to 57.0 percent in 2017, a statistically significant increase that did not occur in Nord Ubangi. Similarly, the decreased proportion of pregnant women who received at least four antenatal care visits was also primarily due to drops in Maniema, from 37.9 percent in 2014 to 27.1 percent in 2017, as comparable percentages in Nord Ubangi were relatively stable over the study period. One possible explanation for these findings concerns DFID's predecessor project, which operated in Maniema, but not in Nord Ubangi. However, as fa r as we know, the Access to Healthcare Project did not include nutrition programming, so the presence of this project does not appear to be a plausible explanation for 474 increased levels of malnutrition in Maniema. However, the predecessor project did suppo rt the delivery of antenatal care services until the program ended in 2012. The effects of the processor program may help explain the higher levels of antenatal care in Maniema, as the utilization of antenatal care was measured over a two -year recall peri od in the ASSP household surveys. Another possible explanation is regression to the mean, in which the worsening of some indicators observed over the study period, such as stunting, may be due to selecting an extreme group in the first measurement, and th e second measurement being closer to the mean for all subjects. However, these are explanations are speculative, and we have no corroborating evidence that would explain why ASSP would have had a damaging impact on any of the outcomes investigated in this evaluation. Below are some possible general explanations for the findings of the impact evaluation. Design and scale of interventions. A key premise of the ASSP project was that the DRC was ready to shift away from a humanitarian development approach to a broader health systems approach that would be sustainable in the long run. The ASSP approach include d a number of experimental interventions that relied heavily on local buy -in and assumptions about how local health systems and communities would respond. Examples include the Community Health Endowment Strategy, a pilot intervention that aimed to mobilize community health financing, and the home gardening intervention, which aimed to combat child malnutrition by improving the availability of locally -produced foods high in nutritional value. However, many of the interventions were not accompanied by format ive research to better understand underlying social and contextual factors that could potentially affect the uptake of the interventions supported by the project. Nor did the project pilot the interventions to test their effectiveness and costs. Moreover, due to limited resources, many of the community -based interventions supported by the project, such as the WASH, nutrition, and ITN interventions, were implemented unevenly across ASSP health zones. This limited the likelihood of finding signific ant impacts of the ASSP project. Nevertheless, ASSP was found to have had significant impacts on increasing the percentage of households with improved water and sanitation. In the case of child nutrition, the limited coverage and the nature of the interve ntion could not have plausibly influence d population- based indic ators such as stunting, and as a result, the results for this indicator should be viewed with caution. Management and coordination. IMA World Health and its partners faced a number of formi dable challenges in the management and coordination of the ASSP project , including the remoteness of the project areas as well as the limited transportation and communications infrastructure available in the DRC. The lack of banking systems was a major pro blem that affected the financial management of the project. While monitoring procedures were in place, these challenges affected the ability to provide support to health zone staff to both identify and then respond to problems in the field. 475 Human resource s for health. In the cases in which the interventions were not as effective as anticipated, one weak link that has been identified through the qualitative findings we re challenges in health worker motivation. For example, the results of the qualitative res earch on nutrition indicate that there were weaknesses in the ability and willingness of outreach workers to carry out their job responsibilities, due to limited incentives and assumptions about remuneration, leading to constant turnover. In the case of fa cility -based health workers, operations research carried out by Tulane suggests that the removal of performance -based pay in Maniema may have had unanticipated effect s on morale and motivation, which may help explain why some of the facility -based interven tions did not have the anticipated impact. Health systems expertise. While ASSP has a very strong project management team along with project coordinators that are extremely knowledgeable of health systems and have an unparalleled understanding of the DRC context, ASSP could have benefited from additional outside technical expertise, particularly for some of the more novel community- based interventions that were introduced by the project. Conclusions and recommendations: Overall, the results of the evaluation suggest that the ASSP project had a positive impact on several outcomes, including reducing the incidence of childhood illnesses (fever and suspected pneumonia), improving rates of women deliver ing in health care facilities , reducing out -of-pocket expenditure for outpatient care, and increas ing improved sources of water and sanitation, the effects were in significant for most of the outcomes analyzed, and were sometimes negative and significant . The reasons for the negative im pacts of the ASSP project are unclear, as discussed above. The empirical results are based on a quasi -experimental survey design that was sufficiently powered to detect the anticipated improvements in most of the indicators assessed. Moreover, for those topic areas that were covered by the qualitative component of the study, the empirical findings are consistent with the qualitative findings . The following are recommendations to consider for future DFID programming. More formative research focused on community perceptions and needs. This recommendation is based on the qualitative research findings indicating that 1) perceptions of low quality of care as well as cultural practices and social norms are important factors that constrain the use of facility -based maternal and child health care services, and 2) time constraints, lack of availability of caregivers, stigma associated with having a malnourished child, and other factors adversely affecting the uptake of the proj ect's home gardening approach to improving child nutrition. More use of formative research would allow for greater consideration of geographical and cultural differences, and adaptations in the design of program approaches to better coincide with contextua l conditions. 476 More focus on incorporating behavior change and communications strategies in the design of interventions. This recommendation is based on limited attention that such interventions received in the ASSP approach, as well as on qualitative re search findings that suggested that behavioral factors limited the uptake of key ASSP interventions. More programmatic emphasis on the role that changes in provider payment strategies (i.e. changing how facility- and community- based health workers are pai d) can play in influencing health worker motivation and incentives, and in turn, service quality and availability. This recommendation is based on the qualitative research findings indicating that reductions in pay in Maniema may have had the unintended c onsequence of reducing health worker motivation of both community -based and facility -based health workers, and as a result, the quality of health services. More use of piloting to inform decisions on whether and how interventions should be scaled up, particularly for experimental community -based interventions that rely on untested assumptions regarding community and health worker behaviors, and more emphasis on monitoring and evaluation of those interventions. This recommendation is based on the results i ndicating limited uptake of the home gardening approach as well as the community -based health financing approach, investigated through a separate operations research study, that was intended to mobilize household pre -paid premiums for local health centers. More programmatic emphasis on supervision of local health officers and health workers and on improving the collection, availability and use of routine data, beyond the data that is available in the DHIS2. This recommendation is based on findings from the qualitative research component of the study that indicated that limited supervision of health workers may have played a role in constraining the use of ASSP -supported interventions, and findings from an operations research study on the project's community -based financing strategy that indicated problems in the quality and use of programmatic data that was reported to the Kinshasa -based ASSP management team. 477 Appendix A. Interpretation of results presented in this report Results from the quantitative analyses are presented using three standardized types of tables. The interpretation of these tables is described below. Please note that while the quasi -experimental research design used for the study allows for plausible attr ibution of the outcomes to the project, it does not allow for the observed changes (impact) to be definitively attributed to ASSP interventions only. General terms defined: n: The number of observations (people, households, facilities) used in the descri ptive analysis or model. Marginal effect : Measure of the average effect of a one unit increase of one variable (a covariate or independent variable) has on another variable (the dependent variable) . SE (standard error): Measure of the statistical accurac y of an estimate. Lower standard errors indicate higher accuracy. p-value : Measure of the statistical significance of an estimate. Ranges from 0 (strong significance) to 1 (weak significance). In most cases, an estimate is considered statistically signific ant if p<0.05, which is the convention on the biomedical and social sciences research literature . Statistically significant p -values are bolded . Weighting : A process to adjust data from a subset of a population so that it is statistically representative (i .e. so that it looks like) the entire population. Table type 1: Full model results of determinants of ______ (DID model) Interaction (Year*ASSP): Shows the impact of ASSP on that outcome. Other control variables: Show the impact of each control variable included in the statistical model on the outcome. These models control for the impact of factors that are not under ASSP's influence, but which may have influence on the outcome of interest . There are three types of control variables: binary or \"yes/no\" variables (e.g. possession of land), other categorical variables made up of more than two categories (e.g. education level or relative wealth quintiles ) and variables on a continuous scale (e.g. out - of-pocket health expenditure). The marginal effects can be interpreted in the following ways: Table 6.1. Full model results of determinants of stunting for children age 6 -59 months (DID model) (n=5,077) Characteristic Marginal Effect SE p-value Interaction (Year*ASSP) 11.2 50 3.35 0 0.001 Interpretation: If there are two otherwise average children, one in an ASSP area and one in a non -ASSP area, the child in the ASSP area's probability of being stunted is 11.25 percent higher because of the ASSP project. This estimate is statistically significant (p<0.05). 478 Binary (yes/no) variables: Table 6.1. Full model results of determinants of stunting for children age 6 -59 months (DID model) (n=5,077) Characteristic Marginal Effect SE p-value Agricultural land 5.430 1.985 0.006 Interpretation: If there are two otherwise average children, one living in a household with agricultural land and one living in a household without, the child with agricultural land's probability of being stunted is 5.43 percent higher. This estimate is statistically significan t (p<0.050) . Categorical variables: Continuous variables: Table 9.4. Full model results of determinants of satisfaction among patients with outpatient visits (DID model) (n=4,192) Characteristic Marginal Effect SE p-value Expenditure on visit (USD) -8.751 1.025 0.032 Interpretation: A one dollar increase in expenditure is associated with an 8.75 percent decrease (because the marginal effect is negative) in the probability of that a patient is satisfied. This estimate is statistically significant (p<0.050). Table 6.1. Full model results of determinants of stunting for children age 6 -59 months (DID model) (n=5,077) Characteristic Marginal Effect SE p-value Mother's education None 0.020 Interpretation: If there are two otherwise average children, one whose mother had no formal education (i.e. the reference group) and another whose mother had some primary education, the child whose mother had some primary education's probability of being stunted is 0.54 percent lower (because the marginal effect is negative). This estimate is not statistically significant (p>0.050) . A child whose mother had completed primary education's probability of being stunted is 4.74 percent lower than a child's whose mother had no education. This estimate is statistically significant (p<0.050). 479 Table type 2: Impact of ASSP on rates of _ ____, restricted to _ ____ (DID model) These tables show the impact of ASSP within specific sub -groups, which can be used can be used to determine whether ASSP had a differential impact across various sub- groups. For example, ASS P may have improved immunization rates among males but not among females. The analyses were conducted separately on females and males, those in the two highest wealth quintiles , those in the three lowest wealth quintiles , those in Maniema/Tshopo, and those in Nord/Sud Ubangi. Each model used the same control variables as Table type 1, although those results are not presented. These sub -analyses have lower sample sizes than the full models and therefore have less power to detect differences. Table type 3: Percent of _____, by selected characteristics, study sample & year These tables show the percentages of respondents within sub- groups that have the outcome of interest. ASSP (n=1,210 children in areas in Nord/Sud Ubangi were stunted. In 2017, 54.4 percent of children in those same areas were stunted. That difference is not statistically significant. 467 Appendix B.

First, data from the surveys will be used to measure changes between the baseline and endline surveys in health outcomes, behaviors, and exposure to and use of health interventions. Second, the survey data will be used to assess the impact of the overall project on selected health outcomes, behaviors, and th e use of interventions. The specific research questions investigated are as follow s: What is the impact of the ASSP project on neonatal and child health outcomes (child nutritional status, anemia, fever during the past two weeks, diarrhea during the past two weeks, infant mortality)? What is the impact of the ASSP project on specified types of health care utilization (maternal health services, including antenatal, delivery care, and postnatal services; immunization; outpatient treatment for both children a nd adults; inpatient services for both children and adults)? What is the impact of the ASSP project on household out -of-pocket health care expenditure? What is the impact of the ASSP project on family planning (utilization of modern contraceptive methods, unmet need for family planning)? What is the impact of the ASSP project on community level environmental health (access to improved sources of drinking water and sanitation facilities)? What is the impact of ASSP on factors related to the quality of care (health facility service readiness , client satisfaction, health worker motivation)? Study Design A quasi -experimental panel study design will be used to obtain changes in point estimates of health outcomes, health care utilization, out -of-pocket expenditures, malaria parasite prevalence, quality of heath care services and community participation in health care. Data from baseline and endline studies will be collected using household , community leader and health facility surveys. The baseline survey will be conducted in 2014 and the endline survey will be conducted in 2017. Both the baseline and endline survey s will provide data to assess plausible attribution of ASSP support on outcome and impact indicators using a dose response approach and a difference -in-differences approach (described below) . Study Site Sampled health zones the Orientale, Maniema, Equateur, Kasai -Occidental and Kasai -Oriental provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo Target Population Children under five years of age within selected households Women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) within selected households Official health centers , hospitals, health zone offices, and regional centers for medicine procurement and distribution designated to serve the selected administrative health areas Sampling M ethod Household/wome n's survey in intervention areas: a two-stage sampling design with probability of first stage selection proportional to relative village sizes, with equal -allocation stratified survey design resulting in three independent intervention sampling areas was used. Household/ wome n's survey in matched comparison groups : a three-stage sampling design where in the first stage non -intervention health areas were matched on four criteria (location, urban/rural, population, vaccination coverage) to health areas containing the intervention villages sampled. Second and third stages us e systematic sampling within matched comparison health areas and villages , with equal -allocation stratified survey design resulting in three independent matched comparison groups. Health center/post survey: the official health center designated for serving the health area in which each selected village is located will be selected. Heath center/post worker survey: all individuals responsible for providing health care services ( e.g., doctors, nurses, midwives) who are on duty in t he selected heath center during the day of the survey will selected. Community leader survey: purposefully selected individuals will be interviewed . Hospital survey: the official hospital designated for serving the health area in which each 469 selected village is located will be selected (endline only) Hospital worker survey: random sample of 4 physicians and 4 nurses per hospital during the day of the survey will selected (endline only) Regional centers for medicine procurement and distribution : all regional centers serving the sampled health areas (endline only) Health zone offices : a random sample of health zone offices overseeing the sampled health (endline only) Sample Size 5,600 households (4,200 at baseline and endline plus 1,400 at endline only) 280 health centers (one for each selected village) 280 - 840 health center/post provider s 560 community leaders (two for each selected village) 32 hospitals (endline only) 256 hospital providers (endline only) 7 regional centers for medicine procurement and distribution (endline only) 32 health zone offices (endline only) Data Collection Household survey (health care utilization for all family members, out -of-pocket health care expenditures, perceived quality of service, community engagement, water and sanitation , malaria prevention, anemia status, malaria parasite prevalence, and anthropometric measurements for children under five years of age) Woman's survey (child illness such as fever, diarrhea, suspected pneumonia, vaccination coverage, and infant mortality; treatment of child illness; maternal health care utilization, including antenatal care and skilled delivery assistance; and utilization of traditional and modern contraception ) Health center/post survey (service rea diness such adequate equipment, drug supplies, and assessing the minimum package of services offered) Health center/post provider survey (health worker satisfaction and motivation and presence of performance-based incentives ) Community leader survey (health zone, health area and village level characteristics; and presence of other program mes at the health zone, health area or village level) Hospital survey (service readiness such adequate equipment, drug supplies, and assessing the minimum package of services offered) Hospital provider survey (health worker satisfaction and motivation and presence of performance-based incentives) Regional centers for medicine procurement and distribution survey (systems for purchasing and distributing drugs; availability of equipment , supplies and personnel) Health zone office survey (systems for managing and prioritizing health services; availability of equipment, supplies, and personnel) Statistical and Analytic Plan Two types of multivariate analyses will be conducted to investigate the research questions. The first type, a dose -response approach, measures the association between the level or intensity of programme exposure and the outcomes of interest. In the second type, m ultivariate regression methods and a difference-in -difference approach within a quasi -experimental panel design will be used to analyze the data by comparing treatment groups with comparison groups. Limitations The proposed study has some limitations While the quasi -experimental design allows for the plausible attribution of the outcomes to the project, it does not allow for observed changes (impact) to be definitively attributed to ASSP interventions only Due to availability of data, comparisons groups could only be matched on four characteristics, which may limit the comparability of sampling areas and comparison groups Data collection for the baseline phase will be delayed by almost by 10 months after launching of the ASSP Project, which means that the results of the difference-in -differences approach may be biased towards the null hypothesis Comparison villages might have been (or will be) exposed to interventions from other health initiatives or projects The sa mpled households are not representative at the health zone level nor can the 470 differential impact of ASSP on the outcomes of interest be validly tested among health zones Ethics The following ethical consideration have been integrated into the design of t he prosed study: There may be physical risks to the household participants/respondents associated with a finger stick from blood drop collection, but they are not considered more than minimal . Data collectors for biomarkers will be trained health personnel and will receive training on how to minimize risk associated with this type of data collection. Additionally, all data collectors will be trained to ensure confidently. Data collected will be stored under lock -and-key in a password-protected computer . All respondent s will be read an informed consent transcript and oral consent will be obtained for all participants age 15 and above. Mothers or caregivers will give oral consent for biomarker and anthropometric data collection of children under 5. Data collection tools and informed consent transcripts have been translated into French and four national languages. Respondents will have the choic e of language for the survey. There is no cost other than a respondent's time and no compensation for participation. 471 Table of Contents 1.

Background and ASSP Project Description Background The Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced some of the worst health indicators world wide . Of particular concern is the health status of vulnerable populations , including poor households , woman and children under five. The u nder-five mortality rate is estimated at 199 per 1,000 live births (UNDP, 2013) and the three leading causes of child death, malaria (25- 30%), diarrhea (16%) and pneumonia (16%) are all preventable diseases . Maternal mortality has declined in recent years but is still one of the highest in the world at 670 per 100,000 live births , while the use of safe birth practices and antennal care remain low (United Nations Population Fund, 2011) . The poor health outcomes in the DRC have been fueled by multiple political, social and economic crises over the past twenty years. As a result to these crises, the Government of Congo (then Zaire) disengaged from the health and education sectors following the pillage during the early 1990's that marked the breakdown on government control and normal societal functioning . Public funding for the country's decentralized health system, specifically to the provincial he alth zones, was drastically reduced. Currently, t he government spends only about 2% of the national budget on health care (Blum, 2011) . Consequently, out -of-pocket health payment s from clients and development assistance to health (DAH) have helped to maintain a minimal availability of health services (Zinnen, 2012) , but there is large concern that as much as 70% of the population has little or no access to the health services resulting from both physical and financial barriers (Waldman, 2006) . While DAH has steadily increased in recent years, funds have largely been directed to vertical disease control program mes such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, t uberculosis control and immunization program mes. Although the government has welcomed increased DAH provided by i nternational partners , there is concern that the emphasis on vertical programmes has neglected some primary health care services and that the programmes may not be sustainable once donor support ends (Maurizzio, 2011). There have been several large -scale health system strengthening projects implemented in the DRC, dating back to 1981. These include: SANRU I (50 health zones covered from 1981 to 1985), SANRU II (100 health zones covered from 1985 to 1991), SANRU III (56 health zones covered fr om May 2001 -Sept 2006) , PMURR ( 67 health zones covered from 2002- 2008) and AXxes (57 health zones covered from Sept 2006 - Sept 2009) . Many of these projects have supported an integrated approach to improving the availability and quality of health care services. However, to date, the impact of these projects has n ot been rigorously evaluated. This impact evaluation marks the first time that a large -scale integrated health systems strengthening project has been rigorous ly evaluated in the DRC context . 474 ASSP Project Description In an effort to strengthen the health care delivery system and increase service utilization, the Ministry of Health has developed a five -year health development plan, which is being implemented with support from a number of internationa l health partners, including DFID. The DRC government's National Health Development Plan for the period 2011- 2015 defines eight priority pillars: governance, human resources for health, medicines and specific inputs, health financing, health information m anagement system, infrastructure and equipment , health service delivery and collabor ation with related sectors ( Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 Publique, 2010). As part of its programme to assist the government in strengthening the country's health system, DFID aw arded Primaires ) project to IMA World Health and its implementing partners and subcontractors in Fall 2012 (see Table 1) . ASSP is a health systems strengthening project tasked with working in 52 health zones in Equateur, Orientale, Kasai -Occidental and Maniema provinces of the DRC1. ASSP interventions have been designed to strengthen the government's priority pillars as described above (IMA World Health, 2012). The project's targeted health zones were chosen by DFID because: 1) the health zones were considered to have relatively weak health systems, or 2) because DFID had begun to provide assistance to the health zones under a predecessor project and wants to continue that assistance.

Output 1: Enhanced health service delivery and quality; 2. Output 2: Increased empowerment and accountability in health service planning and delivery; 3. Output 3: Improved access to health services; and 4. Output 4: Increased and sustainable access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation. Figure 1 presents the ASSP Project's Theory of Change, which was developed by IMA World Health in consultation with DFID. The Theory of Change provides a simplified overview of how the ASSP project is expected to have an impact on health outcomes. The Theory of Change is also used as a tool to guide the evaluation of the ASSP Project. As shown in Figure 1, ASSP consist s of a broad range of facility - and community -based health interventions designed to: 1. Strengthen the public health sector at the provincial, health zone , facility and community level though improved availability of infrastructure, equipment, supplies and improved financial and managerial practices 2. Improve environmental health in targeted areas via the introduction of \"Village Assaini,\" a water, sanitation , and hygiene (WASH) approach 3. Broaden key governance functions, including accountability, governance, stewardship and leadership These health i nterventions, in turn, are expected to improve the availability, quality, and utilization of high qua lity essential health services including antenatal care, deliveries, family planning services, diagnosis and treatment of malaria, and child health services, as well as to improve environmental health. The ultimate objectives of the overall package of interventions are to improve reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health outcomes. 476 477 Figure 1. ASSP Project's Theory of Change 478 Table 2 provides an overview of the types of interventions to be implemented by the ASSP project . As the table describes , ASSP covers a broad range of interventions including improving infrastructure and providing equipment to health facilities; enhancing the quality of service delivery and the range of services offered at the facility and community level; improving the medical supply chain procedures; providing trainings to increase human resource capacity; strengthening the health information system and human resource database to improve data quality; refining the governance of healthcare delivery to be more responsive to communities; increasing financial access to individual users and creating sustainable financial policies for health facilities ; and introducing more innovate intersectional activities such as water and sanitation, hygiene (WASH) and nutr ition program mes. Each activity is linked to the Theory of Change as activities are targeted toward quality and access of service delivery, community engagement or environmental health. Additionally, while certain activities will provide service s to the general population, other activities are specifically focused on improving health outcomes for women and children. Table 3 depicts the anticipated timeline for a staggered rollout. As the timeline indicates, some activities have already started, however the intensity of activity is still very minimal. While the timeline projects the rollout of ASSP activities beyond year one, the specific implementation plans for certain activities are still under discussion both internally at IMA and, in some cas es, between IMA and DFID . The research team will take into account t he timing of activities during data analysis, as described in section 9. It is expected that the design and implementation of these interventions may be modified based on evidence from the project's internal monitoring system or in consultation with Tulane 's ORIE team. 479 Table 2.

The project will also build efficient incinerators and placenta pits for selected facilities. This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality and access to healthcare. Provision of equipment to health zones and related facilities The project will provide medical equipment and supplies to 55 hospitals and 962 health centers: Medical equipment and supplies include: Improved cold boxes and solar refrigerators Kerosene and spare parts for cold chain equipment Medical waste management supplies General medical supplies Laboratory equipment and supplies Facility supplies include: Bicycles for community health workers Laptops, networked sim cards and printers Motorbikes and vehicles for selected health offices Solar energy kits This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality and delivery . Service Delivery Provision of a minimum package of services ASSP will ensure the minimum packages of services are available at all supported health facilities. This package includes bas ic curative care, preventative care, promotional activities, community activities, complementary package of activities to be established in hospitals and management/adminis trative activities (more detail provided in Appendix 1). This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality and acces s to healthcare. Community -based interventions ASSP will introduce and/or strengthen several community -based services, including: Immunization: ASSP will support immunization and Vitamin A distribution activities through the Reach Every District (RED) approach. The project will streng then EPI micro planning at the health zone level and will facilitate vaccine transport from Kinshasa to the health z ones. Modern family planning: ASSP will support the provision of modern family planning methods and increase their accessibility at the community level. Mosquito -nets distribution: ASSP will support the distribution of Long -Lasting Insecticide -treated Nets (LL TN) free of 480 charge. Community health workers will visit homes to help hang up the nets. Community wide behavioral communication campaigns (BCC) to promote a range of healthy behaviors (contraceptive use, immunizations, antenatal care, malaria prevention , etc.). Specific BCC strategies will be developed by individual health zones. Support groups for breastfeeding mothers This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality and access to healthcare. Medicine Supply Chain Medicine procurement and distribution, supply chain management ASSP will work with the existing regional centers for medicine procurement and distribution (CDR) to strengthen their capacit y to continue supply chain management after the project ends. ASS P will also work with the supported health facilities to ensure that all essential medications of good quality are purchased, properly transported and are reaching the target population. This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality and access to healthcare. Human Resources Capacity Pre-service training ASSP will provide the following: Support the nursing schools to produce well trained graduates Provide scholarships for nurses Pre-service training is expected to help improve health workers knowledge and practices and hence improve the quality of services offered. In-service training ASSP will provide the following training or training materials to health personnel in supported health zones: Maternal and C hild Health (MCH) : Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), P revention of Mother To Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV/AHDS , fistula repair, breastfeeding, maternal and newborn health, and emergency obstetric care Family planning, reproductive he alth and post abortion care Sexually transmitted infection care including post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) administration Nutrition Cervical cancer screening Sexual and G ender Based Violence (SGBV) management Drug management Lab testing Tuberculosis detection Malaria detection Behavior change communications Financial management In-service training is expected to help improve health workers knowledge and practices and hence improve the quality of services offered. Health Management Information Strengthen the health information management ASSP will contribute to strengthening the existing SNIS with the following: Provide information technology for electronic reporting 481 Syste ms system (SNIS) Provide SNIS tools and forms to health facilities Implement DHIS2 software in all ASSP supported facilities which will serve as the electronic program me for collecting SNIS data Train health facility staff to use DHIS2 Conduct regular quality audits to assess the routine data being collected by the project. This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality by improving data quality. Human resources information system ASSP will establish a human resources information system at the health zones and health facility level . This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality by improving data quality. Governance Norms and guidelines ASSP will establish norms and guidelines for new program mes and, where available, ensure that the national norms and guidelines are disseminated to health office and health facilities. They will also conduct workshops to ensure that stakehold ers are aware of these standards. This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of service quality. Community eval uation and accountability ASSP will implement the following activity to ensure that communities have opportunities to participate in evaluating the project and are empowered to hold the health system accountable: Establish a pilot community hotline, encouraging community members to signal poor management practices, mismanagement, fraud, theft, corruption and other dy sfunctions; put pressure on health zone officials to improve governance; and hold health service officials accountable. Develop sustain able mechanisms for collecting information on community expectations and evaluations of health services Develop and promote a guidebook designed specifically for health zone officials on creative ways to actively invite and facilitate community participati on in the health zone program me Actively promote the theme of community ownership of the local health center through a variety of media including community radio, public billboards / posters, soccer balls and women's batik cloth and scarves. This activity is expected to contribute to increase community empowerment. Community health committees (CODESA) ASSP will strengthen the governance and oversight capacity of the community health committees (CODESA) by: Training CODEAS members to organize and moderate village meetings Updating the CODESA guidelines to establish clear roles and responsibilities of the group Training CODESA members on performance improvement Encourage and facilitate training of CODESA members and health center staff in their respective roles and responsibilities in the co -management of health centers and the mobil izing of community partnerships This activity is expected to contribute to increase community empowerment. Planning and management ASSP will work with individuals at multiple levels (national, provincial, health zone, community) to ensure the proper planning 482 and management of the project including: Organizing workshops to coordinate the activities of the government, implementing partners, and local facil ities Organizing regular informational meetings to engage stakeholders and partners at all levels Supporting provincial and district technical meetings Ensuring regular supervision is taking place at all levels of the health system including the provinc ial health offices, hospitals and health centers Supporting provincial heath dist ricts and health zone teams This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of quality health care and community empowerment. Finance Primes/financial incentives ASSP will provide primes (salary supplements) at a reduced rate to health workers and other health personnel in health zones where this practice has been previously established. However, in the course of the project, ASSP prim es will be eliminated such that no health worker in ASSP supported zones will receive financial incentives from donors. This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of the access to health care and ensure sustainably . User fees ASSP will establish and disseminate guidelines for setting user fees to the provincial health office s. Each health establishment (health centers/hospitals) will then determine the baseline user fee for normal users. ASSP will provide subsidized curative care for vul nerable population s and for survivors of SGBV. This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of access to health care. Mobilization of health financing through Community Health Endowments (CHE) (agricultural cooperatives) ASSP will implement a community level income generating intervention that will provide additional finances to the health centers and reduce user fees for participants. CHEs are community farms that are planted and harvested by village participant s who agree to give 50% of the revenue to the local health center in return for a 500 -franc reduction in user fees. The following activities will be conducted Train CODESA and CHWs on how community health endowments work Train CHWs to provide technical support to CHE particip ants Provide quality seed/seed cutting to CHE groups Train CODESA to organize village informational meetings Support a community -based campaign to present the community health endowment model of community financial support for the health center to commun ity leaders and individual village groups This activity is expected to contribute to access to health care and community empowerment. Intersectional Collaboration Water and Sanitation, Hygiene (WASH) ASSP will implement a previously established WASH campaign, Village Assaini, as well as an alternative package of activities yet to be determined. Activities include: Providing equipment and implementing activities related to water and sanitation Training individuals on the Village Assaini approach and providing promotional materials for Village Assaini Providing water monitoring kits to clusters of supported villages Supporting community mobilization and initial WASH assessment efforts 483 Establishing regular water testing activities for facilities in supported health zones Spring capping Building home latrines for individual households and composing latrines at health facilities and schools Building cisterns at schools and public facilities This activity is expected to contribute to the improvement of environmental health. Nutrition/Home gardening ASSP's nutrition project involves promoting home gardening activities indented to produce quality and nutritious food for household consumptions. Activities include: Training C ommunity Health Worker s (CHW) on how to implement the home gardening project at the household level, nutrition education and home visits to monitor child malnutrition Equip each health zone with a trained nutritionist Provide nutrition education materials to health cen ters This activity is expected to contribute to access to health care and community empowerment. 484 Table 3. Anticipated t imeline of ASSP interventions (developed by the ORIE team and IMA World Health) 485 486 Previous research on integrated health care delivery models Although integration models of service delivery are not new, interest in this model has increased, especially because of the desire of many governments to accelerate progress on reaching the health -related Millennium Development Goals and the promise this model holds on attaining those goals in an efficient manner (Pronyk et al. , 2012; Bhutta et al., 2008) . The rationale is that the management and delivery of multiple services (e.g., family planning and immunization ) within the same health center is more efficient than having a client travel to separate specialist clinics for each service because of a reduction in both financial and time costs (Briggs and Garner , 2006) . Integrated delivery can also reduce duplication of services and improve the overall quality of care received (Briggs and Garner , 2006) . As a result of the interest in integrated service delivery models, several studies have b een conducted to evaluate the impact of integrated health services in several low - to middle -income countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia (Pronyk et al. , 2012; Arifeen et 2010; Bryce et al. , 2005) . Some researchers have focus ed on child survival ( i.e., the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses [IMCI]) (Pronyk al. , et al. , 2005) , while others have looked at the integration of maternal health with child health services (Briggs and Garner , 2006; Bhutta et al., 2008) and the integration of services for HIV and other sexuall y transmitted diseases with other primary care services (Briggs and Garner , 2006) in addition to child health outcomes. Overall, the results of these studies, which include primary data analyses, as well as systematic reviews of other studies, have been mixed. For exa mple, a systematic review of studies evaluating integrated maternal, newborn, and child health services (MNCH) in low - and middle -income countries in Asia, sub- Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean found that 20 -30% of maternal de aths, 20- 21% of neonatal deaths and 29- 40% of under -five mortality could have been prevented by integrating MCH services at first -level health facilities (Bhutta et al. , 2008) . Similarly, a study evaluating the Millenniu m Villages Project in Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda found that villages receiving a integrated multi- sector package of services saw improvements in child nutritional status and malaria parasitemia in addition to reduced poverty and food insecurity over the three- year follow -up period compared to the matched control village sites (Pronyk et al. , 2012) . Other studies in Bangladesh (Arifeen et al. , 2009) and Benin, Ghana and Mali ( Bryce e t al., 2010) have shown mixed results or statistically insignificant changes . In studies where no significant differences were observed between intervention and control groups, the authors cited uneven implementation of the project (Bryce et al. , 2010) , gaps between expectations and reality (Bryce et al., 2005), and competing factors ( e.g., other immunization and nutritional supplementation program mes, compounded by over all improvements in the country's economy, water and sanitation systems and female education) during the study period as potential explanations (Arifeen et al. , 2009) . None of the studies mentioned above has investigated the 487 intervention packages implemented in the DRC. As a result, there is an absence of evidence on the effectiveness of integrated program mes in the DRC context . The findings from the ASSP evaluation are expected to contribute to filling this gap by rigorously studying the effectiveness of an integrated program me on improving the delivery of quality health s ervices, increasing health car e utilization and improving health outcomes. 2. Study Objectives Under the ASSP project, Tulane University's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (Tulane) is responsible for developing and carrying out a robust, state -of-the-art research evaluation of the overall impact of the comprehensive ASSP package of interventions on health care servi ce utilization, quality of care and health outcomes among the ASSP target population. To investigate the overall impact of the project , Tulane and the Kinshasa School of Public Health (KSPH) will conduct a population- based evaluation, consisting of a basel ine household, health care facility , health care provider and community leaders survey in early 2014 and a follow -up survey at the end of the project in 2017. The objectives of the surveys are two- fold. First, data from the surveys will be used to measure changes between the baseline and endline surveys in health outcomes, behaviors, and exposure to and use of health interventions. Second, the survey data will be used to assess the impact of the overall project (all ASSP activities described in T able 2) on selected health outcomes, behaviors, and the use of interventions . The following are the specific research questions that will be investigated : 1. What is the impact of the ASSP project on neonatal and child health outcomes (child nutritional status, anemia, fever during the past two weeks, diarrhea during the past two weeks, infant mortality)? 2. What is the impact of the ASSP project on specified types of health care utilization (maternal health services, including antenatal, delivery care, and postnatal services; immunization; outpatient treatment for both children and adults; inpatient services for both children and adults)? 3. What is the impact of the ASSP project on household out -of-pocket health care expenditure? 4. What is th e impact of the ASSP project on family planning (utilization of modern contraceptive methods, unmet need for family planning) ? 5. What is the impact of the ASSP project on community level environmental health (access to improved sources of drinking water and sanitation facilities) ? 6. What is the impact of ASSP on factors related to the quality of care (health facility service readiness, client satisfaction, health worker motivation)? 488 Because g ender is of particular interest to the Ministry of Health, the ASSP project and DFID , the study will also investigate whether the ASSP programme reduces gender disparities in the use of selected health care services and in health outcomes In designing the research study, Tulane is committed to adhering to the OECD DAC criteria for evaluating programmes and projects (relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability). 3. Study Methodology While the gold standard randomized controlled trial is the strongest methodical approach to any impac t evaluation, this method is not feasible for this study because health zones supported by the project were not selected randomly . An alternative approach to the evaluation given the staggered roll out of acti vities would be a step- wedge design. The streng ths of this design include the ability of clusters to act as their own control , thus reducing the number of clusters needed as well as the ability to study the effects of time on the intervention's effectiveness. However, a step-wedge design is not possibl e for three reasons . First, the ASSP project is committed to rolling out certain interventions as fast as possible while the rollout for other activities has not yet been planned beyond year one . Second, t he evaluation team does not control the timing and placement of most of the intervention activity . Last, given the large number of health zones targeted by the project and the lack of an efficient transportation system in the DRC , collecting data at numerous time points would increase the budget to a n unreasonable level. Because neither a randomized controlled trial n or a step -wedge design is possible , the impact evaluation will use a quasi -experimental panel design with constructed treatment and comparison groups (Figure 2 ). This will be coupled wit h appropriate data analysis strategies to assess the plausible attribution of ASSP support on outcome and impact indicators as described in section 9. 489 Figure 2. Quasi -experimental panel design with intervention and matched comparison groups The ASSP project will intervene in the health zones in four provinces, but for the purposes of this evaluation, we will treat them as three sampling areas , as follows . The first sampling area3 will consist of health zones in both Orientale and Maniema, the second sampling area will consist of health zones in Kas ai-Occidental , and the third sampling area will consist of health zones in Equator (see Figure 3) . Matched c omparis on groups consist of randomly selected villages within matched health areas outside of ASSP supported health zones that will not receive the ASSP intervention package (the matching process is described in section 4) 4. 3 In this context, a \"sampling area\" is synonymous with a \"survey domain.\" 4 The evaluation study will also take place in some health zones in Kasai -Orientale province. Health zones in Kasai -Orientale were used as matched comparison areas for intervention sampling areas in Kasai -Occidental as almost all Health zones in Kasai -Occidental are receiving ASSP interventions. 490 Figure 3. Map of e valuation areas Map legend: Blue areas indicate health zones in the three ASSP sampling areas, as defined above. G reen areas indicate the health zones from which matched comparison health areas were selected. Each health zone consists of multiple health areas , and each health area consists of multiple village s, as described in Figure 4 . It should be noted that a health zone is an administrative area used in the DRC's public health care delivery system. Each province is divided into numerous health zones and, as indicated in Figure 4, and each health zone is further divided into health are as. In theory, each health zone is comprised of one general reference hospital and is tasked with serving anywhere from 100,000 people in rural areas to 150,000 people in urban areas (Blum, 2011). Additionally, each health area is comprised of at least one health center and serves on average 17 villages in rural areas or neighborhoods in urban areas. 491 Figure 4. DRC health sector administrative units Given that socio- demographic and behavioural factors likely differ between the provinces, the creation of three separate sampling areas and three matched comparison groups will reduce potential confounding and control for secular trend differences influencing observed changes in outcomes in the respective geographic areas . Furthermore, it will allow for geographically representative estimates of population coverage and outcomes to be made for the intervention sampling areas . Data will be collected from households, community leaders , health care facilities and health care providers within six distinct groups (an intervention sampling area and a matched comparison group in each of the three major geographic areas) to ascertain population point estimates for all health and intervention coverage outcomes and i mpact level indicators at baseline and follow -up. As mentioned above, a quasi -experimental panel design will be used for this study. The study will be a panel at the village level, as villages selected for inclusion in the baseline will be the same villag es used in any subsequent surveys. Data collection will occur in the sampled villages in 2014 and again in the same villages in 2017. A household level panel design (i.e., a design whereby the same household is visited during follow -up surveys) across the two survey rounds makes it possible to control for unobserved household- level confounding factors that are fixed across time within units of observation ( households ), as well as to accurately measure changes in exposure over time. 492 Additional d ata collection during endline survey There will be two types of additional data that will be collected at endline. First, a dditional data will be collected to understand the degree of and reasons for ASSP's impact on health system functioning and health outcomes. This data collection will be comprised of a hospital survey that includes a module for hospital workers, a survey of regional centers for medicine procurement and distribution ( CDRs ), and a survey of health zone offices ( BCZs ). Data will be collected from 32 hospitals, 7 CDR's, and 32 BCZ's , half in ASSP and half in non- ASSP areas. Second, additional villages will be s elected in two of the sampling domains, the first covering Orientale and Maniema, and the second covering Equator. The reason for collecting this additional data is that it was determined in April 2017 that it would not be possible to revisit villages in one of the sampling areas ( Kasai ) that were included in the baseline survey due to political instability and violence. By collecting data from additional households and health facilities in the remaining sample provinces that can be revisited, it will be possible to conduct a single -difference approach to estimate impact by comparing intervention areas with matched comparison areas. The additional data will be collected from 70 additional villages (35 intervention and 35 matched comparison) and 70 additional health facilities (35 intervention and 35 matched comparison). O nce the political conditions stabilize , the endline survey wi ll be conducted in Kasai at a later date by visiting the same villages and health facilities that were included in the baseline survey. 4. Sampling Intervention sampling areas For the intervention sampling areas, a two stage sampling strategy was used. At first stage, the sampling frame consisted of a full list of all villages with population estimates for each ASSP supported health area provided by IMA World Health's needs assessment, conducted in June 2013. Villages we re then separated out to cr eate three separate lists of all possible villages for each of the three sampling areas . Next, for each sampling area, 35 villages were selected using probability proportional to size (PPS) to maximize sampling efficiency . This means a total of 105 village s were selected (35 in each of the three sampling areas) for the intervention area. The second -stage sampling frames will be created in the field where the survey team will map village boundaries and then enumerate all households in the village, writing a sequential number on each household dwelling in chalk and recording the total number of households in each selected village. Following complete enumeration, a constant number of 20 households will be 493 systematically selected from each village at the second stage to meet the desired sample size of 700 households in each sampling area. Enumeration of households within each village will also allow data to be weighted in the analysis . In addition, at endline, an additional 35 intervention villages will be sele cted in two of the three sampling domains (18 in the first of the two and 17 in the second of the two). The sampling procedures described above will be carried out to select a total of 700 additional intervention households). Matched comparison groups For the matched comparison groups , a three stage sampling design is necessary as a complete list of villages with population estimates is not available. At the first stage, a comparison group health area was matched to each health area that contained a sel ected village in the corresponding intervention sampling area. This was done using a list of health areas with population estimates obtai ned from the Ministry of Health. Health areas were matched based on four criteria: geographic location , health area population size, health area urban/rural status, and health zone vaccination coverage5. For geographic location, comparison health areas were included from non- intervention health zones within the same province or geographic area (Equateur, Kasai Orientale/ Occidental and Maniema/ Province -Oriental), but close enough to the ASSP supported health zones to be considered similar on socio- demographic characteristics, and additionally , to facilitate logistics for data collection. Health area population size was categorized as greater than or less than 5,000 population. Health zone vaccination coverage was categorized as \"High ,\" \"Second highest ,\" \"Low\" or \"Lowest .\" Match ed health areas were then randomly selected within each compari son group from listings of all health areas with the same four characteristics as the selected health area in the corresponding intervention sampling area. In this way, each selected health area in the intervention sampling areas has a corresponding matched health area in its comparison group in the same geographic location , with the same population level, the same urban/rural status, and the same vaccination coverage (at the level of its health zone). Thirty -five match ed health areas were selected within each comparison group, one for each of the health areas containing a selected village in the corresponding intervention group (no selected health areas contained more than one village). This means a total of 105 health areas were selected (35 in each of the three comparison groups) for the comparison area. At the second stage, once teams are in the field, a detailed list of villages with population estimates will be obtained from the health area office in the selected matched comparison health 5 Health zone vaccination coverage was used as a proxy as information on health area coverage was not available. Information on vaccination coverage was obtained from the national Extended Programme on Immunization. 494 areas. One village will be randomly selected from the list using simple random sampling. All households within each selected village will then be enumerated in the same manner as in intervention sampling areas. In the third stage, 20 hous eholds will be systematically selected from each village to meet the desired sample size of 700 households in each comparison group. In addition, at endline, an additional 35 matched comparison villages will be selected in two of the three sampling domai ns (18 in the first of these two and 17 in the second of these two). The sampling procedures described above will be carried out to select a total of 700 additional matched comparison households). Matching was conducted using all available background information for both project intervention areas and control areas. This information was unfortunately limited to a small number (n=4) of variables. As such, the matching might not be adequate to control for all possible differences between intervention and control areas. After the baseline survey, the quality of matching will be evaluated through a series of descriptive comparisons of various demographic and community characteristics as well as baseline values for the study outcomes. This will help to ensure th at any covariates not adequately controlled for in the matching process can be controlled for in adjusted difference- in-differences models of study outcomes for the final evaluation. While a difference- in-differences analysis relies on the assumption of eq ual trends, the validity of such an assumption is impossible to prove and difficult to assess in practice. In the framework of this study it would require background data on the study outcomes at a minimum of two time points in the intervention and control areas before the start of baseline data collection. Such data is unavailable. Sample size for household survey For measuring changes in key indicators of health outcomes and intervention coverage within the quasi -experimental design, a total of 4,200 households will be sampled at baseline and again at endline, and an additional 1,400 households will be sampled at endline only . A sample size of 700 households per sampling area in the ASSP project area and in comparison groups was sought for measuring changes in all health and intervention coverage indicators, based on being able to detect a 10% increase in the percentage of household members using improved sources of drinki ng water from a baseline of 31%, with 80% statistical power, assuming a 5% probability of committing a type -1 error (1 -sided test), a design effect of 2 and non -response rate of 10% for each round (household non- response). A design effect of 2 equates to a n intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.176 based on previous data from the Demographic and Health Survey ( DHS ), and sampling 35 villages per sampling area or matched comparison group at first sampling stage, given the overall sample size of households e stimated above . This means a t otal sample size of 495 4,200 households when including both the three intervention sampling area s and the three matched comparison groups , and an additional 1,400 household at endline only in two of the three intervention sampling areas and two of the three matched comparison sampling areas . The sample size formula used and a table of sample size input parameters is described in Appendix 2. As this survey uses a village level panel design approach, and not an individual panel design approach, dropout from baseline survey to endline survey i s not anticipated to be a risk. Table 4 presents the detailed samples size estimates by subgroup and T able 5 presents the detectable differences expected with 80% statistical power for illustrative health and intervention coverage indicators. Detectable differences for the sample size of 700 households for elements below the household level (e.g., children, WRA and pregnant women) assume 5.20 people of all ages, 0.99 children, 1.00 WRA and 0.13 pregnant women per household (assumptions are based on data from the DHS 2007 using only rural sampling areas ). Illustrative examples of the resultant statistical power based on the given sample size, across potential detectable difference ranges, is given in A ppendix 2. As outlined above , the sampling method will aim to take the maximum number of village s per sampling area that is logistically feasible for fieldwork given the survey budget, while maximizing precision and statistical power ( number of village per sampling area / matched comparison group = 35; 210 total across the 3 intervention sampling areas and the 3 match comparison groups ). While taking more villages and fewer households per village would result in a slight addition of statistical power of approximately 1% for each additional 5 villages in the first stage selection (e.g. , going from 80% to 81%) , the logistical and budgetary constraints of the study prohibit this.

Sample size for health center/post survey A convenience sample of one health center /post for each sampled village , in total 280 facilities ( 210 health centers /posts at both baseline and endline, and an additional 80 health centers /posts at endline only ) will be chosen once teams are in the field . As the sample for the household survey consists of one village per health area, the health center /post officially designated to serve households in that health area will be chosen for the health center /post survey. Conducting the facility survey in the same areas as the household survey will allow sample households to be \"linked\" to the attributes of a nearby health care facilit y that they can utilize , making it possible to investigate the role of facility attributes in the utilization of health care services. Following the panel design approach, the same selected facilities will be surveyed at baseline and endline. Sample size for health center/post providers survey A convenience sample of all health center /post providers on duty at chosen health facilities the day of the survey will be used. The exact sample size will be dependent on the number of individuals working in each facility on the day of the visit. As 2 80 health facilities will be visited, a minimum of 2 80 health care providers will be interviewed. However, it is estimated that the average number of health care providers on duty at a facility on any given day is between two and three. As s uch the sample size is expected to be between 560 and 840 health workers. 498 Sample size for community leaders survey A minimum of two community leaders will be interviewed for each sampled village , totaling a minimum of 560 community leaders to be interviewed (420 villages and endline and baseline and an additional 140 at endline only ). Sample size for hospital survey A random sample of 32 hospitals serving the sampled health areas at endline only will be chosen once teams are in the field. Sample size for hospital provider survey Within each hospital visited at endline only , a random sample of 4 physicians and 4 nurses will be selected, yielding a total of 256 hospital workers. Sample size for regional center for medicine procurement and distribution (CDR) survey All seven regional centers for medicine procurement and distribution in provinces serving the sampled health zones will be visited at endline only. Sample size for health zone office survey A random sample of 32 health zone offices serving the sampled health areas at endline only will be chosen once teams are in the field. 5. Recruitment and Data Collection Tools Recruitment As all data collection requires face- to-face interviews, the data collection team will recruit individuals in selected households, health facilities and at the home or office of the appropriate community leader. Once sampled households, health facilities a nd community leaders have been selected, data collectors will approach the household or facility and speak with the head of household or facility in -charge. Dat a collectors will carry out the informed consent process, which includes an explan ation of the p urpose of the study, the risks and benefits of participating in the study and the time required by each interview . Also, it explains that the individual has the choice to participat e or not participate in the study . If a household respondent decides not to participate , the survey team will note this and approach the next selected household or eligible household member. There will be no replacement for refusal in the household or wom en's survey. If a community leader or an entire health facility refuses to participate, data collectors will visit another prominent community member or another health establishment (the closest or next closest health establishment to the sampled village) , to ensure 499 the target sample size is met. If an individual health care provider refuses to participate, data collectors will note this and continue interviewing all other eligible health care provider on duty the day of the survey . Household and Woman's Survey Tools Questionnaire For each household selected, the head of the household as well as all female household members of reproductive age (15- 49 years) will be interviewed. All individuals who slept in the household last night (the de facto population), as well as usual household members (the de jure population) will b e considered household residents. Information for all children under five years of age who are household members will also be collected. When possible, this will be done by interviewing the mother. However, in a case where no mother is present, the primary care giver will be interviewed to take into account vulnerable children, orphans and child- headed households. Anthropometric Measurements To assess child nutritional status, age, height and weight data for children 0 to 59 months of age will be collecte d using standard scales and height measurement tools . This information will be used to generate standardized measures for weight -for-height, weight -for-age and height - for-age. Biomarker Collection Finger pricks will be performed on all children age 1 to 59 months who are household members. The data collectors for all blood samples will be trained health personnel. Data collectors will receive standardized training to conduct finger pricks for anemia and malaria parasitaemia in every household sampled. The purpose of the survey will be explained and if the parent's consent is given, a finger prick will be done. The blood drops will be used as follows: (i) 1 st drop of blood will be wiped from the finger; (ii) 2nd drop will be used in the Hemocue photometer to determine the child's hemoglobin level; (iii) 3rd drop will be applied to a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT); and (iv) the 4th and final drop will be placed on a filter paper for confirmation of diagnoses using PCR. After the tests have been conducted and the results have been obtained, used supplies will be discarded according to local disposal regulations. All filter paper blood specimens from selected households will also be examined at Tulane University for the presence of malaria parasites using PCR. This will allow for a very sensitive and precise measurement of infection within the study population. Health Center/Post Survey Tool As only one village for the household survey is selected per health area, the health center designated for serving that health area will be selected. The head nurse will be interviewed using a structured questionnaire to measure facility level indicators. 500 Hospital Survey Tool The head physician or nurse will be interviewed using a structured questionnaire to measure hospital level indicators. Assessment of the availability of specific types of health care services and an abbreviated inventory of infrastruc ture, equipment, laboratories, medicines and other commodities will be conducted to provide an independent assessment of the facility's readiness to provide health care services. Health P rovider Survey Tool (to be administered at health facilities includin g hospitals) For each health facility selected, individuals responsible for providing health care services ( e.g., doctors, nurses, midwives) are considered health workers and are eligible for the health worker survey. Within health centres/posts all individuals meeting these criteria who are on duty the day of the survey will be interviewed using a structured questionnaire to measure individual heath worker indicators. Within hospitals, a random sample of four physicians and four nurses will be sur veyed. Community Leader Survey Tool For each village selected, a minimum of two community leaders will be interviewed using a structured questionnaire . One of the respondents will be a health zone or health area official. The other respondent will be a community health committee (CODESA) member where possible, and if no CODESA member is available, another prominent member of the community such as a village chief or teacher will be interviewed. Regional Center for Medicine Procurement and Distribution ( CDR ) Survey Tool The director of the CDR (or designee) will be interviewed using a structured questionnaire to measure organization level indicators and to assess SSP's level of influence on the performance of the CDR. Health Zone Office ( BCZ ) Survey Tool The Chief Physician of the Health Zone (or designee) will be interviewed using a structured questionnaire to measure organization level indicators and assess ASSP's level of influence on the performance of the BCZ. Data collection methods Baseline data will be collected via paper forms. For the endline survey, data will be collected with smartphones using OpenDataKit (ODK). ODK is an open source, Android- based data collection application which has been used for many large household and faci lity surveys in the DRC since 2012. 501 Geographical information system data The longitude and latitude of each village and health facility will be ascertained using geographic positioning system (GPS) to assess community level factors associated with ecological conditions and distance to health services. Such data will be ascertained from taking a longitude and latitude reading with a GPS unit at the center of each selected village at first visit and at each selected health facility. Such data will then be analyzed using a geographic information system (GIS). As GPS points will be for the center of the village only and not for each selected household, no personal data will be able to be linked back to households or individuals. 6. Indicators Household and individual level indicators The household survey will cover the major health topics of interest under the ASSP Project including access to safe drinking water, immunizations, reproductive health, child malaria paras ite prevalence, family planning and c hild nutrition and well as community engagement, health care utilization for ac ute and chronic health problems and health care financing. Face -to-face interviews will be conducted and w herever appropriate, the survey use s similar indicators and collection protocols as the DHS and MICS, to ensure comparability of data and processes. It also draw s on questionnaires used by IMA and DFID in previous Knowledge - Practice- Coverage studies in the DRC. To assess whether the project is having its intended effects , the following selected indicators will be used (for exact definitions, calculation methods and data sources see Appendix 3): Children's Health Outcomes 1. Percentage of children under 5 with fever in past 2 weeks 2. Percentage of children under 5 with diarrhea in the past 2 weeks 3. Percentage of children under 5 with suspected pneumonia in the past 2 weeks 4. Percentage of children under 5 underweight (-2 SD) 5. Percentage of children under 5 stunted ( -2 SD) 6. Percentage of children under 5 wasted ( -2 SD) 7. Percent age of childre n age 1 to 59 months with Malaria parasite in their blood 8. Percentage of children 1- 59 months with anemia 9.

Percent age of households that are satisfied with their involvement in decision making regarding health care 24. Percent age of communities with a health committee (CODESA) Client Satisfaction 25. Percent of clients sick or injured in the last four weeks who were satisfied with services received 26. Percent of client hospitalized in the last six months who were satisfied with services received Family Planning 27. Percentage of women age 15- 49 currently using any modern method of family planning 28. Contraceptive method mix (percent distribution of users by method) 29. Percentage of woman age 15- 49 with an unmet need for family planning Malaria 30. Percentage of households with 1 ITN 503 31. Percent age of pregnant women who slept under ITN last night Health facility level indicators An interviewer or assistant supervisor will visit the official health center designated for serving the health area in which each selected village is located . The head doctor/ nurse w ill be interviewed about the availability of specific types of health care services and an abbreviated inventory of infrastructure, equipment, laboratories, medicines and other commodities will be conducted to provide an independent assessment of the facility's readiness to provide health care services, an important aspect of the quality of c are available. In addition, all health care providers on duty the day of the visit will be interviewed regarding health care provider motivation , job satisfaction and priorities. Both surveys will use a structured questionnaire. The health facility and health care provider survey will be designed to answer three broad questions related to the health system at the local level: What is the availability of various types of health care services (preventive and curative) at the facility? To what extent are f acilities and health workers prepared to provide these services? What are the perceptions of health workers about various aspects of the work environment, including financial and non- financial factors? The following selected indicators will be used (for exact definitions, calculation methods and data sources see Appendix 3): Service readiness 1. Percent age of health centers with adequate equipment 2. Percent age of health centers with adequate drug supplies 3. Percent age of health centers offering the minimum package of services required to provide preventative services 4. Percent age of health centers offering the minimum package of services to provide curative care Health w orker incentives and m otivation 5. Percent age of health care providers satisfied with specified aspects of the work environment, including financial and non- financial aspects 6. Percent age of health care providers receiving performance -based incentives Community leader indicators While the community leaders survey will not provide data specifically tracking indicators to assess the impact of ASSP, it will provide basic community level information. This 504 information will be used to track community level changes over the course of the 5-year study. Data from this survey will be particularly useful in comparison areas where it is likely that other , non-ASSP interventions will be introduced. The introduction of outside interventions is out of the control of the evaluation team and will l ikely change community characteristic from the time of the baseline study to the endline survey. In order to control for these changes, community level data needs to be collected and accounted for in the analysis stage. 7. Data Collection KSPH will take a lead role in overseeing the fieldwork for this study and are required to submit monthly progress reports to Tulane . KSPH will be responsible for recruiting and training interviewers and health personnel for blood collection; pre -testing the instruments; supervising the fieldwork; overseeing the data entry, cleaning and processing; and producing descriptive analys es. Data collectors will be hired from each of the provinces to insure appropriate language skills and familiarity with the cultural context. Ethical approval of the study and collection procedures will be obtained from the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of both Tulane and KSPH before data collection commences. Table 6.

Data P rocessing and M anagement Tulane will be responsible for overseeing data management. Baseline d ata will be double entered by KSPH study personnel into EpiInfo using customized entry screens. Endline data will be collected on mobile devices. Data will be cleaned by thoroughly checking whe ther indicator values fall within plausible ranges, confirming whether sk ip patterns have been respected and assessing whether survey responses are consistent with previous responses. In addition, for many indicators that are in common with those in the 2013- 2014 DRC DHS , the validity of the results will be assessed by comparing data from the baseline survey with the DHS survey. All data forms and records collected during this research will be held in a secure location at KSPH and/or Tulane University for t he duration of the proposed research by the principal investigator, Dr. Joe Keating. Confidentiality of all respondents will be ensured through the replacement of any personal information with unrelated unique identifiers. Where relevant, names and locati on information will be separated from the electronic data processed for analysis. The only identifiers used during the analysis will be a unique identification number. All data will be kept under lock and key or password protected computer, with only key personnel having access. 9. Data Analysis The evaluation will employ multiple state -of-the-art analytic approaches, nested within a linked population- based and health facility -based quasi -experimental panel study design. The use of multiple data analysis methods will provide a robust and comprehensive assessment of the impact of the overall package of ASSP -supported interventions on a range of indicators. Based on the study design described earlier in this protocol, analyses will be conduc ted at the individual -, household- , facility -, and health worker -levels, depending on the outcome of interest . (See T able 6 for a summary of outcome indicator s and their respective units of analysis) . 507 All point estimates from surveys will be weighted to correct for differences in sampling area sizes and inaccurate estimates of village sizes. All standard errors will be empirically estimated to account for correlated data at the village level. Differences in key outcome indicators of interest between intervention areas and comparison groups and between baseline and follow -up surveys will be assessed with multivariate regression modeling to account for potential confounding factors. This approach is necessary, given the non- randomized study design. Such models will also allow us to assess the association of exposures to interventions and risk factors on health outcomes. Two types of multivariate analysis will be conducted: a dose -response analysis and a diffe rence -in-differences analysis. The dose -response analysis is designed to assess how programme outcomes relate to the intensi ty of programme interventions. The analysis will account for the fact that certain activities will have been implemented before the baseline study data collection has started . It will focus on measuring programme exposure as a dose -response, irrespective of intervention or comparison group assignation. Each village will be categorized using an index into \"None,\" \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" or \"High\" groups to measure the incremental effect on health covera ge and impact indicators. The index of exposure will be developed and villages will be categorized through consultations with IMA and the implementing partners, by examining ASSP quarterly progress reports and routine data collected by ASSP , as well as the data collected by this study 's community -, health facility - and health provider surveys . Specifically , the community leaders survey is designed to capture information on specific program mes or interventions happening at the village -, health area- and heal th zone - level and this data will inform the development of the index and categorization of villages. Using assigned categories, we will use multinomial regression models to test for the effect on outcomes (including health care utilization and health outc omes), while controlling for potential confounding factors. Additionally, for assessing the impact of the ASSP project , a difference -in-difference analysis with a multiplicative interaction term in models for representing time*group assignment will be used . In this way, the net program me effect can be distinguished from the gross program me effect, thereby limiting the bias of secular drift, external confounding factors and potential confounding factors, to the extent possible. For all models, nested random effects at the sampling area and village level will be used to account for correlated data within geographic areas for standard error estimation, as well as heterogeneity between areas in estimation of regression coefficients. Many of the analyses, when appropriate, will be stratified by gender to assess whether the project had an impact on reducing disparities between males and females (e.g., child health outcomes and health care utilization). 508 10. Study limitations The proposed s tudy has some limitations. First, as mentioned above, a \"gold standard\" randomized control trial is not feasible for this study because the target health zon es were selected non -randomly. In addition, a step- wedge design is not appropriate due to IMA Health's approach to introduce and scale up the interventions, as described earlier. While t he quasi - experimental design allows for the plausible attribution of the outcomes to the project, it does not allow for observed changes (impact) to be definitively attributed to ASSP interventions only. Indeed other projects and initiatives might also explain changes in the observed value of indicators , although the study attempts to control for these factors . Second, as this study will employ a panel design, there is the risk of loss -to-follow up from baseline to endline. This risk is limited however, baring a disaster o r extreme population movement, as the panel design follows the same villages, and not the same individuals or households over time. Third, the limited availability of data means that the matching of comparison groups could only be done on four characterist ics. The limited number of matching variables may hinder the comparability of the invention areas and matched comparisons groups. To account for this, descriptive comparisons of demographic and community characteristics will be assessed which will help ens ure all covariates are appropriately controlled for in the difference -in-difference analysis. Fourth , due to unforeseen circumstances , data collection for the baseline phase will be delayed by almost by 10 months after launching of the ASSP Project , which means that the results of the difference -in- differences approach may be biased towards the null hypothesis. To address this constraint, a dose-response analysis will be conducted to assess the associations between the intensity and coverage of the ASSP int erventions with the outcomes of interest. Fifth , the selection of villages in the comparison groups was made based on common characteristics between the health areas in which they are located and health areas containing villages in the intervention samplin g area. However, these comparison villages might have been (or could be) exposed to interventions from other health initiatives or projects. While this is out of the control of the research team, the presence of other intervention efforts will be controlle d for using data collected through the community leaders survey. Last, the sampling plan allows for comparisons to be made between ASSP supported health zones and those not supported by ASSP . However, the sampled households are not representative at the he alth zone level nor can the differential impact of ASSP on the outcomes of interest be validly tested across health zones. 11. Results Dissemination Upon completion of the baseline and endline survey reports , Tulane and KSPH will be responsible for hosting a results dissemination workshop to inform all stakeholders of the survey results. Reports will be written in English and in French, summarizing the study results . The workshop will present the findings in a clear and c oncise manner and invitees will include representative from DFID, IMA World Health , Implementing Partners, Tulane, the M inistry o f Health and where possible community leaders from the communities selected for the study . In 509 addition, datasets will be public ly released after the conclusion of the study , following data sharing policies of the Ministry of Health and DFID. 12. Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research Protection of human subjects Risks to subjects We will use a quasi -experimental, matched comparison group design that targets households and residents in addition to health workers and community leaders. Survey data will be collected at baseline and post -intervention. All households and health facilities satisfying the geographic criterion, and all health workers and community leaders with the appropriate credentials, irrespective of the respondents' health status will be considered for selection into the study. Because a representative sample of villages and households will be taken, no sub- population will be deliberately included or excluded from the study. Age, gender, location, demographic characteristics of the respondents and health -related or employment -related data will be collected at each sampling interval. The ASSP project will support a wide array of health interventions (including clinical interven tions, behavioral interventions and interventions designed to improve health financing and community engagement). All of the ASSP targeted health zones will receive most of the inte rventions during the course of the project, with the exception of some health systems interventions that are viewed as experimental. For these interventions, ASSP will conduct pilot interventions, and then these interventions will be scaled up during follow -up activities if effectiveness is shown by supplemental operations research studies . There may be physical risks to the household participants/respondents associated with a finger stick f rom blood drop collection, but they are not considered more than minimal. Lancets or needle sticks are potentially, but only temporarily, painful. In addition, blood will be collected using standard hygienic practices ( e.g., one needle per child, disinfecting finger using alcohol swabs, etc.) and materials will be disp osed of according to national guidelines. The risk to data collectors of needle sticks involving HIV positive individuals and the risks of transmission, however, will be minimized, as the study will use trained health personnel. Our proposed strategy to reduce risks associated with finger pri cks include: Explain ing the physical procedures carefully to the mother or caretaker of each child so that she understands the potential pain associated with collection of blood for parasitem ia or hemoglobin data but also understands that the pain is unlikely to be more than temporary. 510 Using specially trained and supervised fieldworkers who will be able to answer commonly asked questions. Specially train ing fieldworkers to collect potentiall y sensitive questionnaire data and ensur ing that all data entry personnel are trained on confidentiality and safety issues, as well as on informed consent procedures. Using the most efficacious testing procedures available to ensure sterile and safe biological data collection and testing. Using trained health personnel to collect and handle biological specimens and receive special training on universal precautions for handling all biological specimens (see section on t raining below). Using trained healt h personnel to minimize the potential for HIV transmission to data collectors from the needle stick procedure. Results from the anemia testing and malaria RDTs will be available immediately. Anyone testing positive for malaria or found with hemoglobin levels of less than 7g/dl will be given written results and referred to the nearest health facility where treatment will be provided based on national guidelines . Anyone with severe malaria will be referred to the closest hospital. There is also the risk of breach of confidentiality or privacy during the data collection or storage process; processes to mitigate these risks are detailed below. In addition, all data will be stored under lock and key or password protected computers. Only key personnel and data managers will have access to collected data. The use of unique identifiers will further ensure that no data are linked to individuals. The researchers will retain the data without identifiers for possible use in future data analysis related to this project, which will be consistent with the original research purpose. Informed consent The study team will obtain oral informed consent from each survey respondent a s well as provide contact information to each participant. The consent transcript will be read to the respondent in French and/or a local language by the interviewer. The consent forms and procedures will follow exactly those that are app roved by the Ministry of Health and institutional review board of Tulane and KSPH . These forms will be read to each participant and will include a description of voluntary participation (no penalty for non-participation), the right to withdraw from the study at any time and the right to not answer any question or refuse to have blood samples taken. This will also include a description of the panel design approach, explaining that data collectors will conduct the survey during the current visit and then will attempt to return (to the village or health facility) and conduct the full survey one more time in 2017. As some households may be selected for the baseline and endline 511 surveys, it will be explained that consent will be obtained before each interview. The transcript will also address the risks, benefits and purpose of the study and what we hope to learn. All respondents 15 years of age and older will provide oral consent for their own participation, as well as for the p articipation of their children. In the DRC, anyone under the age of 18 is legally considered a minor. However, individuals 15 years of age and older fre quently assume adult responsibilities, including mar riage, childbearing, caretaking and labor force participation, and are expected to understand the implications of informed consent. Therefore, for the purposes for this study, 15 years of age will be used as the age of consent. In health facilities and for community leaders, the assumption is that all respondents will be over the age of 18. We will train all interviewers extensively on the consent procedures, and each form will be signed by a team member t o ensure all participants have consented (see section on training below). Checks in the field by the PI and project leaders will further ensure the consenting process is followed in all cases. Data collection team members will provide a list of health facilities they can contact for any further information on the topics brought up in the interview, or for treatment if necessary. The confidentiality procedures are designed to meet all contingencies so that the privacy of the participants is preserved. Language While the DRC's official language is French , the four national languages, Kikongo, Swahili, Tshiluba and Lingala , are the languages predominating spoken in different regions of the country. For the propose of this study, all survey instruments and consent transcripts were professionally translated from English to French and reviewed by the Tulane ORIE Research Director based in Kinshasa, as well as the KSPH researchers . The household, woman's and community leader's survey s and accompanying cons ent transcripts were then translated from French i nto Swahili, Tshiluba and Linga la by local translation teams identified by KSPH 6. The teams consisted of professional multi -lingual translators whose first language was the local language of interest. The Tulane ORIE Research Director based in Kinshasa and KSPH then held a workshop to back translate selected questions and review the local language translations for accuracy. Household members and community leaders will be given the choice of language for the interview. All data collectors will be fluent in French as well as the dominant local language spoken in the area to which they are assigned. It is assumed that health care providers have obtained a certain level of education and are fluent in French; therefore all health facility and health worker surveys , the CDR and the BCZ surveys will be administered in French. 6 This study is not operating in areas where Kikongo is spoken. 512 Potential benefits of the proposed research to the subjects and others The selected intervention villages as a whole and the individuals within the selected intervention villages specifically will potentially benefit from improved health as a result of the planned health systems strengthening interventions. The na tional health policy makers will potentially benefit from the availability of evidence of the effectiveness of the project in improving health outcomes. Importance of knowledge to be gained The development of novel strategies for improving access to healt h care and health seeking behavior, and subsequently the control of disease, is essential if we are to successfully improve child and maternal health in DRC. The results from this study will inform decision - makers as to the potential effectiveness, or lack thereof, of interventions for increasing health care seeking behavior, and thus reducing the burden of various diseases. As well, the results of this study will provide information about why individuals choose to use or not -use methods of personal protect ion against disease, as well as why or why not individuals choose to access health care within a specific cultural and societal context; this information is extremely important for formulating cost -effective disease control strategies. Inclusion of women a nd minorities Most of the adult participants will be women, as this project has a strong focus on maternal and child health and consists of a woman's questionnaire. The household questionnaire will be administered to the head of household, which can be mal e or female. Our study will be conducted outside of the U.S., and no racial , ethnic group will be excluded. We do not expect to find race/ethnicity differences in the intervention effect. Inclusion of children Children are a major focus of this research, a nd all child household members between the ages of 0 and 59 months will be selected for the study. Training of data collectors All data collectors will undergo a ten -day training on interview techniques, privacy, confidentiality and the consent procedure. Health personnel will be trained on the collection of biological samples. The PI and investigators have extensive experience administering such trainings in international settings. The trainings will utilize standard materials developed by USAID's MEASURE/ DHS Project, which carried out a nationally representative household survey s in DR -Congo in 2007 and 2013. Remuneration Respondents will not be paid to participate in the study. 513 Costs Apart from the respondents' time, t here will be no costs to individuals participating in this research study. 13. Planning, Study Management and G overnance Planning The evaluation of ASSP Project is being conducted by Tulane University's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine Operations Research and Impact Evaluation (ORIE) t eam as part of the research activities of the Department of Global H ealth Systems and Development. Tulane has established an office in Kinshasa to monitor the implementation of health development activities undertaken with Tulane technical assistan ce in th e DRC. With regard to ASSP evaluation, the Tulane KSPH team is composed of a Senior Research Director and a Research Manger . Tulane's ORIE Team has already accomplished the following activities: (1) signature of subcontract with IMA for conducting ASSP project impact evaluation and implementing operations research ; (2) elaboration and submission of impact evaluation baseline study protocol; (3) submission of the Protocol to Tulane 's Institutional Review Board; (4) subcontracting of KSPH to conduct a pretest of methodology and instruments; (5) r evision of baseline study methodology and instruments based on the findings from the pretest; (6) subcontracting of KSPH for implementing the baseline study. KSPH has so far accomplished the following activitie s: (1) submission of the Protocol to KSPH Institutional Review Board; (2) pretesting of study methodology and instruments; (3) reporting of pretest findings to Tulane ORIE Team; (4) translation of study instruments into local languages (Lingala, Swahili an d Tshiluba); (5) and an initial training of baseline study data collection supervisors.

The Tulane ORIE team based in New Orleans , led by Prof essors Jane Bertrand (the Principal Investigator of the ORIE component and responsible for administrative issues ), David Hotchkiss (the Technical lead for the ORIE component ), and Joe (the PI for the im pact evaluation) . They are assisted by Ms. Sarah Mattison, a grant s pecialist who is responsible for the financial management of the study. The ORIE team regularly visits Kinshasa for discussions with DFID, IMA, local Tulane team and KSPH team. Tulane repo rts on progress of the study to DFID and IMA. The local Tulane t eam works closely with DFID, IMA, KSPH, and the Ministry of Health to ensure that relevant aspects of DRC health system are t aken into account in the study. The team also participates in all study activities undertaken by KSPH ( e.g., pretest of instruments, selection of data collection sites, training of supervisors and data collectors, translation of study instruments into French and local languages). The team plays a key role in the planning of field activities and in the revision of study instruments. It also particip ates in discussions with DFID on a regular basis . Quality control is ensured both by both the New Orleans -based and Kinshasa - based team . Figures 5 presents the organogram of the ASSP e valuation t eam and information flow. Study Co -investigator, Prof essor Antoinette Tshefu, Director of KSPH (at the University of Kinshasa) is responsible for the m anagement of the subcontract between Tulane and KSPH and for the implementation of t he study. She is assisted by Prof essor Mala Ali Mapatano who heads the study's research team at KSPH. There are four other members in the coordination team (a professor of public health, two graduate students who hold MD/ MPH degrees among which is a labor atory specialist, and an administrator/accountant). Several other KSPH graduates are members of data collection supervision team (see Appendix 5 for KSPH organogram) . 517 Figure 5. ASSP evaluation baseline study data and information flow Governance The decisions relat ed to study methodology, budget and timing are taken in consultation with DFID and IMA on the basis of proposals made by Tulane ORIE Team. This is achieved through both face -to-face and telephone discussions. Tulane 's ORIE team and IMA entertain collaborative relationships facilitated by the physical proximity of their two offices in Kinshasa. However Tulane 's ORIE team remains independent f rom IMA in terms of financial management, staffing, office space, equipment and operations.

IMA have subcontracted Tulane University to deliver the ORIE component of the project. The ASSP project inception phase began in late 2012. It was intended that the consortium lead would be responsible for developing and agreeing ToRs with subcontracted partners at the time of signing their sub -contracts. DFID provided some basic guidance in terms of minimum specifications for sub -contracts of the A SSP project in Annex 1 of the overall ASSP ToRs. However, IMA contracted Tulane in the absence of ToRs. Therefore, i n December 2013 DFID drafted the following ToRs on behalf of IMA and they were agreed in January 2014. These now replace the technical s ub-contract specifications (as outlined in Annex 1 of the Terms of Reference for the Consortium Lead of ASSP). The ToRs reflect the current programme requirements and adjustments that have been made since the ASSP project started in 2012 . These ToRs fol low the DFID SEQ AS template for evaluation ToRs rather than the DFID PRG format (which the ASSP ToRs use). This document only outlines technical rather than financial /other requirements. Other requirements such as financial reporting, management of asset s and liability etc are outlined in the contract between IMA and Tulane University. Page 4 of 30 1.0 Introduction DFID and SIDA are providing \u00a3185 million over five years (2012 -2017) to strengthen basic health service provision in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in order to improve reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health. The ASSP (Acc\u00e8s aux Soins de Sant\u00e9 Primaires) programme is implemented by IMA World Health for DFID and focuses on supporting basic service provision (through government and faith based facilities across 56 health zones ) and wider health systems strengthening work nationally. ASSP is an ambitious pr oject with considerable investment. DFID is committed to ensuring that impact is evaluated and that lessons are learnt that can be fed back both into the project and disseminated more widely. In recognition of this, w ithin the overall ASSP budget, DFID has allocated \u00a34.7m for an Operations Research and Impact Evaluation sub -component. This subcomponent is implemented by Tulane University as a sub -contract to IMA. The ASSP consortium was selected in July 2012 and a design -phase contract awarded to IMA in October 2012. After a procedural delay, implementation began in April 2013. Support was limited to 20 pre -existing project health zones for the first quarter and then expanded to 56 zones from July 2013. In January 2013, Tulane completed an Evaluability Assessment for ASSP. These ToRs were drafted in December 2013 (14 months after the inception phase started) and therefore reflect some of the discussion and work that has already been done within the project. DFID has taken an active r ole in drafting these ToRs since it recognises that since this is a specialised function that it was not an appropriate expectation for IMA to have developed these without appropriate technical support. 2.0 Purpose and Objectives of the ORIE component 2.1 Purpose The purpose of ASSP's operational research is to improve programme outcomes and perform ance, to assess the feasibility and cost effectiveness of specific programme components in the DRC and, when necessary, to advocate for policy or programme change. 2.2 Objectives The objectives of the evaluation and operational research component are as follows : A. Provide a baseline and end line assessment of health status and health service status. B. Evaluate of the overall impact of the ASSP Project , for example, on health behaviours, service utilization, and health outcomes. C. Conduct a mid-point process evaluation to provide information to strengthen the management of the ASSP project. Page 5 of 30 D. Conduct a series of operations research studies that focus on sp ecific interventions within the ASSP pr ogramme to provide information f or DFID and implementing partners on what works in supporting health service delivery and health systems strengthening in the DRC. E. Participate in implementing the monitoring plan by tracking and monitoring indicators requiring surveys in the log -frame that will be measured with data from baseline and follow up household and health care facility surveys. F. Disseminate evaluation and operational research findings to ASSP implementing partners , DFID and the Government of DRC/other donors to inform programme implementation decisions, demonstrate programme impact (both positive and unintended negative effects) and to share good practice and lessons learnt. 2.3 Theory of Change See annex ( ii) 2.4 Research questions to be answered Evaluatio n studies (i) Baseline assessment The baseline assessment should be able to collect baseline data in order to answer the endpoint impact evaluation questions outlined in section 2.4.iii below. It should also be able to produce a stand -alone report summarising key health status information and health service information for the populations /areas assessed. (ii) Midpoint process evaluation The midpoint evaluation should be able to produce key information to inform the on - going management of the ASSP project including questions such as; a) Is the ASSP project being implemented according to the plan and is it likely to reach the targets in the logframe ? b) Can the results reported to date be verified? Provide independent verification of reported results from the project through spot checks and third party verification at health facilities and in communities. c) What are the main barriers to ASSP reaching its potential and what solutions are proposed for the second half of the project? (iii) Endpoint impact evaluation The evaluation should assess the overall impact of the ASSP ( Acc\u00e8s aux Soins de Sant\u00e9 Primaires health outcomes, health care utilization, out -of-pocket expenditures, and exposure to and use of health interventions. This question is concerned with the core package of services provided by ASSP; it is not focusing on the programme in conjunction with other interventions such as WASH. The specific research questions are the following: Page 6 of 30 What is the impact of the ASSP project on neonatal and child health outcomes (child nutritional status, anemia, fever during the past two weeks, diarrhea during the past two weeks, infant mortality)? What is the impact of the ASSP project on specified types of health care utilization (maternal health services, including antenatal, delivery care, and postnat al services; immunization; outpatient treatment for both children and adults; inpatient services for both children and adults)? What is the impact of the ASSP project on household out -of-pocket health care expenditure? What is the impact of the ASSP projec t on family planning (utilization of modern contraceptive methods, unmet need for family planning)? What is the impact of the ASSP project on community level environmental health (access to improved sources of drinking water and sanitation facilities)? What is the impact of ASSP on factors related to the quality of care (health facility service readiness, client satisfaction, health worker motivation)? NB: In the longer term, DFID is interested to know whether the ASSP program was sustainable and did it remain as effective? In order to assess this research would need to be carried out after the package of support from ASSP has ended. Currently the contract of Tulane ends at the same time as the end of the ASSP project. DFID may therefore commission a further study on sustainability either as a cost -extension of the subcontract, a stand -alone contract to Tulane or commission this to another supplier. Operations Research studies DFID and Tulane University1 have agreed that operations research will be conducted to answer questions related to interventions relevant to ASSP . Tulane should conduct a minimum of six operations research studies. The exact study titles and study questions should be developed by T ulane and approved by DFID in a concept note for each one before proceeding to the next stage. Study name Examples of types of questions/issues OR1 User Fees study Examination of elasticity of demand and utilisation in relation to different levels of user fees. Private facilities supported by ASSP are charging higher fees and there is some geographical variation in tariffs which provide natural experiments. OR2 Community Health endowment study Do community agriculture schemes enable clinics to lower user fees and are they a sustainable way of financing health care in the absence of reliable public financing ? OR3 Health worker salaries/incentives study Examination of impact of incentives/salaries/financial and non -financial motivation on utilisation and delivery of health services. OR4 Value for money study What is the most cost effective amount per capita for donors to spend on appui global? This stud y could 1 Email from DFID to Tulane '13 -12-12 meeting note - second meeting on OR topics', 13 December 2013 Page 7 of 30 comp are results from other donors and/or compare results between health zones within ASSP if there is any variation in cost per capita between health zones. What is the value for money of the overall ASSP programme in terms of cost per DALYs avert ed? This was modelled at the business case stage and DFID committed to review this during the life of the project. How do effects and costs vary with different combinations of interventions; for example are the services provided under the ASSP programme coupled with WASH or the Community Health Endowment programme more cost effective even when taking the additional expenditures into account? OR5 Family planning study To include a situation analysis and tracking of SNIS (National Health Management Information System) data on progress in zones. Possible question - Is it possible to increase contraception uptake amongst adolescents through mainstream health care provision in rural DRC? OR6 WASH study Which approach to WASH is most cost-effective w ithin a health programme? Village Assaini or hybrid model? OR7 Governance, Accountability and Community Engagement study How do people judge the quality of health care on offer by the health service? What criteria do they use for making this judgment? Ho w can community opinions be incorporated into decisions to improve both the quality and the range of services on offer? 2.5 Gender issues to be addressed in the research Improving the lives of women and girls in the DRC is a priority for DFID. The ASSP project has an overall gender strategy which fits into the wider Action Plan for Women and Girls for DFID DRC. For the ORIE component, it is vital therefore that particula r attention is paid to designing research, d isaggregating information and conducting appropriate analysis to provide information on impact on these groups. In particular, the evaluation should be designed so that issue of equity and access to health servi ces can be evaluated by gender. For instance the evaluation should compare women and adolescent girls' utilisation rates to those of men for services which aim to benefit men, women and girls (which would not include antenatal/maternity services). 2.6 Target audience/s The main audience for the research produced will be DFID DRC and IMA to inform current and future programming. More widely this research may be of interest to the Government of DR Congo and other development partners including other donors and implementing NGOs. Page 8 of 30 3.0 Recipient The recipients of the Evaluation and Operational Research services are IMA on behalf of DFID DRC. 4.0 Scope and implementation requirements 4.1 Areas the research needs to address In total it is expected that the ORIE contract will deliver an evaluability assessment2 plus ten research studies as listed in the table below. List of ten studies Study name E1 Baseline assessment E2 Midpoint process evaluation E3 Endpoint impact evaluation OR1 User Fees study OR2 Community Health endowment study OR3 Health worker salaries/incentives study OR4 Value for money study OR5 Family planning study OR6 WASH study OR7 Governance, Accountability and Community Engagement study The evaluations should refer specifically to the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention in addressing financial and non -financial barriers to healthcare access for the poorest, to addressing issues of exclusion for vulnerable groups, includin g women and girls, and to the particular impact of the intervention upon these groups. Tulane may conduct some of the OR research in two or more phases if needed. For example, for the topic \"user fees,\" one study phase could investigate the responsivene ss of households to changes in user fees based on data from the baseline survey, and a second study phase could investigate (a) whether the ASSP health financing interventions are leading to the anticipated changes to user fees and (b) whether these change s are having an impact on health care utilization, based on data from baseline and one or more follow up surveys. The evaluations should also identify any unintended outcomes of the intervention. 4.2 Methodology Evaluation studies 2 The evaluability study was completed in 2013. Page 9 of 30 In answering the overall evaluation questions listed above, the impact evaluation should investigate whether observed changes in health service use, quality and affordability would not have happened in the absence of the intervention and to quantify the ma gnitude of that effect. A quasi -experimental design, comparing groups, coupled with appropriate data analysis strategies, is expected to be the best means of assessing the plausible attribution of ASSP support on outcome and impact indicators. The Evaluability Assessment and then the Impact Evaluation Study Protocol should examine then explain the strengths and weaknesses of options, and recommend the strongest feasible study design. The sample frame should cover all the health zones in the A SSP programme with the exception of the four zones in South Kivu which were removed from the evaluation due to budget constraints early on . Sample attrition and population turn over should be monitored closely. The sample size should be large enough to i nvestigate the research questions with a sufficient degree of power. For the evaluation study of the impact of the overall ASSP project, the sampling strategy does not allow for the data to be representative at the health zone level. As such, DFID is aware that it will not be possible to test for the differential impact of the project interventions by health zone. It is important to ensure that treatment and comparison groups are statistically matched. The Evaluation Study protocol should clearly set out the aspects that will be considered for this matching, and the data that will be used to determine it. Statistical techniques such as propensity score matching may also be used to match the groups on relevant variables. It is expected that at least t hree surveys will be conducted over a five year period, which will include a baseline, a mid -term review, and an endpoint study. DFID and Tulane University agreed that evaluation studies may have diffe rent stages with different foci as follows: E1 Base line impact evaluation Baseline assessment of health status and health services E2 Midpoint evaluation A process evaluation to provide information to improve management of the ASSP project mid way. E3 Endpoint impact evaluation Assessment of impact of ASSP project The Evaluation Study Protocol should outline how the three surveys will be co - ordinated with the roll -out of the programme, and how frequently each of the proposed indicators should be measured. NB: O nly two househo ld surveys will be conducted - one at baseline and one at the end of the project. As such, the household -level indicators will only be measured twice. Operational research studies Page 10 of 30 For the operational research questions is envisaged that qualitative methods will be used in addition to quantitative methods. This should include case studies and semi structured interviews (which should be used to verify facility records), focus group discussion (FGDs) and, where appropriate, observation methods. The fina l mix of methods will be decided based on the concept notes and discussion between DFID and Tulane for each operational research question. Separate concept notes will be provided by Tulane to DFID to consider the appropriate methodology to address each OR question below. Some questions may use only qualitative, only quantitative, or a mixed approach with varying degrees of quantitative and qualitative methods. In addition, Tulane University should consider how best to address the following issues in the e valuation and operational research designs they propose. Issues may include; i. How best to ensure a participatory approach is taken to the design and implementation of the studies once research topics have been established . Tulane should comment on how they will ensure that this approach incorporates women and excluded groups. ii. How best to separate out real changes in service provision and usage from improved measurement of changes /data ascertainment (possibly arising from activi ties relating to improving the SNIS health information systems). iii. How to control for contagion between outputs of the intervention. For example, implementation of the ASSP programme in one health zone may attract residents of contingent health zones that are being used in the studies as controls thereby treating some members of the 'no treatment' population. Similarly, compelling behaviour change communications messaging may well be shared beyond the ASSP health zones. iv. How to assess the merits of altern ative explanations for the outcomes that are observed, other than the expected influence of the DFID funded intervention. It should take account of the outcomes and impacts of other health, infrastructure and WASH, and empowerment and accountability interv entions in the ASSP health zones. v. How best to distinguish between \"theory failure\" and \"implementation failure\". The project may have failed because of faulty beliefs about causal linkages in the design document, but still have been implemented competen tly. Or the basic design idea may have been sound, but implementation difficult in practice. These differences have implications for relevant policy advocacy efforts. Separate concept notes will be provided by Tulane to DFID to consider the appropriate me thodology to address each OR question below. Some questions may use only qualitative, only quantitative, or a mixed approach with varying degrees of quantitative and qualitative methods. 4.3 Governance arrangements Role of IMA versus DFID Page 11 of 30 Both DFID and IMA will be closely involved in reviewing progress on delivering the evaluation and operational research plan. The ORIE component is contracted by IMA who is responsible for the oversight and performance management of Tulane University. As the project has progressed it has b ecome apparent that managing a large research contract is quite specialised and that the performance management of Tulane University needs to be strengthened. Therefore DFID has recently provided additional oversight and man agement of the contract , over and above that provided by IMA . DFID expects that it will need to continue to provide detailed direction and close monitoring of the contract. This does not replace the role of IMA in the day to day management of the sub -contract. We currently see no benefit in reversing out the sub -contract and contracting directly to DFID as long as IMA remain in agreement that DFID play an active role in oversight. Later sections in the document outline reporting arrangements to both D FID and IMA to reflect this dual accountability arrangement. See also section on DFID coordination. ASSP ORIE Oversight Committee The evaluation and operational research will be guided by an ASSP ORIE Oversight Committee consisting of IMA, Tulane University, DFID and two evaluation and research experts who are not directly involved in the ASSP programme. DFID will propose members of the panel , recruit them and draft the terms of reference for the panel by the 1st of Marc h 2014 . This panel will guide the strategic direction of the independent evaluation and operational research, reviewing and commenting on key reports and outputs. See sections on approvals and quality assurance for clarification on which stages the committee is responsible for approving and quality assuring. The committee may make recommendations to DFID and IMA rather than having any direct management responsibility or control over the contract. Tulane has responsibility for secretariat function ( convening and minuting meetings etc). Tulane should convene panel members (virtually) for first time by end of March 2014. Meeting costs should be met by Tulane using project funds. Other institutional oversight /regulation Tulane University should respect the ethics and research regulation requirements of their own institution and those within DRC. 4.4 Limitations likely to impact on the scope DRC is a challenging context to work in and there are likely to be operational limitations resulting from se curity, political and logistical constraints. Tulane is expected to take reasonable steps to ensure that the research can be modified appropriately according to the situation. See also any sections on force majeur within the contract with IMA in terms of impact on expectation on delivering the contracted research. Page 12 of 30 4.5 Resources available Tulane University is responsible for providing in-country transport, translation , logistical support and office space. 4.6 Ethics All studies must be designed and implemen ted in accordance with DFID Ethics Principles for Research and Evaluation. Tulane University should document out how they will ensure the study is ethically sound and with which relevant ethical protocols it will comply. Tulane University is expected to fulfil all academic institution/university with ethical standards requirements and document successful IRB reviews. 4.7 Evaluation code of conduct Tulane University is expected to design and implement studies in accordance to DFID Evaluation Policy and core principles of independence, transparency, quality, utility and ethics3. 4.8 Fieldwork Tulane University is responsible for deciding scope, planning and implementation of all fieldwork. Tulane will need to liaise closely with IMA and other implementing partners on logistics and project implementation plans. 4.9 Inception, work -planning and review meetings The official inception phase has now been completed. Going forward it is expected that Tulane University and IMA will liaise closely on a daily/wee kly basis to ensure that implementation and research plans correspond. DFID welcomes regular meetings with Tulane and/or IMA to discuss research plans in addition to the more formal arrangements outlined in the section on reporting. 4.10 Commenting and qualit y assurance of study outputs (including timescales) See section 5.3 5.0 Requirements 5.1 Outputs / deliverable s 3 DFID (2013), expected; Output/ Deliverable 1) Evaluability Assessment 2) ORIE plan For each of the ten studies; A. Concept Note (operational research studies only) B. Study Protocol with research instruments and proposed dissemination strategy C. Preliminary report including dissemination strategy D. Final report Tulane are expected to have had at least one study accepted for publication in a peer reviewed journal by the end of December 2017. Requirements and specifications of key deliverables All reports should be provided in English and in electronic format c ompatible with MS Word or Excel. Any data sets that are shared should be c lean, clearly documented and in an accessible format . As much as possible data should be disaggregated in particular by gender, age and disability. ORIE Plan A stand -alone document summarising the overall research plan providing the following information for each of the ten pieces of research (i.e. baseline, midpoint and endpoint evaluations and the seven operations research studies); i. approximate budget ii. timeline iii. lead res earcher iv. 2-3 key questions that the study will address Concept Note A stand -alone document as outlined in annex (iv). Study Protocol This is a stand -alone document and should comprehensively meet the requirements as outlined in the DFID SEQAS criteria document. This should include a summary of international literature already in existence of relevance. Final Report This is a stand -alone document and should comprehensively meet the Quality Assurance requirements as outlined by DFID's M&E Adviser. This should include a summary of international literature already in existence of relevance. Page 14 of 30 5.2 Personnel and team requirements The evaluation and operational research must be carried out by qualified evaluators and public health researchers with a recognised reputation for work at an international standard and practical experience of rigorous impact evaluation and health systems resea rch. This includes but is not limited to: Experience of designing and implementing household level surveys with associated knowledge of sampling design and data analysis. Expertise in the successful application of a purposeful mix of in -depth qualitat ive and quantitative methods in research and evaluation including the use of participatory research methods. The analytical capacity to draw implications from evaluation findings, developing evidence -based recommendations for policy and programming approac hes. The evaluation and operational research must reflect the local context so the capacity to operate in the DRC operational environment is necessary. It is expected that at least one member of the team have specific qualifications or credentials in pub lic health systems strengthening with solid experience in impoverished, fragile state and post -conflict poor rural environments such as in the DRC. It is expected that the team put forward will comprise a small core team of international and national evaluators with plans for a survey team and support researchers. It is also expected that where possible there will be an appropriate gender balance in t he evaluation team. Project /Research Manager There should be a designated project /research manager who will be expected to be responsible for : Co-ordinating and monitoring the performance of the various activities of the evaluation and operational research, taking action to strengthen any weak elements of the programme and reinforce strong ones Ensuring that the work plan and budget are being followed and that deliverables are ready for approval on time and on budget. Liaising between different comp onents of the project, particularly about strategic and directional issues, and trouble -shooting when required Reporting and liaising with IMA and DFID 5.3 Routine r eporting requirements Tulane should; 1) Provide a narrative report to IMA quarterly. Thi s should be provided within 30 days of the end of the quarter and follow a format agreed with IMA. Page 15 of 30 IMA is required to include the following information as an annex to the main ASSP narrative report to DFID; a. Narrative overview b. The improvement plan agreed in December 2013 with updated progress to date until all actions have been completed. c. A table outlining where each study has reached in terms of stage/milestones d. A table outlining for each study current problems/ exceptions and what steps are being taken to solve these . e. A table outlining recommendations from last ORIE oversight committee meeting and progress achieving them plus date of next meeting. 2) Provide a quarterly presentation to DFID in the month after the quarterly report has been submitted by IMA. 3) Arrange a m onthly meeting with DFID Evaluation Advisor 4) Tulane should also participate in Annual Reviews conducted by DFID. 5) Tulane's work plan and budget should be kept up to date (showing timelines and sub -budgets for each study) and shared with IMA and DFID when requested. 6.0 Constraints and dependencies 6.1 Coordination with programme implementation Tulane will need to liaise closely with IMA to ensure that they have a clear in depth understanding of the ASSP programme in terms of what and how it is trying to achieve. IMA should provide detailed summary information outlining which intervention will b e delivered at what time in which health zones to inform study design and study implementation planning. Lack of information about programme implementation and operational planning could inhibit effective evaluation and research designs and study implement ation. Tulane should ensure that learning is shared within the project as early as possible to inform implementation. The collaboration between Tulane University, IMA and other component sub -contractors should enhance the coordination and relevance of the research and evaluation activities with the programme implementation, is expected to enhance iterative learning within the project. 6.2 Independent evaluation and ac ademic impartiality Since the operational research and evaluation work is contract ed as a sub -contract to the consortium lead, this will mean that it will be unable to provide a completely independent evaluation of the project overall. Tulane's University should ensure that academic impartiality is maintained throughout the project a nd document steps it is taking to ensure this in the ORIE plan. Page 16 of 30 It is expected that the team will aim to publish the evaluations in peer -reviewed journals so that the research is reviewed and critiqued by experts in the field that are independent of the consortium and the evaluation team itself. If Tulane feels that their independence is coming under pressure then they should raise concerns with either the oversight committee or with DFID. DFID is committed to publishing evidence of failure and what d oesn't work as well as success. The evaluation provider is expected to undertake the evaluation as independently as possible, recruiting its own staff for survey design, data collection and analysis, and report production. It will be expected that Tulane will be retained throughout the project period, depending upon satisfactory completion of deliverables, to ensure consistency of survey execution and to build on historical knowledge. 6.3 Handling and analysis of data Data must be managed professionally and its analysis must be conducted to a high standard using widely recognised and appropriate methods. Tulane should ensure high standards in terms of confidentiality and security in term of handling/storing data. Where data generated inte rnally by the ASSP project are used, independent verification may be required to be undertaken by Tulane , if necessary , on a sampling basis. This should be done as part of the mid -term process evaluation and as part of specific operations research studies when appropriate. The independent quality assurance arranged by DFID will approve the scale of surveys and the degree of sampling required, but methodologies must comply with generally accepted best practice. The QA arranged by DFID will also review all survey instruments before they are sent to the field. All findings, datasets , analytical frameworks and methods for the evaluation and operational research must be published per DFID Evaluation and Research policies and made available to allow researchers to replicate findings. Publication in peer reviewed journals should be an objective. Findings of the studies should be published in standalone reports and through peer reviewed journals where possible . Participation will be expected in various fora, inc luding international and national conferences, particularly in later years as evidence is emerging. This will require high calibre expertise in presenting and debating findings. Tulane should seek approval from DFID before publishing any papers. 7.0 Other i mplementation Requirements Approvals Tulane are required to seek approval from DFID for the following before moving to the next step; Page 17 of 30 i. Approval of the OR topic(s) ii. Approval of the Concept Note iii. Approval CV of lead researcher for each study iv. Approval of the Study Protocol , following a QA process v. Approval of Preliminary Report and Dissemination Strategy vi. Approval of Final Report Each of these approvals will be f ollowed by an a uthorisation in writing from DFID to proceed with the next step s of the research process. Tulane is not required to request DFID approval for the submission of manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals. However, Tulane should provide DFID staff the opportunity to review draft manuscripts and would welcome their comments and suggestions for improving the drafts. 8.0 Timeframe The timeframe for the contract is outlined in the contract signed between IMA and Tulane. The ASSP contract itself is a five year contract which commen ced in April 2013. There is a break point in the contract at the end of the spending period (see IMA contract for wording).

The DFID DRC Results and Evaluation Advisor will liaise with Tulane University on technical m atters and for quality assurance purposes, making recommendations to the Health Adviser, and be a member of the Evaluation and Research Oversight Panel for DFID. 10.0 Background to the ASSP project The ASSP project supports 56 health zones (out of 515) in up to four of the eleven provinces in DRC, providing at least 8 million people with access to essential primary and secondary healthcare services. The design phase was from November 2012 with implementation running for five years from early 2013 to Ma rch 2018. In addition to delivering health outcomes, health facilities and health zones with better capacity, the programme will also support the government to be a more effective steward, to provide an enabling environment and to seek a stronger social contract through empowering citizens to hold both the government and non -state providers of health care (such as faith based organisations) to account. The programme investment is expected to achieve the following: Impact : Improved reproductive, maternal, neo -natal and child health (RMNCH) in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Outcomes : Increased coverage with essential reproductive, maternal and child health services in DFID -supported health zones target areas. Key resu lts: Under the DFID DRC Country Operational Plan 2011 -2015, this programme aims to deliver the following key results in target areas by the end of 2014/15 DFID spending period: Reduce U5 mortality in target areas: o Vaccinate 522,000 one year old children against measles Improve reproductive and maternal health: o Provide contraception - 553,000 new acceptors of modern methods of family planning (10% of which are age 19 years or under) o Ensure that 580,000 births are attended by skilled personnel o Make sure 100% of health facilities in target areas offer appropriate emergency obstetric care. o Provide 437,000 pregnant women with two doses of Intermittent Presumptive Treatment (IPT) for malaria during ante -natal visits. Provide 374,000 people with access to cle an water and sanitation. Page 22 of 30 The programme will also deliver additional benefits beyond those identified in the Country Operational Plan, such as improved nutrition, enhanced empowerment and accountability, and institutional capacity building/health systems s trengthening. See appendix for Theory of Change for the ASSP project. 11.0 Duty of Care Duty of Care responsibilities are as outlined in the contract between Tulane University and IMA. See also duty of care section in IMA contract with DFID. 12.0 S ecurity Parts of DRC are relatively insecure and Tulane University need to consider how to ensure th e security of their workforce and those of subcontracted partners such as the Public School of Kinshasa when they are conducting fieldwork in particular. See also section on security in IMA contract with DFID. 13.0 Quality Standards/Performance Requirements Evaluation principle standards It is expected that the evaluation s should conform to OECD -DAC principles of accuracy and credibility, and to the evaluation principles set out in the DFID's 2013 Evaluation Policy. The evaluation s will test hypotheses around the following criteria, which are in line with the OECD -DAC eval uation criteria, and with DFID's policy on evaluation. The hypotheses draw on the programme theory of change and the intervention logics of specific components that are the focus of operational research studies. Tulane is expected to draft hypotheses to b e tested and to propose appropriate methodologies to test them. Efficiency measures the outputs -- qualitative and quantitative -- in relation to the inputs. Effectiveness - A measure of the extent to which an aid activity attains its objectives. Quality Assurance of evaluation products Evaluations should fulfill DFID policy requirements for Quality Assurance. DFID contracts some QA to SEQAS (the Specialist Evaluation & Quality Assurance Service ). DFID evaluation guidelines recommend that the following evaluators' products are QA'd through SEQAS; i. QA is required for the evaluation design/approach as outlined in the evaluation protocol . ii. If there is a baseline report or other inception reports, these need also to be QA'd before publication. Page 23 of 30 iii. QA at exit focuses upon analytic approach, findings, lessons and recommendations and the utility of the product for different audiences. This normally means the final draft report. All evaluation reports and DFID management r esponses should be published internally and externally in accordance with DFID's transparency initiative and publication guidance. Quality assurance of operations research products DFID QA SEQAS evaluation standards will be adapted for the operational research. The Operational Research protocols will be reviewed by the Evaluation and Research Oversight Panel according to these standards. OR protocols must be of adequate standard an d have passed the QA for the study to proceed. Summary of how quality of products will be assessed. The table below outlines how each deliverable will be assessed for quality.

Final report s All review ed by Oversight Committee panel DFID 13.1 Management of performance issues Tulane's contract is managed by IMA. If issues arise around the performance of Tulane it is the responsibility of IMA to manage those issues in close collaboration with DFID. Failure to perfo rm would typically be defined as any of the issues below; Failure to produce research outputs/deliverables on time as or failure to meet milestones as outlined in the terms of reference Failure to produce research outputs/products of adequate quality (as demonstrated by failure to pass quality assurance review (s) as outlined in the table above). Failure to manage the budget appropriately and over -commit resources such that the budget is adequate to complete the research started. In the event that the ORIE component is deemed to be failing to perform, IMA should issue an improvement plan to Tulane outlining the steps that need to be taken to improve. In the event that the action points of the improvement plan are not achieved then DFID reserves the right to direct IMA to terminate Tulane's contract according to th e terms and conditions of the agreement. 14.0 Budget DFID allocated \u00a34.7m GBP for Research and Evaluation within the ASSP project. Tulane's budget is as set out in their contract with IMA. 15.0 Publication and access to data sets The evaluation should be published in full by the evaluation provider. Data sets should be made available to other researchers for analysis, with due consideration given for the privacy of respondents. 16.0 Intellectual property and title rights In line with the UK G overnment's Freedom of Information Act and the International Aid Transparency Initiative, all of DFID -funded key evaluation reports set out in these Terms of Reference will be made publically available. This should include publication and ensuring open acc ess to underlying data sets where appropriate4. 4 See DFID (2013), DFID Research Open i. DAC Criteria for Evaluating Development Assistance ii. ASSP Theory of Change iii. Links to DFID guidance documents iv. ASSP Operational Research Concept Note format Page 26 of 30 Annex (i): DAC Criteria for evaluating development assistance DFID applies internationally -agreed criteria to help ensure that our evaluations consistently tackle the issues widely recognised as important in the development evaluation community. These are described briefly below. I t is not necessary to investigate every criterion in depth in every evaluation. However, you should provide an explanation of the criteria you have chosen to cover in your evaluation approach. Relevance - The extent to which the aid activity is suited t o the priorities and policies of the target group, recipient and donor. Effectiveness - A measure of the extent to which an aid activity attains its objectives. Efficiency measures the outputs -- qualitative and quantitative -- in relation to the inputs. Impact - The positive and negative changes produced by a development intervention, directly, or indirectly, intended or unintended . Sustainability is concerned with measuring whether the benefits of an activity are likely to continue after donor fundi ng has been withdrawn. Note that projects need to be environmentally as well as financially sustainable. The following additional three criteria are also useful; they were developed by the DAC for use in humanitarian evaluations but can apply in other contexts. Coverage looks at which groups are included in / excluded from a programme and the differential i mpact on those included and excluded. (Who and how many people are we reaching?) Coherence is the need to assess other policies and programmes which affect the intervention being evaluated . Co-ordination includes assessing both harmonisation with other aid agencies and alignment with country priorities and systems. (How are we working with others?) Page 27 of 30 Annex (ii): Theory of Change for ASSP (intervention logic) The diagram shows how programme inputs will be converted into outputs, outcomes and impact. A ctivities through which this will take place consist of training, supervision, provision of resources (e.g. for purchasing supplies and providing salary incentives), operational research and impact evaluation (ORIE), and capacity building / technical assis tance. The programme engages at several levels: Engagement with non -state service providers to strengthen public sector health services DFID will continue to work through non-governmental organisations and in particular faith based networks to implement this programme, rather than through direct assistance to the Government of DRC. By working through faith based networks ASSP will seek to strengthen public provision in both government and FBN facilities and build capacity for sustainable service delivery through investing in key health inputs such as supervision/training, salary incentives, drugs and equipment and infrastructure rehabilitation. Engagement with communities and individual s Central to the theory of change is that improved accountability of the Ministry of Health and service providers will strengthen service delivery in the long term. Empowered citizens who are able to hold the government to account on service delivery will play a crucial role in assisting the government to be more responsive to citizens' needs which should lead to better access to quality services. Page 28 of 30 Behavioural change points in the model There are a number of points in the theory of change which will rely on behaviour change. In particular the theory assumes that people will change their behaviour in adopting healthier hygiene and sanitation practices, will want family planning and will want their children to be vaccinated. Engagement with the state. The ASSP programme will also strengthen Ministry of Health management teams at Health Zone and provincial level. The Ministry of Health at central level has a key role in stewardship and policy setting and we will therefore invest more in strengthening th ese core functions so that the government is able to provide a more enabling environment and more people have access to higher quality service delivery. In using this approach, DFID will be actively seeking to strengthen decentralised levels of governance and legitimate authority by strengthening both decentralised Ministry of Health management teams at provincial and health zone level. Strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of health centrally and of decentralised entities is a major st ep to move towards a more systemic approach in DFID's health programme. A change to a more sustainable approach is expected to bring marked cost savings in terms of cost -per-capita and should enable DFID therefore to expand its footprint in terms of numb er of zones and population supported. Small cost savings on cost per capita would have a dramatic effect on the number of people supported - a reduction of just $2 per capita per annum on DFID's current programme would enable a further one million peopl e to access to health services.

Background/Introduction - The purpose of this section is to provide the motivatio n for the study, including the health systems context and ASSP program component, and the existing evidence base. Specifically, this section will address why evidence from the study is needed by the ASSP project (why it is programmatically important). 2. Research questions - This section presents the research questions. Where applicable, this will also detail the different phases of research. 3. Methodology - This section presents the methodological approach, data to be used, as well as proposed sampling frame and sampling strategy.
