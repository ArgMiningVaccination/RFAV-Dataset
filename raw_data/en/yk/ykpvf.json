She also states that vaccines are important for children and that there are minimal risks. This article also mentions annual flu and COVID vaccines to be administered to 16-year-old children. I am the father of a 7-year-old daughter. My \"aha\" moment came at the pediatrician's office when our daughter, about 6 months old at the time, was scheduled to get her next set of vaccines. I simply asked for a written list of vaccine ingredients that were about to be administered. This was not available and I was referred to the Centers for Disease Control website. I also asked what they thought was causing the dramatic rise of autism cases. The answer I got was that this is genetic. As a new parent, I realized I needed to do a quick self-study trying to understand the risks of vaccinating my child as well. Very few studies have been done comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated children. An exception is known as the Mawson study. It can be found online and it is a good read to help with choosing the best option for your child. There is no denying that American children are really sick. An estimated 43% of U.S. children (32 million) currently have at least one of 20 chronic health conditions, not including obesity. A pilot study from the [Journal of Translational Science](https://archive.is/PwUrN) concluded the following: Vaccinated children were three times more likely to be diagnosed on the autism spectrum than unvaccinated children. Additionally, unvaccinated children were at much higher risk to be diagnosed with ADHD, hay fever, learning disabilities, pneumonia and ear infections. Let's focus a bit on the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and the link to autism. According to the CDC, 1 in 36, or 2.8%, of 8-year-olds were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. On Aug. 25, 2020, attorney Aaron Siri deposed Dr. Kathryn Edwards, professor of pediatrics and known as \"The Godmother of Vaccines\" for her contributions to vaccine evaluation and implementation. He asked what studies were done to make the claim \"Vaccines don't cause autism.\" Siri: \"The clinical trials relied upon to license the vaccines that kids receive, many of which are still on the market today, were they designed to rule out that the vaccine causes autism?\" Edwards: \"No.\" Furthermore, the CDC still quotes a 2004 Pediatrics study claiming to debunk a link between autism and vaccines, even though one of its authors, their own top scientist, William Thompson, admitted that he and colleagues colluded to obscure and then shred data (he kept copies) showing a link between autism and the MMR vaccine. Thompson confessed in a taped telephone chat to Brian Hooker, a bioengineer professor at Simpson University and the father of an autistic child. Here is a link https://rumble.com/v1dlztl-cdc-whistleblower-dr.-william-thompson-revealed.html Additionally, vaccines tend to be introduced after a crisis has passed. The measles vaccine was introduced in 1963. Measles death rate had already dropped by almost 100% before the use of vaccines. Well-nourished children very rarely died of measles and it can be treated with vitamin A and C. Furthermore, mothers transmit protective immune globulins to their babies naturally via the placenta. Unlike mothers who are vaccinated, a mother who has had natural measles yields protection to the baby against measles for about 12 to 15 months while breastfeeding. In the era of vaccination, babies are now susceptible to measles at a much earlier age when they are at higher risk of complications. Lastly, why is the COVID vaccine still recommended for children? Data shows that COVID vaccines are neither safe nor do they stop infection or transmission. [The CDC's records](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cdcs-covid-19-vaccine-v-safe-data-released-pursuant-to-court-order-301639584.html) show more than 7.7% of those using the agency's smartphone registration program, v-safe, had a health event requiring medical attention, emergency room intervention, and/or hospitalization following COVID vaccination. With COVID we learned, I believe, that civil and individual rights should never be contingent upon a medical procedure. Parents should be free to decide whether or not to follow the vaccine schedule for their children. Coercing parents by denying school access is wrong. Doctors should not be at risk of having their medical license revoked for speaking out or questioning vaccines. We also need strong and independent government institutions that can be trusted, especially since we allow pharmaceutical companies to be shielded from product safety liability.Arjen Vriend lives in Greenfield.
