Treat your PCOS Naturally today", "sitename": "Cup of Life Healing Center", "date": "2021-08-23", "cleaned_text": "Transform your PCOS symptoms naturally. Restore regular cycles, get relief from pain throughout the month, all while avoiding hormonal medications. Many women with PCOS tell us they experience menstrual cycles so painful, they can't function in their everyday lives (so painful they often miss work or school). To make matters worse, their cycles are unpredictable, they get frustrated with unexplained weight gain, acne, and facial hair. As if that is not enough, even when they do all the traditional treatments, they never really feel much better at all. Imagine what life would be like without the constant struggles and worries of each coming month. We understand it is almost impossible to imagine this. We KNOW how you feel, and we KNOW we can help. Our unique treatment process considers you as a whole person. We don't stop at treating your symptoms; we go right to the root cause so you can feel better and get your life back again. How We Treat Your PCOS We use an amazing combination of modalities to help you the best way we can: - Acupuncture has been demonstrated in studies to increase relaxation and relieve stress, which improves blood flow to the reproductive organs as a result. - Chinese herbal therapy is used to balance hormone output and tissue response, as well as replenish and restore the body's internal resources. - Customized supplementation and nutritional advice ensures that you are getting the abundant nutrients necessary for all of your physiological functions. By making targeted, practical adjustments to your diet we can reap significant benefits for you. - Specialized mind-body techniques. We teach you how to effectively manage stress, to keep your neuro-endocrine axis in balance. This means that hormones will be produced and released into the body at the right time and in the right amounts. By setting up a mental-emotional frequency that supports this synchronicity, your body works as it was originally designed. Your initial consultation is free. Come meet us in person and learn more. Or, just call 603-352-3625 and we'll be happy to answer your questions. Consultations are available for our Keene, NH location. Our Nashua, NH location will open in October 2022.

Prior to my initial free consultation, Cup of Life provided me with the most thorough health history questionnaire I had ever encountered. Upon arrival at Cup of Life, I felt immediately welcomed by Michael and Satya's caring presence. Within minutes of my first visit, I was given a personalized health plan which included nutritional recommendations, stress management techniques, supplements, and positive visualizations. Although I entered Cup of Life for fertility assistance, I was pleasantly surprised to receive holistic healing from the ground up, far beyond acupuncture! Michael and Satya definitely fulfill their mission to provide affordable care that yields desired results. After 3 months of weekly visits, I received a positive pregnancy test. I continued acupuncture throughout my first trimester, and greatly appreciated the support! My husband and I then moved away from New England, however, we continue to enjoy a healthy pregnancy and are awaiting the arrival of our first baby in December of 2021. We are forever grateful for Michael and Satya. It was a privilege to receive their care. We highly recommend Cup of Life for all manner of healing needs.\" --Emily, 36, M.D., Family Medicine \"My insurance company was not going to pay for my IVF cycle because I could not seem to get my FSH level below 15 and my day 18 estradiol above 100. After a few acupuncture treatments, I have been given the go-ahead because my FSH measured 8, my LH was 24, and my estradiol measured 336 today. Thank you so much.\" ~ S.C., 41, Psychologist \"Wow! I'm blown away by how much acupuncture is helping. My uterine lining measured 11 mm today. I have never had my lining measure above 8 mm, ever.\" ~ E.N., 42, Nurse, patient preparing for an IVF cycle \"I cannot remember when I have bled so little. After the first acupuncture treatment, my bleeding got lighter. After my second acupuncture treatment, I bled even less. I expect after this treatment, it may stop bleeding altogether.\" Mary --Patient with a long-standing history of continuous menstrual bleeding \"If you're looking for relief from pain issues, whether emotional, physical, or mental, this is the place to go! Michael and Trish are an amazing team! When you are with either Michael for acupuncture or Trish for Reiki you feel cared for and totally refreshed and recharged. Thank you both for doing what you do. You are both blessed with such amazing talents/gifts and we are lucky to have you in this community.\" ~ Amy, Small Business Owner \"It was hard to feel hopeful a year ago when I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic and degenerative autoimmune disease. My rheumatology team at Cheshire Medical is amazing, but my body has not embraced any of the immune suppressants we've tried so far. This past winter, I decided to access prolonged treatment from Michael. After two months of weekly treatments, my legs feel so normal sometimes I forget how much function I had lost. My arms are functioning better than they have since 2006. I have no more fibromyalgia and very little pain. Smaller changes also encourage me. My balance has returned. I no longer groan when doing routine tasks. I am not depressed anticipating more decline. I have hope now that function can be maintained. I owe such a debt of gratitude to Michael, his kindness, his skills. What a treasure his knowledge and abilities are for our community.\" \"Michael is extremely gentle and is entirely committed to making your experience comfortable & healing. He is very skilled at what he does and his treatments are extremely effective! I have been a long-time patient of acupuncture & I find Michael's treatments to be thorough & consistently healing. He also happens to be wonderful with children. My son LOVES coming in for treatments & has been feeling so much better! Michael & his wife Tricia are a gift to our community!!\" --Jennifer - 50 \"I came to Michael with weird belly distress of many weeks that Western medicine could not diagnose. After just a few acupuncture sessions and the appropriate herbs suggested by Michael, I am 95% better, and continuing to heal! The soothing ambiance is an important part of the healing process, in addition to the skilled, professional treatments.\" Susan - 63 - Academic Administrator \"What an AWESOME Healing Center! Tricia (Satya) and Michael greet you like family. They are a great asset to the community and bring healing, relief, and training to so many. Thank you for being a part of all of our lives.\" John - 50 - I.T. Director \"Michael and Tricia (Satya) have each facilitated and supported profound physical and emotional healing journeys for my husband and me. It is a blessing (and a miracle) to have them in our community. I can't thank them enough for the depth of ability and knowledge they offer at Cup of Life.\" ~ Gretchen \"I would highly recommend trying acupuncture and going to Cup of Life Healing Center. Michael is a very gentle and caring person. He is very knowledgeable and skilled in his field. It was my first experience with acupuncture and he made me feel comfortable and welcome.\" Melissa - 38 - Bank Associate \"Working with Michael has been such a critical part of my self-care regime and has made an enormous impact on my welfare. Highly recommend.\" Laura - 32 - Clinical Psychologist Are you ready to put an end to the frustrations of your PCOS? Do any of these sound familiar?

We address the root cause Our process includes finding and attacking the actual root CAUSE of your PCOS. This is why so many have found relief with our therapies, even though other therapies didn't work. Even those with a long family history of PCOS or PCOS-like symptoms have experienced significant relief. We use an all natural approach your doctor doesn't know about Your doctor may have told you that you have to live with your PCOS and accompanying symptoms or \"this is as good as it gets\". That doesn't mean there's no treatment, it just means your doctor has run out of ideas or there aren't conventional treatments available. We find that people who don't respond well to conventional treatment often respond very well to our natural approach. We help you awaken your body's natural healing system Despite what you may have been led to believe, your body is not \"broken\" and it IS possible to have energy, focus, and joy again. That's because your body never forgets how to heal itself. It just needs the right support. Your body makes its own internal anti-inflammatory substances and medicines, and our therapies help it do just that. We keep it simple and results are quick Feeling better does not have to be difficult or take a long time. Simple, targeted lifestyle and diet changes, along with our targeted natural therapies, are a very clear and concise way to attack the problem head on, and patients often see improved energy and mood within DAYS not WEEKS or MONTHS. We focus on how you FEEL - not just the numbers While everyone else is looking at pieces of paper with numbers, and not listening to you - WE focus on YOU, your story, and how you feel. Are you feeling more energy? Are you thinking more clearly? Are you starting to lose those unwanted pounds? Does your skin look healthy and vibrant? THAT is OUR focus. NOT more expensive, unnecessary lab tests. Our approach ALWAYS includes stress reduction Stress is often a key component of PCOS issues. We do not ignore this, we actually teach you very simple ways to enhance sleep and relaxation which supports your body's natural healing system. Your initial consultation is free.

Gentle Acupuncture Acupuncture is one of the most powerful ways to naturally stimulate your body's innate healing process. Once stimulated, the healing process begins repairing and restoring all cells and tissues. It is an excellent way to tune in the neuroendocrine system's function of balancing hormone levels and pain. Herbal Medicine Chinese herbal therapy simultaneously cures AND strengthens the body. This dual action is something unique to herbal medicine that makes it very well suited to treat hormonal conditions including thyroid, menstrual disorders, mood problems, sleep issues, and fertility. Nutritional Therapy \"You are what you eat\" is the saying. When your cells, glands, and tissues are fully nourished with the specific nutrients they need, these tissues naturally function at a very high level. This means you feel your best because the body's key systems are optimized. Relaxation and Stress Reduction General life today causes a stress reaction that will cause your endocrine system to go out of balance and cause illness. When your nervous system is calm, the hormonal system, immune system, digestive, and circulatory systems all calm down, too. This means a more focused mind, more resilient immune system, less inflammation, better circulation, and optimal nutrient absorption. Your initial consultation is free.

No guarantee of specific results is warranted or implied and your results will depend on many factors ( [full disclaimer](/disclaimer/)) The Process Is Simple Free Initial Consultation At your free initial consultation you'll meet with your practitioner to discuss your health concerns and most importantly YOUR GOALS. We want to be certain that our program is going to meet your needs and that there is a HIGH probability of success for you - BEFORE we move forward to the next step. Detailed Assessment & Treatment Plan Once your free consultation is complete, and we agree to move forward, your next step is the Intake appointment. At this appointment, your clinician will do a detailed assessment of your symptom pattern, medical history, and other factors to determine the root cause of your issue and devise a specific plan of attack. Your first acupuncture session will be performed at this time, and a you will be given a treatment plan with exact, easy-to-follow instructions. Your treatment plan will include dietary and lifestyle adjustments, key supplements and herbal medicines, and mind-body exercises to address the root of YOUR health issue. Active Treatment & Symptom Resolution You'll return for once-weekly visits to ensure close support as you begin to feel the positive shifts of the therapy. We want to make sure your treatment plan is producinging the expected results: - Increased energy - Better sleep - Improved mental focus - Healthier skin and hair - Healthy metabolism and (if needed) weight loss You will continue to receive acupuncture at each visit to ensure that your neuroendocrine system (the delicate connection between your nervous and hormonal systems) is rebalancing in a way that results in optimal reproductive function. Transitional Care As Things Stabilize Once we see stable improvements, we will begin to reduce the frequency of visits. This usually occurs after about 8-12 visits. Initially you'll come every other week until we feel confident that the issue is resolved, then once every 3 or 4 weeks to maintain wellness. We'll be here in case you ever want to come in for a tune-up or to address other health concerns. Of course, MANY of our patients do wish to continue with \"ongoing maintenance\" and we are happy to work that out with you, should that be your wish. Taking Care Of Your Friends and Loved Ones We pride ourselves on the fact that the majority of our new patients are referred to us by other patients or people in the community who have witnessed their friends and loved ones receive life-changing benefits from our work. So, we very much look forward to helping YOUR friends, family, and loved ones on THEIR journey to a more joyful, energetic, purposeful life. Your initial consultation is free.

No guarantee of specific results is warranted or implied and your results will depend on many factors ( [full disclaimer](/disclaimer/)) Common Questions Does the acupuncture hurt? The sterile, stainless steel, single-use needles are extremely thin, and they cause no pain because they are razor sharp and solid as opposed to hollow like a hypodermic needle your would find at your doctor's office. How long will it take to see results? People often feel a shift after the very first treatment. Acupuncture is a very powerful way to regulate the neuroendocrine axis of the body - which is how the brain and central nervous system talk to the endocrine system. And, most patients see significant results within 6 - 12 weeks such as return of regular menstrual and ovulatory cycles, increased libido, and reduction of stress and other potential symptoms of YOUR cause of PCOS. Will I have to spend a lot of time coming in for treatments? Most of our patients are able to get great results with once-weekly visits. We can discuss this in more detail at your free consultation. Will I have to do some kind of horrible, super-restrictive detox or elimination diet? NO WAY. We are here to set you up for success. We find the 2 or 3 \"key leverage points\" in your diet and work on those. No impossible to follow meal plans or detoxes here. What are my chances of success? Results vary, of course. That being said, well over 70% of our patients experience a return to regular cycles and a significant reduction in other symptoms of your cause of PCOS. However, your situation is unique and once we meet with you we will be able to give you our best estimate of time and prognosis of outcome. Will I learn self care techniques like meditation and special exercises that will help empower me to heal faster? Certainly. While we want to guide you every step of the way, we also want to empower you for this journey and all those following. Our program is so effective because of its ability to connect the Body, Mind, and Spirit. We feel it is a very important part of every person's healing for any condition. Can natural medicine REALLY help my PCOS? Absolutely. Your hormonal system - and your body as a whole - is capable of healing itself, especially when it has the nutritional support and specialized natural therapies we offer to help it get back on track. We've seen this happen in our clinic over and over with PCOS and many other conditions. Your initial consultation is free. Come meet us in person and learn more.
