VIITable of Committee and Senior Program Committee . . 7 Conference IROS returns to Germany \u2014 to Hamburg, \"Germany's Gateway to the World\", one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the country. While the Hanseatic city of Ham- burg has been a very international trading, business and seafaring city for centuries, with the harbour's roots dating back to the ninth century, it has also been very open to new tech- nologies: the port of Hamburg is not only the second-biggest container-terminal in Europe, but in terms of adoption of Internet-technology and automation, it is also one of the most advanced \u2014 ranking it one of the world's most flexible, high-performance universal ports. Moreover, Hamburg is strong in medical industries, microelectronics and civil aerospace, as well as heavy industries, including the making of steel, aluminium and copper and shipyards. It is also Germany's number one city in the media industry, and it is home of the TV station producing the most reputable daily news show from a fully robotized studio. The University of Hamburg is one of the largest universities in Germany. Referring to Hamburg's role as a gateway for seafarers, we have chosen the conference theme to be \"Gateway to the Era of Robots\". In view of the positive development that the eld of robotics has seen, both in terms of technology and in terms of business, over the last ten years, we think that as roboticists we are not only witnessing the emergence of a new age, but through our work, we are ushering in a new era of intelligent machines \u2014 and with that comes quite some responsibility. For those of us who had the pleasure to attend the rst IROSes, the growth of the conference over the last three decades, which reflects the growing breadth of the eld, is phenomenal. But also the younger participants will nd the numbers impressive: this year we received 2134 paper submissions and 62 proposals for workshops and tutorials. A total of 5444 high-quality review reports were received from 3465 reviewers and then checked and ranked by the Conference Editors. Finally, 969 papers were accepted for publication, which is 45% of the overall papers received. Thanks to the work of the program committee and in particular to the participants of the Senior Program Committee Meeting held in Munich in June 2015, the conference could be successfully structured to t perfectly into this conference week. Looking at the numbers, it is also interesting to see how the set of accepted papers reflects the continents: roughly 28% of the papers come from Asia, 29% from the Americas and 41% from Europe. This is certainly a result of the high priority that individual European countries give to robotics. But it is also a consequence of the European Commission's strong commitment to and signicant investment in robotics. In the past two EU framework programs for research and development (FP6, running from 2002 to 2006, and FP7, running from 2007 to 2013), the EU spent a total of about /EUR680 million on robotics and cognitive systems, funding about 180 collaborative projects. In the current research and innovation program, Horizon 2020, EU funding has been about /EUR170 million so far, including funding for almost 40 large robotics projects. This conference offers six plenary talks with outstanding speakers, three sessions with keynotes from leading experts in their elds, fteen parallel tracks with full oral presenta- tions, a Late-Breaking Poster session, ve technical tours, a Government Forum, a Future of Robotics forum, an Entrepreneurship Forum & Start-Up Competition, and a Citizens' Fo- rum. Two full days are dedicated to 51 workshops and tutorials. 1Our general goal is to create a variety of opportunities and formats for a lively exchange among participants, especially young researchers, to present their work to larger audiences - often for the rst time in their scientic career. Furthermore, IROS 2015 will be an ideal platform to connect robotics academia and industry, and to facilitate entrepreneurship. Over 50 companies have already signed-up for the IROS exhibition, with established global play- ers next to small start-ups demonstrating exciting new products. In addition to being an international hub, Hamburg, as an old harbour town, also has a vibrant and world-famous night life. We will offer a large number and wide variety of unique social events in Hamburg and its surroundings. There will also be a conference dinner in a very traditional setting. We are greatly appreciative of the strong support from our sponsors and exhibitors, both industrial and institutional, without whom the program would not have been possible. Like- wise, we would also like to thank the entire Organizing Committee, the Conference Editorial Board, the 300 Program Committee members, the over 3000 reviewers, the Senior Program Committee members, the local arrangement team, and the student volunteers. Their valu- able contributions and assistance have greatly improved both the quality of this event and its international success. Last but not least, our thanks go to the authors, the conference participants and all those whose help and support make this conference possible. Finally, we wish you an interesting, pleasant and memorable stay in Hamburg!

Zeeshan Zia Teresa Zielinska Tom Ziemke Local Organization and Digest Team 20Welcome to Hamburg The Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, one of the 16 states of the Federal Republic of Germany, is the second largest city in Germany with its 1.7 million inhabitants. In this sense, it is a city as well as a state. Economically and culturally, Hamburg is also the centre of Northern Germany. 3.5 million people live in the 755 square kilometres large metropolitan region of Hamburg - for them, Hamburg is a shopping and cultural metropolis. With 30 square metres of living space per person, Hamburg has the biggest average living space of all major cities in the world. As much as 14% of the city area is made up of green spaces and recreational areas. As a surprise to many, Hamburg has 2,302 bridges - more than Venice and Amsterdam combined! With over 90 consulates, Hamburg is second only to New Y ork City. As a historical trade centre, Hamburg has always been outward-looking, a fact that has shaped the mentality of Hamburg's inhabitants. Places to see \u2014 Things to Do Hamburg offers many highlights to explore on foot. The Landungsbr\u00fccken Area is one of the oldest parts of Hamburg, where the big migrations to Hamburg, and from Hamburg to overseas, took place at the end of the 19th and in the early 20th century. Y ou can easily get there by the U3 or S1 metro lines. A special attraction is the Alter Elbtunnel , which means \"old Elbe tunnel\". The 426 m long tunnel was opened in 1911 and was a technical sensation at the time. We highly recommend visiting this marvel of civil engineering. It is open 24 hours for pedestrians and bicycles. The Reeperbahn is Hamburg's oldest and most 21famous red light and entertainment district. Revelers of all ages and backgrounds will nd entertainment from ritzy nightclubs to quirky little bars, from strip clubs to restaurants and theaters. TheHamburg Fishmarket attracts over 70,000 visitors to the Elbe every Sunday. Here you can nd fresh sh, fruit baskets and tropical flowers. It is best to make a very early morning visit, and you will get to experience the bustling trade at a place that is as much an institu- tion as a real marketplace. As an added bonus, you can get fresh regional fruits and other produce at immense discounts near the closing time, if not for free ! If you're on time, you'll catch the live band with some dancing and breakfast in the beautiful Altona Fischauktion- shalle (Altona Fish Auction Hall), where the IROS2015 will also take place. Address: Gro\u00dfe Elbstra\u00dfe 9, 27767 Hamburg Opening times: Every Sunday, 05:00 - 9:30 April to October Public transport: S1, S3 \u2014 Exit at \"Reeperbahn\" U3 \u2014 Exit at \"Landungsbr\u00fccken\" Bus 112 \u2014 Exit at \"Fischmarkt\". TheSpeicherstadt (Warehouse City) with its neo-gothic brick warehouses and the adjacent Kontorhaus district , newly appointed UNESCO World Heritage sites together with the mod- ernist Chilehaus , is one of the largest coherent historic ensembles of port warehouses in the world (300,000 m2). Today it houses restaurans, cafes, museums, shops, hotels and the mind-boggling Miniaturwunderland , the world's lagest model railway. This historic district to the east of the Landunsgbr\u00fccken area has recently received a posh new neighbour in the Hafencity , Hamburg's youngest quarter with great views of the river Elbe and its cruise ter- minal where cruise liners like the Queen Mary II regularly set off on new journeys. Discover these quarters on foot, or take a port cruise through the red canals of the Speicherstadt. A city with a lake at its heart \u2014 this is Hamburg. Take a stroll on the urban banks of the inner Alster along picturesque Jungfernstieg shopping street in the city centre, turn right into Neuer Jungfernstieg, passing the grand Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten (Four Seasons), amble along the benches at the northern edge of the inner Alster, cross under Lombardsbridge and Kennedy bridge and see the outer Alster open up before you: a wide lake dotted with sailing boats, lined with lawns and trees, walkways and bicycleways, with here and there a restaurant or cafe and plenty of benches to sit and soak in the holiday atmosphere.

This includes the presentation of a laboratory setup for the assessment of physiological and expressive emo- tional reactions in the context of human robot interaction and the demonstration of a standardized set of sounds (The Bremen Emotional Sound Toolkit BEST) for use as nonverbal acoustical emblems for Robot-Human Interaction. 27Robotics Innovation Center of the DFKI in Bremen The Robotics Innovation Center (RIC) of the German Research Center for Articial Intelligence (DFKI) and the Robotics Group at the Univer- sity of Bremen welcome the participants of the IROS 2015 for guided tours through their laboratories and testing facilities. The DFKI, based in Kaiserslautern, Saarbrucken, Bremen and leading a project ofce in Berlin is the world's largest research center in the eld of Articial Intelligence.The Robotics Innovation Center, headed by Prof. Dr. Frank Kirchner, develops robot systems to be used for complex tasks on land, under water, in the air, and in space. The RIC closely cooperates with the Robotics Group at the University of Bremen. The guided tours start at 14:30 in the DFKI-building at Robert- Hooke-Stra\u00dfe 1 in Bremen. During the visit the participants will pass different labs \u2014 for example the 1,300 m2Maritime Explo- ration Hall, which is unique in Europe, and the Space Exploration Hall, where robots are tested under realistic conditions \u2014 and see multiple robot systems, which were developed at the DFKI and will be demonstrated by the scientists. University of Bremen The Institute for Articial Intelligence (IAI) directed by Prof. Michael Beetz is part of the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of Bremen. The research group investigates methods for cognition-enabled robot control. The research is at the intersection of robotics and Articial Intelligence and includes methods for intelligent perception, dexterous object manipulation, plan-based robot control, and knowledge representa- tion for robots. The team will demonstrate results from the EU projects RoboEarth, RoboHow, SHERPA, SAPHARI, and ACAT as well as from the Ro- boSherlock project funded by the German research foundation (DFG). Live demonstrations will be presented which cover a variety of complex manipulation tasks, including popcorn making and a chemical experi- ment. The focus will be on AI-based technologies for perception, knowl- edge representation, reasoning, and plan-based control. The presen- tation at the University of Bremen will also feature the new web-based cloud-robotics platform openEASE, which is intended to facilitate the exchange, retrieval, semantic annotation, and re-use of big data both in the AI and the robotics community. 28Tour 2 Berlin: Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t October 2 08:00 Departure from CCH 11:30-12:45 TU Berlin Part I 12:45-13:45 Lunch 13:45-15:00 TU Berlin Part II 15:00-16:00 Sightseeing Berlin 19:00 Arrival at CCH The internationally renowned Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin is located in Germany's capital city at the heart of Europe. It will host a technical tour featuring demonstrations by four laboratories from Technical University Berlin and from Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin as well as a demonstration by ReWalkTMRobotics: TheRobotics & Biology Laboratory , headed by Oliver Brock, fo- cusses on research in mobile manipulation. The group develops solutions for mobile manipulation that tightly couple various as- pects that traditionally were considered separately (e.g. hardware, planning, control, perception, etc.). The concept of interactive per- ception, for example, considers perception and manipulation as inseparable components of a single problem, leading to novel so- lutions both in perception and in manipulation. The lab's grasping research combines the development of novel hands with asso- ciated planning and perception algorithms. The lab will present the resulting mobile manipulation capabilities in various demon- strations, amongst them a demonstration from the Physical Exploration Challenge DFG project in collaboration with the Machine Learning and Robotics Laboratory from Univer- sit\u00e4t Stuttgart, headed by Marc Toussaint. TheCompliant Robotics Lab , headed by Ivo Boblan, inves- tigates how compliant and resilient control can be imple- mented in both actuators and supporting structure. Inher- ent compliance of systems is the key for safe interaction be- tween humans and robots. The way how the total compli- ance should be divided between the construction and the ac- tuators, is a main subject and mission of the lab. Since 2015 the group has a mandate, received from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), to work out the princi- ples/basics related to a human-centered human-robot interaction (HRI) within the scope of demographic change. An interdisciplinary team of researchers from the elds of robotic en- gineering, biophysics, science and technology studies, neurobiology and interaction design has come together to investigate criteria and possibilities of a successful HRI with a holis- tic approach. For this purpose an HRI FabLab is built to experience and develop HRI with participants of all areas of society. Furthermore an associated HRI network of representa- tives of organizations and industry will evaluate the results. The group will present a robotic 29manipulator according to the role model of an elephant's trunk, which was developed in a former project BROMMI:TAK. The research focus Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology , led by Thomas Schauer, is part of the TU Berlin Control Theory Group. It focuses on feedback control and electromechanical design problems in biomedical engineering and the development of technical aids for the neu- rological rehabilitation of motor function disorders caused by stroke and spinal cord injury. We will demonstrate how feedback-controlled neuro- prostheses can be used to restore motor function in paretic limbs. To this end, we derive realtime motion parameters using adaptive inertial sensor networks. By means of functional electrical stimulation, we trigger mus- cle contraction and generate or support functional motions like grasping, cycling, and walking. Feedback control strategies are employed to follow predened motion trajectories and to adjust the stimulation to the needs of the patient at all times. TheAdaptive Systems Group , headed by Verena Hafner (Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin), focuses on topics in cognitive and developmental robotics. One of the lab's current research questions is on sensorimotor learning and interaction, and approaches include internal mod- els and exploratory behaviour with humanoid robots. Within the EU project EARS (Embod- ied Audition for RobotS), the group focuses on embodied cognition and interaction, active sensing and behaviour prediction. Other projects are on joint attention, behaviour recogni- tion, sensorimotor learning as well as biorobotics (spatial cognition, navigation, and neural modelling). The group also regularly participates in the RoboCup standard platform league with their NaoTH team. We will demonstrate internal models for egonoise prediction on the humanoid robot Nao as well as learning mechanisms for a swimming spherical robot. ReWalkTMRobotics is an innovative medical device company that is designing, developing and commercializing exoskeletons allow- ing wheelchair-bound individuals to stand and walk once again. Our mission is to fundamentally change the health and life expe- riences of individuals with spinal cord injuries. Current ReWalkTM designs are intended for people with paraplegia, resulting in com- plete or incomplete paralysis of the legs. The system uses patented motion sensing technology along with battery-powered motorized legs powering knee and hip movement which is con- trolled by proprietary on-board computers and software. Subtle changes in center of gravity restores self-initiated walking. Re- peated body shifting generates a sequence of steps, which mim- ics natural gait at efcient and functional walking speed. The ReWalkTMsystems allows the user to sit, stand, walk, turn and has the ability to climb and descend stairs* (*stairs function not available in the USA). ReWalkTM users are able to independently transfer in and out of the system and operate the device on their own. A ReWalker will demonstrate how to use and walk with the system during the exhibition. 30Tour 3 Hamburg: Port of Hamburg - HHLA Container Terminal Friday October 2 17:30 Departure from CCH 20:30 Arrival at CCH Eye to Eye with Giants The \"Gigantentour\" is an enthralling tour through the Freeport of Hamburg.

Within HCC, there has long been inter- est in combining forces and integrating com- mon research interests with the guiding re- search theme formulated as \"Intelligent Sys- tems for Complex Applications and Domains\". Technical Aspects of Multimodal Systems The TAMS group at the University of Ham- burg is led by Jianwei Zhang and is dedi- cated to research in the elds of multimodal sensing and representation, knowledge-based robot control and learning, and robotic sys- tems for mobile manipulation. In addition to its comprehensive experimental facilities, includ- ing a PR2 service robot, two Shadow dexter- ous hands (C5 air muscle and C6 smart mo- tor versions) and several other manipulators, TAMS possesses extensive knowledge of robotic systems designed for dexterous manipula- tion, e.g., the approach of computing grasp synergies for a dexterous robot hand. Addition- ally, methods have been added to monitor human motions and gestures used for learning by demonstration. Knowledge Technology Knowledge Technology unites research areas of computer science with neuroscience, psychology and robotics. The objectives are to develop knowledge technologies for intel- ligent systems. Therefore nature-inspired, in particular hy- brid neural and symbolic representations are studied, to build adaptive neural-evolutionary systems, understanding learning in multimodal neural agents and cognitive robots for human-robot interaction. 35Human Computer Interaction The Human Computer Interaction research group explores perceptually-inspired and (super-) natural forms of interaction to seamlessly couple the space where the flat two-dimensional (2D) digital world meets the three dimensions we live in. The mission of the HCI group is to develop user interfaces, which allow users to intuitively experience and interact with three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments (VEs). In particular, research focuses on different modalities and forms of interaction in immersive virtual environ- ments (IVEs) to support (super-) natural walking, touching, seeing and being, which are addressed in the scope of different research projects. RoboCup Soccer RoboCup is a student-organised workgroup from the Department of Informatics. They work independently, but receive broad support from the HCC research groups. It was founded in 2011 and works with humanoid robots, \"train- ing\" them to play soccer. Since 2012 the team \"Hamburg Bit-Bots\" participates in the Humanoid Kid Size League on national and in- ternational level. Besides all challenging algorithmic tasks to be handled when playing soccer, hardware selection and mechanical design of the platform is done as well. The \"Hambot\" was designed to give teams in the Humanoid League a low-cost possibility to up- grade from the currently used small robots to a larger platform. The whole robot was 3D printed with a consumer printer, thus making production and further development possible for everyone. 3D-Printing Lab The department offers a 3D-Printing lab , equipped with numerous 3D-printers and various useful tools for researchers and students. Besides software development for 3D printing, an ongoing research topic is conductive print- ing. This project aims at the full integration of complex electronic circuits into 3D-printed ob- jects. In the rst iteration, a large FDM 3D-printer has been modied to produce conductive traces with a second extruder during the printing process. SMD-components are then placed into the uncured conductive ink by a camera-guided pick and place system to complete the circuit. 36Fun Tours The following sightseeing tours can be booked on-site or via http://iros2015.org/index.php/program/fun-tours Harbor Cruise \u2014 including Warehouse district Description The cruise starts and ends at the pier St Pauli Landungsbr\u00fccken\".

Here is a list with their opening times: Monday - Friday Le Crobag (Bakery) 05:30-20:00 Information Colonnaden The Colonnaden is one of the oldest pedestrian streets in Hamburg. A magnicent architecture and many glamourous shops adorn it. The architecture of the street is well worth seeing, many grand houses with Neo-Renaissance fa\u00e7ades from the founding period are still intact. The arcades with their Venetian flair are the street's highlight. Exquisite shops offer- ing ne teas, selected literature and handcrafted china tempt the visitor into spending hours inside the marble halls next to the water. The Colonnaden connects the Jungfernstieg with the Stephansplatz and Dammtorbahnhof that lies behind it. Another beautiful access to the Colonnaden is from the G\u00e4nsemarkt through the G\u00e4nsemarkt-Passage, where the junction forms a sort of a piazza. Near the huge Hamburg Opera House, you can take a break in one of the many caf\u00e9s and coffee shops. From here it is only a few steps to Neuen Jungfernstieg and to the Binnenalster. Surrounding Environment The Colonnaden lies directly at the Jungfernstieg, which is Hamburg's most stylish prome- nade. Jungfernstieg also provides a beautiful view of the Alster lake, where after a tiring day, you can buy a drink or an ice-cream and relax at the lake, taking in the magnicent views. There are boat trips around the Inner and Outer Alster. Y ou can also walk around the lake taking in its scenic views. Right at Jungfernstieg, the ve-decked Europa Passage is the largest shopping centre in Hamburg's inner city. In addition to being a home to many of the world's biggest brands, various events are often held there. Many stores organize events, for example piano and guitar concerts, crash courses in jewellery designing and experimental acrylic painting. The Europa Passage also connects Jungfernstieg to M\u00f6nckebergstra\u00dfe, which is the oldest shopping district in Hamburg. Gastronomy In the Colonnaden there are many restaurants and caf\u00e9s. The va- riety of cuisines (Matsumi) to name just a few. Also popular are the many coffee shops, like Balzac-Coffee. The surrounding areas of Jungfernstieg are home to many restaurants. The oldest house on the square is the Alsterpavillon. Caf\u00e9 Alex, right at the Alster, serves its customers salads, pasta, burgers, schnitzel, baguettes and wraps. The Alsterhaus offers great food choices at LeBuffet, or enjoy a snack on the terrace of the luxurious Vier Jahreszeiten hotel. 44TheBocksbeutel is a charming wine bar in the mid- dle of the Colonnaden, serving and selling excellent Franconian wines from 11:30 to 21:00. Finish off the evening with a delicious German wine or take home a bottle as a gift. For those seeking coffee, in between there is a Star- bucks coffeehouse or the bakery DAT BACKHUS. For burger and steak enthusiasts, Jungfernstieg has Jim Block and Block House. How to get there The Colonnaden can be reached on foot in about 10 minutes from the CCH. The Alster, Jungfernstieg and Europa Passage areas are also adjacent to each other and can be reached from Colonnaden within 5 minutes by foot. The public transport lines that connect to these places are: U2 \u2014 Exit at Exit at Jungfernstieg Landungsbr\u00fccken Landungsbr\u00fccken is the beautiful port of Hamburg, situated on the Elbe river. Two towers with striking green domes characterize the 205-meter long termi- nal building at the jetties. One of the towers not only gives the time, but also updates on the water level of the North Elbe. The bell rings every half hour. Guests with a HVV ticket can take the \"F\u00e4hre 62\" ferry from \"Br\u00fccke 3 (Bridge 3)\". The ferry starts every 15 minutes and goes along and across the Elbe and nally returns to Landungs- br\u00fccken after an hour. Guests can take in the lush beauty of the banks of the Elbe, the beach, a sight of the posh localities of Hamburg and nally the industrial area. At the ferry station \"Dockland\", guests can climb the ship-shaped building and get a brilliant scenic view of the entire industrial port area and the city of Hamburg. Note: The last ferry from Landungsbr\u00fccken departs at 23:15 and this ferry does not return to Landungsbr\u00fccken. 45Surrounding Environment Flowing through Hamburg, the Elbe river connects the city of Hamburg to the North Sea. There are numerous ways to explore, including sightseeing boat tours and casual strolls along the banks of the river. When you walks to the left of Landungsbr\u00fccken while facing the river, you will reach the \"Warehouse district\", \"HafenCity\", the \"Speicherstadt\", and the dramatic Elbphilharmonie building. All these form a signicant part of the port of Hamburg. Whether it is the historical warehouse complex in Speicherstadt, or the currently under- construction Elbe Philharmonic Hall, or even the large passenger cruise ships in the docks, there is a lot to explore in the HafenCity quarter, located right on the river Elbe. While the Speicherstadt has long shaped Hamburg's cityscape with its brick, neo-Gothic architecture, the new development area of HafenCity sits directly on the banks of the Elbe with an array of more modern designs. Currently, HafenCity is the largest development project in Europe, and its gurehead is the Elbe Philharmonic Hall. Many eye-catching architectural buildings are already completed in HafenCity, partic- ularly the Unilever building with its futuristic facade looking out directly onto the harbour, as well as the high-reaching Marco Polo Tower with its terraces at the front providing an excellent place to relax in the sun. Other places to explore include the \"Magellan- Terrassen\" and the \"Vasco da Gama Platz\". Many places in the HafenCity were given international names due to Hamburg's cosmopolitan na- ture. Another example one can nd is the Shanghai bridge, which is a good point to admire the canals. For a visit with an eye on the past, have a look around the Speicherstadt. The listed buildings now house leisure activities such as the Minatur Wunderland with fascinating toy railway worlds, and Hamburg Dungeon. In this attraction visitors take a ghostly journey through the metropolis's history. Museums can also be found in the Speicherstadt. There is German Customs Museum (Deutsche Zollmuseum), which tells the tale of customs and smuggling in Hamburg, or the International Maritime Museum with thousands of ship models and nautical charts. Gastronomy Between Landungsbr\u00fccken and Venusberg stretches the Portugese quarter and gives Hamburg a high den- sity of Portuguese Restaurants. In the summer, ta- bles and benches are placed outside and the hustle and bustle on the streets create a Mediterranean hol- iday atmosphere. Y ou will have a great time enjoying delicious food like fresh sh, paella, tapas or just a Galao. Right in the middle of the Portuguese quarter, on Reimarusstra\u00dfe, is the Casa del Sabor. Classic dishes and tapas are the regulars at the small but tasty 46restaurant. The quality of food is consistently good and also an excellent choice for non-sh eaters. Or enjoy a giant seafood salad in the Restaurant Don Jos\u00e9 on Ditmar-Koel-Stra\u00dfe, in addition to a high-quality food. The staff is warm and accommodating. A special feature here is that the guest taps his beer himself. For a more traditional meal, with a simple decor and a relaxed atmosphere, you can feast on excellent Portuguese dishes at fair prices in Chur- rascaria O Frango on the Reimarusstra\u00dfe. The Restaurante Porto has been around since 1984 in the Portuguese quarter, offering its guests authentic Portuguese cuisine. Located directly on the lively Ditmar-Koel-Strasse, you can feel the hospitality of a family business and enjoy classic Portuguese dishes. How to get there The public transport lines that connect to these places are: U3 \u2014 Exit at Landungsbr\u00fccken S1, S3 \u2014 Landungsbr\u00fccken Sternschanze Sternschanze or \"Schanzenviertel\" is Ham- burg's hip trendy area, boasting many small boutiques, restaurants, cafes and a party area with a unique charm. In recent years, the district has undergone many changes and renovations. The streets Schulterblatt, Schanzenstra\u00dfe, Susannenstra\u00dfe und Bar- telsstra\u00dfe form the center of the pop cul- tural district, with record stores, boutiques for browsing, pubs and cozy cafes inviting you to relax. Surrounding Environment The Schanzenpark is a popular recreational meeting place for the young and the old. In the middle of the park looms the imposing Schanzen Tower. It was completed in 1910 and served as the largest water tower in Europe until 1961. In 2005, the 60 meter high building was converted to the M\u00f6venpick Hotel Hamburg. The Reeperbahn, Hamburg's red-light and entertainment district and the district with many restaurants, bars, theatres and nightclubs, is about 15 minutes with the U3. In the 1960's the Reeperbahn became a mecca for rock music with its \"Gro\u00dfe Freiheit\" area. Everybody from the Beatles to the Searchers was performing in clubs like \"Top Ten\" or the \"Starclub\". Grosse Freiheit branches just off the Reeperbahn. Here the Beatles had their rst appearance on German soil in Club Indra. One can trace the Beatles' footsteps to the Kaiserkeller, which is still running, as well as the site of the now-closed Star Club, where a plaque commemorates the venue. Beatles-Platz, a tribute to the band, is a circular plaza, painted black and modeled on a vinyl record. Both this and a sculpture of the band's early members are located not too far from 'Beatlemania', a dedicated Beatles museum. 47Gastronomy Sternschanze is jam-packed with cafes, bars and restaurants. One can nd food and drinks to one's taste easily, when discovering this area. How to get there U3 \u2014 Exit at Sternschanze S21, S31 \u2014 Exit at Sternschanze (Messe) Grindel The Grindel area is where the University of Hamburg is located. The Grindel district is also home to many restaurants, parks, theaters, handcraft shops and museums. Surrounding Environment Y ou will nd the main building of the University of Hamburg near the Dammtor railway station not far from the main campus with the \"State and University Library Hamburg Carl von Ossietzky\", the lecture hall and several other educational buildings. On the other side of Grindelallee more University buildings are grouped around the Martin-Luther-King-Platz. The conclusion of the Uni- versity in the West is the Geomatikum near the underground station Schlump and the Zoological Museum. In the Schl\u00fcter- stra\u00dfe, on the eastern side of the University is the Post Ofce 13, the former Foreign Exchange Department of the City. Near the Schl\u00fcterstra\u00dfe is Joseph-Carlebach-Platz where one can nd the Synagogue Memorial. Finally, at the end of Grindelallee you will nd the Grindelhochh\u00e4user at Hallerstrasse 1, which was initially planned as the headquarters of the British occupation forces. Some of the most famous theaters in Hamburg are located here. The Abaton theater is considered the rst cinema in Germany. In addition, the Grindel district is home to the Hamburger Kammerspiele (a theater), the Zoological Museum and the Mineralogical Museum of the University. Gastronomy The Grindelallee sports many international restaurants. Y ou can nd Indian, Pakistani, Turk- ish, Chinese, Thai, fast food and other cuisines very easily. How to get there Located north-west of Dammtor railway station / CCH, the Grindel district can be easily explored by foot.

The Role of Place Dependent Expertise in Mobile Robotics Paul Newman Mobile Robotics Group University of Oxford Tuesday, September 29, 10:30-11:15 Hall 2 Abstract Is it worth considering trading everywhere generality (mediocrity) for local, place specic excellence? This talk will make the case, that for some use-cases, the answer is \"yes, we really should\". If your robot is mobile but only in a local area then we might think of imbuing that machine with competencies that explicitly over-t to its own workspace. This policy of learning to become the local expert forces us to think about learning spatially and temporally varying feature detectors, bespoke classiers, rich temporally indexed visual models and even place dependent controllers. This talk will discuss how such competencies, wrapped up in a life long learning framework, can contribute to a delightful increase in performance in the place of work. Isn't that, sometimes, exactly what we want? Biography Paul Newman is the BP Professor of Information Engineering at the University of Oxford and an EPSRC Leadership Fellow. He heads and founded the Mobile Robotics Group within the Department of Engineering Science which has developed a strong reputation in mobile autonomy - developing machines and robots which map, navigate through, and understand their environments. His focus lies on pushing the boundaries of navigation and autonomy techniques in terms of both endurance and scale. He enjoys collaborations with many in- dustrial partners which provide exploitation opportunities to drive the research. The group has developed a keen focus on intelligent transport. He obtained an M.Eng. in Engineering Science from Oxford University, Balliol College in 1995. He then undertook a Ph.D. in autonomous navigation at the Australian Center for Field Robotics, University of Sydney, Australia. In 1999 he returned to the United Kingdom to work in the commercial sub-sea navigation industry. In late 2000 he joined the Dept of Ocean Engineering at M.I.T. where as a post-doc and later a research scientist, he worked on algorithms and software for robust autonomous navigation for both land and sub-sea agents. In early 2003 he returned to Oxford as a Departmental Lecturer in Engineering Science before being appointed to a University Lectureship in Information Engineering and becoming a Fellow of New College in 2005, Professor of Engineering Science in 2010 and BP Professor of Information Engineering and Fellow of Keble College in 2012. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and the IEEE in 2014 for contributions to robot navigation. He likes things to know where they are. 57The New Robotics Age: The Challenge of Physical Tasks Oussama Khatib Articial Intelligence Laboratory Stanford University Tuesday, September 29, 16:00-16:45 Hall 2 Abstract The generation of robots now being developed will increasingly touch people and their lives. They will explore, work, and interact with humans in their homes, workplaces, in new pro- duction systems, and in challenging eld domains. The emerging robots will provide in- creased operational support in mining, underwater, and in hostile and dangerous environ- ments. While full autonomy for the performance of advanced tasks in complex environments remains challenging, strategic intervention of a human will tremendously facilitate reliable real-time robot operations. Human-robot synergy benets from combining the experience and cognitive abilities of the human with the strength, dependability, competence, reach, and endurance of robots. Moving beyond conventional teleoperation, the new paradigm - placing the human at the highest level of task abstraction - relies on robots with the req- uisite physical skills for advanced task behavior capabilities. Such connecting of humans to increasingly competent robots will fuel a wide range of new robotic applications in places where they have never gone before. This discussion focuses on robot design concepts, robot control architectures, and advanced task primitives and control strategies that bring human modeling and skill understanding to the development of safe, easy-to-use, and competent robotic systems. The presentation will highlight these developments in the context of a novel underwater robot, Ocean One, called O2, developed at Stanford in collaboration with Google Robotics, and KAUST. Biography Oussama Khatib received his PhD from Sup'Aero, Toulouse, France, in 1980. He is Pro- fessor of Computer Science at Stanford University.

Incubators Zexiang Li Robotics Institute Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Wednesday, September 30, 10:30-11:15 Hall 2 Abstract Studies of a robotic system or a manufacturing research problem start usually with mod- eling the underlying conguration space and then use properties of the space for analysis and/or synthesis/design/control of the system or the problem. Traditionally, local (Euclidean) properties of the spaces and calculus on Rnare been used for these studies. More than 30 years ago, Roger Brockett introduced Lie group theory for global studies of robot kinemat- ics. This effort was continued and expanded by Sastry's group at Berkeley and a number of other prominent researchers in the robotics community. In this talk, I will present major achievements and progresses of this research program. First, I will review the basic concepts of differentiable manifolds and Lie group theory and then show how (unied) geometric models can be developed for robotic systems such as rigid body motion, open-chain and closed-chain manipulators, multi-ngered hand grasp- ing and manipulation, bio-mechanic systems and robot calibration, and for manufacturing research problems such as workpiece localization and tolerancing formulation and veri- cation. Finally, I will highlight how geometric properties of the modeling spaces and the corresponding calculus tools can be exploited for more efcient solutions of the underlying optimization problems. From a different perspective, I will describe a few other innovations we introduced into our curriculum program that lled in the missing gap for commercialization of our research. Over the last 15 years or so, several startups, including Googol Technology, a leading motion con- trol company in China, DJI,a global leader in drones products and Lie Group Automation (or QKM), a provider of innovative robot solutions to the massive C3(Computers, Communica- tion and Consumer products) manufacturing industry in China, have spun off from my lab. Burrowing from L. Page's words, I credit this effort to \"Geometry as inspiration\". Rapid prototyping and fast scaling ups are essential for any robotic startups to succeed. We beneted greatly from the amazing manufacturing eco-system of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region (also known as the Hollywood of Makers) and believe that this resource is also sought-after by robotic startups elsewhere. We established the Songshan Lake Robotic Startup Facility (SSL RSF) at the heart of the PRD region to assist entrepreneurs of our community. I will highlight some key features of the SSL RSF .

It will unleash at least the same disruptive and transforma- tional power within the next 50 years as mainstream IT -technology and the Internet have in the last half of a decade. This will not only apply to the steadily growing eld of industrial robotics. Driven by a num- ber of technological enablers, e.g. the broad availability of low cost but high performance sensor technologies, robotics will be unchained and liberated from its cells. It will conquer completely new domains until it permeates all areas of life, pervading all parts of the human experience realm. The rst seal has already been broken: establishing and fostering sensitive and safe robotics, the foundations for cooperative robotic systems and human-machine-interaction have been laid. In the past, robots were surrounded by heavy safety cages, locking humans out and machines in; these borders have now been obliterated for the rst time. Workers can directly interact with automation systems as if they were colleagues. Starting in the industrial domain, robots will enhance and augment human capabilities more and more over the years. This will help to solve some of mankind's biggest challenges of the next century, e.g., over-ageing of societies driven by demographic change and a hyperbolic growth in demand for products. New markets will emerge due to the augmented demand resulting from exuberant worldwide population growth. As the required technologies become available over time, the pervasion and assimilation of robotics in all elds and domains of the living environment will follow phases similar to those of the progression of mainstream IT -technologies, including the internet: Systems became smaller, mobile, ubiquitous and then even pervasive. Nurtured and enabled by the technological breakthroughs in industrial automation, robotics will permeate other domains. In this near-future world, where robotic systems have become a commodity and facilitate peoples' lives, a new generation will grow up in a society that is enriched and augmented by robotics in every imaginable way. Robotics will be tailored into many everyday objects, becoming an integral part of all kinds of appliances. This Generation Robotics will not be intimidated by direct interaction with any form of robotic and automated system. Self-driving cars, autonomous service robots, automatized logistics 61and robotics in retail will be perceived as just as normal as the internet, smartphones and tablets are today. Surely, this change will not happen by tomorrow, but I strongly believe that the children of our children will grow up as Robotic Natives and hence be the rst Generation 'R' in the history of mankind. However, in order to pave the way for this new generation, we need to discuss and establish a set of guidelines and frameworks to address questions about the ethical, juridical, social and political impact of robotics on our daily life. This Robotic Governance has to be developed and discussed by as many stakeholders as possible - in robotics and other interdisciplinary elds; in science and research, industry, politics and society.

Hager Johns Hopkins University Thursday, October 1, 10:30-11:15 Hall 2 Abstract We are entering an era where people will interact with smart machines to enhance the physical aspects of their lives, just as smart mobile devices have revolutionized how we access and use information. Robots already provide surgeons with physical enhancements that improve their ability to cure disease, we are seeing the rst generation of robots that collaborate with humans to enhance productivity in manufacturing, and a new generation of startups are looking at ways to enhance our day to day existence through automated driving and delivery. In this talk, I will use examples from surgery and manufacturing to frame some of the broad science, technology, and commercial trends that are converging to fuel progress on human- machine collaborative systems. I will describe how surgical robots can be used to observe surgeons \"at work\" and to dene a \"language of manipulation\" from data, mirroring the sta- tistical revolution in speech processing. With these models, it is possible to recognize, as- sess, and intelligently augment surgeons' capabilities. Beyond surgery, new advances in perception, coupled with steadily declining costs and increasing capabilities of manipulation systems, have opened up new science and commercialization opportunities around manu- facturing assistants that can be instructed \"in-situ.\" Finally, I will close with some thoughts on the broader challenges still be to surmounted before we are able to create true collaborative partners.

Computer sim- ulation of the human whole body is in the grand challenge of robotics. The current focus of our study is on closing the loop of the neural system and the musculoskeletal system. Although the knowledge of the biomechanical structure of human body in every scale is well documented in anatomy, we do not know how the whole system works through their hierarchical and horizontal interactions. Mechanics and dynamics in robotics provide the tools for describing the complex system, while optimization and algorithm in robotics offer the means for solving the results of interactions. Study of brain science discovered the structure of neural system. The brain anatomy also shows the knowledge of the structure and of the connection among the local areas with interpretation of their functions. However, the pictures are still and static. While dynamics of neurons is mathematically well modelled, dynamical behavior of the neuron pool remains unexplored. What kind of dynamic views will show up by connecting and closing the loop of the two dynamical systems, namely, the neural anatomy and the body anatomy? This talk will in- troduce our approach on modeling for the human whole body simulation under the national super computer project of Japan in collaboration with neuroscientists, medical doctors, and scientists in computational mechanics.

The DRC challenged participating robotics teams and their robots to complete a difcult course of eight tasks relevant to disaster. 25 teams from around the world participated in this demanding challenges but only three of them completed the mission in the specied time limit of one hour. Even the rst place winner, team KAIST, took 44 minutes to complete. Many teams struggled a lot in operating their robots. Most of the robot experienced real 'disastrous' situation as falling down before entering the disaster scene or during the tasks. Some of them were from mechanical failure, the others were from operator's mistakes or from bipedal walking difculties, etc. Prof. Jun Ho Oh will review the DRC nal process and discuss about what the difculties were, what happened and what we learned from the challenge. He will also explain some details and winning strategy about the robot 'DRC Hubo'.

However, even today the integration of robots with their sensors in complex tasks remains a research topic, typically not being able to cope with real-world scenarios. Advances in machine learning in the last years is about to radically change this situation. The efciency and generalising behaviour of deep learning now allows us to perform end- to-end learning on complex tasks. By combining deep learning with reinforcement learning and exploration, actions can be swiftly learned using raw sensory data. These new method- ologies no longer require explicit modelling of the movement in state space, conguration space, or task space; instead, all representations will be efciently created in latent spaces in the neural networks. In my talk I will explore the very recent literature on this topic, and demonstrate the power of deep learning in the interpretation of complex sensory signals in a robotic setting. I will fur- thermore demonstrate how to efciently generalise between latent spaces and conguration or task spaces. Biography Patrick van der Smagt received an M.Sc. in computer science at the Vrije Universiteit Am- sterdam and a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Ams- terdam. He is professor for computer science at TUM and researcher at fortiss Munich, and directs a joint lab on machine learning for biomimetic robotics. Besides publishing nu- merous papers and patents on machine learning, robotics, and motor control, he has won various awards, including the 2013 Helmholtz-Association Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger Award, the 2014 King-Sun Fu Memorial Award, and the 2013 Harvard Medical School/MGH Martin Re- search Prize. He is founding chairman of a non-for-prot organisation for Assistive Robotics for tetraplegics and co-founder of various companies. His most recent startup focuses on machine-learning methodologies for robotics and data processing, in particular focussing on deep learning and recurrent neural networks. 66Robots, Politics, and Ethics: How Autonomous Driving Transforms Our Way of Thinking About Machines Bj\u00f6rn Giesler Head of Driver Assistance Elektrobit Automotive GmbH Tuesday, September 29, 17:50-18:20 Hall 2 Abstract Highly intelligent robots have been a trope of science ction literature since the genre's inception. In reality, robots have so far been conned to strictly-controlled factory and ware- house floors, and the tasks assigned to them were tailored to their low level of intelligence. This is changing drastically as the Automotive Industry and some software companies are starting to bring about the advent of the Autonomous Vehicle in public trafc. Universities, research labs and development centers worldwide are working hard on the intelligence level necessary to release a self-driving car into the streets, and the rst results will certainly improve trafc safety on average. But it is clear that the self-driving car will be inferior to a human driver for a very long time when it comes to dealing with difcult, unforeseeable situations that require creativity to avert accidents. As a result, autonomous cars will cause harm to humans in trafc, even if statistically much less than human drivers. This clashes with the way we think about machines as tools to make our lives easier and most importantly safer, not on average but individually. To be able to accept the statistical improvement on safety that self-driving cars promise, we need to change our way of thinking about machines. Biography Bj\u00f6rn Giesler received the M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2000 and his PhD in En- gineering in 2005, both from the University of Karlsruhe. While at University, his research interests included augmented reality, computer vision, self-localization of and creating maps with sensor systems (simultaneously if possible), autonomous robots, human-machine inter- faces and large software structures. He joined AUDI AG in 2005 to develop self-driving cars. On the path to this goal he worked on time-of-flight cameras, multi-camera stereo and motion stereo, automotive computer vision, camera self-calibration, sensor data fusion, and trajec- tory planning and control, as well as system architectures and functional safety. He spent the last three years developing what will be the rst highly-automated driving system for the consumer market. He initiated and co-ordinated the student contest \"Audi Autonomous Driving Cup (AADC)\", rst held in 2015. He recently joined Elektrobit Automotive GmbH, a company working on software architectures, systems, and components for the Automotive industry, to head the department for Driver Assistance and Highly Automated Driving. 67Micro/Nano Robotics Enabled Technology for Nano Device Assembly and Drug Discovery Lianqing Liu Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA) Chinese Academy of Sciences Wednesday September 30, 16:50-17:20 Hall 2 Abstract The micro/nano robotics provides new enabling technology for people to explore the world down to the nano meter scale. Although micro/nano robotics has achieved great progress, the problem of lacking practical applications is still a bottleneck that hindering its further de- velopment. In this talk, two multidiscipline researches of Micro/Nano Robotics with Nano Device Assembly and Drug Discovery will be introduced. For Nano Device Assembly, the traditional method with AFM, SEM or DEP based manipulation often costs several minutes for only one device assembly. While with newly developed robotic manipulation technology, thousands of nano devices can be assembled in a couple of seconds, which increases the efciency over thousand times. For Drug Discovery, nano robotics provides many unique functions to facilitate the process of new drug discovery. As examples, how to use nano robotics to study mechanosensitive ion-channel and investigate efcacy difference of lym- phoma targeted therapy will be presented. These researches show that micro/nano robotics is full of potential to bring breakthroughs for current scientic research, and as a result, new applications in turn will pull the technology into a higher level.

At present, as autonomous cars ap- proach deployment in several countries, ethical issues are being discussed with increasing frequency. Among these are such issues as: responsibility and legal liability for accidents involving self-driving cars (which may in- clude injury to humans and property damage), job displacement (e.g., for truck drivers and taxi drivers), protection of privacy, needed changes in vehicle driving rules, responsibility of human passengers, changes in laws involving police and legal authorities, liability of vehicle owners and manufacturers. the ability of police to override the controls of a self-driving car performing illegal moves and control it remotely, and, if so, then \"hacker\" possibly taking over the vehicle's controls and using it for illegal purposes. This presentation will review these and other legal and ethical issues involving autonomous cars. Biography Dr. George Bekey is an emeritus professor of computer science, electrical engineering and biomedical engineering at the University of Southern California, and a research scholar in residence at California Polytechnic University at San Luis Obispo.

To solve the practical problem with robots, we rst have to analyze the task in order to understand the particular problem. And if the problem is expected to be solved by robotic machines, which can perform the necessary tasks and replace or support the humans'work, we can use whole robotic systems. In these cases, the functions realized by robotic machines are like human working ability, (work done by human hands, or using their mobility). The expected roles of the robotic systems are generally: (1) decreasing the strenuous load of human workers and reducing working costs, (2) increasing accuracy, or upsizing in order to handle more heavy weight materials, (3) expand the working environment to cover hazardous or dangerous sites. For eld robots, technical importance is the ability to cope with the variety of environment conditions. The set of the environment conditions covered by a robotic system should be dened for each practical problem. So, even though robotics research aims at generality or versatility, rst we have to solve each particular problem and in each possible working conditions. In this talk, I will report on unmanned construction by remote operated heavy equipment for building erosion-control dams after big landslides or volcanic eruption, and also on inspection of large structure without using temporal scaffold for safety, and cost reduction in the infrastructure maintenance. I will also introduce recent Japanese activities on technical development and attempt on social implementation of eld robots technology.

An im- portant part of this infrastructure is the HBP Neurorobotics Platform, a research platform for high-delity virtual robotics, that will allow scientists from all over the world to connect reconstructed brain models to virtual bodies and robots and test them in realistic dynamic environments. I will shortly present the HBP Neurorobotics Platform and illustrate the chances and chal- lenges of virtual robotics on the example of an integrated sensory-motor model of a mouse. The virtual mouse includes a brain, reconstructed from high-resolution imaging data, as well as a body, composed of a skeleton with muscles, skin, and sensory organs. If the mouse is embedded in a simulated environment with realistic physics it can be used in a wide range of in silico experiments while researchers can observe its entire neural activity. Finally, I will illustrate how such closed-loop sensory motor experiments can be used to inform and rene bottom-up reconstructed brain models. Biography Marc-Oliver Gewaltig co-directs the Neurorobotics subproject of the European \"Human Brain Project\" and leads the Neurorobotics Section of the Blue-Brain Project at the EPFL in Lau- sanne, Switzerland. In his research, Marc-Oliver Gewaltig investigates the computational properties of biologically derived brain models in closed action-perception loops. Before join- ing the EPFL in 2011, Marc-Oliver Gewaltig was Principal Scientist (2003-2011) and Project Leader (1998-2002) at the Honda Research Institute Europe in Offenbach, Germany, where he worked on detailed columnar models of information processing in the primate visual sys- tem (Schrader et al., 2009) as well as on learning and plasticity (Knoblauch et al. 2012). Marc-Oliver Gewaltig received his PhD in Physics in 1999 for his work on activity propaga- tion in cortical networks (Gewaltig et al 2001, Diesmann et al 1999). 71Optimization for Robust Motion Planning and Control Russ Tedrake Robot Locomotion Group Massachusetts Institute of Technology Thursday October 1, 17:20-17:50 Hall 2 Abstract I dream of making robots capable of executing extremely aggressive dynamic motions - like the speeder bikes in the Star Wars' Forest of Endor - out in the real world. These systems must plan in real time in novel environments, and be robust enough to deal with uncertainty from perception, imperfect actuators, and model errors. Moreover, I want to achieve this performance in legged robots and robot manipulation, where contact with the environment plays a central role in the dynamics. Achieving this performance reliably requires a focus on robustness, which has natural formu- lations using optimization. Making these optimizations tractable requires exploiting sparsity and convexity in our robot equations, and making informed relaxations. In this talk, I will review our best attempts to date and give examples with fast UAV flight through clutter and whole-body planning and control for humanoids.

Volcano eruptions cause damages to habitants by volcanic bomb, volcanic ashes, lava stream, and debris flow. To protect lives, robotic technologies are now expected to be applied to observe volcanic activity in restricted areas close to the craters. Based on the above background, ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism (MLIT) in Japan organized some robotics projects to apply to natural disaster observation and infrastructure surveillance, and our research group is now a part of them. Our objective is to forecast debris flow with multi-rotor UAVs, and our current challenges are to obtain a 3D-map of the target environment, and to enable soil sampling from restricted areas. In this talk, I will introduce recent robotics projects for natural disaster response in Japan, and present our practical research activities in volcanic areas.

In recent years, as robotics technologies have begun to move beyond their traditional strongholds in industrial and manufacturing applica- tions, government agencies have adapted their funding models, introducing new programs and providing increasing funding for interdisciplinary and international collaborations. Exam- ples include the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) of the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Horizon 2020 (H2020) program of the European Union, and Japan's Robot Revolution initiative. The purpose of this Government Forum is to bring together researchers and gov- ernment policy makers in a continuing dialog about new funding opportunities, new possi- bilities for international collaborations, and lessons learned from ongoing efforts, building on the success of the Forum that was held at the 2015 ICRA ( http://icra2015.org/ conference/forums/11-conference/47-government-forum ). The Forum will consist of two sessions, punctuated by a lunch break. In the rst session, pol- icy makers from funding agencies in Asia, Australia, North America and Europe will discuss government funding priorities and government policy as it relates to robotics, with a particu- lar emphasis on opportunities for interdisciplinary and international research collaborations. In the second session, researchers will discuss emerging challenges and opportunities. This will include a discussion of characteristics that can either contribute to, or impede, successful research collaborations, including discussion of the kinds of research project that are likely to succeed only when confronted by international collaborative teams. The lunch break, which will occur between the two sessions, will provide an opportunity for researchers and policy makers to interact informally, potentially raising issues to be addressed in the second session. The Forum will conclude with a panel discussion. Agenda 11:30 Representatives from government funding agencies 13:00 Lunch Break 14:00 Researchers from academia and industry 15:30 Panel Discussion 75Futurist Forum Wednesday Sep. 30, 11:30-16:00 Hall 2 Organizer Dominik B\u00f6sl, Corporate Innovation Ofce, KUKA AG Shaping a united vision for the future of robotics Robotics will change the world! It will unleash the same if not an even more disruptive and transformational power within the next 50 years as mainstream IT -technology and the Internet have in the last half of a decade. But what will this future look like? Y ou will have the chance to discuss this question with a lineup of internationally renowned experts from different interdisciplinary elds out of science, research, industry and politics at the1stIEEE IROS Futurist Forum ! The goal of the Futurist Forum is to provide a rst draft of a \"north star\" for the robotics community: A universally shared vision of the future that will be rened and detailed over the next few years. It will provide a holistic view on the future and its arising challenges, serving future robotic research as motivation and guidance . Nurtured by technological breakthroughs in industrial automation, robotics will permeate other domains. Hence, a new generation of Robotic Natives will grow up in a society that is enriched and enhanced by robotics in ev- ery imaginable way. Robotics will be tailored into many everyday objects, thus becoming an integral part of all kinds of appliances. The direct interaction with any form of robotic and automated system will not intim- idate this Generation Robotics . It will per- ceive self-driving cars, autonomous service robots, automatized logistics and robotics in retail as just as normal as the internet, smartphones and tablets are today. This change will not be limited to the steadily growing eld of industrial robotics. Due to a number of technological enablers, e.g. the broad availability of low cost but high performance sensor technologies, robotics will be unchained and liberated from its cells. It will conquer completely new domains until it pervades all areas of life, permeating all parts of the human experience realm. How will our world, the global economy and societies change? Which impact will these changes have and what needs will arise in the near future? And how can robotics and automation technologies help address some of these issues? These questions are essential, since the rst seal has already been broken: by establishing and fostering sensitive and safe robotics, the foundations for cooperative robotic systems and human-machine-interaction have been laid. In the past, robots were surrounded by heavy safety cages, locking humans out and machines in; for the rst time, these borders 76have now been obliterated. As if they were colleagues, workers can directly interact with automation systems. The collaborative vision of the future is crucial for paving the way for this new Generation R: the need to discuss and establish a set of guidelines and frameworks to address questions about the ethical, juridical, social and political impact of robotics on our daily life will arise. TheFuturist Forum can lay the foundations for an elaborate debate on Robotic Governance in which stakeholders from diverse domains have to be involved - from robotics and other interdisciplinary elds; from science and research, industry, politics and society.

To foster the entrepreneurial spirit and to provide a platform to encourage researchers and practitioners to transition ideas and prototypes to commercializable products, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (IEEE RAS) is inviting the robotics and automation com- munity to participate in an Entrepreneurship Forum and Start-up Competition (EFSC) at the 2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'15) in Hamburg ( http://iros2015.org/ ). The event is intended to inspire, educate, en- able, and empower researchers, students, young professionals, and anyone else who has the 'start-up bug' in starting companies of their own but is not sure of how to go about it. We also believe that this event will create an ecosystem that will provide the much-needed support for start-ups to launch their initiatives while being realistic about their envisioned ideas and products. Previous IEEE RAS events centered on the entrepreneurship topic have been held at IROS'13 (Tokyo) and IROS'14 (Chicago) and served as starting points for discussions on identifying gaps and building bridges between industry, academia, govern- ment, and end-users (see http://www.iros2013.org/industry-forum.html and http://www.iros2014.org/program/industry-forum ). In addition to invited talks centered on entrepreneurship in robotics and automation, the start-up competition at IROS'15 will consist of three stages: In the rst stage, submitted applications will be down-selected to arrive at a pool of qualied applicants based on a dened set of criteria developed by the organizers (see 'Application Form' information below). This will be followed by a remote stage where the selected applicants will be paired with coaches based on the proposal content and the expertise of the coaches. The coaches will then critique, and provide technical and professional assistance to rene the idea/product pitches. The nal stage would allow for the rened pitches and content to be presented in front of a distinguished panel of venture capitalists, industry, and academic experts who have successfully funded, transitioned and have experience in commercialization of robotics and automation technologies. Travel support will be provided for all qualied applicants invited to IROS'15 and awards will be given for the top 3 nishers (totaling $45k). We gratefully acknowledge the support of IEEE and KUKA for their generous nancial support of this event. Additional information is available from http://iros2015.org/index.php/program/ entrepreneurship-forum-start-up-competition/ . 78Citizen Forum Friday Oct. 2, 9:00-12:00 & 14:00-17:00 Hall 2 Organizer R\u00fcdiger Dillmann, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Tamim Asfour, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Karsten Berns, TU Kaiserslautern Horst-Michael Gross, Ilmenau University of Technology Joachim Hertzberg, Osnabr\u00fcck University The purpose of the IROS 2015 Citizen Forum is to inform and to discuss recent progress as well as future visionary research and development towards a robot technology which allows robots to autonomously interact closely with each other and with humans, in risky and challenging scenarios with different needs and societal impact. Such robots may have various different shapes and functions, cognitive capabilities, and in addition, natural and intuitive man-machine interfaces. Today's robots are mostly used in industrial manufacturing, maintenance, inspection and transportation. However, new robot shapes and bionic principles have emerged which allow robots to fly, to dive, or to walk in uneven, rough and dangerous terrain, performing tasks which cannot be carried out directly by humans. Others are designed for highly risky appli- cations like surgery, man-made and natural environmental disasters or in space. All of these robots need to perceive and understand the environment to fulll the requirements of the scenario they are designed for. When cooperating with people, the robots must adapt their behaviour to the needs of the humans, considering each individual's personal capabilities, stature and mental status. The interest in such systems is rapidly growing, as current robot technology is available at a reasonable price and becoming part of our daily life. Robots are being connected to the Internet, to other robots, autonomous mobile systems and to various sensors and other devices within future smart urban environments. In addition to the conference participants, the IROS 2015 Citizen Forum addresses all inter- ested citizens, pupils, students, teachers, artists and others. In short, all people interested in future and upcoming emerging technology which may strongly influence our daily life and our societies. Attendence is free and open to all. The program of the Forum includes talks and discussions by a unique selection of outstanding speakers, which survey recent techno- logical progress towards advanced robots and explain the impact on various new upcoming application elds. Speakers Dario Floreano EPFL, Lausanne Haddadin Universit\u00e4t Oussama of Freiburg 79Call for Knoll, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen Hannes Bistry, Universit\u00e4t Hamburg Discussing the latest progress on your project on a conference is a great thing, but showing it and playing around with it together with other researchers and developers takes the expe- rience to a different level. To meet this demand, the IROS 2015 introduces the concept of an open Playground . The Playground is a marked eld in the foyer in front of Hall G. Every participant is invited to bring and show robots or prototypes without prior registration. The idea is to assemble a community around the open eld to create an atmosphere for lively discussions, inspirations and communication. We kindly ask you to drop a short mail to playground@iros2015.org if you plan to bring any Hardware for the Playground, to help us to estimate the amount of interest and required space. Rules & Facts The Playground will be open during the three main conference days: Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. We will provide a number of tables and power supplies. The Playground rules are quite simple: The Playground is open for everyone (student, researcher, startups, ...). Robots on the playground must neither damage other robots nor harm humans. If your robot has any special safety requirements, please contact us in advance. Be careful with Wi networks. Extensive use of multiple Wi hot-spots may interfere with the conference network and other playground users. Be fair! Don't occupy the playground for long times in case other people are waiting. The use of small UAVs is possible, depending on the situation. We hope to see many innovative devices and have interesting discussions. See you at the \"Playground\"! 81Robotic Fish Water Polo Competition Foyer Hall G Organizer Jorge M. Dias, University of Coimbra Guangming Xie, Peking University Kaspar Althoefer, KCL London Jingtai Liu, Nankai University Rong Xiong, Zhejiang University Over 70% of the earth is covered in water and the ocean is a very important resource for human soci- ety. Many manual or automatic machines, including robots, are being developed for all kinds of under- water work and services. Developing more effective underwater robots is becoming an attractive eld of robotic technology. Today, various robotic competi- tions are being organized, such as robot football, res- cue robots, service robots at home. However, all of these are only taking place on land. The time has come for holding underwater robot com- petitions. By introducing appropriate games, more people will be attracted to the eld of underwater robotics and, therefore underwater robots and their cooperation techniques will improve. A water polo competition with robotic sh is currently being constructed at Peking University, China. It fo- cuses on the problem of intelligent underwater multi- agent cooperation and control in a highly dynamic environment with a hybrid centralized system. The game involves two teams of robotic sh with differ- ence colors. A camera over the pool catches the im- ages of the sh and ball. On an off-eld PC, the po- sitions of the sh are obtained in real time and the control commands are generated and sent to the sh by WiFi. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. The question of how to track multiple robotic sh on a water surface in real- time and how to control the sh to push the ball efciency and precisely are the two key challenges in the game. Teams from China, Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway will attend the competi- tion. 82Awards The best papers of the conference will be awarded. Aside the best paper award of the conference, multiple sponsored awards will be granted. The award ceremony will be held in the lunch break on Thursday, October 1 in Hall 2. Lunch boxes will be given out in the foyer of Hall 2, starting at 12:15.

Martinet of Coimbra), C. Stiller (KIT) Abstract The purpose of this workshop is to discuss topics related to the challenging problems of autonomous navigation and of driving assistance in open and dynamic environments. Tech- nologies related to application elds such as unmanned outdoor vehicles or intelligent road vehicles will be considered from both the theoretical and technological point of views. Sev- eral research questions located on the cutting edge of the state of the art will be addressed. Among the many application areas that robotics is addressing, transportation of people and goods seem to be a domain that will dramatically benet from intelligent automation. Fully automatic driving is emerging as the approach to dramatically improve efciency while at the same time leading to the goal of zero fatalities. This workshop will address robotics technolo- gies, which are at the very core of this major shift in the automobile paradigm. Technologies related to this area, such as autonomous outdoor vehicles, achievements, challenges and open questions would be presented. Keynote Speakers P . Bonnifait (Heudiasyc), M. Mendes (Univ.

The workshop will be focused on summarizing the main achievements of the project accom- panied by demonstrations and simulations of the hardware and software as follows: Novel concept of Mini-RoboMach, with unique intelligent controller with which the Mini-RoboMach is utilised to perform self-positioning, reasoning and planning. Unique virtual test bench for the hardware and software. Demonstration of MiRoR system. Speakers Dragos Axinte, Salvador Cobos-Guzman, Xin 28 Sep, 09:00-17:00, Hall C1 Semantic Policy and Action Representations (SPAR) for Autonomous Robots http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~yzyang/spar.html Organizers Y ezhou Y ang (UMD), Neil T. Dantam (RICE), Eren Erdal Aksoy (KIT), Tamim Asfour (KIT) Abstract Observation and execution are dual problems for autonomous robots. A sensory-motor bridge from observation to execution of an action is essential for autonomous robots to learn from human demonstrations and generate dynamic policies to fulll demonstrated goals. This requires not only imitation of human movements at the level of continuous signals, but moreover, semantic action representation to express the desired goals even in different scene contexts. The more expressive and structural the semantic representation, the greater the capabilities and reliability of the robot. The aim of this one-day workshop is two-fold. First, we will highlight recent developments in manipulation action semantic representations and semantic policy generation. We will also compare the state-of-the-art approaches for generic action and policy representations in both computer vision and robotics, looking for a common ground to combine assumedly disparate approaches for autonomous capability and reliability. A key goal is to reconcile and integrate various bottom-up and top-down approaches for semantic action perception. Speakers (Univ. of Michigan), (Imperial London) Day Workshop MoWS-04 Mo, 28 Sep, 08:30-17:30, Hall C2 Designing and Evaluating Social Robots for Public Settings http://iros15-desrps.chrisbevan.co.uk/ Organizers Chris Bevan (Univ. of Bath), Paul Bremner (Bristol Robotics Laboratory), Dana\u00eb Stanton Fraser (Univ. of Bath), Hatice Gunes (Queen Mary University London) Abstract Social robotics has become increasingly important in HRI, yet robots are often still designed and evaluated using traditional lab-based experimental methods that derive from the AI roots of robotics as a eld. Increasingly however, robotics researchers are considering the value of multi-disciplinary design and evaluation methods, including the mixed-methods lab-based designs used traditionally within the social sciences along with \"in the wild\" testing through eld deployments in public settings. In this workshop, we will explore the challenges to both robotic design and evaluation methods that these hybrid methodologies create, and how these challenges might be harnessed to promote a more \"human-centred\" approach to HRI. The objective of this full day workshop is to bring together a multidisciplinary group of researchers to identify and address key challenges to the future study of social robotics in both lab and eld. The workshop will include three guest speakers with backgrounds in a range of methodological approaches to HRI. Speakers Hideaki Kuzuoka (Univ. of Weiss (Vienna Riek (Univ. of Notre Dame) 100Full Day Workshop MoWS-05 Mo, 28 Sep, 08:30-18:00, Hall C3 Multimodal Semantics for Robotic Systems (MuSRobS) https://musrobs-iros2015.appspot.com/ Guti\u00e9rrez (Univ. of Extremadura), Rafael Banch (A*STAR Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore), Suraj Nair (TUM) Abstract Human learning and reasoning is a process that involves information obtained from a range of different senses combined to form an incredibly successful cognitive system. Articial autonomous systems should also effectively process and combine different sensory infor- mation to compliment each other to produce better logical inferences. Through semantic modeling of low level features within a scenario, robots can generate rep- resentation of such features in level of abstraction where logical reasoning methods could be applied to them for decision making. Furthermore, at such level more than one modalities can be fused to compliment each other and produce logical inferences. This creates the possibility of robust decision making even under scenarios where certain modalities under- perform, such as generic task performances. Lately heterogeneous cognitive systems have become quite popular among the research community, specially those using deep learning techniques over images and language sources, showing promising results. This workshop provides a uniquely focused forum for the discussion of the intersection of different elds like, audio, speech, language, images and some others into unique robotics systems that can auto-improve by learning and can be exploited through different reasoning techniques. This workshop will bring together the foremost researchers from different elds of robotics sharing and unifying techniques that can be applied to different areas on where they are currently used. Along with the presentation of novel works in the eld discussions will be encouraged to share latest advances among researchers. Finally prominent gures on the research of multimodal semantic systems will be invited to share their latest and most suc- cessful achievements and overviews on the eld. 101Full Day Workshop MoWS-06 Mo, 28 Sep, 08:30-18:00, Hall 12 Towards Standardized Experiments in Human-Robot Interactions clawar.org/towards-standarised-experiments-in-human-robot-interactions/ Organizers Nicole Elena Gi- G\u00e4vle) Abstract This workshop aims to advance the topic of standardization of robot experiments in Human- Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios. While the R&D community produces great amounts of scientic outputs on HRI, the results are scattered in a myriad of different approaches and ways of performing and testing the interaction; metrics which have been used include efcacy, effectiveness, users satisfaction, emotional impact and social components. The main consequence is that results are not comparable and benchmarking of the various approaches proposed is not possible. The community is still missing consensus tools to benchmark robot products (robot producer/industrial perspective) and robot applications (re- search/academic perspective). Models are required for the standardized assessment of robot products and applications in use in terms of safety, performance, user experience, and ergonomics. The benet of agreed approaches and methods to the assessment of HRI is the production of results, so called \"normative\" data in the standardization community, meaning that they have been formulated via wide consultation in an open and transparent manner. In this way, the results become widely acceptable, and can be exploited for the creation of international quality norms and standards which in turn would mean measurable robot performances in terms of HRI. We would like to draw from a wide set of experts from the industry, academy and standardization to focus on the key areas of industrial, personal care and medical robots. Together, we will work on establishing benchmarking scenarios and identifying suitable metrics common to HRI in these central and related robotics domains. As a result we aim for providing metrics and scenarios for robot producers and HRI researchers to evaluate their robots and robot systems and setups on a comparable level. Reproducible and comparable results and interoperable systems should be a long-term goal that will be a valuable contribution to our community. 102Full Day Workshop MoWS-07 Mo, 28 Sep, 08:30-18:00, Hall 15 Unconventional Computing for Bayesian Inference http://ap.isr.uc.pt/events/UCBI_iros2015 Ferreira (Univ. of Coimbra) Abstract Contemporary robots and other cognitive artifacts are not available to autonomously operate in complex environments. The major reason for this failure is the lack of cognitive systems able to efciently deal with uncertainty when behaving in real world situations. One of the challenges of robotics is endowing devices with adequate computational power to dwell in uncertainty and decide with incomplete data, with limited resources and power, as we and biological beings have done for a long time. To deal with incompleteness and uncertainty probabilistic Bayesian approaches have been pursued, with outstanding results. However, all these works, even if they propose probabilistic models, still rely on a classical computing paradigm that imposes a bottleneck on the performance and scalability. Improved and novel electronic devices have opened the spectrum of devices available for computation, such as GPUs, FPGAs, hybrid systems, allowing unconventional approaches to better explore par- allelization and tackle power consumption. The flexibility of current reprogrammable logic devices provides a test bed for novel stochastic processors and unconventional computing. The workshop will address recent advances and future directions of probabilistic computing for robotics, with keynote speakers on Bayesian inference for autonomous robots, and in- sights from computational biology, as well as presentations of submitted works, setting the floor for fruitful discussions and insights in this bridge topic. Speakers Jacques Droulez (ISIR-UPMC), Pierre 103Full Day Workshop MoWS-08 Mo, 28 Sep, 08:30-18:00, Hall B1 From Plants and Animals to Robots: Movements, Sensing, and Control. Two Worlds in Comparison http://mbr.iit.it/about/workshops/ws-iros-2015.html Organizers Barbara Mazzolai (IIT), Lucia Beccai (IIT) Abstract Robots today are expected to operate in a variety of scenarios, being able to cope with un- certain situations and to react quickly to changes in the environment. A strong relationship between nature and technology plays a major role, with the winning approach of evaluat- ing natural systems to abstract principles for new designs. As starting point of the event PLANTOIDS, ANIMALOIDS and HUMANOIDS robotic platforms are discussed. Under this scientic and technological umbrella, we will compare ideas, biological features, and tech- nological translations coming from the two Kingdoms and related to areas of interest in robotics: movement, sensing and control. Movement, usually ascribed to animals, is also pertinent to plants which move in a very efcient way. New actuators and materials, muscle- or not muscle-like, will be discussed, together with bioinspired tactile sensing systems, these including: the stick insect sensory system focusing on active touch; flow sensing in sh lat- eral line systems, and plant inspired tactile sensing. Control \"with and without brain\" is the concluding part, involving: plants, as information-processing organisms with complex com- munication, where the \"command center\" is mainly at root apex, for new signaling modeling and distributed networks; octopus, with distributed control in its peripheral nervous system, for new distributed embodied control models; and, computational models of Central Pattern Generators, will be presented for locomotion control in quadruped robots. The discussion sessions during the whole workshop will be chaired and guided by a professional science communicator, Sabine Hauert, who will give a view \"out of the box\" of biorobotics and its future impacts on the society.

Models offer a high-level way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at the right level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for programming complex systems. They have however recently garnered interest as a separate eld of study; this workshop investigates DSLs and models for robotics. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concur- rency, uncertainty, time constraints, etc.), for which reason traditional general-purpose lan- guages often lead to a poor t between the language features and the implementation re- quirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful, systematic way to overcome this problem. The DSLRob series of workshops is devoted to promoting the systematic use of DSLs in robotic systems; this year's DSLRob program includes paper presentations and discussions, invited talks, and reports on DSL-related activities in the robotics community. Speakers Herman Bruyninckx (Univ. of Leuven), Markus V\u00f6lter (itemis AG Stuttgart) 105Full Day Workshop MoWS-10 Mo, 28 Sep, 08:45-18:00, Hall E Robotic Co-Workers http://home.deib.polimi.it/zanchettin/IROS2015/ Organizers Hao Ding (ABB), Andrea Maria Zanchettin (Politecnico di Milano) Abstract To quickly and efciently adapt to production changes, future working environments will be populated by both humans and robots, sharing the same workspace. This scenario entails a series of issues and open topics, such as safety, optimal tasks allocation and scheduling, learning and error recovery, which are uncommon in today's industrial settings. These topics are still open for more reliable solutions and further investigations, possibly taking inspiration by successful industrial test cases. This workshop aims at bringing together academic and industrial points of view on the eld of human robot collaboration, and update the discussion concerning their respective expectations, key success factors, and open topics. Speakers Bjoern Matthias (ABB), Brian Benoit (Rethink Robotics), Hannover) and others. 106Full Day Workshop MoWS-11 Mo, 28 Sep, 08:30-18:00, Hall D Learning Object Affordances: A Fundamental Step to Allow Prediction, Planning and Tool Use? http://objectaffordances.blogspot.pt Organizers Lorenzo Jamone Lisbon) object affordances a for prediciton and planning? Are the basic mecha- nisms involved in the learning of affordances similar to ones that lead to tool use? What are the algorithm and strategies that can support the emergence of this knowledge in robots? Can affordances enable generalisation (and even creativity) in cognitive robots? The goal of this full-day workshop is to try to answer these questions (and more!) while depicting the current state of the art concerning the modeling of affordances and motor cognition in animals and robots, standing from a multi-disciplinary point of view, and to sketch the main challenges and future directions of the eld. Speakers Alex Kacelnik (Oxford University), Jaqueline Fagard Aloimonos (Univ. of Maryland) 107Full Day Workshop MoWS-12 Mo, 28 Sep, 08:30-18:00, Hall 8 Bridging User Needs to Deployed Applications of Service Robots robot-era.eu/robotera/index.php?pagina=pagine_personalizzate&blocco=92&id=261 Organizers Fabio Bonsignorio, Filippo Cavallo, Paolo Dario (SSSA) Abstract Future service robotics will be machines that will primarily help and assist persons of all ages in daily activities at home, in their workplace and in other environments. They will be able to perform a multitude of roles thanks to their capabilities to act and interact physically, emotionally, socially and safely with humans, providing for an easier and healthier life. De- spite the progress of research in the eld of service robotics, there are various issues that should be addressed and solved for a wide deployment in the real daily life world and for the creation of a real market. Fundamental aspects as reliability, availability, adaptability, safety, security and maintainability (these attributes are the basis of the dependability paradigm) should be addressed and appropriately evaluated in a unique situation in order to demon- strate a consolidated technical feasibility. In addition to the technical evaluation, issues like acceptability and usability of technologies and the economic, ethical, legal and social impli- cations, as well as standardization aspects should be strongly taken into account. The aim of this workshop is to provide a structured approach from user needs to the deployment of intelligent robot and system solutions to improve the quality of life of elders, impaired per- sons and everybody else by augmenting mobility, manipulation and cognitive capabilities of the users. If you are a researcher interested to turn your research results into a solution to a real need of the real life of real people, or if you are an entrepreneur willing to improve the quality of life of the greater possible number of people by making easier any activity of daily life of ordinary people, you will need a coherent set of methodologies, software, hardware and physical validation infrastructures. In this workshop we will propose a bridging approach with reference to real use-cases of service robots in a town setting. Generalizing the expe- rience gained in a number of FP7, AAL-JP and H2020 projects, each step of the process will be discussed by leading experts with reference to cutting edge real world experiences where service robot platforms have been tested with more than 100 real users, in different locations. 108Full Day Workshop MoWS-13 Mo, 28 Sep, 08:30-18:20, Hall 14 Real-Time Cognitive Computing for Service Robots http://arch.naist.jp/~yaojun/IROS-WS-CognitiveComputing.html Organizers Jun Y ao (Huawei Tech), Nancy Amato (Texas A&M Univ.), Jun Takamatsu (NAIST), Andreas M\u00e4der (Univ. of Hamburg) Abstract The goal of this workshop is to give a quick review of the rapidly evolving high-accurate ma- chine learning and other cognition technologies, and explore the adaptability with the cur- rent and future service robots. Particularly, we start from the machine learning or statistical learning technologies that are particularly relevant to mobile robotic agents in providing them with an adaptive decision-making capability. The complexity of the related mechanisms will be then considered under the battery-life constraints that a mobile platform usually experi- ences. Therefore, we borrow the concept of efciency, measured as performance per power, to measure this possible adaptability. The acceleration of the complex deep-learning tasks, such as, the convolutional neural networks, will be discussed in detail by all aspects of soft- ware, hardware and their collaboration. Meanwhile, since the machine learning techniques are usually heuristic, safety issues including false-positive and false-negative handling are also covered in our scope. We will address all these issues while discussing cutting-edge technologies in both cognitive computations and service robot planning and control systems.

This methodology is intended for creating 3D cellular systems such as functional tissue in vitro environments, in which active functional cells selected from a living organism are used to create the 3D cellular system. This new methodology will bring innovation to the next generation of tissue engineering and will become the world's rst creation of 3D cellular system in vitro environments. This innovation will be achieved by developing a methodology of hyper micro-nano measurement and control. The outcome of this innovation will bring great technological advancements to both engineering and life science eld.

Jaume I) Abstract In Robotics Research the replicability of results and their objective evaluation and compari- son is very difcult to put into practice. This workshop aims to gather researchers active in the academia and the industry to share the ideas so far developed and discuss the challenges still ahead. The best contributions will be invited to submit to a refereed edited book or special issue on an high impact robotics journal. Robotics is a broad science and though we will try to cover different aspects of the discipline, the emphasis of the workshop will be on principles, methods, and applications in terms of cognitive capabilities and autonomy. We will address the issue of how to dene and measure system level characteristics like autonomy, cognition or intelligence. Another key topic will be a capability-led understanding of cognitive robots: how to dene shared ontologies or dictionaries to discuss robotic cognitive systems in terms of their performance, relationships between different cognitive robotics capabilities, requirements, theories, archi- tectures, models and methods that can be applied across multiple engineering and appli- cation domains, detailing and understanding better the requirements for robots in terms of performance, the approaches to meeting these requirements and the trade-offs in terms of performance. Finally, epistemological issues in robotics research and its evaluation will be presented and discussed, related to performance measurement, methods for the objective comparison of different algorithms and systems, and the replication of published results.

Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE), a revolutionary clinical alternative to traditional flexible scopes, enables inspection of the di- gestive system with minimal discomfort for the patient or the need for sedation, mitigating some of the risks of flexible endoscopy. Although WCE has entered the medical scene as a disruptive technology, it presents a number of limitations, e.g., the impossibility to actively control locomotion and camera orientation, which leads to low diagnostic specicity and false-positive results. Therefore, the natural evolution of clinical WCE consists of integrat- ing mechanisms for closed-loop active locomotion and providing the capsule with sensors and tools for diagnosis and therapy. We propose addressing a wide range of open chal- lenges about robotic endoscopic capsule in a dedicated workshop at IROS. Ranging from active locomotion mechanisms to sensing and therapeutic modules, the topics of interest will cover key aspects of smart robotic devices for gastrointestinal procedures. In the morn- ing, a keynote presentation is followed by three technical sessions: i) capsules and novel flexible endoscopic devices, ii) robotic locomotion for active endoscopic capsules and iii) sensing and therapeutic modules. To represent the current research trends, we design a combination of invited talks: invited speakers will include researchers with an engineering and medical background, but also industries.

It is also one of the central goals of the European projects KoroiBot and H2R as well as the DARPA robotics challenge. To improve humanoid walking it is crucial to identify the essential characteristics of human movement and transfer it to robots. Different geometries and inertial properties of the human and humanoid systems including different kinematic and dynamic constraints have to be taken into account in this transfer. The aim of this workshop is to present the different advantages of all these approaches as well as many promising works on combining them. Optimization or optimal control can be performed on robot and human models of different complexity taking different constraints into account, in both offline and online context. It is very useful for exploiting the physical lim- its of a system, but solutions might have to cope with model-reality mismatches which have to be addressed. Reinforcement learning can work without any model, iterating over reality, but in the contact of complex systems and motions that easily fail, it requires good starting data. Different types of movement primitives, such as kinematic or dynamic primitives (in different senses) provide a good approach to standardize motions taking into account con- straints. Neural primitives do not refer to the explicit motion but to the signal processing side of movement.

Designing and controlling robotic devices that can assist frail elderly people and generally people with mobility im- pairments constitutes an emerging research eld in robotics. Many challenging scientic and technological problems need to be addressed in order to build efcient and effective assistive robotic systems, including: (i) human motion tracking, action and intention recog- nition fusing multimodal sensorial data, (ii) analysing and modelling human behaviour in the context of physical and non-physical human-robot interaction, (iii) developing context-aware, human-centred robot control systems that can act both proactively and adaptively in order to optimally combine physical, sensorial and cognitive assistance modalities, (iv) fostering intuitive and natural human-robot communication ultimately achieving assistive robotic be- haviours that emulate the way a human carer would operate while taking into account social interaction and ethical constraints. This workshop aims to gather researchers covering different topics within this multi- disciplinary and challenging research eld. The objective is to provide a review of recent scientic and technological advancements in the eld, as well as to highlight novel applica- tion perspectives, both from a clinical and an industrial viewpoint, that may have a signicant societal impact in the near future.

The key to establishing effective rehabilitation techniques is to elucidate the mechanisms by which the brain adapts to changes in body functions. However, abnor- malities in somatognosia can occur even in diseases that do not cause motor dysfunction. This indicates that we create/maintain an internal representation of the body in the brain. Accordingly, interdisciplinary research to investigate the neural mechanisms of the body representation in the brain and its plasticity mechanism, and to apply these ndings to re- habilitation interventions is highly expected. This workshop aims to have an opportunity to bring together neuroscientists, clinicians and robotics researchers who are interested in the embodied-brain systems science and to discuss about related research topics and future direction in the eld. Speakers Jun Ota (U.

Sabattini, C. Secchi of Freiburg) Abstract Recent advances in multi-robot systems offer the potential to signicantly improve quality for manufacturing and other industrial applications. Advances in control systems, embedded processor, sensor, communication and networking technology in the last few decades, that have made individual autonomous systems more practical, have enabled the research on and the development of cooperative systems, where capabilities are expressed by the team rather than by a super-capable individual. This makes it possible to address challenges that are relevant for industrial applications, where typical operations often include complex tasks that require capabilities that are varied in both quantity and difculty, such as goods transportation, distributed assembly, and infrastructure inspection. This workshop aims at bringing together experts, both from the academia and from the industries, in the eld of cooperative vehicle and robotic systems exploited for solving real world industrial problems.

As an outcome, the workshop will attempt to create guidelines for future robot competitions and how those can be improved so that tangible results useful for future research and technological development can be extracted. The workshop will explore the synergies that will arise from robotic com- petitions for education, for the advance of modern robots and robotic technologies and/or to promote practical applications, such as rehabilitation, medical robotics, care of the elderly, search and rescue, factories of the future, etc. Presentations and round table discussions will focus on obstacles and challenges and the future direction of robot competitions. The workshop will also act as a platform for wider discussions and aims at establishing guidelines/recommendations for future robot competi- tions. 117Half Day Workshop MoWSAfternoon-20 Mo, 28 Sep, 14:00-18:00, A3 See and Touch: 1st Workshop on Multimodal Sensor-based Robot Control for HRI and Soft Manipulation http://www.lirmm.fr/IROS15_wk_Visio-haptic_control Andrea Cherubini (LIRMM, Universit\u00e9 Navarro-Alarcon (The Chinese Univ. of Hong Kong), Mario Prats (Google, Mountain View) Abstract Multimodal robot control is crucial in many applications. For instance, human-robot interac- tion often relies on force/tactile feedback to transmit the user intention to the robot. However, the robot should recognize the intention even without direct contact between the two. A pos- sible solution comes from visual data, which should then be combined with haptics to obtain the best result. The automatic manipulation of soft materials represents a second case study. For all these reasons, adaptive sensor-based methods directly linking perception to action, can provide better solutions in unpredictable scenarios, than traditional planning and model-based techniques, requiring a priori models of the environment.

Whether structured in an environment with managed software packages like ROS or by simply sharing code as ZIP le on the personal website of a researcher, the ability to push the boundaries of autonomous robots often depends on the availability of existing work to build on. Open source robotics is by now well established in ground robotics. As aerial robotics is moving from tackling relatively self-contained navigation tasks like the flight in GPS denied environments towards addressing dynamic scenes and more challenging dynamic obsta- cles, open source is equally important in this eld. This workshop is providing participants a solid overview of the current state of the art in aerial robotics research. It will also provide an overview of open source solutions ranging from SLAM packages for onboard companion computers to better motor controllers for multi- rotors. It will also give participants the opportunity to provide direct feedback on desired hardware and software features, and allow them to meet core developers of some popular ROS aerial robotics stacks and autopilots. 120Full Day Workshop FrWS-01 Fr, 02 Oct, 08:30-17:30, Hall 12 Task Planning for Intelligent Robots in Service and Manufacturing http://www6.in.tum.de/Main/WorkshopIros2015TaskPlanning Organizers Andre Gaschler (fortiss Gmbh & TUM), Ron Petrick (Univ. of Edinburgh), Esra Erdem (Sa- banc University) Abstract One of the main motivations for robot task planning is to allow intelligent robots to solve complex, real-world tasks in service and industry. While substantial progress has been made in recent years in developing many of the components needed for building such sys- tems\u2014symbolic reasoning, path planning, grasp planning, and trajectory generation\u2014and powerful algorithms for solving problems in individual areas are available, the general prob- lem of robot task planning nevertheless remains a challenge. One reason for this difculty is that realistic task planning problems require a hybrid search in the combined symbolic action and continuous motion spaces. Only recently has this problem started to receive substantial attention in the two distinct communities of symbolic AI planning and robot motion planning, which have started working on hybrid approaches aimed at solving hard, real-world tasks in service and manufacturing robotics. This workshop invites participants from symbolic plan- ning, robot motion planning, and related elds of research to share their ideas and ndings, and to foster cooperation towards the common scientic goal of intelligent robot systems.

Particularly, small and flexible instruments as well as needles are a promising alternative as those devices combine less trauma and high precision for diagnosis and treatment. Placing the probe or treatment device directly into the target tissue may result in superior focality and fewer side effects. However, the access via natural orices and cavities or through soft tissue is challenging, particularly as the properties of the tissue are patient specic and often not precisely known in advance. Typically, deformation and forces have to be considered dur- ing placement of the instrument. The workshop addresses a wide range of challenges when developing actuated flexible instruments for medical applications. Ranging from motion plan- ning to image guidance and navigation, the topics of interest cover key aspects of intelligent robotic systems. A keynote presentation will highlight the requirements from the medical per- spective, followed by a poster teaser session. Sessions on steerable flexible instruments, flexible robots, and navigation, sensing, and motion planning will each present an overview and recent research work in these areas. We encourage participants to discuss progress and challenges illustrated by the talks. A poster session will offer a platform to present recent novel work and work in progress.

In each case, the key contributor for the nal success was the willingness to learn from previous mistakes and to share the gained experience with the research community. The path to progress in the eld of robotics is not free of failures and caveats. These failures provide valuable lessons and insights on future approaches by analyzing errors and nding methods to avoid them. As such, the robotics community could benet from the experience of those who had faced and overcome similar failures before. The objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to share their personal experiences on their \"failure to success\" stories, to present what they have learnt, what others should avoid while experimenting in similar context, providing tips for better re- search practices and for creating more successful robots that meet people's expectations. In addition, well known speakers in robotics will be invited to the workshop to share their ex- periences, how they avoid failures, and their recommendations for creating more robust and successful robots. Finally, the panel session will provide the right environment for attendees to learn and discuss good practices in the robotics area to avoid failing to satisfy people's expectations around robots.

Petersen (Univ. of Southern Denmark) Abstract In the last decade, the number of robots used in industrial production has increased by approx. 10% per year. Also, industrial robot applications frequently exploit sensorial infor- mation, in particular vision and in quite some industrial robot installations, humans operate in the vicinity of the robot. In service robotics, new kinds of robots surface on the market, most of them with rather simple sensing and actuation. The two areas - industrial robotics and service robotics - differ in the sense, that robots in industrial production are used since the 1960s, while service robots are just now entering a newly formed market with large growth potential. As a consequence, the open problems as well as the next steps for development of industrial robots can be quite well formulated while the eld of commercial service robots just emerges, leaving space for fundamentally new ideas and products. The workshop 'Transfer of Cognitive Robotics Research to industrial Assembly and Service Robots' intends to reflect on the impact of cognitive robotic research on industrial applica- tions as well as service robotics by showing examples of successful transfer from research to application. This will allow for the analysis of the actual transfer process in both domains. In addition, today's needs of industry will be formulated by industrial partners as well as commercial potentials in the service robotic domain will be outlined.

The interaction places challenging requirements on the safety, robustness and adaptivity on robots. But what exactly are the safety requirements on such robots? And how can such requirements be formalized? How can compliance and force control be best exploited to enable physical interaction? Should we sacrice accurate tracking? Which forms of imitation learning should be used? And how can we associate the correct solution with a given task context? Finally, what are relevant and protable applications for physical human-robot collaboration? In which cases is it benecial over fully automated solutions? How can it facilitate customization of products in assembly lines? Can it also be used in medical applications? Can technologies for physical human-robot collaboration be extended to wearable robots and prosthetics? These and other questions will be addressed in lectures and an expert panel discussion. Speakers Sami Haddadin (Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover), Jae-Bok Song (Korea University), Sensorimotor Contingencies for Robotics http://www.iri.upc.edu/groups/perception/sensorimotorIROS15/ Organizers Ricardo T\u00e9llez (Spanish National Research Council), Guillem Aleny\u00e0 (Spanish National Re- search Council), Cecilio Angulo (Technical Univ. of Catalonia), Kevin O'Regan (National Center for Scientic Research, France) Abstract The sensorimotor approach to cognition states that the key to bring semantics to the world of a robot requires making the robot learn the relation between the actions that the robot performs and the change it experiences in its sensed data because of those actions. Those relations are called sensorimotor contingencies (SMC). The SMC approach breaks completely the classic sense-plan-act pipe that rules most of today's autonomous robots, by mixing sensation with action, aiming to bridge the gap be- tween symbolic data and semantics for robots. The goal is to build robots with a more robust behavior in real environments. This workshop aims to explore practical formalizations and computational models of the SMCs and their direct application to robot control and autonomy. Theoretical frameworks will also have their space on a relation of 1/3rd of the accepted papers.

Schoellig (Univ. of Toronto) Abstract Modern robots are expected to perform complex, unsafe, or difcult tasks. Planning and exe- cuting the motions required for these tasks is difcult due to factors such as high-dimensional conguration spaces and changing environmental conditions. Moreover, uncertainty in robot dynamics and environment makes it impossible to know ahead of time how to operate best. Recent success has been made through the integration of planning methods with tools from Machine Learning (ML). For example, clustering, reinforcement learning, and intelligent heuristics have adaptively solved planning problems in complex planning spaces, automat- ically identied appropriate trajectories for robots with complex dynamics, and reduced the amount of time required for planning motions. It is the goal of this workshop to explore methods and advancements afforded by the integra- tion of ML for the planning and execution of robot motion. Because these methods are often heuristic, issues such as safety and performance are critical. Also, learning-based questions such as problem learnability, knowledge transfer among robots, knowledge generalization, long-term autonomy, task formulation, demonstration, role of simulation, and methods for feature selection dene problem solvability. We will address these issues while discussing current and future directions for intelligent planning and execution of motions for robotics systems. Speakers Lucian Busoniu (Technical Univ. Workshop FrWS-08 Fr, 02 Oct, 08:45-18:30, Hall C2 2nd Workshop on the Role of Human Sensorimotor Control in Surgical Robotics www.bgu.ac.il/~nisky/Second_Motor_Control_RAMIS_workshop.htm Organizers Ilana Nisky (Ben-Gurion Univ. of the Negev), Anthony Jarc (Intuitive Surgical) Abstract Surgery is a highly complex sensorimotor task requiring surgeons to precisely control sur- gical instruments to operate on patients. In tele-operated robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), the surgeon manipulates a pair of master manipulators that control the movement of instruments that are inserted into the patient via small incisions. The design and control of RAMIS platforms may enhance the ability of the surgeon to perform a safe and effective surgery. A comprehensive understanding of surgeon sensorimotor behaviour is fundamental to continuing innovations and improvements of surgical robots. The tele- operative nature of RAMIS allows measurement of underlying surgeon behavior, and this research is resulting in new and exciting ndings that not only improve surgical robotics but also suggest a novel, applied, and real-life environment to study basic human sensorimotor control. In this workshop, we seek to foster a dialogue between researchers in the elds of: (1) computational modelling of neural control of behaviour, and motor learning; (2) human-robot interaction, tele-operation, and surgical robotics; and (3) surgical training and skill assessment. By bringing together researchers from these elds, we hope to gain insights on future directions to improve surgical robotics as well as to ad- vance our understanding of basic human behaviour.

Hollinger (Oregon State University) Abstract On-line decision making is an important part of robotic problems where mobile robots op- erate in unknown or partially known dynamic environments in order to acquire information about some studied phenomena. This problem can be found in the robotic problems like autonomous data collection, environment monitoring, and robotic exploration missions that can be generally considered as variants of robotic information gathering. The key aspect of these problems is that the overall mission performance can be evaluated after the mission is completed and efcient decision-making depends on local in-situ decisions made accord- ing to the information acquired during the mission. The main goal of the workshop is to discuss and share ideas and approaches related to the on-line (in-situ) decision-making to coordinate a team of mobile robots to full a global mission objective by individual actions performed by particular team members.

However, to deal with such operations, GPS based navigation is not sufcient. Small scale size vehicles have to fast and autonomously navigate in narrow outdoor and indoor environments, in cities or other dense environments and able to actively explore un- known areas while avoiding collisions and creating maps. This involves a number of per- ception and control challenges that still have to be solved. This workshop will address UAVs navigation solutions in GPS denied environments and the algorithmic and software design challenges that arise in the settings of small-scale, fast navigation in three-dimensional en- vironments. This full-day workshop at IROS '15 brings together researchers from academia and industry in the area of closed-loop control and navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles working in indoor and outdoor GPS-denied environments, using passive vision sensors as the main sensory modality. The convergence of the consumer electronics industry and the robotics industry has opened up opportunities and solutions that did not exist a few years ago. The interest in this area of research is large and, as such, we expect to have an heteroge- neours audience in terms of expertise and interests. While most previous workshops have attempted to address the fundamental problems of perception, control and communication for aerial vehicles, this workshop will instead focus on the systems challenges for small- scale, fast vehicles where the size, weight and payload constraints only allow light-weight sensors like cameras, and the operating conditions of high speeds require perception over longer ranges and shorter time scales. 130Full Day Workshop FrWS-11 Fr, 02 Oct, and Research Univ. of the Negev), Eldert van Henten (Wageningen University), Marcel Bergerman (Carnegie Mellon University) Abstract This IROS workshop focuses on the intersection between robotic systems and the agri- cultural sector, with emphasize on food production (agri-food robotics). One of the main challenges in this eld is to deal with the huge natural variability in agricultural products and environments, and the need for flexibility to perform different tasks. The main focus of this workshop will be on presenting and discussion scientic and applied research to ensure that robots are equipped with the robustness and flexibility to deal with the variability. The work- shop furthermore aims to give an overview of the state-of-the-art in the eld and to discuss future direction, as well as to increase awareness of the scientic and societal challenges among robotic researchers, engineers, and practitioners in general.

Exteroceptive perception is crucial for de- tecting foothold and handhold affordances in the environment, and generating agile motions accordingly. This workshop will provide a platform for researchers from perception and plan- ning in legged robotics to disseminate and exchange ideas, evaluating their advantages and drawbacks. This will include methods for detecting footholds and handholds on uneven and rough surfaces for legged robots including bipeds and quadrupeds. The goal is to show various ways from sensing the environment to nding contacts and planning the body and limb trajectories for achieving agile and robust locomotion. Speakers S. Chung, O.

Sea or extreme underwater environments can actually be compared to a near planet, where operation is prevented by hazardous or impractical environmental conditions and by range and communication limitations. Underwater robots have been developed following two main approaches: ROVs (remotely operated vehicles) and AUVs (autonomous underwater vehi- cles). To date however, usable solutions for extended operation in underwater conned and complex environments, subsea installations, cavities and caves are very limited. There is need of new robotic systems that are affordable, adaptive, versatile, efcient and suitable to a wide spectrum of uses. Promising bioinspired approaches are being adopted worldwide at research level, allowing high energy efciency in locomotion, robust multi-agent operation, advanced sensing and communication, adaptive behaviour. By taking inspiration from living marine organisms, bioinspired underwater robots adopt elegant solutions overcoming the limitations encountered by traditional engineering approaches, ranging from the exploitation of flexible bodies to the use of autonomous neuro-inspired control. Advanced prototypes are today reproducing the energy efciency, agility and adaptability of marine creatures, provid- ing effective and safe interaction with the environment. Speakers Rudolph Bannasch (EvoLogics Fr, 02 Oct, 08:30-17:30, Hall 8 2nd Workshop on Alternative Sensing for Robot Perception http://www.rit.edu/iros15workshop/ Organizers Thierry Peynot (QUT), Sildomar Monteiro (RIT), Teresa Vidal-Calleja (UTS), Peter Corke (QUT) Abstract Robotic perception based on conventional sensing (color cameras and LIDAR) has lead to signicant realizations in relatively restricted situations, while showing important limitations in challenging environments. The future of robotic perception lies in \"alternative sensing modalities\" and their intelligent combination and fusion. Examples of alternative sensing modalities include: radars, sonars and other acoustic sensors, cameras sensing outside of the visible spectrum (e.g. thermal cameras or hyperspectral/multispectral cameras), cam- eras using alternative acquisition processes (e.g. event-based or light-eld cameras), odor sensors, etc. Operating at distinct electromagnetic frequencies, or sensing other physical properties altogether, alternative sensors have recently opened many new possibilities for robotics, such as: automatic geological analysis using hyperspectral cameras, obstacle de- tection through smoke or heavy dust using mm-wave radar, or robotic deep-sea exploration with sonars. This workshop aims at exploring and discussing how alternative sensing and original combinations of sensor data induce new perspectives and challenges, which may re- quire rethinking conventional perception and data fusion algorithms, and how they will open new robotic applications and put the next great robotic achievements within reach. It follows up on a rst workshop held at the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2012 conference, and a special issue of the Journal of Field Robotics published in January 2015.

The sector experiences a paradigm shift from the tra- ditional heavy-duty robot operating separated from the human worker in a fenced area to robots that work close to the human, adapting to the movements of the human and possibly even interacting with them. The workshop will explore the potential, opportunities and risks of robots operating in a modern factory environment where human-robot interaction is used as a means to pave the path for accelerated manufacturing whilst reducing costs.

Soft robotics research is providing interesting achievements and there is a general opinion that it can nd application in several industrial sectors. Thus this workshop is extremely timely to help focus on the needs from industry and services, that may nd responses from soft robotics and to ll the gap between laboratory and industrial products. To this aim, invited speakers not only from academia but also from industry will present and discuss real world issues and possible applications where soft robotics can represent a game changer. The workshop is organized to be part of a series of scientic events planned in the framework of RoboSoft Coordination Action (EU funded project, under the FET open scheme, www.robosoftca.eu) aiming at advancing soft robotics and its marketing.

Luo (NTU) Abstract This workshop will focus on assistance and service robotics in a human environment in different contexts of human life. This major research issue will affect our lives in the near future. The integral assistance systems are robotic modules and technological aids in gen- eral for personal assistance, such as robots, mobile bases, electric wheelchairs, soft robot manipulator arm. They can support disabled and elderly people with special needs in their living environment. Assistive and Service Robotics covers a broad spectrum of research topics ranging from intelligent robots acting as a servant, secretary, or companion to in- telligent robotic functions such as autonomous wheelchair navigation, embedded robotics, ambient intelligence and smart spaces. Some international industrials already think that smart houses or smart buildings (with sensors, actuators and computer capabilities) can be already considered as \"static robots\". According to this vision, adding a mobile robot inside the house or the building could endow the whole system with \"mobility capabilities\". This workshop will focus on the assistance in terms of mobility, social interaction, as well as ev- eryday chores that are particularly relevant to the elderly. Topics related to social interaction, smart homes, mobility assistance, healthcare and wellbeing would be covered. Fundamen- tal and technological research, in particular, the one related to autonomous indoor vehicles, sensor and actuators networks, wearable and ubiquitous technologies, and human-robot interaction, will be addressed.

Workshop FrWS-18 Fr, 02 Oct, 08:30-18:30, Hall B2 Social Norms in Robotics and HRI http://www.spencer.eu/irosws.html Organizers Kai O. Arras (Univ. of Abstract While robots are increasingly good at solving the basic tasks of perception, navigation, and planning, designing interactive and collaborative human-robot behavior is becoming a key factor for the success of robots in human environments. Research in robotics, cognitive science and human-robot interaction (HRI) has typically focussed on the understanding and modeling of individual or pair-wise human-human or human-robot behavior. Social norms, the customary rules that govern behavior in groups, provide an extensively studied frame- work from the social sciences to represent socially compliant or noncompliant behavior. En- abling robots to understand these concepts is highly relevant for the design of effective and self-improving interactive and collaborative behavior. Ultimately, the workshop is driven by the prospect that the two goals of social compliance (subjective behavior goals) and task ef- ciency (objective behavior goals) are not mutually contradictory but actually belong together for robots to be successful in human environments. Example tasks that involve socially normative constraints include perception and analysis of groups of people, multi-party human-robot interaction, navigation through crowds adher- ing to pedestrian/car trafc rules, or planning joint actions towards shared goals (see also Topics). The workshop is coorganized by researchers of the FP7-project SPENCER, \"Social situa- tionaware perception and action for cognitive robots\". We will have a project-internal review process to identify the most relevant research activities within SPENCER to be presented in the workshop. Two slots are reserved for this purpose, marked as \"SPENCER talk\". Speakers Takayuki Kanda (ATR, Osaka), Bill Smart (Oregon State University), Greg Trafton (Naval Research Laboratory), Julie A.

Currently, with respect to the design and computa- tional modeling of articial cognitive systems, selective attention has again become a focus of research, and one sees it important for the organization of behaviors, for control and in- terfacing between sensory and cognitive information processing, and for the understanding of individual and social cognition in humanoid artifacts. While visual cognition obviously plays a central role in human perception, ndings from neuroscience and cognitive psy- chology have informed us on the perception-action nature of cognition. In particular, the embodiment in sensory-motor intelligence requires a continuous spatio-temporal interplay between interpretations from various perceptual modalities and the corresponding control of motor activities. In addition, the process of selecting information from the incoming sensory stream, in tune with contextual processing on a current task and global goals, becomes a challenging control issue within the viewpoint of focused attention. Seemingly attention sys- tems must operate at many levels and not only at interfaces between a bottom-up driven world interpretation and top-down driven information selection. 139Half Day Tutorial FrWSMorning-20 Fr, 02 Oct, 08:30-12:30, Hall 7 TRS 2015: An Open-source Recipe for Teaching (and Learning) Robotics with a Simulator Setup a Laptop in 5 Minutes, Write a Control, Navigation, Vision or Manipulation Program in 100 Lines of Code http://teaching-robotics.org/trs-iros2015/ Organizers Renaud Detry (Univ. of Liege), of Technology), Marc Andreas Freese (Coppelia Robotics) Abstract This tutorial presents a cross-platform robot development and simulation environment that can be installed in ve minutes and that allows students to write control, navigation, vision or manipulation algorithms in a hundred lines of Matlab or Python code. The tutorial relies on the V-REP robot simulator, and on the Matlab Robotics Toolbox (RTB). The key feature of this combination is its ease of use - both tools are trivial to install. The tutorial is intended for teachers and students. Students will install the simulation environment on their laptop and learn everything they need to know to start implementing and testing robot algorithms. Teachers will return home with a ready-to-use recipe for organizing a master-level robotics project. This event follows our successful tutorial at IROS 2014. In this instance, we will focus on providing hands-on experience to the audience with an hour-long practice session. This event follows our successful tutorial at IROS 2014.

Both of them are actively investigated robotics. In the emerging discipline of neurorobotics, the focus is on a close correspondence to ex- perimental ndings from neuroscience. In contrast, other approaches like deep learning techniques build on the theory of classical articial neural networks but apply it at larger scales or to novel network architectures. This workshop highlights advances in biologically inspired brain-like cognition and control for robotics by bringing together experts from the elds of neurorobotics, articial neural networks and machine learning, making it a must- attend event for everyone interested in a fresh view on cognitive robotics. Speakers Joni Dambre (Ghent osinski (Cornell University) 141Half Day Workshop FrWSMorning-22 Fr, 02 Oct, 08:30-12:30, Hall A1 Grounding Robot Autonomy: Emotional and Social Interaction in Robot Behaviour http://cognitionreversed.com/iros-emotion-workshop/ Organizers Robert Lowe (Univ. of Sk\u00f6vde), Emilia Broekens (Univ. of Delft) Abstract The aim of this workshop is to capture emerging trends and common problems related to the interaction autonomy of social robots. In the past, issues related to the constitutive au- tonomy of social robots have focused on safe interaction with the environment, and with humans. Today, we see a shift towards social robots that act in human environments and to a larger degree need to act in relation to social and emotional aspects. A nursing robot must not only interact safely with its environment, it should act in a way that communicates care and respect for patients, and that supports the social bounds necessary for the task. Such autonomous aspects have application to educational, companion and personal assistant human-robot interaction scenarios. Furthermore, many social signals should be embedded in the functional behaviors of robots, not added to the behavioral repertoire as specic ges- tures. Finally, the interpretation of social signals coming from humans should be integrated with the current robot behavior controller, and depending on the type of controller this is, thus, a different process. So far, robots work with what could be called \"perceived\" emotions and social abilities, i.e., additions to their instrumental abilities. This focus of this workshop is instead the following question: How can emotion and social interaction be grounded in the behavioral repertoire of the robotic system? This includes sub questions such as: Is the robot able to have intrinsic emotions? How could emotions, grounded in the embodiment of the robot, provide socially adaptive behavior to the robot? How can the communication of emotions between a robot and a human be grounded? The workshop welcomes conceptual papers and convincing applications, as well as concrete methods and algorithms relevant for the topic.

Daun, J. Kim, R. Jung (ROBOTIS) Abstract Over the past few years the kid sized open humanoid-robot-platform DARwIn OP has been successfully used for research and education. So far, the computational power limited the range of applications. The newly released successor ROBOTIS OP2 is a new platform manufactured by ROBOTIS. With additional computational power it enables the robot to run more complex code on-board in real-time, for instance in the elds of computer vision or motion planning. To allow an easy exchange of software features and to encourage collaboration ROBOTIS is working on the support of the Robot Operating System (ROS), which provides an integration of several popular libraries as MoveIt, OpenCV or the physics simulator Gazebo. Currently, an interface for the kid size humanoid ROBOTIS OP2 and the full size humanoid THOR-MANG are under development. The interface for THOR-MANG will be used by Team ROBOTIS at the DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals. In the rst half of the tutorial, we give an overview on the current ROBOTIS ROS environment for the OP2. First, we describe the hardware of the OP2 and give a short introduction to ROS. Afterwards, we explain the usage of ROS and the simulator Gazebo with the OP2. In the second half participants will have the opportunity to apply the new knowledge and work on a small ROS- based project with the ROBOTIS OP2. Speakers K. Daun, R.

The nonlinear flight phase controller accounts for state and input contraints. An additional nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) scheme is superposed to coordinate the hopping cycles and to maximize the hopping speed. The MPC can be designed with a simple nonlinear optimization algorithm, as the constraints are already accounted for by the cascaded controller. Simulation results for a nonlinear dynamical model of the Festo BionicKangaroo show the working principle of the bi-level predictive control scheme.
