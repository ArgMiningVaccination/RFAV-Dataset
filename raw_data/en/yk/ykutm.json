Amongst the many talented pioneers, Judith Swack stands out as making a unique and profound contribution. With a background in biological science and many papers in prestigious journals, she brings the fresh and disciplined stance of a true investigator. In her Healing from the Body Level Up [HBLU], Judith asks fundamental questions and ventures into areas where few others are willing to go - discovering and resolving factors that can profoundly limit a person's freedom to fulfil their potential. She is passionate and steadfast in her work of exploration and healing, dedicated to her mission of passing on her knowledge and skills. Sometimes imitated and copied, contact with Judith will reveal that she is truly the 'real deal'. She, and her work, are astonishing!\" Phil Mollon, President of ACEP \"Of the many workshops I have attended, none has compared with Judith Swack's for sheer intellectual excitement, psychotherapeutic innovativeness, and practical effectiveness. This workshop opens new and important territory.\" Nathaniel Branden, Ph.D., psychologist, Author of The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem \"Six weeks after taking the HBLU I training, my client load and income doubled without any different marketing effort on my part. I now have a waiting list of people who would like to work with me. Instead of having a handful of 'breakthrough', miracle sessions each year, I have that many each day.\" Amy St. Hilaire, LMFT \"My experience at the recent HBLU training was extremely valuable for me.
