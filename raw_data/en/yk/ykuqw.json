Specifically, the Cannabidiol Board modified and recommended the addition of severe, intractable pediatric autism with self- injurious or aggressive behavior. This recommendation, submitted to the Iowa Board of Medicine, was made based upon a petition involving a child with ASD. As the Cannabidiol Board noted in its order, \"ASD refers to a group of complex neurodevelopment[all disorders characterized by repetitive and characteristic patterns of behavior and difficulties with social communication and interaction.\" Because of \"the wide range of symptoms, skills, and levels of disability in function\" that occur in persons with ASD and the potential negative effects the use of medical cannabidiol may have on the developing young brain, the Cannabidiol Board felt it important to limit the use of medical cannabidiol to those children with severe autistic symptoms included self-injurious or aggressive behaviors. Thus, the recommendation to the Iowa Board of Medicine was limited to children with severe autism. 'Sarah E. Fitzpatrick et.al, Aggression in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Presentation and Treatment Options, Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment (Dove Medical Press Ltd., June 23, 2016), https://www.ncblrilm.nth.govipmciarticies/PMC4922773/. 1 At the December 13 and 14 meeting of the Board of Medicine, that Board voted to notice rules which would add severe, intractable pediatric autism with self-injurious or aggressive behavior to the list of debilitating medical conditions approved for the use of medical cannabidiol. I am the mother of a 28-year-old . young man with severe autism with self- injurious and aggressive behaviors. When I learned in January that the recommendation specified pediatric autism, I contacted the Cannabidiol Board and the Board of Medicine to inquiry as to the recommendation's applicability to adults with autism. I attended the February 1, 2019 Cannabidiol Board meeting and the February 5, 2019 Board of Medicine meeting. I also submitted a letter to the Board of Medicine requesting an amendment to the proposed rulemakin.g to remove the word \"pediatric\" and make it all ages. The essence of that letter is contained in this petition. At both meetings, board members were supportive of my request, However, the Board of Medicine explained it was unable to modify the recommendation at this juncture and encouraged me to submit a petition to the Cannabidiol Board to add \"severe, intractable autism with self-injurious or aggressive behaviors, all ages\" to the list of debilitating medical conditions for which medical cannabidiol would be allowed. As I previously stated, my adult son, , has severe autism with self- injurious and aggressive behaviors. These behaviors began to develop when was an adolescent, though his diagnosis of autism and severe intellectual disability was made when he was three years old. Many treatments, including psychiatric medications, were tried, most with limited benefit and several with serious side effects including facial tics and constant tremors.2 In total, has been treated with in excess of twenty psychiatric drugs, including the only two drugs actually approved for the treatment of autism in children, Risperdal 2See Lauren Gravitz, Autism's Drug Problem, Autism Review, Pharmacy and Therapeutics (June 2015) [hereinafter LeClerc], https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4450669/ (discussing approved and off-label pharmacotherapeutic options for the various symptoms of ASD and their potential benefits and side effects); Jeremy Kossen, Blog, How Does Cannabis Consumption Affect Autism?, Leafy (May 19, 2016) [hereinafter Kossenj (noting that numerous \"experimental\" and \"off-label\" drugs that carry their own risks are used for persons with autism). When on Risperdal, Jared developed tics, tongue thrusting, grimacing, and uncontrolled body movements. Though the symptoms have lessened, he continues to have facial tics and possibly some uncontrolled body movements. 2 and Abilify.3 Diets and supplements were also explored with no significant improvement. He was seen at the University of Iowa Centers for Disability several times for recommendations. More and different medications were tried. When he was in his late teens and early twenties his behaviors were so extreme, including running and throwing himself at windows, that he was hospitalized in the psychiatric department at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for ten days. Despite multiple medication adjustments, he did not improve. Shortly before his 21st birthday, we made the difficult decision for his admittance to the Woodward Resource Center in Woodward, Iowa. has resided at the Resource Center since that time. Since admission, the number of serious psychiatric medications he takes has been reduced in number; however, he still receives at least three psychotropic drugs daily.4 And he continues to engage in self-injurious and aggressive behaviors. Some of the self-injurious behaviors my son engages in on a regular if not daily basis include hitting himself, especially about the ears and face; biting and slapping himself; dropping to the floor with force that he has damaged his skin and joints; and running into walls and objects. Hitting himself about the ears has resulted in damage to the outer cartilage of both ears, and he has what is sometime referred to as \"cauliflower or wrestler's\" ears. also bites objects and clenches his jaw very tightly when he is agitated. On occasion, he has chipped his teeth. Last year, he had a molar extracted at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for what they believed was an infected tooth. It was thought that the tooth may have become infected as a result of a cracked tooth. It is also believed that he may suffer from TMJ, though it has been difficult to confirm this diagnosis because he is essentially nonverbal and uncooperative with testing. He takes Aleve and Tylenol daily because it is felt that he is experiencing pain. This necessitates the use of Prevacid and Ranitidine to prevent GI issues secondary to the NSAID use. 3Gravitz, supra (\"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved only two drugs for children and adolescents with autism: risperidone [Risperdal) and aripiprazole (Ability), both atypical antipsychotics prescribed for behaviors associated with irritability, such as aggression, tantrums and self-harm.\"). Some of the drugs that Jared has been currently on Celexa, Depakote, Namenda, and Lithium. At bedtime he takes Ambien. 3 The aggressive behaviors that he engages in include hitting, slapping, kicking and pushing others. Sometimes these actions appear undirected; is just trying to get away and someone is in his path. Other times, he appears to be releasing whatever pain or frustration he is having on those near him. He also engages in destructive behaviors that involve damaging furniture, including his bed; damaging his walls; throwing objects; and chewing and tearing his clothing. As a result, bedroom walls are padded, and he has a soft helmet that is offered to him or applied whenever he is experiencing extreme agitation. His severe communication and social deficits make it very difficult to determine what triggers his self-injurious behaviors and aggression. One minute he will be calm and the next he will be beating himself about his ears and face, jumping up and down, and flinging himself about the room. is 6' 4\" tall and his weight fluctuates between 170 and 190 lbs. When he is agitated, he is often very difficult to control and his safety and the safety of those around him can be at risk. Assessments made at the Resource Center suggest that his outbursts \"are maintained by a combination of social variables, fpjrimarily pain and secondarily by escape.\" As will be discussed under #3 of this application, scientific literature suggests that persons with autism suffer from immune system dysfunction and accompanying inflammatory conditions which may account for pain which results in symptomology in the form of self-injurious behaviors, emotional outbursts, destructive behaviors, and aggression. 5 Since has been sThe literature also suggests that medical cannabidiol may be beneficial in treating some of the other conditions/symptoms autistic persons are prone to including anxiety, insomnia, and gastrointestinal problems.

Often the monthly occurrences of these behaviors are in the hundreds. At times, the data will reflect a decrease over a period of months only to have a subsequent sudden resurgence for unknown reasons. Clearly, the pharmacological options that have been tried with have not been altogether successful and are not without great cost themselves to his physical well-being. I could provide dozens of anecdotal stories of self-injurious behavior and even some pictures of the injuries he has inflicted upon himself,6 However, I want to respect privacy as much as I can. Therefore, I am including in this application a sampling of his past school reports, medical records and evaluations, and monthly reports from the Resource Center that establish the behaviors which I have described. I ask the Boards not to make his name public. I also understand that the clinical research regarding the therapeutic benefits of cannabidiol in general, and with autism in particular, is limited, in part due to the Schedule I status given to cannabis. 7 And the research involving autistic adults is even less.8 However, there is some scientific data or evidence and many anecdotal reports suggesting medical cannabidiol may be therapeutically beneficial to persons with severe autism.9 When an exhaustive 6That you might understand how severe his behaviors can be, there was one incident where he banged his head with such force that he caused a laceration about 1\" long which needed stitches. Because he was unable to cooperate with that medical procedure at the Resource Center, he was taken to the ER and medical glue was used. Glue only works so well, and Jared repeatedly reopened this wound. It eventually healed after about a year.

I would ask the Medical Cannabidiol Board to recommend removing the pediatric restriction and adding \"severe, intractable autism with self-injurious or aggressive behaviors, all ages\" to the list of debilitating medical conditions for which individuals would be eligible to receive a medical cannabidiol registration card.

Wait approximately 10 minutes and offer the soft helmet again if he has not calmed. Repeat this offer for a total of three times. If the helmet is refused a third time wait a period of about 15 to 30 minutes needs to occur before re-prompting or he reaches for the helmet or has calmed, is to wear the helmet for no longer than 110 minutes without it being removed for 10 minutes. If ask for food during the NOC shift attempt to distract him and encourage him to watch a movie, listen to musicror sleep;. If ask for food two additional times provide him a drink and each time thereafter. Encourage to get on and off the bus before anyone who does so slowly (due to him moving at a fast pace which can result in him pushing past others). There are times likes to take naps during the day.

Looking into purchasing more indestructible mattress to prevent I from being able to destroy. FADING PLAN\u2014 Wher has not destroyed any of his mattresses or bed frames for 12 consecutive months the IDT will consider discontinuing this restriction. oRisk: OTHER: Soft Helmet to help _t calm and reduce potential injuries due to self-injurious behavior. Anytime ' is engaging in precursor behaviors or is engaging in SIB offer him his soft helmet to wear. Anytime he refuses to wear the helmet, e.g., takes it off, allow him to do so. This looks unusual when compared to community standards but does not impede with his activities of daily living. The helmet can protect from harm and considered low risk. - Justification: Anytime is engaging in precursor behaviors or is engaging in SIB offer him his soft helmet to wear. Anytime he refuses to wear the helmet, e.g., takes it off, allow him to do so. On 10/21/14 - doctor gave an order for him to wear a soft-non locking helmet while he healed from head injuries that resulted from SIB (banging his head on surfaces). , could remove the helmet if he chose to do so but staff observed that he willingly wore the helmet' on most occasions and it seemed to help him calm. Therefore the use of the soft helmet as proposed will serve a dual purpose. It will protect : from injury when he actually engages in self-injurious behavior but it should also meet a sensory need that helps him calm. He is learning to wear the helmet to meet his sensory needs through a SEN ILP. FADING PLAN: When has went six consecutive months without requiring medical treatment for a head injury caused by SIB the IDT will consider discontinuing the soft helmet and trying to find a substitute such as a hat or cap. oPsychobropie Medications - See attached addendum. Justification: Psychotropie Medications \u2014Please see the attached Medication table, graph, and psychiatric and medical reports and or notes. There has been a med change and a med reduction this past year. 13 Less Restrictive Measures Tried or Considered: i is learning to accept a variety of sensory activities. He appears to like limited sensory items but seems to become -overstimulated in his environment at times and becomes agitated. By introducing him to other sensory items that he might enjoy, he will have a better variety of items available and may be better able to engage in activities that will help him tolerate overstimulating environments. oTolerate and accept transitions oTo keep room organized and clean OComplete a variety of activities throughout his day OMassage therapy appointments weekly.

D,0.13,: WOOD WARD RESOURCE HISTORY: . is a 26-year-o1d male. - was admitted to Woodward Resource Center On February 6, 2012, Records indicate that _ was originally diagnosed with autism at the age of 3. Starting in approximately November of 2010, - . began to have more challenges with agitated and aggressive behaviors. By March of 2011 his behaviors progressively had become more out of control culminating in an incident during which he bit his parents. After this incident he ended up being psychiatrically hospitalized at the University of Iowa. After hospitalization due to the severity of his ongoing symptoms, became more difficult to manage in an outpatient setting. This prompted his eventual admission to Woodward Resource Center. Primary documented psychiatric diagnoses at this time include autism spectrum disorder and severe intellectual disability,. He also has a history of insomnia but his sleep has improved since starting treatment with Ambien. Challenging behaviors over the years have included significant aggression and SIBS. Previous psychotropic medication trials have included naltrexone and Inderal. PSYCHOLOGY DATA/TEAM OBSERVATIONS: There was a slight upward trend in some of his behaviors during the spring of 2017. Team feels some of this may have been related to environmental stressors. On a positive note during this month of June so far, his behaviors appear to be improving. RECENT LAB RESULTS AND H PALM CONCERNS: From collection date of June 12, 2017, Depakote level 61.4, liver enzymes normal, platelet count 202,000, sodium level was normal at 140. There have been no recent acute health concerns of significance. CURRENT PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS: Celexa 20 mg daily, Depakote 1000 mg h.S., Namenda 10 mg b.i.d. DRUG ALLERGYES: No known 'drug allergies, but historically it is noted that he may have had a paradoxical reaction to lorazepam in the past and he has responded poorly to certain types of psychotropic medications, such as several prescribing antipsychotic medications that have been used before. Finally, I am also told that he did not respond very well to trazo done in the past. SIDE EFFECT RATING SCALES: On May 3, 2017, he scored 10 on a MOSES assessittent PSYCE101.ROPIC MEDICATION CHANGES MADE WITHIN 1JJJ PAST YEAR: Treatment with BuSpar was discontinued on December 15, 2016. Treatment -with melatonin was also discontinued during the month of December 2016. Treatment with two new medications, Ambien, and Namenda, was initiated during the month of December 2016. Overall, has generally done better since the aforementioned medication changes were made. MENTAL STATUS EXAM: During the appointment, was seated at the table accompanied by treatment . team members. He was chewing on a bib and fidgety in his chair, ' is unable to directly answer many questions. He did say some of his usual phrases, such as repeating the two words \"right now\". Alsb he did make many- of his typical voCalization, seemed to get bored with the appointment after -a while and then stood up with staff to walk around the room. Mood varies, affect relatively calm at the day of appointment. No NAME: _ D.O.B.: WOOD WARD RESOURCE , obvious signs of overt psychosis. He is alert, not lethargic. At the time of the appointment, there were no immediate indicators of risk towards harm himself or others. DIAGNOSES: 1, Insomnia by history, now. well-controlled. 2.Autism spectrum Medication. None. 3, Psychotropic Polypharmacy. It is acknowledged that is being treated with the psychotropic polypharmacy regimen. Over a long-term basis, it is our goal to eventually get him down to the least amount of psychotropic medications that have been felt to be clinically necessary. 4.Intraclass Polypharmag. None. 5.Psychotropic Medication Reduction Status. Most recent reduction was the discontinuation of treatment -with BuSpar on December 15, 2016. 6.Psychiatric Follow Up. 1 will continue to see for ongoing psychiatric follow up. 7.Medical Follow Up. will continue to receive general medical care under the direction of Priya Philip, Physician's Assistant. 8.BSP When talking about the Behavioral Support Plan, I was told that some positive programming changes may be in the works. 9.Psychotropic Medication. Plan. Potential risks and benefits of psychotropic medications have again been carefully reviewed, had a rough spring of 2017, but things recently seem to be turning for the better. All things considered now is not considered to be the appropriate time to make a medication change of any type. Matt Horvath, D.O. Graph Name: ID* . .

However, all increased in the latter half of the month and by the end of the month all rates had increased.. In January rates of all target behaviors substantially decreased indicating that recent programmatic interventions were effective, butin February rates of all target behaviors increased, especially SIB. The IDT discussed this today and feel that it is a problem with consistent program implementation. Retraining will be done and program monitoring will be increased to enhance the effectiveness of the aforementioned programmatic changes.

The IDT met on 6/20/16 to discuss programmatic adjustments that might be helpful and concluded that rather than altering his programming it is best to retrain the procedures and make sure that all supplies are available to ensure consistency. After the current procedures were implemented in November of 2015 Page 6 of 10 Comprehensive Psychological Assessment responded well but because of drift resulting from staff turnover and similar environmental issues there has been regression. Should this prove unsuccessful the IDT will consider consulting with the psychiatrist to explore psychotropic medication adjustments. 7120116- BSP was modified to include procedures in the \"Do This to Avoid Problems\" section pertaining to traveling in a vehicle to prevent. becoming aggressive towards others in the vehicle. 8/2116 \u2014 was seen by Dr. Horvath for his annual psychiatric appointment and because of the upward trend in all of _3target behaviors despite several program modifications and retraining Dr. Horvath decided to increase his Depakote dosage to 2500 mg. from 2000 mg. B Diagnostic Assessments: The following Intellectual and Adaptive assessment information was provided by Duane Dolphin, Licensed Psychologist. Intellectual assessment was conducted at parents' house on February 2, 2012, Intellectual functioning: On the Stanford-Binet intelligence Scale \u2014 Fifth Edition, attained a Full Scale IQ score of approximately 40. He was only able to correctly complete a few of the testing tasks. He did not spontaneously name pictures and/or objects shown him, but said \"bird\", when shown the object and prompted by his father to say the word. When shown the figure of a cat, he again said \"bird\", ' tends to repeat or echo back what is said to him, but usually only the last word. He did show the ability to discriminate and match colors and objects. was able to place a circle, square and triangle into a form board, but was less apt to try to complete the task when shapes where in smaller component pieces. 'did not respond to the request to count, but tended to repeat some numbers when prompted to do so. Adaptive functioning: The AAIDD Adaptive Behavior Scale \u2014 Residential and Community: Second Edition (ABS-RC:2) was completed by means of interview with ; parents and review of previous records. The ABS-RC:2 assessed adaptive skills across ten different areas. Those areas included Independent Functioning, Physical Development, Economic Activity, Language Development, Numbers and Time, Domestic Activity, PrevocationalNocational Activity, Self-Direction, Responsibility and Socialization. attained Age Equivalent scores ranging from 3-years to 4-years on most domains, with the exception of his relatively higher score of 9-years on the Physical Development domain. He demonstrated significant limitation across all adaptive behavior domains. attained an overall Age-Equivalent score of 4-years-1-month, which translates into adaptive functioning within the Severe range of Mental Retardation/Intellectual Disability. Overall results of this assessment would indicate that intellectually, does function significantly below what would be expected of peers his age. He also demonstrates significant limitations in all adaptive behavior skill areas. does meet the essential criteria for a diagnosis of mental retardation according to DSM-IV guidelines. Results of this assessment would indicate intellectual Page 7 of 10 Comprehensive Psychological Assessment functioning within the Severe range of intellectual disability, currently demonstrates Severe deficits in adaptive behavior functioning. He will continue to require and benefit from extensive supports, services and supervision in all important life-skill areas. Previous records indicate that (13 years old) was administered an intellectual assessment on February 16, 2004. He was assessed through the use of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition and a brief Adaptive Functioning Checklist. The results of that assessment placed intellectual abilities in the Severe Mental Retardation (318.1) range. A DASH-II (Diagnostic Assessment for the Severely Handicapped) was completed with the following results: date Impulse Organic Arodety Mood The results are outlined in the table, below: lmtability Lethargy ::Stereotypy :: Hyperactivity Inappropnate Speech .-:peedii ; :TOW 1/11/13 21 18 13 37 12 101 11/27/13 25 6 6 34 5 76 11/3/14 23 20 10 30 5 88 9/15/15 19 16 6 17 4 62 8/12/16 19 18 10 17 4 68 II Preference Assessment: A Reinforcer Assessment for Individuals with Severe Disabilities (RAISD) completed on 8/12/16 and the following items and activities were identified as potential reinforcers: TV and Disney movies (Bambi, Winnie the Pooh, Little Mermaid); music (KIOA station, Candle in the Wind, Little Mermaid songs) ' Youtube and computer game. Food (pasta, Ramen noodles, peas, fish sticks, chips, bread and butter, peanut butter sandwiches, cereal, crackers, vanilla wafers, sweets, cake, Chinese food, tacos with sour cream, lettuce, Cheetos, Doritos) and milk. Foot rubs, being tickled, showers; stuffed animals (Winnie the Pooh, bunny); CD player, playing his keyboard; and going for van rides. He also seems to show some positive response to verbal praise (perhaps repeating some of his favorite phrases to him), pats on the back, hugs, clapping, pats on the back and especially shoulder and head rubs. He also now seems to enjoy occasionally looking at magazines, short walks, swinging for short periods of time and short van rides.

Transition Times and problems with his daily routine. o assessment results tend to suggest that his emotional outbursts and aggression are maintained by a combination of social variables. Primarily physical pain and secondarily by escape. Hence, his programming will attempt to provide him more structure to his schedule and environment and improve his ability to communicate his wants and needs in an attempt to decrease the need for him to use emotional outbursts and aggression to escape unwanted or unexpected situations or to gain access to preferred items. He is also being closely monitored for symptoms of pain and analgesics are being prescribed as needed. The 1DT has also been providing access to sensory items such as his vest, deep pressure and massage as a way of meeting his sensory needs and this appears to be helpful when implemented consistently. Contextual variables that were identified in the past to always precede target behaviors Ongoing difficulty communicating wants or needs Too many people around the person. Inability to leave a setting. Location associated with negative interactions Failed to have his or her requests met. Favorite activity ends. Medical appointments or medical settings (having to wait for more than a few minutes for a medical appointment). Page 9 of 10 Comprehensive Psychological Assessment , Maintenance, generalization, and planning for the future: 's socially maintained target behaviors will be addressed through improving his ability to communicate his wants and needs and improving his ability to understand and participate in his daily routines. Structured teaching techniques are used in the development of his programming for his daily schedule/routine, The IDT is providing access to sensory items such as his vest, compression wear, deep pressure and massage as a way of meeting, sensory needs. This appears to be helpful when implemented consistently and should be continued. The IDT and WRC psychiatrist continue to assess and adjust psychotropic medication regimen to best meet his needs. His current regimen of Celexa, Depakote, Melatonin and Buspar appear to be reasonably effective and have not been substantially modified over the past year while programmatic interventions have been made. In early August his dosage of Depakote was increased. Pain management is an important component of plan of care and he is currently receiving a dosage of Naproxen for this, The IDT should continue to monitor his pain symptoms closely and adjust his medications accordingly. has a history of disrupted sleep patterns that may affect his behavior and he currently receives a dosage of Melatonin as a sleep aid. Over the last three months has experienced fewer average hours of sleep per night and this should be closely monitored and assessed further If it persists.

His mother, who is also his legal guardian, told me that\" was oidgnoao as being autistic wnett re was 3. He speak a few words', but the main mode of communication is nonverbal (through pictures, writing words, etc), Since last November, he has been having more frequent episodes of agitation, has trouble going to school. Last night, he started hitting himself, was slamming the furniture in his room\". Last night he charged at his parents and hit them. Parents were able to calm him down, took him to the ETC of an outside hospital, where he got agitated again (was given 16 mg IV Haldol, Ativan and propofol). Was accepted for transfer to a hospital. The patient was brought to the UIHC ETC in an ambulance. Morning labs were done in the ETC, the patient was felt to be medically stable for transfer to 1 JP West, Parents deny any recent changes in his schedule, home environment, or caregivers that could have triggered these behaviors. Mother denied a history of suicidal thoughts.

Additionally, researchers studying brains affected by ASD found a common pattern: widespread activation of brain immune cells that produce inflammation.' Chronic inflammation in the brain has been shown to lead to encephalitis\u2014an acute inflammation (swelling) of the brain usually resulting from either a viral infection or due to the body's own immune system mistakenly attacking brain tissue.2 Additionally chronic inflammation in the digestive tract is a known factor behind many of the challenging GI disorders ASD patients may experience .3 In making the argument that medical cannabis could benefit persons with ASD, the petitioner provided the following summary on the medical research thus far. Clinical research regarding the therapeutic benefits of cannabis has been almost nonexistent in the United States since cannabis was given Schedule I status in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Despite this challenging research environment, some research has been or is being conducted demonstrating the positive iSimone Gupta, et al., Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Dysregulation of Innate Immune Response Genes and Neuronal Activity-Dependent Genes in Autism, Nature Communications (Dec. 2004), https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6748. 2Janet K.

Research-Supported Symptoms Improvements In 2013, a study4 published in the journal Neuron revealed that autism-related mutations in mice resulted in \"deficits in endocannabidoid signaling.\" The study concluded that \"alterations in endocannabinoid signaling may contribute to autism pathophysiology.\" Also in 2013, researchers at Stanford University found that the symptoms of autism are caused by a mutation in the neurologin-3 gene that both blocks the body's natural production of endocannabin.oids and also interferes with the way cannabinoids communicate with the brain, Cannabinoids in cannabis interact with the body's endocannabinoid system and act not only to regulate emotion and focus but also serve as a neuroprotectant preventing further degradation of brain cells.5 Researchers at the University of Irvine in California believe they have also discovered a link between endocannabinoids and ASD, concluding that \"increasing natural marijuana-like chemicals in the brain can help correct behavioral issues related to Fragile X syndrome, the most common known genetic cause of autism.\"6 Yet another study7 from 2013 that was published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders revealed a link between the endocannabinoid system and immune cells in children with autism. Because immune dysfunction is a factor that 47Csaba Faldy, et. al, Autism-Associated Neuroligin-3 Mutations Commonly Disrupt Tonic Endocannablnoid Signaling, Neuron (May 8, 2013), https://www.ncbi.nimmih.gov/pubmed/23585028, 5E, de Lego J. 6Boosting Marijuana-Like Chemical Treats Fragile Symptoms, https://news.uci.edu/press-releases/boosting-natural-ma rij symptoms! o, 711 Siniscalco, et,al, Cannabinold Receptor Type 2, But Not Type 1, is Up-regulated in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Children Affected By Autistic Disorders, Journal Autism Developmental Disorder (Nov. 2013)[hereinafter Siniscalco], https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23585028, 2 contributes to autism, the condition is believed to be linked to higher levels of CB2 receptors in cells (CB1 receptors, on the contrary, were not overexpressed). CB2 receptors play a significant role in regulation of the immune system. Because problems with the immune system are so closely related to autism, the authors of the study concluded that the use of cannabinoids and therapies that target CB2 receptors might be helpful for those who suffer from ASD. As already addressed in my letter to the Cannabidiol Board, research also suggests that medical cannabidiol may be beneficial in treating some of the other condition autistic persons are prone to including gastrointestinal problems and the pain associated with. Moreover, the Autism Research Institute believes that many symptoms of autism can be mitigated through the use of properly titrated (dosed) cannabis: Some of the symptoms medical marijuana has ameliorated include: Anxiety\u2014even severe anxiety\u2014aggression, panic disorder, generalized rage, tantrums, property destruction, and self-injurious behavior. It is undisputed that much more research needs to be done on the effects of medical cannabidiol on the symptoms and treatment of autism. A recent retrospective study conducted in Israel involved sixty children with ASD.8 The study assessed safety, tolerability and efficacy of CBD based medical cannabis, as an adjuvant therapy, for refractory behavioral problems in children with ASD. The children were treated with oral CBD and THC at a ratio of 20:1. The dose was up-titrated to effect with the maximal CBD dose 10mg/kg/d. Following the cannabis treatment, 61% of the patients had improvements in behavioral outbreaks, 39% and 47% had improvements in anxiety and communication problems respectively, and 29% reported improvement in disruptive behaviors. There were also reports of lesser improvements in sleep disturbances, irritability and loss of appetite. This study has led to \"the first clinical trial in the world to test the benefits of medicinal marijuana for your people with autism.\"9 This sAdi Aran, et at., Cannabidiol Based Medical Cannabis in Children with Autism\u2014a Retrospective Feasibility Study, Neurology (April 24, 2018). 9Marijuana May Be a Miracle Treatment for Children with Autism, USA Today (www.usatoday.comistoryinews/world/04/25/marijuana-pot-treatment-children-autism-cannabis- oil/100381156/. 3 study, conducted in Israel, involved 120 children and young adults, ages 5 to 29, who have mild to severe autism, and lasted through the end of 2018. As of yet, no report has been released. In another study, researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine will be investigating whether CBD safely and effectively provides therapeutic benefit for ASD's more problematic symptoms such as aggressive behaviors, repetitive or self-injurious behaviors, hyperactivity and social and communicative deficits.10 According to the director of the school's Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, Dr. Igor Grant, \"accumulating evidence suggests the endocannabinoid system is associated with four phenotypic features known to be atypical in ASID: social reward responsivity, neural development, circadian rhythm and anxiety-related symptoms, and [ghat makes the endocannabinoid system a prime region for finding and testing new, potentially therapeutic compounds, such as CBD.\" Along with the research available, there are numerous anecdotal reports of symptom improvements. Rather than repeat these stories, they are included in the articles and literature attached. In view of the limited research, the very serious symptoms that persons with ASD may exhibit, and the limited success with current recognized treatments and drug therapies, anecdotal evidence should not be dismissed. 10G.abrielle Johnston & Scott LaFee, is CBD a Remedy for Autism? TBD, UC San Diego News Center (Apr. 26, 2018), https:Hucsdnews.ucsd.eduifeatureiis-cbd-a-remedv-for-autis-tbd.. 4 response to conventional treatments and chronic intractable pain. Disease activity before and after cannabis use was estimated using the Harvey-Bradshaw index for Crohn's disease, and patients assessed their general medical well-being before and after use. Patients' hospital records were obtained to monitor disease activity, rate of hospital admission, use of additional drugs, and need for surgical intervention. All 30 patients rated their general medical well-being as improved after cannabis use via a visual analog scale. Twenty-one patients had a notable improvement after treatment with cannabis use. only 2 patients required surgery during a period of 3 years of cannabis use, a rate that Naftali and colleagues claimed is a significant Improvement for the normal operative rate in patients with Crohn's disease. Whereas 26 patients required corticosteroid therapy prior to cannabis use, only 4 patients were still maintained on corticosteroids after cannabis use, suggesting a possible corticosteroid-sparing effect of cannabis. There was also a substantial drop in use of aminosalicylates, thiopurines, rnethotrexate, and tumor necrosis factor antagonists. The authors cited these data as objective benefits of cannabis use and advocated for more placebo-controlled studies for further evaluation of therapeutic effects of cannabis use. In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine published its findings on the health benefits of medical cannabis entitled \"The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids\" 23. While not specifically focused on ASD patients, a notable finding from this research is that in adults with chronic pain, patients who were treated with cannabis or cannabinoids are more likely to experience a clinically significant reduction in pain symptoms. Anecdotal Symptom Improvements Anecdotal reports of symptom improvements due to medical cannabis are primarily sourced from ASD patients and caregivers. Medical cannabis can help to relieve many symptoms commonly associated with ASD, including but not limited to anxiety, aggression, panic disorder, generalized rage, tantrums, property destruction and self-injurious behavior 24. Here we will highlight a portion of the parent testimony of Victoria Grancarich, whose son Julian qualified for medical cannabis based on his .history of seizure disorder: Julian had always been a kind and affectionate boy In his younger years. When Julian turned 13, the onset of puberty brought new challenges. In February of 2016 Julian became extremely violent toward both family and school staff. In August 2016, Julian began to turn the violence on to himself. 23 littps://www.nciolnim.nih.gov/books/NBK423845/pdf/Bookshelf_NE3K423845.pdf 24 https://vvww.massroots.com/learnicannabis-treatment-autism 8 He began punching himself in the head [and] would use his knee to injure his teeth, 1-./e would bang his head into walls. Between October 2016 and January 2017, Julian was hospitalized 3 times. He suffered self-inflicted skull. fractures and massive tissue damage. We enrolled him in the Minnesota Cannabis program in January 2017. Within a week of beginning cannabis therapy Julian was able to go about an hour without harming himself. As the weeks went on and we reached a therapeutic dose Julian's behaviors began to slowly melt away. By early March he ,was smiling again. Within 6 weeks of beginning cannabis Julian was no longer injuring himself or others. He began to take an interest in his life again. He returned to school full time; We were able to remove his helmets and protective gear. By mid March we were getting smiles and hugs, Julian began to go outdoors again by mid-April, By May, Julian began to show Interest in using augmentative communication for the first time in his life. it is now late June. We have not seen 1 episode of self-injury since early March. June 6, 2017 Advanced Microglial and Cannabinoid Signaling in Autism Plant-Based Nutrition Certified, Cornell Universit Re: Minnesota lawmakers - Expert support for autism as qualifying condition Autism 8z Cannabis'\u2014 Physician Support This brief summary provides \"additional supportive evidence\" for Minnesota lawmakers to justify autism as qualifying condition for their medical marijuana program. Please refer to the first document entitled \"The Endocannabinoid System as it Relates to Autism\" to appreciate further scientific evidence, Recommendation Dear Colleagues, I am the father of a 12 year old son who has autism. I have found great interest in pursuing possible etiologies in the development of the condition and explore safe alternatives to conventional pharmaceutical intervention. I am a speaker at multiple national conferences, specifically focused on autism and cannabis, As you know, several states have autism as qualifying diagnosis and more and more are to follow in the coming years. I have provided testimony in several other states about this same Issue at hand including Texas, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Georgia and South Carolina. Since I am sure you are aware, cannabis is non-lethal to humans. There are no reported deaths in recorded history that are attributed to cannabis as the cause of death. - The only question that really should be asked Is if chronic cannabis exposure to the developing brain can be harmful. I share the same passion to protect our children. I am a father of four and am caught in the health-nut movement, where everything I offer them is safe to consume, free of refined sugars, genetically modified foods and more of such nature. Recommending cannabis to this subpopulation comes with a great deal of research. Section G I aril giving my full support for giving parents the choice to choose cannabis as treatment modality in autism spectrum disorders. The reasons are as follows: I have seen countless parents' success stories with cannabis treatment, especially self- injurious, severe autism I have seen parents with their treated children for several years without adverse effects, I have researched this thoroughly. Cannabis is not only safe, but therapeutic (evidence below), -This is not meant to change novel treatment recommendations for autism in anyway. This is meant simply to be a legal choice for those parents that desire to choose cannabis for their child. It offers them legal protection from prosecution, -Many \"do it\" without having \"cannabis-cards\" anyways. This causes additional stress for already struggling families. I have personally consulted with Professor Grinspoon, who is a renowned Harvard Psychiatrist for 40 years and was reassured that cannabis is the not toxic in the developing brain. I have also consulted Professor Mechoulam, who discovered the THC molecule. In fact, he is still active as professor in Israel and is involved in the first human trial with cannabis and autism [out of all diseases]. If you see the powerful transformation yourself, when you listen to powerful parent testimony, it is our duty to protect these parents from state or federal interference. We must protect these very brave, yet vulnerable parents. Thank you for your time to hear these Parents and physicians and thank you for your time researching this subject as thoroughly as I have. Vignettes 7 year old male; ASD, Tourette's, aggression, rage episodes and anxiety. After starting medical cannabis there was a 60% reduction in tics and aggression, an increase in his tolerance of others and more rapid de-escalation and recovery from rages \u2014 by parent report. 8 year old male with ASD, Tourette's, aggression and anxiety. Once starting medical cannabis, - and after a few adjustments in the combination of THC and CBD, there was a 70% reduction in tic behaviors, 40+% reduction in aggression, 50% reduction in anxiety, and a 40% improvement in his sleep, per his parents. 8 year old male with ASD, Tourettes, and anxiety: after starting cannabis there is a 50% reduction in raging episodes with a 40% increase in flexibility to transitions, and a 70% reduction in tics as reported by parents. 13 year old female with ASD, Tourette's self-injury, aggression, and anxiety: Picking and self- injury behaviors nearly resolved, vocal tics 90% improved, aggression symptoms were \"less frequent\" but, more importantly, \"recovered much faster\" from aggressive episodes, as reported by caregivers, 10 year old male with Tourette's and ASD On 8 medications to manage behaviors: initially an 80% reduction in tics, 30% reduction in anxiety, and 20% increase in willingness to try new things, increased flexibility. Parents report that he is continuing to show significant improvement in his anxiety and transitions and his tics have all but disappeared. 17 year old male with ASD, Tourette's, anxiety: Mom reports his \"life has completely turned around\". His tics were so severe he could not attend, school, sit long enough to do homework or participate in family activity. I hardly recognized him at his last visit because he was transformed into a sociable, smiling, happy young mani 6 year old with Tourette's and ASD: prior to starting cannabis, this child actually broke the ceiling light in the office with a stuffed animal, tried to walk up the inside of the door, could not sit for more than a second and his vocal and movement tics were out of control, The family had tried a number of medications and had failed a recent trial of clonidine. After three months with medical cannabis he is able to sit through the visit, he is able to accomplish some study activities, is far less aggressive and is sleeping better than he had been for his whole life per MOM. LIFE MEDICAL, PA 4201 Excelsior I3LVD, Saint www.LifeMedicaLUS sIt'Ir>1.ji Health Cannabis P.O. Box 64882 St. Paul, MN 55164 To the Minnesota Department of Health, My name is Dr, Jacob Minnan, I graduated from the University of Minnesota Medical School and completed my residen4 in primary care internal medicine at Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Chicago. I specialize in integrative medicine and I am the Medical Director of Life Medical, an integrative medicine clinic in St. Louis Park. write to you today in support of the petitions to add nausea, autism, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, liver disease, and chronic pain to Minnesota medical cannabis program. As a physician treating patients for all these conditions, I believe my patients who suffer from these conditions would benefit from being added to the state's progratri, am a primary care internist. I am a not a politician, a law enforcement officer or a cannabis policy eipert. Yet, as an internist with 25 years of experience working with patients, I hope'you will consider my views on whether to expand Minnesota's medical cannabis program, have been certifying patients for medical cannabis for Over a year now, and have seen a tremendous benefit to patients when they return to me for follow-ups. Notably, in addition to the medical condition that qualifies them for the program, many .patients who I have certified suffer from some other ailment \u2014 including several listed above \u2014 and have seen their conditions improved with medical cannabis -use. Patients come to me because they need help. I agree to see them and do my best to help them. The buck stops with me. If I send a patient to a specialist and he or she is unable to help, the patient comes back to me and their medical care is again my responsibility.. When standard approaches do not help the patient, my responsibility as their physician does not end. For the last few months, around 20% of my practice has involved treating patients benefiting from medical cannabis, I certify on average two-three new patients per day. Notably, many patients are finding relief for not just the condition they have been certified for, but also secondary conditions. Further, my.patients are happier, suffer from less anxiety (many have Leon B. Frid, DC Jacob L Allman, MD Section G My name is and I would like to share the story of my 21 year old son as a testimonial to the powers of medicarcannabis, which I have found to be nothing short of miraculous. has severe autism and a history of severe self-injury and aggression towards others. We are originally from Wisconsin, where we lived until 2012 when we moved to Missouri. During the 2.5 years we were in that state, my son's behaviors became extremely violent. He was kicked out of school and out of an adult day program for individuals with developmental disabilities. He literally ripped half of his own bottom lip completely off and to this day has numerous scars on his hands and legs from other self-injury. He was abusive and dangerous to our entire family. We attempted to have him hospitalized in an inpatient psychiatric facility numerous times; around 30 attempts to get help for him over those 2.5 years but they only.took him 4 times, for 4-5 days each stay. During those hospitalizations, they just kept adding more and more psychotropic medications until he was at a point where he slept up to 18 hours/day and when he wasn't sleeping, he was violent and self-injurious - increasingly so. He was taking up to 18 pills/day towards the end of our residency in that state, My husband was given the opportunity to move again, and we chose California. I had just heard of cannabis potentially helping people on the autism spectrum. This was our very last hope to keep him home and keep him and everyone else within our home safe. I had no idea if it would work. I had always believed cannabis was nothing more than a bad street drug. I believed it made people lazy and that there was absolutely no value to it at all. After seeing a video of a young child taking medicinal cannabis which almost immediately ended his violent behaviors, I began to reconsider all I knew about it. By this point, we had nothing left to lose, We were already expecting to have to institutionalize my son in California if the cannabis didn't work and this was our absolutely final thing to try in order to keep him home,' since none of the other medications we tried in the past had helped him. We started the cannabis within a couple of Months of arriving in our new state. The results were almost immediate.] could see a change in his demeanor. He looked so calm, made eye contact, and just seemed to be more \"present\" in our world. Three days after beginning cannabis, we went to a National Park and he smiled and posed for the camera on his own. Before this, it was very rare to get him to smile for a photo. Now he does it all the time. Everything preconceived notion I had about cannabis in the past was incredibly wrong. It has helped and began to heal my son more than anything else, ever. We slowly began weaning him from those 18 pills he was taking. It took 7 months to remove them all, but it happened! it has now been 19 months since he stopped taking pharmaceuticals. He no longer sleeps 18 hours/day. Instead of being violent every single day, he might have a minor episode once. every 3-4 months and it can generally be stopped in under 5 minutes, Before cannabis, it might have lasted all day long or we had to give him extra doses to make him sleepy so we wouldn't get beaten by him, It has changed his life and our entire family's lives drastically. He is happily living at home with us and we have no plans to find another home for him anymore. He also spends part of his days at a new day program with his peers and he seems to enjoy it. We no longer fear him or his future. I am asking the State of Minnesota to add autism as a qualifying condition in your state's medical cannabis program. No child or adult should suffer needlessly. No parent should be prevented from trying everything they absolutely can to help their child. Zip codes and legalities should not be a reason a parent is unable to at least try every available option, especially one that Is far less harmful than many of the pharmaceuticals they are oftentimes overprescribed. Please help this vulnerable population, My son was diagnosed with Autism at age 3..He didn't speak or respond to his name and was constantly flapping his arms. He would shriek uncontrollably and bang his head forcefully on the floor, walls, and doors. He was unconsolable. He was constantly moving and showed no interest in what others were doing or saying. He had unusual obsessions (the washer, the microwave, the ceiling, holes.) He has cycled through countless repetitive behaviors, Stomping, spilling, clearing his throat, jumping,pushing his younger brothers, pinching, spinning, and most recently echoing the same word or phrase. His aggression and destructive behaviors only got more intense with age. Punching himself in the face, biting his legs and arms, throwing his whole body on the floor, scratching until he bleeds, punching holes in walls, throwing objects. He has multiple scarsend has given me 3 black eyes He had no Interest in his brothers and was unable to make eye contact, use gestures, or communicate in any way. He has been nonverbal for most of his life. Lack of communication led to much of the aggressive behaviors, but at times it was 'random and seemed like he was in pain.. He had Speech Therapy, but was unable to focus or follow simple directions. He did Occupation Therapy but was discharged due to \"unknown underlying medical conditions.\" Kindergarten was a nightmare. He was left out of special events and spent most of his day in a room with only two other students. He was not allowed to join, the mainstream classroom or participate in Kindergarten graduation because they did not want to upset him by changing his routine He started ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) Therapy in August of 2015. The behaviors continued and we felt there was no choice but to try medication, in retrospect this was a mistake. Within a year my 7 year old son was on Buspirone,Tenex, Prozac, Klonopin, Hydroxyzine and Ability. These medications had zero effect, put him to sleep, or put him into a violent rage. The risks outweighed the beneflts.Risperdal was prescribed as a last resort, but thankfully he was re-evaluated and given a diagnosis of Tourelle's Syndrome. as certified through the Medical Cannabis Program last November. While it has only been a short period of time, his quality of life has dramatically improved,He is able to communicate by speaking simple words and using his MC (augmentative and alternative communication) device. He is generally in a very good mood and smiling. Eye contact has improved and he plays with his brothers.He can wave at us, label objects, and says mom and dad. He is of all other medications and is much easier to redirect and calm down. Of course we still have off times, but they are rare. I don't have to worry he will have an allergic reaction or hurt himself or others. Medical cannabis has given my family hope. Section G To whom it concerns, My name is I am the very proud mom of Is 11 yo and has severe autism, as well as Lowe Syndrome (brain/eye and kidney disease) and Tourettes. He has been certified to use Medical Marijuana in the State of MN for his Tourettes condition since September of 2016, nearly one year. In his one year since beginning Medical Marijuana- has potty trained daytime hours, he has learned to dress himself with 1:1 step direction, he is able to transition 80% better, his anxiety levels have been decreased significantly, he has returned to fulltime school and is doing well, he is learning new tasks all the time, he is playing appropriately with toys, he is interested in other children and joining in on their play, he is willing to eat new foods and eats them regularly (cucumbers, raw apples, carrots, almonds, walnuts) he is able to receive a haircut with electric clippers without any behavior. His kidney function has increased, he was functioning at 66%, last check he was functioning at 80%- recheck due in August. has been weaned off Abilify- please see Ode effects of this med. He has also weaned 14 off Risperidone, we had to stop weaning as the withdrawal was horrific- he remains at 0.5mg day, we are working up the courage to try again...the withdrawal was heartbreaking for all. We are very fortunate to have a Tourettes diagnosis as it gives us legal access to Medical Marijuana, I come forward to petition with others again this year as I believe in this medicine, I believe in it- I'm living the'clifference and feel every person with Autism should have the same freedoms my son does. Medical Marijuana has been life changing for my son and our entire family. Section G My son now 10 years old - was diagnosed with Autism at age 3. He also has ADHD, and Intellectual Disability. I knew he had this disease at 15 months old as he stopped meeting his milestones. He started screaming sometimes continuously on and off for days intermittently as if in pain, and beating on the right side of his head under the ear. Although is verbal, his cognition is delayed to the level of a 3-4 year old. can obey one step commands but no more. Self-injurious behavior and aggression are the biggest concerns although there are many. has adverse reactions to medications, limiting him to certain ones. One medication required me to have him transported by ambulance to the hospital for a very long admission. has signs and symptoms of sub-clinical seizures, although numerous EMG's have detected nothing. I have recorded these episodes and others have admitted these episodes are possibly absent seizures. has had very thorough ABA therapy and treatment along with placement at a behavior facility in Wisconsin for one year. These approaches have not been effective. Redirection has only been successful 22% of the time. ABA has never been successful and has resulted in discharge of the ABA facility. has head pain in the right back side the head in which he beats under the ear at full force \u2014 his hair has ceased to regrow In the area due to consistency of striking and digging in that'area. is afraid of children thinking they will hurt him which makes aggressive. We cannot go to waiting areas of clinics. We must be immediately directed to a quiet room or he will attack others due to noises. needs to be reduced in his medications. Risperdone causes obesity and trying other medications causes adverse reactions. Depakote was used and continues to be used for aggression although recently had a high toxicity and was admitted to the hospital. His head pain continues and there is no medication to calm and treat. Nothing works and Benzodiazepines cause adverse reactions. I *discharged recently due to neglect at a Crisis home as another child abused him. I believe this could have been avoided if put on the program and cognition and verbalisation would have cleared a lot more up. I believe I have a right to this natural medication after multiple have failed and we have nowhere to turn. My son also vocally ticks in the morning and randomly throughout the-day. He has resorted to biting his ' forearms as his way of crying out in pain. Do I think he is in pain? Your doggone right I do. When a child tells you that, you don't consider them a liar. These strong medications need to be reduced and I believe Medical Cannabis administration is the key to keep healthy. Please make Autism a qualifying condition to help my child - I feel I have tried everything and I don't want to lose my child. I believe after reading about the endocannabinoid system and the benefits of getting certified by the Minnesota Medical Cannabis Program that we could save s life and save lots of time and money spent. The expense of multiple admits, inpatient facilities, safety of others and safety of a suffering child, far out way the benefits of the medication itself. Thank you for understanding my concern. Please see photos on following page, Section G I wish to remain anonymous. My 17 year old son has been diagnosed with ASD, AMID and Depression With Severe Anxiety. Over the years, his aggression (rage attacks) and anxiety have gotten worse. During a rage attack, he punches holes in the wall, smashes windows, bangs his head and breaks items by kicking or throwing stuff. Walking in our house resembles a battle zone. His siblings often lock their bedroom doors, barricaded inside, to avoid him and his behaviors. His anxiety has gotten so bad that he is unable to order food for himself at Mcdonalds or any sit down restaurant. He doesn't leave my side when we're In public as he's afraid of being abducted. He's tried Ability and Risperdal for ASD, and Hydroxlzine for Anxiety. None seems to help. His current prescriptions are Adderal, Ablify, and trazadone to help with sleep. My son hates taking these meds and often refuses as they make him feel \"out of it\", sick to his stomach with no appetite, and his body aches all the time, not to mention what these meds do to his sleep cycle. During his rage attacks he also bites himself, punches us (his parents), and cuts himself. He usually ends up restrained and the police are called t6 calm him down. Recently, my son has been self-medicating with marijuana. We as parents disapproved strongly at first. However, since he started using, we've noticed a huge difference in his demeanor. He is calm, rational, happy and we no longer see any rage attacks. He's nice to his siblings and to us, his parents! I don't see him constantly worrying, he has an appetite and he Is able to sleep without medications. Please consider adding ASD to the list of approved conditions for medical marijuana use. My son's happiness\\life depends on it. Section G My name Is I'm the mother of a 14 year-old boy named has severe Autism and a seizure disorder. began having seizures in June of 2011. We have tried many medications over the last 6 years, however seizures and motor tics continued to be an issue. had always been a kind and affectionate boy in his younger years, When turned 13, the onset of puberty brought new challenges. In February of 2016 became extremely violent toward both family and school staff. He began raging daily and would physically attack us. It got to the point where we as his family needed to wear protective clothing twavoid being bitten, having our hair-pulled, and being kicked and punched, His younger sister could not be in the same room and she had to spend all of her time at home locked in her room for her own protection. In August 2016, began to turn the violence on to himself. He began punching himself in the head full force thousands of times per day. He would use his knee to injure his teeth. He would bang his head into walls: We were powerless to stop him, We were trying to protect him using helmets, arm immobilizers and at times we had to physically restrain him for hours at a time to keep him from harming himself. We believed our son was in terrible pain and was suffering from debilitating headaches. We saw this once vibrant boy lose his will to live. He seemed determined to end his life and came close several times. Between October 2016 and January 2017, as hospitalized 3 times. He suffered self-inflicted skull fractures and massive tissue damage. He had black eyes and giant hematomas on his skull regularly. The hospital staff offered psychiatric medications as well as gabapentin but nothing could stop the daily rages that lasted every moment that he was awake. I felt certain that if we could not get annabis that he would find a way to end his life. - qualified for cannabis through the state program because-of his seizure disorder. After being sent ome from Children's Hospital in Minneapolis after another life-threatening episode of self-injury with .no plan in place to heal our son we felt cannabis was our only hope. The excruciating pain our son was in was getting worse and we knew no pharmaceutical medication could help him. We had tried everything the doctors offered and had.absolutely no success. We enrolled him in the Minnesota Cannabis program in January 2017. Within a week of beginning cannabis the?apy as able to go about an hour without harming himself. As the weeks went on and we reached a therapeutic dose, 's behaviors began to slowly melt away, By early March he was smiling again. Within 6 weeks of beginning cannabisFi as no longer injuring himself or others. He began to take an interest in his life again. He returned to school full time. We were able to remove his helmets and protective gear. By midiMarch .we were getting smiles and hugs 3 .egan to go outdoors again by mid-April. By May egan to show interest in using augmentative communication for the first time in his life. It is now late June. We have not seen 1 episode of-self-injury since early March. has not struck me since February. is enrolled in a day camp for children with special needs w ere. e spends S hours a day. He is exploring outside and making friends. He is happy and smiling and his sister have a relationship once again. spends hours in our backyard enjoying bouncing on his trampoline, moving his body and taking in fresh air. He lives safely and happily in our home. He is free from pain. His seizures and motor tics are well managed to the point they are not interfering in his daily life. Cannabis gave us our beautiful son back. is alive and well today because of this miracle medication. On the following page are photos of my son before cannabis therapy and after. Section section G I am a mother of a 10-year-old boy, We did not learn about his Autism Spectrum Disorder until he was 7 1/2 years old. Looking back now, we can see the signs were there in a subtle way starting from infancy. It was at age 6, when he was ready to move to a mainstream school, that his challenges became more apparent. The dominos kept being pushed, and my boy kept having a harder and harder time. He went from being a happy and clever and confident child, to frustrated, sad, anxious and self-doubting in a fairly short amount of time, When we were told that he has High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder, we, as parents, grieved. In our grief, we pushed and plugged forward. School was there for us and there has been constant Support and communication as changes are happening frequently. Our son's ASD manifests as high anxiety, and quick triggers. He becomes frustrated with anything that he perceives as a block to a goal or need. He has the emotional maturity of a 3-4-year-old, He has an emotional response and is overwhelmed to what I would compare to a person experiencing a PTSD reaction, Re experiences sensory input more than a typical developing person does, and the overwhelming sensory overload leads him to deep frustration and a fear response. He yells and cries and gets in a looping thought pattern that keeps himself stuck in that trauma reaction. These episodes have become a serious block for social. interaction and development since other children cannot understand what is happening for him or why he is yelling at them. His ability to understand his own emotions and express his needs and wants as well as lack of problem solving ability keeps other children from wanting to interact. It even triggers other children into pushing buttons to elicit an outburst because it seems \"funny\" to them, Now we have bullying happening with that. He also has ongoing stories happening in his mind, and he retreats into a world within his imagination, It has become increasingly difficult to get him out of the stories and the retreat world within his head, From all of this, we now have a highly anxious and depressed child. He is a highly intelligent child. With his smarts (high IQ), he actually is aware that he is different from others. He sees that he reacts and experiences things differently, and he knows that it is hard on others. With that, he also knows that he is not able to stop it. With this, he experienced not only sadness, but a deep loneliness. Talk of suicide began at age 9. As he came into the school from recess, a staff-member noticed that he was walking slowly and looking down rather than his typical demeanor. The staff-member asked him what was on his mind and he said that he wished that he had a rope so that he could hang himself. Further discussion of these feelings revealed that his 'first thoughts like this actually began internally at 'age 7. He has been on Adderall XR (amphetamine salts), a stimulant for treating his inability to focus and attention. This has been helpful with focus, but he has had an increase of anxious behavior and panic attack/ PTSD-type trauma reactions, Although I brought-this up and asked what we could do differently over numerous visits to his prescribing Nurse Practitioner, she never had any answer except for adding more pharmaceuticals. I am in the Health care industry, and am not against medications when used appropriately. We added Intuniv (guanfacine extended release) for his impulse control, and that helped, but the anxiety and panic and frustration tantrums kepi getting Worse. The clinician suggested a few times that an anti depressant and then after that, a mood stabilizer could be tried. This is where I drew a line. Anti depressants in youth can actually increase the risk of suicidal thoughts, and with an already suicidal boy, that is not an option for our individual child, The mood stabilizers also come with side effects that we refuse to risk; Other medications suggested have frightening side effects and if ever we wanted to take- him off of them, risks with withdrawal symptoms are unacceptable. I am a very scientific thinker, so I read and researched various articles, both academic and anecdotal. The'idea of Medical Cannabis crossed my path. From my detailed searches, I found that children are medicated using medical cannabis and they are NOT getting high. I learned about Cannabidiol (CBD), which does not have the psychotropic effect on people. I did not like the idea of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), because I did not want to risk my kiddo getting \"high\" and also because, it is against the law. I found products that we could legally obtain with whole plant extractions of CBD, and purchased CW Advanced. I connected with a non-profit group in Colorado, and they directed me to the \"start low and go slow\" method. We gave our son his first very small dose of CBD oil on April 19th in the evening. We used the guidance of the non-profit group, and found a dose based on his weight. Within a just over two weeks of adding CBD to his treatment plan, we received an email that said, \"Hello All- I hope [child's name removed] is feeling better. I wanted to let you know that [he] had a really good week. He was focused, on. task, flexible, and able to recover quicker from bumps in the road. It was a drastic improvernentfrom the past couple of weeks, regarding his flexibility and focus.\" His father and I both were seeing improvements at home with his communication and seemingly easier time recovering from frustration. With a lot of research, I found a way to obtain cannabis strains that have TI-IC and are found to be helpful for other parents that have a child similar to mine. As a parent desperate to treat my child, I crossed a legal line. I traveled to a \"legal\" state and purchased. a few strains with guidance from other parents who are further along in their journey. As his parents, we agreed that we would try this in secret What we saw since adding a tiny amount of THC is beyond even what we had hoped for. Within a week of adding THC as medication, we watched our child face a challenge that lasted over two hours, and instead of having a full-out breakdown, he worked through it. He told himself after repeated \"failure\" things like \"You can do this\" and he just tried over and over. He also accepted corrections, which he typically never would Without high defensiveness and anger. That was just a 'start. He was also having real back-and-forth conversations with us as well as peers and other adults. His eye contact greatly increased, and he even began asking other people their thoughts and about how they were doing. He never before would ask someone \"How are you\" even. His thoughts began to be outside of his inner focus and inner world. Something simple, but noticeable is that he never looked into a camera and he could not smile on command. It took someone else to point - out to me that he was not only looking at the camera, but he was smiling.. ..as in a real and genuine smile! We continue to see him blossom socially. He has found an awareness of his emotions and identifying them to himself, and sharing them with people around him He is open to listening to ideas to improve outcomes where defensiveness would have blocked him before. He is having fun again and interacting with other children much better. His awareness is reaching out of his own world that he had been trapped in prior to treatment involving Cannabis. We are parents who are successful in our careers and social lives. We have been law-abiding citizens up to the point of desperately seeking medication that has not been available in our state for our child. Please consider making Medicinal use of Cannabis available to our son so that we can legally treat his -Autism Spectrum Disorder under medical guidance Within our own state of Minnesota, Thank you for considering adding Autism Spectrum Disorder a qualifying condition under Minnesota's Medical Cannabis program. With Great Hope, *A loving Mother *For obvious reasons, I wish to remain anonymous. July 24,2017 , Hello, I am writing to share our family's experience with medical cannabis and express how important it is for Autism spectrum disorder to be added as.a qualifying 'condition for the MN medical cannabis program. Our journey with cannabis began in 2015, when we first heard about CBD oil. We began using it for our son has both an ASD and a Tourettes diagnosis. We started with the OW brand and switched to the HH brand 3 mos later (we feel the HH brand Is a high-quality and reliable product). This initial test with CBD oil proved extremely successful for had been having extremely aggressive meltdowns reguariy. They occurred most often from going out into the community and having sensory overload. The meltdown would occur once he r,etumed home. He would attack me and raj/ husband (as well as therapists and school staff) when overwhelmed. We stopped going anywhere except routine places (basically school and therapy) to lessen these fits, Howeveh they would happen randomly.as well. The fits also terrified his little sister (who also has ASP and Tourettes), causing much anxiety in her. When we began CBD oil, the aggression during fits stopped. He no longer hit, kicked, or attacked us when upset. He still had meltdowns, but they were much shorter and the removal of the aggression was ci huge improvement. We also saw an increase in focus during ABA sessions, more eye contact, an increase In his wanting to and trying to communicate with us is semi verbal only able to make short requests or use learned phrases -he cannot hold a conversation or answer a question). When he started school again in the fall that year, staff were blown away by the changes in him. His FBA had to be rewritten after only one year due to the behavior Improvements. As a family, we were able to attend movies and go to Disney on Ice productions. began ice-skating lessons and participated in Special Olympics basketball that winter. He was happier and visibly more comfortable. The CBD.has helped his leaky gut issues as well, reducing inflammation and pain. In 2016, became registered with the MN Medical cannabis program under his Tourettes diagnosis. We tried a variety of different options with the guidance of the MN Med company. We did not see a lasting improvement in 's tics however, after almost a year of trying the MN Med products. Currently, is only taking the HH pro uot, but we will keep trying to help him through the state cannabis program in Miura. it is very important to note how many of my son's ASD based symptoms - the aggressive meltdowns, lack of communication and eye contact, anxiety and sensory overload - all reduced due to CBD oil. Our daughter. became registered with the MN Medical cannabis program in Aug 2016, with Tourettes being her qualifying con. on. We saw initial improvement with tic reduction right upon starting the MN Med green product. This remained for about 4 mos until we purchased a new bottle of this product. For some reason, the new bottle did not have the same effects and stopped working. We switched companies and the Lealline product is working better, in combination with the HH product. My daughter's ASD symptoms improved as well with both MN cannabis products. She became calmer, happier, and less anxious. Her speech Improved and her spontaneous language increased. Her ability to answer questions also Improved. Being able to help my children by Using the MN Cannabis program has made a huge difference in their lives and our - family's life. There are many children out there with only an Autism diagnosis who would surely benefit from having the same access to this program. Medical cannabis has proven to help with so many of the symptoms and side effects that go with ASD Inflammation, speech/communication improvements, gut and digestive issues, sleep issues, behavior issues including aggression and self-injury, anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses - just to name a few. Why should these children and their families continue to suffer each day when there is an option that is safe and may help them? Please consider adding Autism as a qualifying condition for the MN medical cannabis program. Thank you for reading our story. Sincerely, July 25, 2017 To Whom it May Concern, My name is my husband and I are sending this letter to share our family's personal experience with our daughter We are praying that the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder will be added to the list of Qualifying Conditions to the Medical Cannabis Program. Our daughter's name is she is 13 years old and is an exceptional artist, writer, illustrator, and has a heart of gold. She Inspires us each day to be the.best parents that we can be, to protect her, and nurture her in any every way possible. One of the challenges of parenting that we have is watching her struggle on a daily basis. Was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder when she was 10 years old after many Oars of trying to figure out what was causing her to struggle severely in many areas of her life. struggles with social communication; she has difficulty with peers and adults, and lacks skills in social settings. As she is in adolescence these deficiencies are more noticeable and upsetting to her. She also struggles with repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Her focus on subjects and intensity are admirable, but they truly impede her happiness and success in areas of her life. She struggles with transitioning from one item to another and has difficulty engaging with others when she is hyper-focused on a subject or object. also struggles with her behavior; she has rages daily when it comes to transitioning and carrying out her activities of daily living. She has anxiety, depression, and has also been diagnosed With Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). will self-injure as well as hurt others when she is unable to manage her emotions and is having sensory overload. Due to her challenges she has been hospitalized multiple times. These hospitalizations have been to. stabilize her as well as to attempt to manage her medications. We have had so man challenges with pharmaceutical medications that have been harmful immediately and over time urrentiy is pre- diabetic, has high tri-glycerides, as well as high cholesterol. The medication that causes her to have these side effects also causes her to have insatiable hunger and has affected her self-esteem as she does hot look like her peers. She is on an additional medication'to help curb some of these side effects as well. We have tried many types of medications and have had major side effects with each one. A combination of medications prescribed caused her to be hospitalized due to aggression and extreme confusion where she struggled to speak. Another medication caused to start lactating at age 11. We have recently been referred to a new Psychiatrist specializing in Autism Spectrum Disorder to hopefully come up with a plan that will keep her stable, functioning, safe, and not cause more serious health concerns due to side effects. As s parents we struggle to make careful and informed choices about her medications. We have the best and most knowledgeable providers for her and they are running out of options to help As parents we want to protect her and ensure that as she is moving through life, she is safe, and able to realize her goals and aspirations. At the rate we are going many of these will not happen for and as parents it breaks our hearts. We have heard of many success stories from other families who use Medical Cannabis for their children who have qualifying conditions. The changes in these families' lives have been extraordinary. The ability to move away from pharmaceutical medications that can cause damaging side effects has been a blessing for so many people. As parents we would move heaven and earth for our child and truly need to have other options to treating her. We are asking to please allow Autism Spectrum Disorder to be added to the list of Qualifying Conditions in the Medical Cannabis program. The addition would allow families options for treating their children's Illnesses and allow -stability and safety without the fear of damage. Thank You Marijuana madness Page 1 of 4 Marijuana madness Nick Buglione is convinced marijuana saved her child's life. Just six months ago her son, a 10-year-old with severe autism, weighed just 46 pounds. He stopped eating after the medications he had been taking to control his behavior took away his appetite, according to the Orange County, Calif., mom. \"You could see the bones in his chest and in his arms and legs,\" 7 says. \"He had stopped walking and he would bruise very easily.\" But it was medical marijuana, an unorthodox treatment for autism that's been the center of debate recently, which got her child eating again and changed his life for the better, she says, It was not a decision she made lightly. 'I decided to try medical marijuana truly after I exhausted every other treatment,\" ' - says. About five years ago began exhibiting behaviors typical of children with severe autism\u2014he would hit himself, bang on walls, and throw anything he could get his hands on. 'He was very unpredictable,\" she says, so much so that she shied away from inviting company over or taking '; to someone else's house. 'I could no longer socialize with friends or family due to his behavior.' tried behavior modification, a gluten-free, casein-free diet, and over 13 different medications with limited success, she says. While some of the medicines managed to reduce outbursts, the results were fleeting, according to the mother. The effects of the medication were temporary. It seems like every three weeks we were either changing the doses or changing the medication, which is normal, but that took a toll on his body,\" she says. All of the medicines\u2014including Ritalin, Focalin and Risperdal\u2014had serious physical side effects or Thee were facial ticks, seizures and liver damage, but worst of all, a lack of appetite that left emaciated and weak, his mother says. As grim as the situation was, it was a light-hearted moment with friends that clued in on the possible benefits of marijuana. 'I was sitting around with friends and it started as a joke,' she says. \"We were talking about how marijuana users eat, they sit down, they're very calm, and they're pleasant to be around.\" Later that night she typed \"autism and medical marijuana\" into an Internet search engine and the name Dr. Bernard Rimland popped up. Rimland is a former director of the Autism Research Institute who wrote about using medical marijuana to treat autism. \"I'm not pro-drug, but I am very much pro-safe and effective treatment, especially in cases when an autistic individual's behaviors are devastating and do not respond to other interventions,\" Rimland once wrote. \"Early evidence suggests that medical marijuana may be an effective treatment for autism, as well as being safer than the drugs that doctors routinely prescribe.\" According to the Autism Research Institute, some of the symptoms marijuana has improved in children with autism include anxiety, aggression, panic disorder, tantrums and self-injurious behavior. Though Rimland died in 2006, his ideas continue to draw interest from parents with children on the spectrum., http://www.autisinsupportnetwork.corn/print/7991 5/8/2017 Marijuana madness Page 2 of 4 California is one of 14 states that now allow the use of medical marijuana with a doctor's prescription.

The improvements continue to be evident, she says, as is now smiling and even attempting to talk\u2014things he never did before. Having appeared on Good Morning America and other media outlets, ' . Is spreading the word about medical marijuana and autism. She has even started her own website, uf4a.org. 'There are definitely other parents who are using it but I'm just the only parent that's gone public,\" she says. And though she lives in a conservative county in California, the response to her grassroots campaign has been overwhelmingly positive, she says. The positive feedback has far outweighed the negative feedback,\" she says. \"After I was on Good Morning America, I received over 700 e-mails from parents asking all kinds of questions. I heard from a mother in Texas who had a child with autism die of malnutrition and she said she would have moved to California if she'd known about medical marijuana,\" The mother is hoping her crusade will result in the California state legislature including autism as one of the treatable conditions under its medical marijuana law, which passed in 1996. AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and arthritis are among the illnesses currently included. Although autism is not explicitly mentioned in the bill, doctors can prescribe marijuana for any other illness that it might provide relief. \"The medical community must start acknowledging the benefits of cannabis for our children with these symptoms. Finding a medical marijuana doctor to see a child is difficult they fear the risk of losing their license,\" Hester-Perez says. \"I called several doctors before I found a doctor for that I thought was morally in line with why we were turning to cannabis. For those who have exhausted all other treatments medical marijuana provides one more option that does not lead to death, liver damage and seizures.\" isn't the only parent who has admitted to giving her child medical marijuana. ^ an author and professor at Brown University, has a 9-year-old child with autism who is taking marijuana to treat his behavior. Though the mother declined an interview with Spectrum, she has blogged about the experience online. In the last year the teachers at her child's school began inquiring about his behavior, even having to wear protective pads because his biting had become so severe, Lee writes. She didn't like the idea of putting her child on Risperdal, as its long term effects have never been studied in children, and became intrigued when a homeopath suggested medicinal marijuana. \"But I was resistant. My late father was an anesthesiologist, and compared with the precise drugs he worked with, I know he would think marijuana to be ridiculously imprecise and unscientific,\" she writes. \"At his school, I was already the weirdo mom who packed lunches with organic kale and kimchl and wouldn't let him eat any 'fun' foods with artificial dyes. Now, I'd be the mom who shunned the standard operating procedure and gave her kid pot instead.\" Lee's doctor put her child on the prescription drug Marinol, a synthetic form of cannabis, and her son showed a marked improvement in behavior, she writes. After he developed a tolerance to the synthetic drug, however, his aggressive behavior returned. http://www.autismsupportnetwork.conilprintl799l 5/8/2017 Marijuana madness Page 3 of 4 'Since her state, Rhode Island, allows medicinal marijuana, filed the paperwork and her doctor consented, making her son the youngest person in the state to be prescribed pot.

He sleeps through the night and doesn't wake up. He has a good appetite. He is less resistant and more manageable and cooperative.\" On the downside, the mother says the child is sleepier In the day and requires a nap. She's also noticed he's become more self-centered. \"At a Mexican restaurant (recently), he yelled to the waitress twice to bring him chips,' she says. \"I mean yelled.

I have had the good fortune to work with families who have children (of all ages) who struggle with autism. In many cases, the pharmacological options are not sufficient to help these families manage symptoms and in many cases, allow the security of physical safety for their child and their family. I implore you to not limit the age of those who may be benefited by medical canna bidiol. Instead, please consider that a family's health care provider would be the best in exercising discernment on what may or may not help a patient. lam afraid that by putting an arbitrary age on the access to medical canna bldfol, too many Iowans will be unable to access an optional treatment option that could very well improve the entire family's quality of life. Thank you, in advance, for considering this request Sincerely, Jacquelyn\u00b0 Joens, NCC, NA New Ilope Counseling, Coaching 6. Reply to All 4. Forward ..

I feel it is very important that autism be included on the list for medical cannabidiol in the state of Iowa. For so many children and adults who suffer from severe autism they can't communicate which then leads to frustration which then leads to self-harm. For most of us we can't even imagine what that feels like as a parent. I know I can't. Severe autism is not a curable disease and there are very few treatment options for these children and adults that actually help them get through the day without anger or self- harm. Many are forced to be away from their loved ones and options for treatment are not always beneficial when cases are severe. It has proven to help calm a patient who has Parkinson's disease and epilepsy as well. We all have seen what it can do for these patients who suffer on a daily basis from these. debilitating diseases. Autism is no different and for. who suffers from severe autism, it would be nice to see him able to enjoy a day without being upset or hurting himself. His family would love to see have a calm afternoon while they visit him and maybe a few hours of rest. We know this is not a cure for autism, but children and adults who suffer from autism deserve to benefit from medical marijuana as do so many other diseases. Please consider this as an option for children and adults with autism. Thank you for your time and your consideration, Sara Ahrendsen Print Page 1 of 1 Subject: 'Letter 2 From: , To: Date: Monday, February 25, 2019 1:12 PM February 25, 2019 Dear Members of the Medical Cannabidiol Board. On November 27, 2018, the Iowa Medical Cannabidiol Board issued an order that modified and approved a petition to add Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as a debilitating medical condition for which the use of cannabidiol would be medically beneficial. Specifically, the Cannabidiol Board modified and recommended the addition Of severe, intractable pediatric autism with self-injurious or aggressive behavior. Our nephew a 28-year-old young man has severe autism with self-injurious and aggressive behaviors. My Husband and I would like the board to consider adding \"all ages\"),vith severe intractable autism the list of medical conditions that can receive medical cannabidiol to the petition, Sincerely, Cindy and Tim Andreassen Sent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone, https://mail.yahoo.com/neo/launch?.src=ym&reason=unsupported_browser 2/25/2019 March 1, 2019 Office of Medical Cannabidiol Lucas State office Building 321 E. 12th St. Des Moines, Iowa 50319 Dear Members of the Board, I am writing regarding your recommendation that severe, intractable pediatric autism with self-injurious or aggressive behavior be added to the conditions for which medical cannabidiol can be used. My adult nephew has severe autism with self-injurious and aggressive behaviors. I have been very involved in his care for his entire life. He is 28 now and has resided at the Woodward Resource Center since just before his 21' birthday. His placement there was not an easy decision for his parents to make. When he reached puberty his behavior changed. He started hitting people and himself causing injuries to both. He loved music and he suddenly started becoming obsessed with the computer and CD players which were things that once brought him joy, but now agitated him resulting in him losing the ability to listen to music and play on the computer. Since he's been at the Resource Center he's remained self- injurious and aggressive. He's put many holes in his wall and broke several recliners and TVs. My sister visits him weekly and I try to accompany her as much as possible. He often has bruises, cuts and abrasions of his hands, face and ears from charging into things or hitting himself. He once hit himself with an object hard enough to open up his scalp which took several months to heal completely due to recurrent trauma. I love my nephew. I see Cannabidiol as his best chance at a better quality of life. Nothing will make him \"normal\", but Cannabidiol might make him more at peace with himself. Please amend the rules to include severe, intractable adult as well as pediatric autism with self-injurious or aggressive behavior. Sincerely, Kathryn Sbiral 132 Hanna "}
