It is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy and regulates blood sugar (1). Diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn't make enough insulin or when the body does not effectively use the insulin it produces (3). Herbs have traditionally been used to assist a person to come back to a healthy state of well being. Individual herbs, specifically prescribed for a particular situation may assist the body to come back into balance, thereby allowing a healthy homeostasis to be reinstated as nature intended. The herbalist looks to the whole person, their values and attitudes as well as their circumstances and physical condition along with other aspects of their individuality. This is in marked contrast to the allopathic medicine approach. Below you will find an example of selected herbs for a particular condition. Herbal support can take a variety of forms and combinations, so it is vital that each person consult directly with a qualified holistic practitioner to gain the full benefit of immunity and health building support. We all know about the Pancreas because we know it is involved in diabetes and that it is somehow responsible for managing blood sugar through producing a substance called insulin. While the Liver and Kidneys are crucial organs and we cannot survive without them working, there are all sorts of other member organs involved in our metabolism which don't seem to be so critical. These include the Pituitary, Thyroid, Spleen and Adrenals as well as the pancreas. Life can continue, even with serious damage to one or more of these organs, as the other partners share amongst them some of the load but these secondary organs are by no means unnecessary and perfect health cannot be experienced without all member organs being healthy, supported and working well. There is a finely balanced harmony between all the systems of the body including all the organs above and the other major systems like the Urogenital System, the Digestive System, the Nervous System, the Cardio Vascular System and the Immune System. Hormonal and nervous system messages are being exchanged between each system and the individual members of each system constantly, all aimed at tuning the entire metabolism to respond to the day to day and moment to moment demands of this most complex of machines, the human body. Pancreatic conditions seem to develop in individuals more from emotional causes, than most. In particular, an emotional deficit best described as a lack of sweetness in their lives, and I don't mean a lack of candy. Adult onset diabetes mostly comes on slowly and can be intercepted at any stage of its development if it is caught before regular insulin injection become necessary. If insulin has been used for some time it is more difficult to turn the disease around as the pancreas has shut down completely due to the insulin. Dietary changes and the inclusion of the two most effective herbs into that diet offers a real chance of curing this sort of diabetes and rather than have to look forward to a lifetime of insulin injections it is worth a great deal of effort to make the changes required. The two common herbs supportive of the pancreas are oats and fennel. Oats as in rolled oats porridge, which used to be a breakfast staple before the introduction of a myriad of less healthy, highly sugared and processed breakfast cereals. Fennel as in fennel seeds which can be eaten a pinch at a time as is common practice after meals right through Asia and the Middle East. I see the pancreas as a more sensitive organ than most and when treating it, I rely on herbs to support the associated systems as much as those supporting the pancreas itself. This approach seems to work well and the pancreas seems to function best when all its metabolic partners are happy. Sensible diet and eating patterns with oats included daily, are normally sufficient, along with the herbal tonic, to stabilise the illness and prevent it developing to require daily insulin injections. The long term emotional/ relationship situation in which a Diabetes sufferer finds themselves, and which is most often is a significant factor in the illness, may be the most difficult factor stopping ones ability to get completely over diabetes but just accepting and being aware of these factors is a help even if one is able to do little about it.
