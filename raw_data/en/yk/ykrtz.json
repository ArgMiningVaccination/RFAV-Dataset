It can also spread through contact with clothing, bedding, and other items used by a person with monkeypox or from respiratory droplets that can be passed through prolonged face-to-face contact, including kissing, cuddling, or sex. People who do not have mpox symptoms cannot spread the virus to others. Anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has mpox is at risk. What should individuals with concerns do?
