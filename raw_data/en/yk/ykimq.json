Gayatri Daily Horoscope- Saturday & Sunday- Saturn Day & Sun Day 09/09-10/2023 * All times are Atlantic Standard Time Energetic Overview Venus is Direct in Leo! Venus stationed retrograde in Leo on 7/22-9/3. Venus entered its pre-retrograde shadow on 6/19 and leaves its retrograde shadow on 10/07. Venus Retrogrades make us turn inward for some heart reflection, especially with Venus in Leo; Leo rules the heart. Venus is standing still all week, preparing to move forward again as she slowly comes back online. This Venus Rx brought lots of break-ups and relationship drama. This will likely continue until Venus clears her Rx shadow in early October. Venus is doing cleanup work. It's likely that the most dramatic part of this Venus Rx cycle comes this week, as Uranus, then Jupiter Station Rx. Venus has been in a square with Uranus and Jupiter in Taurus throughout her Rx cycle. Now, these planets are turning back toward Venus as she also approaches them! When planets approach each other, it increases the intensity of the planetary expressions. If relationships and partnerships are exploding, imploding, and ending, the Universe is trying to course-correct us! Jupiter is the Greater Benefic, working to support us in our spiritual karma. Uranus is the Great Awakener, asking us to open our minds, see things from a different perspective, and try something new! Jupiter and Uranus in Taurus are working with us to reflect on our value systems and self-esteem. These planets, retrograding now, are asking us to reflect on what we have learned. Mercury is also retrograde in Virgo! Mercury rules Virgo, so this does bring some support to this Mercury Rx! I have seen LOTS of glitches in technology! My phone has been acting weird! This is a fantastic retrograde for getting work accomplished! Do projects that you've been avoiding, get organized, and do a deep cleaning! There can be an element of feeling like it's Ground Hog Day, living the same day over and over again. There's a lesson here. Mars is in Libra now. The South Node is also in Libra. This energy can feel extremely draining and intense! Mars is the only planet moving forward, not preparing to retrograde! The South Node pulls Mars into old patterns and habits or can point out where he needs to rebalance some area of life that has gotten extremely out of balance. We have been counting on Mars to guide us through this time, but now he's starting to crack under pressure! Step back, slow down, and try to avoid traps from the past. If you see yourself getting into an old habit, way of thinking, or behavior, correct it quickly! This time can also bring back good habits that we need to reintegrate into our lives now! Mars in Libra is ruled by Venus, now Stationary Direct! September is here! The personal planets are moving into the signs of Autumn, with the exception of Venus wrapping up in Leo! We are beginning to see and feel the seasonal changes this month. I am looking forward to this month. We moved through some serious intensity over the last few months, and September gives us some time to regroup. I'm also very much looking forward to the Autumn Equinox! The only downer is that we will be entering Eclipse Season mid-month. We will begin to feel the influence of these Eclipes for a month on either side of the Eclipse! We are in a year of mixed Eclipses, so we will have the first Libra Solar Eclipse and the final Taurus Lunar Eclipse! This Lunar Eclipse will officially wrap up the Taurus-Scorpio Eclipse cycle, and it's an INTENSE ONE!! These Eclipses aren't until October, so we have time to prepare! The Yin time of year is growing; welcome in shorter days and longer nights, and add some extra soft lighting to your space. Enjoy the magic of the season! This Weekend: We have a mellow, quiet weekend ahead of us, astrologically. There are no big aspects; we are in the Waning Moon's energy. The Moon is in Cancer all day Saturday and in Leo in the afternoon Sunday, after being void all Sunday morning. This is a great time to focus on matters of home and family. I have been doing some deep cleaning on my home, and it feels so good! I try to do these deep cleanings twice a year before/during the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes. These are magical times to rebalance our energies. Next week is BIG again! We enter Eclipse Season again with the New Moon in Virgo next week. We begin to feel the Eclipse energy working a month before and up to a month after the actual Eclipses! Mercury Stations Direct, just after the Virgo New Moon, and Venus has her final square to Jupiter 3/3 Venus-Jupiter squares! This helps wrap up the Venus Rx stories we've been working through since mid-June! Saturday: The Moon is in Cancer all day today. Focus on matters of home, family, self-care, and gentleness. Make your home feel warm and cozy, clean, and organize your space. Tap a nap if needed! This is great energy for snuggling in bed. Some of us may just need to stop and regroup; this is a fantastic time for rejuvenation and laying low. The Moon is in Cancer; the Moon in Cancer is sensitive, emotional, instinctual, sentimental, memory-retentive, nurturing, self-protective, and family/mother/home-oriented. Moon in Cancer sextiles Jupiter Rx in Taurus at 7:38 a.m.; this is a lovely, peaceful aspect. The Moon and Jupiter are working together to help us enjoy life a little more. Enjoy a slow, gentle morning. Moon in Cancer sextiles the Sun in Virgo at 9:49 a.m.; the Moon and Sun are working together in harmony. This is an aspect of helpful friends, being of service to others, and most importantly, being of service to yourself! Moon in Cancer squares Chiron Rx in Aries at 2:34 pm; have a good cry and take a nap if you need to! This aspect can show up as explosive anger, frustration, and rage. Our anger is our own responsibility; self-control is imperative now. This aspect invites us to work on tasks that we've been avoiding, whether physical or emotional. Moon in Cancer sextiles Uranus Rx in Taurus at 10:34 pm; this is a lovely aspect for emotional upgrades, seeing things in a new and different way, and adapting to new circumstances. Sunday: The Moon wraps up in Cancer mid-morning, and the Moon is void of course until midday! Get any important tasks accomplished before the void Moon. Void Moons are great for relaxing or working behind the scenes. The Moon enters Leo this afternoon. Moon in Cancer trines Neptune Rx in Pisces at 5:36 am; the Moon and Neptune are flowing together in harmony. This is an emotional, watery time. Pay attention to your dreams! Moon in Cancer opposes Pluto Rx in Capricorn at 8:47 a.m.; this is a harsh aspect! It often shows up as angry arguments, power struggles, power plays, and bullying. This is NOT a great time to pick a fight! Avoid overly aggressive people. The Moon goes void with the square to Pluto. During void Moons, disputes and arguments can go overboard and spiral out of control! They turn ugly quickly, and nothing gets resolved! Domestic problems can spike now due to the Cancer-Capricorn opposition. The Moon goes void of course at 8:47 a.m. and lasts until midday. Unplug from drama, let anger float by you, and you'll be happier and smarter in the long run! I often feel triggered during void Moons; then I remember that the Moon is void, laugh, and disengage from the battle. I'd rather do \"battle\" when there can be a resolution(once the Moon enters the next sign.) The Moon enters Leo at 12:36 pm; the Moon in Leo is warm-hearted, loyal, generous, dramatic, proud, regal, paternalistic, creative, and dominating. We are entering the Dark Moon phase now; pull back, reflect, and do protection work. Moon in Leo inconjuncts Saturn Rx in Pisces at 6:09 pm; uh oh, did we forget to do something important this weekend to prepare us for the week ahead? Use this aspect to double down and get things done so that you have your own back. This week is sure to be busy, especially after the New Moon energies get going! This Week: 9/11-9/17 We have another BIG week ahead! The first few days of the week are mellow as we navigate the Dark Moon energies. Focus on cleansing and clearing the energies around yourself, your home, and your workspaces. The Sun inconjuncts Chiron, bringing a matter of importance to our attention. This is a matter dealing with our health and healing. Take any health issues that come up seriously! On Thursday, we have the Virgo New Moon, which also opens the gates to Eclipse Season! We have the last 2 Eclispes of the year in October, so the intensity is ramping up yet again! On Friday, Mercury Stations Direct! Finally! The Virgo New Moon helps to free up Mercury and gets things moving again! On Sunday, we have the final Venus Jupiter square! This is the final of three squares that we have been working through with Venus and Jupiter through Venus's Rx cycle. This energy wants the finer things in life; treat yourself to something nice! Maybe something that you've had your eye on goes on sale! Try to avoid overdoing those indulgences, though! Venus in Leo and Jupiter in Taurus can really go overboard! This brings some solutions and culminations to Venus' Retrograde. We are beginning to wrap up these storylines and move on. We still have the Venus Uranus square to work through, but we are moving forward now! Monday: Sun inconjuncts Chiron; we have some healing work to do! The Sun in Virgo highlights exactly where that is and makes us pay attention. We could experience this energy as an illness, inflammation, or an inner soul wound that has flared up. Tap into your Divine connection; we don't have to do it alone. The Moon is in Leo all day; we are in the Dark Moon energy now; turn inward. Tuesday: The Moon wraps up in Leo late this morning and is VOID OF COURSE for the rest of the day!!!! Wrap up any important work this morning, then enjoy a dreamy afternoon. The evening energies tonight do not look like fun; avoid socializing tonight, go home, and regroup. The void Leo Moon is grumpy tonight! Unplug and avoid arguments and disputes; it's a waste of time under the void Moon energies. A void Moon and Dark Moon combo isn't awesome. Many people will undo themselves tonight if they are out and about or looking for trouble! Wednesday: The Moon enters Virgo early this morning. We are moving into the New Moon energies but are still wrapping up the Dark Moon times. Clean and organize your closets and junk drawers; don't waste these dutiful Virgo Moons! Thursday: Happy Virgo New Moon! This New Moon is at 21*59' of Virgo! We have to wait until tonight to enjoy the New Moon energies, but they are welcome! It's a pretty quiet New Moon. Mercury, the ruler of the New Moon, is Stationing and will move Direct tomorrow afternoon, so this is great news for the Virgo part of our charts! This New Moon is getting lots of support from Uranus and Jupiter, so we are ready to initiate those changes that have been waiting in the wings. The Moon is in Virgo all day. Friday: Happy Mercury Direct! Mercury Stations Direct in its home sign of Virgo, at 8*08' of Virgo. Mercury will be in its Retrograde Shadow until 9/28. I'm just glad it's coming to an end, lol! I think Mercury will slurp down its coffee and get moving pretty quickly. Groundhog Day is officially over! Sun trines Uranus; this aspect brings in some significant energetic upgrades! Both the Sun and Uranus are ready to initiate change. Virgo is a Mutable Earth sign, which means it's ready to make changes as needed! Like sand on the beach. Uranus has been shaking up Taurus, the most fixed Earth sign in the zodiac, and even Taurus is ready to make some upgrades and changes! If Taurus thinks of it as upgrading rather than changing, this can help with the transition! The Moon wraps up in Virgo late this morning, has a few hour-long void Moon, then enters Libra this afternoon. Normally, I'd be thrilled about a Libra Moon, but the South Node and Mars are in Libra, and the Moon will have a meeting with both of them. We will need to remember the importance of being diplomatic! Saturday: The Moon is in Libra all day, meeting Mars in a tense exchange this afternoon. We are building up to the Venus Jupiter square all day today! Sunday: Venus squares Uranus for the 3rd and final time! This square is exact very early this morning, so we will really feel the build-up on Saturday. Venus and Jupiter want the best things life has to offer, and sometimes, we have to make the best of things ourselves! We can expect more relationship news, breakups, reconciliations, and new partnerships! Remember, we are in Eclipse Season now, so this is BIG energy. Breakups are final(Eclipses do this), and we must trust that we are being led in the direction of our highest good by the Universe! The Moon is in Libra all day, feeling a bit cranky, and goes void late tonight with a tense square to Pluto. Create a sacred sleep space before going to bed tonight, and as always, make sure that you feel safe! Daily Oracle Saturday & Sunday 9/09-10/2023 Raccoon- Generous Protector If Raccoon wandered into your cards today, the little bandit may be telling you to look around and see who needs your strength at this time. Speak up in defense of another instead of remaining silent when others are gossiping. Maybe it is time to share the bounty of your time, energy, or possessions with the less fortunate. But remember to help those in need develop their own protector and provider skills. In all cases, Raccoon asks that you honor yourself and others equally. Provide for your own needs, or your well will be dry when you choose to give generously. Chiefs earn their Eagle feathers when they promote every human's right to self-dignity; acting in this manner brings that same honor to yourself and to your family. Malachite Essential meaning: Clarity of thought and emotions, the right use of intellect, integrating thoughts and intuition. Malachite is a beautiful stone that helps integrate our personal power, hearts, and intellect simultaneously. It allows us to come from a place of authority without losing sight of what is for the highest good of all. It is a useful stone to work with when exploring issues around the next right action in families and organizations. Orange Sapphire Essential Meaning: Joy in sensuality, respecting your body, body love. Orange Sapphire is very effective in stimulating the second or sacral chakra. It can assist those who desire to experience sensuality in life as well as get the creative juices flowing. It asks us to explore the world through our senses; silken fabrics, chocolate melting on the tongue, the feel of finger paints as we create on a canvas. Meditate with this crystal when you start a creative peoject or when you want to feel more sensual. **There have been some changes with my website provider. I cannot figure out how to delete the malachite card below. It is not showing on my editor but on the live site! Ahh! I'll remove it when I figure it out. In the meantime, we have prolonged malachite spirit messages coming through. Mercury Retrograde! Tips & Donations - THANK YOU! Thank you for supporting my work!

Dark colors, especially black, tend to absorb energy. That's the last thing that we want to do right now! Red is a powerful and commanding color. It is also very protective. White is the color of purity. Green is the color of health and healing. If you are wearing blue, make it royal blue or light blue. Purple is called the Feng Shui beige because it works to your benefit in most scenarios, being a higher octave of red. Bedroom Feng Shui I love the look of plants in the bedroom, but did you know that it is said that plants in the bedroom drain your energy? Humans are considered to be an Earth element. Plants are the Wood element. In the 5 Element theory, Wood drains Earth energy. As always, do what is best for you! Take a look at your energy levels; if you have plants, pictures of flowers, or even plant patterns on your bedsheets, maybe begin trading them out. Bedrooms do best with neutral colors, earthy colors. "}
