SDI Productions / Getty Images 2-Month Vaccinations While babies are born with a fairly strong immune system, there are some diseases that can be severe and are hard to fight on their own. Vaccinations are given to help their immune system prevent these diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an immunization schedule that includes six vaccinations for 2-month old babies. Most vaccinations are given as a shot. However, the rotavirus vaccine (RV) is given by mouth through liquid drops. Alternate Names for Vaccinations Vaccinations may also be referred to as:InnoculationInjectionShotVaccineImmunization Comforting Your Baby Write down questions you have and bring available shot records with you to the appointment. It's also helpful to pack your baby's favorite toy, pacifier, or blanket to comfort them during the visit. During the appointment, you can help your baby by: Holding themDistracting them with toys or singingSmiling and whispering reassuring words After the appointment, you can comfort your baby by: Breastfeeding or bottle-feeding Offering a pacifier Swaddling with their favorite blanket Giving them Tylenol (acetaminophen) as needed for pain if approved by your healthcare provider How Much Tylenol Does Your Child Need? Diphtheria, Tetanus, Acellular Pertussis (DTaP) The DTaP vaccination is given in five doses. The first dose begins at 2-months and the final at 4-6 years old. DTaP helps prevent the following diseases: Diphtheria Tetanus Pertussis (whooping cough) Is it DTaP or Tdap? Both the DTaP and Tdap are vaccines that protect against the same diseases. The first five doses given are the DTaP. Tdap is the booster given around 11 years or older. How the DTaP Vaccine Helps Protect Against Infectious Diseases Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (Hib) Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) is often confused with seasonal influenza (flu) because of their similar names. However, these are two different diseases. Seasonal influenza is a virus, while Hib is a bacteria that can cause: Meningitis Pneumonia (lung infection) Sepsis (bloodstream infection) Epiglottitis (swelling in the upper airway or windpipe) The Hib vaccine is scheduled as three or four doses depending on the brand. It is given at the following ages: 2 months4 months6 months (if needed depending on vaccine brand)12-14 months Hib Statistics Between 1989 and 2000, Hib rates in the United States dropped by 99% due to vaccinations. Polio Vaccine (IPV) In the late 1940s, polio was a highly feared disease that caused paralysis. After polio vaccinations, infections in the U.S. decreased dramatically. Children in the U.S. get a shot called an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Other countries may use an oral polio vaccine (OPV). IPV is given over four doses at the following ages: 2 months4 months6-18 months4-6 years Polio Cases in the United States No cases of polio have originated in the U.S since 1979. In 1993 one case came into the country through travel. Healthcare providers may choose to increase the pace of polio vaccines for children traveling to a high-risk country. Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) protects against a bacterial infection that causes ear or sinus infections, meningitis, and pneumonia. The PCV vaccine is given in four doses at the following ages: 2 months4 months 6 months12-15 months Pneumococcal Disease Streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus are bacteria that cause pneumococcal disease. Immunization against these diseases is important because they can be invasive and severe. Hepatitis B (HBV) Hepatitis B (HBV) is a potentially serious viral infection that causes damage to the liver. It is passed through body fluids or from mother to baby. The hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) is given in three doses at the following ages: Shortly after birth1-2 months 6-18 months Protecting Your Baby from Hepatitis B After Delivery Moms can have hepatitis B without symptoms and unknowingly pass it to their babies at birth. This is why infants usually receive the first dose within the first 12 hours of their life. Rotavirus (RV) Rotavirus (RV) is a gastrointestinal virus that causes stomach pain, severe vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration (loss of fluid). The RV vaccination is given as drops in the mouth. There are two brands of this vaccine. One brand is given at 2- and 4-months-old. The other brand includes a third dose given at 6-months-old. Side Effects If babies experience side effects after vaccines they are usually mild. The most common side effects include: Soreness, redness, or swelling at the site of the shot Low-grade fever (100-102 degrees or lower) Less common side effects include: Fussiness or irritabilityLoss of appetiteDiarrhea or vomiting What About Severe Side Effects? Severe side effects or allergic reactions are very rare. If you are concerned about this possibility, talk to your healthcare provider before the appointment. What to Do If Your Baby Has Side Effects To help minimize mild reactions, you can try the following: A cool cloth to reduce redness and swelling A room temperature sponge bath for low-grade feversFeed your baby more often for comfort and hydrationGive Tylenol (acetaminophen) if approved by your pediatrician Medications to Reduce Fever and Discomfort Motrin or Advil (ibuprofen) is usually not given to babies less than 6-months-old. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is safe for infants 2-months-old and up with approval from their healthcare provider. Children should not receive aspirin unless directed by their healthcare provider. Dosage for Infants' Tylenol When to Contact the Pediatrician If your baby has any of the following symptoms, contact their healthcare provider: Fever greater than 104 degreesRedness at the shot site larger than 1 inch or lasting longer than three daysHigh-pitched crying lasting over one hourNonstop crying for three hours or moreFussiness for more than three days Severe vomiting or diarrhea When to Call 911 If you think your infant is having a life-threatening emergency or any of the following rare reactions, call 911 immediately: Trouble breathing Trouble swallowing Lethargy (not moving or very weak) Not waking up Seizures Can a Baby Have Deadly Reactions to Vaccinations? Summary Vaccinations are usually given at an infant's 2-month wellness visit to help protect them from preventable diseases. You can help comfort your baby by holding them and offering them their favorite blanket, pacifier, or toy. Vaccination side effects are generally mild and can be treated at home to ease any discomfort. A Word From Verywell Parents are often concerned about their infants having reactions to vaccinations. While mild reactions to vaccinations may occur, severe reactions are very rare. Don't be shy about talking to your healthcare provider if you have any concerns. Overall, the benefits of vaccinations (and being vaccinated early in life) far outweigh the risks.
