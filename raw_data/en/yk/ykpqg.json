This process includes fee agreement, staking, slashing, voting, and more. For example, an oracle or blockchain must stake HMT via the Routing Layer to operate in the network. The Execution Layer fulfils the on-chain execution of the various work and responsibilities that the Routing Layer has discovered, assigned and distributed. For example, Workers complete their tasks via the Execution Layer. Every user has a unique requirement on HUMAN Protocol. Smart Routes are the individual connections you make when you engage with HUMAN Protocol. A community-led initiative to help you learn, grow, gain experience & receive rewards. [Learn more](/ops) 600MM tasks solved (Q4 2022-Q1 2023). Where HUMANs complete jobs. Anyone in a verified country can earn HMT by signing up, referring friends, and solving jobs. By using the App, Workers are brought closer to the rewards of their work; and Requesters gain access to diverse work pools capable of completing increasingly difficult work Scalable bot protection for the Web 3.0 world. Proof of HUMANity uses a CAPTCHA to verify a user's humanity on-chain, protecting the from bots. Applicable to DApps, DEXs, DeFi, NFT auctions, governance, and more. HUMAN Global Queries extends the core functionality of the Protocol to create applications capable of truly global question and response systems. The first Global Queries application, Ask Athena, is a market research tool with powerful A/B testing, multiple choice, and data scraping functionalities. The wide variety of grants reflects the uniquely flexible qualities of HUMAN Protocol. From AMM in DeFi, to content moderation, bounty creation in Web3 ecosystems, and rewarding customer reviews, HUMAN Protocol facilitates a wide range of new economic opportunities. Powering AI products that can truly benefit the future of humankind. A research institute of internationally renowned and award-winning scientists seeking to find cures.
