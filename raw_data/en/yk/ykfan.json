Feeling generally low-energy? If you are looking for supplements to raise your natural energy levels, you're in luck. This year, the best energy supplements are evolving to help you increase energy levels in a cleaner, healthier way. In this article, we're going to discuss the latest advancements in energy supplements across both stim-free and caffeinated formulas, concluding with the best energy products you can buy on the market today. Let's get to it! Today's best stim-free energy supplements now boost vitality on a cellular level. Advanced energy formulas are now maximizing vitality by targeting mitochondria: The \"powerhouse\" organelles within cells that take in nutrients, break them down, and use them to produce energy. By optimizing mitochondria -- helping to protect, produce, fuel and multiply them within cells -- supplements unleash a whole-body power surge, helping with both physical and mental fatigue. Today's best stim-free energy supplements unleash a different kind of vitality boost: - Clean, revitalizing and natural energy boost without stimulation - No crashes, jitters, irritability or other booster side effects - Revitalizing nootropic benefits for mental energy - Physical vitality benefits for strength, endurance and more - Metabolic weight loss benefits: burns energy stored in fat while keeping energy in muscle - High energy levels without super-stimulation and its related side effects Of course, many people still prefer caffeine stimulation as their energy-booster of choice. There's good news in this category as well, because caffeine-driven energy booster supplements are evolving, too. Today's best energy supplements with caffeine produce cleaner stimulation. The days of megadose caffeine-powered energy supplements are gone. Now, advanced stim-driven formulas are increasing energy levels in a cleaner, healthier and more comfortable way. Some features of today's top stim-driven energy supplements: - Precision-dose caffeine, helping users to find their \"sweet spot\" dosage associated with the best stimulatory effects. - Caffeine + L-Theanine. L-Theanine helps promote a state of [wakeful relaxation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681988), taking the edge off caffeine stimulation while allowing its alertness benefits to shine. - Restorative nutrients: Caffeine is associated with [nutrient depletion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279923885_Effects_of_caffeine_on_health_and_nutrition_A_Review). Today's best stim supplements are designed to help restore what caffeine takes away, so you get the alertness benefits without running low on essential vitamins and minerals. - Brain chemical support: Stimulation burns through [more neurotransmitters more quickly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12633594). A little extra support for these brain chemicals is now being included in caffeine pills to promote a healthier stimulation experience. Now that we've discussed the cutting-edge features of today's leading stim-free and stim-driven energy pills, let's take a look at some of the best energizing ingredients. The short list of the best ingredients found in today's top energy boosting supplements are: - Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) Caffeine (Boosted with B-Complex, L-Theanine and L-Tyrosine) - Vitamins & minerals, or simply a [good multivitamin supplement](https://www.performancelab.com/products/nutrigenesis-multi-men) Each of these ingredients can support healthy energy levels when taken solo. However, the real magic happens when they are taken as ultramodern new forms and combined into a supercharged energy stack. Let's learn more about each of these energy booster supplement ingredients, one by one. See the Best Natural Energy Supplement [Click Here](https://performancelab.com/products/energy) Best Individual Energy Supplements Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) Coenzyme Q10 is a pseudovitamin that helps support energy production in many ways. CoQ10 plays a crucial role in [bioenergetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17914161): The flow and transformation of energy across all biological life forms. This vitamin-like coenzyme powers bioenergetic activity by [sparking chemical reactions within cells](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.115.002639) that produce ATP energy, as well as shuttling energy substrates across mitochondrial membranes. CoQ10 also helps fight fatigue and raise cell energy throughout the entire body by: - Stimulating the body's ability to [create fresh new mitochondria](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/CoQ10-triggers-mitochondrial-biogenesis-in-ONH-astrocytes-that-counters-oxidative-stress_fig3_257349639)within cells - Converting into a potent [mitochondria-protective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4025630/)antioxidant Part of CoQ10's bioenergetic role is that it is a cofactor required by mitochondria to convert macronutrients into ATP natural energy in the body's cells. CoQ10's energizing effects are associated with health and vitality, especially in the context of high-energy organs like the heart and brain. CoQ10 may boost energy on a cellular level. Ever feel drained from physical and mental stress? Research has suggested CoQ10 supplementation may help to reduce feelings of mental and physical fatigue and [enhance performance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18272335). Early evidence from animal [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27864103/) also suggests it may support nitric oxide production, helping to relax blood vessels and promote circulation. For these reasons, CoQ10 is sometimes taken in combination with pre workout dietary supplements. How to take CoQ10 for Energy: MicroActive\u00ae Q10 + BioPerine\u00ae Black Pepper Extract is a remarkable energy nutrient. Without CoQ10, biological life-form energy could not even exist. We are capable of naturally producing our own CoQ10. We can also get it from food, although it is mostly present in organ meats that few people eat. And, CoQ10 declines with age. CoQ10 supplements are the answer. However, CoQ10 is [notoriously difficult](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6306788/) to absorb and utilize, especially in older adults. To get its full energizing potential, take CoQ10 as advanced MicroActive\u00ae Q10 and combine it with BioPerine\u00ae Black Pepper Extract. - MicroActive\u00ae Q10 is easy to absorb CoQ10. Research has shown that MicroActive\u00ae Q10 absorbs quickly, sustains release over 24 hours, and [doubles blood CoQ10 levels within 3 weeks](https://bioactives.com/product-list/microactive_coq10/)when taken daily. - BioPerine\u00ae is a patented form of black pepper extract, long prized in Ayurvedic medicine, that boosts nutrient absorption. Research has suggested BioPerine\u00ae is a cofactor that helps increase energy production in cells via mitochondria optimization. PQQ helps mitochondria in a couple of Mitochondria an antioxidant free radical-fighting power](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/130/4/719/4686720)of vitamin C, protecting mitochondria and preserving their energy efficiency Get on board. Sign up for emails to get more information. - Mitochondria Biogenesis: PQQ has been shown in clinical research to boost the [number of mitochondria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804159/)within cells, helping the body produce energy. When considering supplements to buy for stim-free energy, CoQ10 and PQQ are two of the best mitochondria boosters that may work even better together than when taken alone. Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) ALCAR is an amino acid that plays a crucial role cell energy by fueling mitochondria. If a cell is like a car, and gasoline is nutrition, then ALCAR is like the gas pump. When it is taken as a supplement, ALCAR migrates to mitochondrial membranes. Here, it works by ushering long-chain fatty acids across the membrane and into the mitochondria. Continuing with the car metaphor, ALCAR funnels fuel substrates into cell powerhouses (mitochondria), where they are \"combusted\" to produce the ATP energy that powers our lives. ALCAR also escorts waste products out of mitochondria - helping them to function efficiently; as well as reducing the damaging effects of free radicals on mitochondria. R-Lipoic Acid R-Lipoic Acid is a coenzyme that is naturally produced within mitochondria that plays critical roles in cell energy metabolism. It has been suggested to: - Enhance mitochondria [structure and performance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3600316/) - Protect mitochondria directly and indirectly by boosting antioxidants - Promote healthy activity of enzymes involved in mitochondrial function Researchers have suggested Lipoic Acid, ACLAR and CoQ10 are [leading mitochondrial nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4264162/) for supporting overall health and wellness. In supplement form, R-Lipoic acid is available as Bio-Enhanced\u00ae that helps eliminate gastric side effects and maximize bioavailability. Vitamins & Minerals (or a good multivitamin supplement) You may know essential nutrients for being present in a healthy diet and promoting all-round health benefits. But some essential and minerals are also incredibly important for cellular energy production: Iron supplements: Iron deficiency anemia can [diminish your natural energy levels](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/iron-deficiency-anemia). This is because iron is required for red blood cells to transport oxygen, which the body's cells \"burn\" in order to generate energy. Iron deficiency is easily corrected with iron supplements. B-Vitamins: The B-complex vitamins support many aspects of wellness, including robust blood flow, mental performance and keeping nerve cells healthy. In addition, the B-complex -- especially vitamin B12 -- help catalyze cell energy. B12 is [found in](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/) animal foods, so if you are vegan it is likely a good idea to take this key energy nutrient as a supplement. Vitamin D: Low levels of vitamin D have been [associated with](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5207540/) feelings of fatigue. Taking supplements and getting more sunshine can help restore healthy vitamin D levels, which supports not only energy, but also the immune system. Magnesium: This mineral is a key cofactor in over [300 life-sustaining biological activities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5637834/) in the human body. Among those bioactivities are the production of energy, which cannot occur if magnesium is not present. Magnesium supplements offer a bonus for energy: their muscle-relaxing effects help slumber in those with difficulty falling asleep. Best Energy Supplements for Chronic Fatigue Many more people are now seeking energy supplements for [Chronic Fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279099): a miserable set of symptoms including tiredness, pain, exhaustion after exercise, brain fog, cortisol stress hormone dysfunction, lack of enough sleep and others. The following supplements may help: - CoQ10: When studied in conjunction with a nutrient called NADH, it has also been [suggested to help with](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346380/)chronic fatigue syndrome. - Magnesium: One [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3617392/)analyzed 26 research studies and found that, of the 17 supplements evaluated, only two appeared to help -- one was a magnesium supplement. - Vitamin B12 and B9: Some [research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009)suggests B12 + B9 supplements can help to relieve the brain fog that often accompanies chronic fatigue. Chronic fatigue can be difficult to manage, but the right lifestyle changes, dietary choices and supplements may help to bring significant improvements to your energy levels. Now that we've covered some of the best individual ingredients for naturally raising your energy levels, let's look at the high-quality supplements that deliver them most effectively. Best Stim-Free Energy Supplement Performance Lab\u00ae Energy Performance Lab\u00ae Energy combines all of the stim-free energy boosters we just discussed, all in their most advanced forms, into one clean, vegan-friendly capsule: - MicroActive\u00ae Q10 (CoQ10), - Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR), 750 mg - BioPerine\u00ae Black Pepper Extract, 2.5 mg - Bio-Enhanced\u00ae R-Lipoic Acid, 150 mg Because it features all of the best nutrients for improving mitochondrial function, Performance Lab\u00ae Energy can boost your cell vitality like no other vitamins and supplements can.

[Get the Best Performance Lab\u00ae Energy Deal Now](https://performancelab.com/products/energy) Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCT) Our #1-recommended energy supplement Performance Lab\u00ae Energy has a strong mitochondrial focus. As a vitality booster, Performance Lab\u00ae Energy may work even better when combined with mitochondria-optimizing Medium-chain triglycerides, or MCTs. Medium-Chain Triglycerides work by raising levels of compounds called ketones. MCT and ketones help mitochondria by: Serving as an efficient fuel source. MCT ketone fuel enters mitochondria more easily, serving as as fuel mitochondria to Performance Lab\u00ae MCT oil There are four medium-chain triglycerides that you will see in supplements: - C6 - Caproic Acid - C8 - Caprylic Acid - C10 - Capric Acid - C12 - Lauric Acid Coconut oil supplies all four of these MCTs. The problem is, C6 and C12 are associated with gastric distress. And besides, they are not even the best of the MCTs for energy and mitochondrial support. Coconuts aren't commonly found in a balanced diet, either! Further, coconut oil can be sold in low-quality forms, including from genetically modified coconuts, potentially produced in mass agriculture via unnatural means. Performance Lab\u00ae MCT oil is the cleanest, most efficient mind-body MCT fuel -- and the best overall for energy supplement applications. Performance Lab\u00ae MCT supplies only the most important C8/C10 MCTs from 100% non-GMO organic coconuts. This helps unlock peak MCT metabolic benefits without the gastric distress concerns of C6/C12 MCTs in plain coconut oil or inferior-quality MCT formulas. As an energy supplement, Performance Lab\u00ae MCT oil is great as: - Fast-acting performance fuel to boost energy, cognition and metabolic function - An optimizer and protector of brain cells' powerhouse mitochondria - Fuel for mind-body vitality during intense exercise and fasted training - Boosts energy quickly to help replace physical and mental fatigue with clean power - Helps with all fat loss and diet programs, including ketogenic lifestyles [Get the Best Performance Lab\u00ae MCT Deal Now](https://performancelab.com/products/mct) Performance Lab\u00ae MCT is also a great energy supplement because it works in ways that promotes health benefits, rather than diminishing your health (like some other energy formulas).
