In fact, we also need to better understand our patients. This issue of Paths of Progress contains two articles that illustrate this point. One focuses on \"exceptional responders\" - patients who, against all odds and expectations, benefit from experimental drugs that failed for nearly every other patient with a similar tumor. For years, such out-of-the-blue successes baffled researchers. Only now, with the development of gene-reading technology, have we come to appreciate how fundamentally different a kidney tumor, say, can be from one patient to another. The difference may be a mutation in only one or two genes, but that slight variation can explain why one patient' s tumor responds to a certain drug while another patient' s doesn't. Exceptional responders are teaching scientists a great deal about which patients are likely - or unlikely - to benefit from gene-targeting therapies. A second article in this issue takes a cultural and economic per- spective on patient differences. It describes Dana-Farber' s recently completed Community Health Needs Assessment, which investi-gated why cancer mortality rates for blacks in Boston are higher than for whites, and how the cancer burden for underprivileged groups can be reduced. Recognizing the roots of these disparities is a critical step in working to eliminate them. As you'll read, the Institute leads a variety of outreach efforts to increase medically underserved people' s access to cancer screening, treatment, and preventive services. These articles, as well as the other feature stories and shorter pieces on individual patients and staff, are testimony to the diver-sity of work being done at Dana-Farber, the people who perform it, and the people who benefit from it. The human response to cancer - the experience of patients as well as researchers and clinicians - is inseparable from the disease itself. Edward J.

To date, 19 research-ers have received 26 Awards to overcome the hurdles that can accompany such challenges. The fund was established by Dana-Farber Trustee Gloria Spivak in 2008 within the Office for Faculty Development (OFD)under the direction of Glo-rian Sorensen, PhD, MPH. \"The award provided me with important funding when I was at a make-or-break point,\" says Stacy Gray, MD, a medical oncologist. In 2008, Gray, her husband, and their two children under age five moved to Boston, leaving behind her research career at the University of Penn-sylvania. She had to rebuild research collaborations and Spivak Fund Supports Scientists at a Pivotal Time wasn't yet a candidate for career development funding. With Spivak funding, Gray hired a research assistant to work with her to start her projects here, do the data collection, and serve as an extra pair of hands. The funding was for one year and renewable for a second year. During that pivotal time, Gray launched three projects related to the public' s understanding of personal-ized medicine concepts, physicians' use of genetic testing, and how personalized medicine is represented on the Internet and in the media. Jennifer Ligibel, MD, applied for the Spivak Award after she had received a small grant for an ambi-tious research project, but lacked the funding to hire a research assistant to coordinate the multi-institu-tion study.

Scientists identified additional challenges in treating cancers driven by - and dependent on - the mutated cancer gene KRAS.

A significant subset of patients with a rare gastro-intestinal tumor may find long-term benefits from targeted therapy with the drug imatinib (brand name Gleevec \u00ae), according to a new study. Clinical trial analysis suggests the use of a combi-nation drug therapy may be highly effective in treating recurrent ovarian cancer. A new research collabo- ration is working to find which lung cancer patients are most likely to benefit from a new generation of immuno-therapies and which therapies hold the most promise. Dana-Farber researchers unravelled a mystery of brain cell growth, uncovering how a single protein helps nerve cells find their assigned places in the brain' s wiring. outpatients could be mo-tivated to become more active by speaking with an exercise coach by phone. Those who received the counseling did exercise more, becoming stronger and able to walk longer distances and generally felt better. Still, Ligibel observed, they didn't stick to the program as closely as did cancer patients in anoth-er study who had personal coaching in the hospital. \"It was a really important study and it led to our de-veloping a partnership with YMCAs to have exercise coaching at external sites,\" says Ligibel.

Recklitis wondered if ap- pealing to young patients' concerns about their appear-ance might be more effective than warning them about the health consequences of sun exposure. He designed a study using ultraviolet photography to take images that reveal hidden skin dam-age and show them to cancer survivors. \"It shows the spots and wrinkles that are starting to develop - it looks pretty scary,\" Recklitis notes. Preliminary results show the ultraviolet photographs made a strong impression on the patients, who, when contacted later, were more likely to have changed their attitudes toward sun protec-tion than those who only received written instructions, Recklitis says.encourages researchers facing a family challenge at a critical time in their careers to apply for the Spivak Award, which is given annually.

CANCER DICTIONARYArou ND ThE INsTITuTE C ANCE r DIC t IO n ARy Researchers at Dana-Far- ber have identified natural human antibodies against the virus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a newly emerging and often-fatal disease that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The discov-ery may be a key step to-ward developing treatments for MERS, a severe respira-tory disease with a mortality rate of more than 40 percent. Currently there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for the condition. In laboratory studies reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), research-ers found that these \"neutral-izing\" antibodies prevented a key part of the virus, known as MERS CoV (CoV stands for coronavirus), from attaching to protein re-ceptors that allow the virus to infect human cells. The research was led by Wayne Marasco, MD, PhD, profes-sor and scientific director, Center for Human Antibody Therapies at Dana-Farber. Further experiments are under way that could lead to development of antibody preventives and treatments for MERS, according to the scientists. Symptoms of MERS in- fection include cough, fever and shortness of breath, and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. The World Health Organization has recorded more than 250 cases and at least 93 deaths, mainly in countries of the Arabian Peninsula. A num-ber of cases and deaths have been in health care workers and hospital patients. The report in PNAS said laboratory studies of how the virus evolves in response to exposure to neutralizing antibodies suggest that the MERS virus won't easily shape-shift to evade anti-body treatments, as some other viruses do. Marasco' s team found that the same mutations that enabled the MERS virus to escape neutralizing antibodies also weakened the virus' s ability to replicate. Dana-Farber's Wayne Marasco, MD, PhD, is leading research into antibodies that may neutralize the emerging MERS virus.Scientists Identify Antibodies for Emerging Respiratory Disease 7 www.dana-farber.org What diseases can potentially be treated by a pediatric stem cell transplant? Leukemia and lymphoma are the most common reasons for stem cell trans-plantation in children, particularly for high-risk cases, patients who relapse, or cases with certain clinical features. Transplant may also be an option for children with solid tumors, such as neuroblastoma, and, increasingly, for children with blood disorders, immune deficiencies, neurologic diseases, or metabolic disorders. Why is the procedure effective for certain diseases that are not cancer? Children can be born with or develop a noncancerous disease in which a component of the immune system or blood is missing, or elements of these systems are dysfunctional. When we perform a transplant using cells from a donor, the patient receives new blood and immune systems that can cure dis-eases such as ALD, Hurler syndrome, or osteopetrosis. What sets Dana-Farber/Boston Children's apart in terms of stem cell transplants? When a family comes to us for transplant, we tell them we will do everything possible for their child. We mean it. This is a contract we take very seriously. Our program is housed in two extraordinary institu-tions: a leading cancer center and a top children' s hospital. We work closely with geneticists, neurologists, psychologists, pediatric surgeons, im-munologists, and other specialists. We collaborate with lab-based scientists and participate in consortia for clini-cal research, so we can offer the most advanced care. And our nursing care is second to none. What is your research focus? I study the late effects of stem cell transplant. Survivors are at risk for late complications - such as heart disease or learning difficulties - due to their underlying disease and treat-ment. My goals are to understand what causes particular late effects, which survivors are at greatest risk, and what are the best ways to treat these problems, should they develop. How do you support families during the transplant process? A psychosocial practitioner and resource specialist support every family before, during, and after transplant. Stem cell transplant has an enormous emotional and practical impact on the family. It affects a par-ent' s ability to work and care for other children, especially if the family lives a great distance from Boston. What do you enjoy most about your work? I love being part of the changing land- scape of transplant and expanding it to children with non-cancer diagnoses. However, I most enjoy working with families and being part of their child' s transplant process. hristine Duncan, MD, associate clinical director of the Stem Cell Trans- plant Center at Dana-Farber/Boston Children' s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, explains how the benefits of giving a patient new bone marrow can extend beyond cancer - even to rare diseases like adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), subject of the film Lorenzo' s Oil.

Bone marrow transplants, also called hematopoietic stem cell transplants, have been used to treat leukemia and other blood cancers since the early 1970s. First, potent chemotherapy erases a patient' s immune system, then a cancer-free replacement is transplanted from the patient or a donor. The proce-dure can be curative, says Paul Rich-ardson, MD, clinical disease program leader and director of clinical research at the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC), but the procedure is also necessary. Without it, patients like Eve will die of their diseases. Like many aggressive cancer thera- pies, bone marrow transplant (BMT) is not without risk. Tragically, complica-tions such as infections, organ failures, or rejection of the graft can cut short the lives of some patients who may be on the verge of a cure. Some have transplants early while they are still healthy, as a first and only resort, while for others, some very sick, BMT is a last resort. But all who elect for such bold therapy have hope, so Richardson and others at DF/BWCC have dedi-cated their careers to finding ways to protect patients at their most vulner-able moments. Their efforts to improve supportive care have led to new thera-pies that are preventing deaths from the complications of aggressive cancer therapies. At the same time, supportive care research is opening up new avenues for the treatment of cancer itself. Clearing the Way for Cures As a junior attending physician at DF/BWCC in the early 1990s, Richard-son saw his first cases of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver. The condi-tion is caused by chemotherapy prior to BMT that damages the numerous small blood vessels that percolate within the liver. It occurs in a range of patients (varying from 5 to 60 percent, depend-ing on age and health). As a trainee, he' d been told to look out for the disease. \"If it occurs, your patient is very likely to die,\" he recalls being told. The only treatment at the time was a clot-buster that opened the damaged blood vessels, but also caused an unacceptably high rate of life-threatening bleeding. Richardson set out to find another solution. A little-known drug called defibrotide came to his attention. In-stead of busting through blockages, the drug promised to stabilize the linings of blood vessels, shoring up the vessel walls while simultaneously clearing them. With the cooperation of Gen-tium, the small Italian pharmaceutical company that manufactures defibrotide, he gained permission to try the drug for compassionate use. Soon after, a 28-year-old patient developed severe VOD after undergoing BMT to treat relapsed Hodgkin lympho-ma. Her VOD progressed rapidly and the clot-buster did not help. But after 12 days of defibrotide, she improved. Later, with prolonged therapy, she completely recovered. Doctors mobbed around the poster Richardson presented At first, Eve Pallang thought she' d pulled a muscle shoveling snow. Two urgent care visits later, in March 2013, the 33-year-old newly trained nurse learned she had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a highly malignant cancer of the white blood cells. Chemotherapy knocked down the disease, but not completely. She tried an experimental drug, with the hope that it would ready her for the next step in her oncologist' s treatment plan. 11 www.dana-farber.org \"our patients more than anything show us what their needs are.\" - Paul r ichardson, MDabout her case at the 1995 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology. \"It was the first case ever described of a drug working for VOD,\" Richardson says. Richardson and his team expanded their studies to a larger group of patients. Because VOD is an uncom-mon condition that occurs early after transplant when patients are extremely vulnerable, it is challenging to study new drugs for its treatment. Over the years, however, clinical trials showed that defibrotide cut death rates from VOD by about half and raised response rates from less than 10 percent to about 30 to 40 percent. A partnership with a pediatric BMT group at Dana-Farber/Boston Children' s Hospital Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, initially led by Eva Guinan, MD, and then by her colleagues Leslie Lehmann, MD, and Christine Duncan, MD, allowed Richardson and col-leagues to evaluate the drug in children. Children tend to receive higher-dose chemotherapy prior to BMT and to be more vulnerable to VOD. \"Outcomes in Paul Richardson, MD (center, front), and his team in the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at DF/BWCC. 12 Paths of Progress Fall/Winter 2014 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute \"We can't have these patients we're trying to save from cancer die from infections that are diagnosable and preventable.\" - Francisco Marty, MDkids with VOD were as bad as in adults, but with defibrotide, kids seem to do really well,\" says Richardson. In 2006, to gain approval for the drug, Richardson and colleagues designed a phase 3 clinical trial to test defibrotide in patients with severe VOD and advanced multi-organ failure. The study results showed that 24 percent of patients who received defibrotide recovered fully from severe VOD, more than double that of a contemporary and rigorously selected historical control group of patients who did not receive the drug. Based on this data, defibrotide received approval in September 2013 from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of VOD. Approval is still under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), although defibrotide is now available through an expanded access program in the U.S. for patients with less-severe, though still potentially life-threatening, forms of VOD - as was the case for patient Eve Pallang. Within three days of her transplant, Pallang' s petite 110-pound frame had gained 20 pounds from fluid retention and her liver had failed, symptoms of VOD. Richardson and the DF/BWCC BMT study team, Vincent Ho, MD, Philippe Armande, MD, PhD, Joseph Antin, MD, and Robert Soiffer, MD, recommended defibrotide. Within two weeks, the weight was coming off and her liver had returned to normal. \"It worked,\" says Pallang. \"I was just so happy that I was fortunate enough to receive it.\" Infection Fighter Another barrier to BMT successes are infections. Infectious disease doc-tor Francisco Marty, MD, got his start supporting cancer patients with infec-tions in the early 2000s. During his fellowship, he couldn't help but notice the guesswork involved in treating infection in cancer patients. One patient died from complications from an un-necessary antifungal medication, while another died for lack of treatment for a fungal infection that went unchecked. \"We can't have these patients we're trying to save from cancer die from infections that are diagnosable and preventable,\" he says. Finding solutions became his mis- sion. In 2003, Marty joined Dana-Far-ber permanently. He and his colleagues started a weekly half-day infectious disease clinic. Today, he is part of a group of five doctors committed to improving infectious disease care for cancer patients. Between them, they are developing new diagnostics and thera-peutics for fungal and viral infections, as well as preventive solutions such as vaccines. Of the many problems he sees in the clinic, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infec-tion after bone marrow transplant is a common occurrence without a com-plete solution. CMV , a type of herpes virus, causes little more than a fever or swollen glands in most adults before the immune system controls it. The virus lies dormant in about 60 percent of U.S. adults. But in transplant patients, particularly BMT patients, the immune system is compromised, allowing the virus to escape and blossom into a potentially life-threatening infection. Doctors can detect CMV infection and treat it with antiviral drugs. But the first-line drug, valganciclovir, causes a drop in white blood cells, which makes patients more susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections, so much so that attempts to use this drug to prevent CMV created risks that outweighed the benefits. Second-line drugs can cause kidney damage. Even with sev-eral treatment options, overall survival is lower for post-transplant patients who develop CMV . In 2009, another option emerged. An experimental drug named CMX001 was proving in test tube and animal studies to be effective against a wide range of viruses, including CMV . Origi-nally developed as an agent against smallpox, CMX001 is an easily distrib-uted pill form of an existing intravenous drug. It also has minimal risk of kidney toxicity, so Marty and colleagues around the country launched a study to determine whether it might be effective in the prevention and treatment of CMV in transplant patients. The phase 2 trial recruited 230 BMT patients from 27 centers and random-ized them to receive CMX001 or a placebo after transplant for two to three months, or until CMV infection 13 www.dana-farber.org Read more about the new drug helping prevent cytomegalovirus infection. Search for \"CMV\" at www.dana-farber.org.required an alternate intervention. The results, published in 2013 in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed the drug cut the risk of CMV to nearly a fourth, from 37 percent to 10 percent of patients, and indicated a safe effective dose of 100 mg twice weekly. Marty and colleagues in the U.S., Canada, and Europe have since launched a phase 3 trial to collect the evidence needed to seek FDA approval for the drug. Marty is quick to mention that other drugs are also in play to treat CMV in transplant patients. \"Many people are working to bring a second wave of drugs to prevent and treat this infection more safely and effectively,\" he says. Supportive Care and Beyond Work being done to treat serious BMT complications is also proving valuable in directly treating some forms of cancer. For example, the efforts of Richardson and his Dana-Farber col-leagues to improve supportive care for BMT patients dovetailed with similar Francisco Marty, MD (far left), and his team lead research into a drug that can often prevent a viral disease in stem cell transplant patients. efforts for multiple myeloma patients. In tests in animal models, the research-ers, including Constantine Mitsiades, MD, PhD, and Kenneth Anderson, MD, investigated defibrotide' s ability not only to reverse VOD, but also to make sure it didn't undermine the efficacy of other anti-cancer agents. It turned out that defibrotide added to the effectiveness of the mix of anti-tumor agents; with defibrotide, tumors grew more slowly and animals survived longer. The researchers quickly learned that defibrotide has multiple effects on the tumor microenvironment, the normal cells and tissues that surround, communicate with, and sometimes support, a tumor. Defibrotide appears to negate some of this support, making tumor cells more prone to die and less likely to grow. Those effects occurred not just in lab- oratory and animal models of multiple myeloma, but also of breast, lung and colorectal cancer, suggesting that defi-brotide might someday have broad ap-plicability as part of combined therapy for cancer. A recent early phase trial of defibrotide combined with melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide showed encouraging results in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. While it was laboratory work that revealed defibrotide' s potential, it was the struggles of patients that provided the first clues. \"Our patients show us more than anything what their needs are,\" says Richardson. Taking those bedside observations back to the bench is the essence of supportive care, creat-ing big differences for patients, and big advances for therapy.Paths of Progress Fall/Winter 2014 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute 14 By ro BErT LEVyDOUSING THE FLAMES Why inflammation may blaze a trail for cancer 15 www.dana-farber.org In 1863, when German pathologist Rudolf Virchow looked at malignant tissue through his microscope, he saw the cancer cells were mixed with a throng of white blood cells, which are part of the body' s inflammatory response to infection and injured tissue. Surprised to find tumor cells intermin-gling with cells that ought to be their fiercest enemy, Virchow asked whether inflammation might actually contribute to cancer. Over the next century and a half, scientists would confirm what Virchow could only hypothesize. But that is hardly the end of the matter. As re-searchers have diagrammed the body' s disease-fighting system in increasing detail, they've come to realize that the connection between cancer and chronic inflammation is not a one-way affair, but a tangle of interdependence and exploitation, of cooperation and an-tagonism - a vicious biological circle. If inflammation had a Facebook page, it would list its relationship status with cancer as \"Complicated.\" As the give-and-take between cancer and chronic inflammation has become clearer, so, too, have the opportunities for disrupting it - both to treat cancer and reduce the risk of some tumors getting started. At Dana-Farber, investigators are studying how lifestyle changes that reduce obesity - a trigger for inflamma-tion - can impede cancer development. Others are tracking the flow of signals between cancer cells and inflammatory agents to identify cut-off points that can be targeted by drug therapy. \"We think that chronic inflammation can play an important role in the devel-opment and progression of cancer,\" says Charles Fuchs, MD, MPH, director of the Center for Gastrointestinal Oncology at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC). \"As we discover the molecular pathways that link them, we're developing additional thera-pies that can target inflammation - and improve patient outcomes.\" First Responders Inflammation is the body' s way of responding to tissue damage. When bacteria or other infectious agents enter the body, or when chemical irritants find a way in, they're met by a burly crew of white blood cells called neutrophils and monocytes which have no fondness for foreigners. The white blood cells shower the intruders with caustic chemicals, gouge holes in their surface, or gobble them whole. This microscopic melee produces the redness, heat, swelling, and pain familiar to anyone who has skinned a knee or had a sore throat. As critical as the onset of inflammation - as important as the prompt detection, identification, and demolition of the invaders - is the winding-down process. After the enemy has been defeated or devoured, signals order the white cells to leave the damaged area and re-enter the bloodstream. Remaining too long in fighting mode could result in damage to nearby, healthy tissue. On rare occasions, however, the battle ends in stalemate rather than victory. If the inflammatory response can't clear the infectious agent or chemical irritant, a kind of ineffectual siege occurs, in which the inflammation lingers but accom-plishes little. It is this type of persis-tent, chronic inflammation - associated with diseases such as ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and Crohn' s disease - that increases the risk of cancer. Evidence of a link between chronic in- flammation and cancer is perhaps stron-Almost from the time of their debut under a microscope, cancer cells were found to have some unexpected company. 16 Paths of Progress Fall/Winter 2014 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute gest in the digestive tract. \"In virtually every type of GI cancer that we see, there is a chronic inflammatory condi-tion that is a risk factor for it,\" Fuchs says. Examples are numerous: inflam-matory bowel disease is a risk factor for colon cancer; gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach lining due to infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (or h. pylori), raises the risk of stomach cancer; Barrett' s esophagus, an inflam-matory-like condition of the esophagus tube due to backflow of stomach acid, often precedes esophageal cancer; and viral hepatitis increases the chance of liver cancer development. In each case, it is inflammation of many years' duration that poses a cancer risk, Fuchs notes, not the temporary inflammation that occurs as wounds heal. Multiple studies have shown that anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin can reduce the risk of developing colon cancer, and of the cancer recurring after it' s been treated. Fuchs and his colleagues have shown that this effect stems from its ability to block a key enzyme called COX-2. In another study, his team found a way to identify colon cancer patients who are most likely to benefit from aspirin therapy. Molecular Chess Dana-Farber' s Glenn Dranoff, MD, has studied the basic mechanics of inflammation' s relationship with cancer. In mice born with a genetic risk for certain cancers, he and his colleagues discovered an elaborate interplay of action and reaction. \"We found that chronic inflammation sets up conditions that tumors thrive under, because they learn to adapt to factors that are present in that situa-tion and use them for their own ben-efit,\" Dranoff remarks. \"The abnormal production of these factors can enhance tumor cell survival, as well as the ability to invade other tissue and grow blood vessels. \"But we also discovered that chronic inflammation can block the ability of the immune system to restrain tumor growth,\" he continues. Chronic inflam-mation, in other words, enables cancer growth in two ways: 1) by providing chemicals that tumor cells exploit for their own selfish pur-poses; and 2) by tamping down the immune system response that normally would attack the cancer. Many scientists now believe that chronic inflammation is often neces-sary for full-blown, invasive tumors to emerge. Cells that acquire genetic mutations may begin to grow out of control and drift in the bloodstream to other parts of the body, but only when they have access to the rich chemical broth of the inflammatory response do they become truly malignant. This dynamic helps explain why cigarette smoking is so closely tied to lung cancer, Dranoff notes. \"There' s a buildup of toxic substances in the lungs that damages tissue. When these toxins aren't removed - as often happens when people continue to smoke - a state of chronic inflammation can follow. The inflammatory response itself can pro-duce tissue damage, which spurs even more inflammation. Early-stage cancer cells in the lungs may take advantage of this situation.\" The cancer-inflammation relation- ship is more complex than even this description suggests. Studies indicate that tumor cells not only respond to the inflammatory state, they can actually instigate it, generating even more of the substances that tumor cells crave. There' s also evidence that inflamma-tion not only affects already-existing cancer cells but can, in some instances, cause mutations that help normal cells become cancerous. 17 www.dana-farber.org Learn why aspirin may help curb inflammation.

Jennifer Ligibel, MD (center), is tracking how exercise and weight loss affect indicators of inflammation in patients with breast cancer and other cancers. Charles Fuchs, MD, MPH (right), and his colleagues have shown how anti-inflammatory agents can lower the risk of certain cancers. Dousing the Fire Dana-Farber scientists are studying several strategies for depriving cancer cells of the biochemical boost they receive from chronic inflammation. Jennifer Ligibel, MD, of the Susan F . Smith Center for Women' s Cancers at Dana-Farber, is leading several studies that evaluate how increased exercise and weight loss affect inflammatory indicators in breast and other cancer patients. Obesity and inactivity are both linked to increased inflammation and to an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Ligibel wants to better understand how lifestyle changes can influence inflammation and subsequent cancer risk, with the ultimate goal of designing studies to test the impact of weight loss and increased exercise on cancer risk and development. Kornelia Polyak, MD, PhD, is study- ing samples of normal mammary (breast) tissue from thin and obese mice. The samples have been \"scored\" to indicate how much inflammation is present. Polyak and her colleagues will study how the level of inflamma-tion affects \"progenitor\" cells, which are forerunners of cells that line the milk ducts, and are thought to be where breast cancer often originates. Explorations of the inflammation- cancer link aren't limited to breast cancer. DF/BWCC' s Nikhil Munshi, MD, for example, has found that people with inflammatory diseases such as rheumatism, colitis, and ulcerative colitis have two to three times the normal chance of developing the blood cancer multiple myeloma. One reason, he discovered, is that immune system cells called T helper 17 (Th17) cells are overabundant in myeloma tissue. He also found that these cells produce a protein called interleukin-17 (IL-17) and other inflammatory proteins, rais-ing the prospect that drugs that block IL-17 could stop or slow the develop-ment of myeloma. A clinical trial of one such drug for patients with relapsed myeloma is planned for this fall. Meanwhile, Dana-Farber researcher Constantine Mitsiades, MD, PhD, has shown that inflammatory agents in myeloma' s \"microenvironment\" - the web of cells around the tumor tissue - can influence how the cancer responds to various drugs. The interactions between myeloma and its neighboring tissue are so important to the survival of myeloma cells, Mitsiades says, that precision therapy for the disease will need to take account not only of the specific mutations within the cancer cells but also the makeup of the cells' microenvironment. Another project is exploring inflam-mation' s role in certain malignant and non-malignant blood disorders. In a newly launched study, patients with very early stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and Waldenstrom' s macro-globulinema (a rare form of lymphoma) will periodically answer health ques-tionnaires that will help researchers pinpoint what causes the disease to progress. \"We'll ask patients about any infections they've developed, their exer-cise habits, weight, and other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis that could be related to inflammation,\" says DF/BWCC' s Irene Ghobrial, MD, who is co-leading the project. Researchers agree that lifestyle changes and carefully targeted med-icine offer the best way of severing cancer' s pipeline to the inflammatory response. Rudolf Virchow would most likely approve. 18 Paths of Progress Fall/Winter 2014 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute By roBErT LEVy I LL us T r ATI o N B y M EGAN hILL As a construction material, DNA - the carrier of the genetic code - has many advantages. It' s versatile, durable, supple, and, under the right con-ditions, can assemble itself into desired shapes. This adaptability has allowed scientists to create a variety of DNA-based \"nanodevices\" that one day may be used to detect and treat cancer and other diseases. One shortcoming of bare DNA, however, is that it' s easily destroyed by fluids within the body. To protect it, Dana-Farber' s William Shih, PhD, and his colleagues at Harvard University' s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering have borrowed a strategy from viruses. Certain viruses are wrapped in a double layer of phospholipids - fat-like substances - that enables them to evade an attack from the immune system. Recently, Shih and his associates found a way to create a similar cloak for a DNA nanodevice. When injected into laboratory mice, the nanodevice didn't disintegrate quickly but remained in the bloodstream as long as conven-tional drugs do. The image at right illustrates how the coat- ing is applied. The device itself is shown in blue. The yellow helixes jutting from the side are DNA adaptors that serve as handles for constructing a double layer of lipids. Viewed through a high-powered, atom-force microscope, the coated nano-device closely resembles a lipid-covered virus. Having succeeded in hiding DNA nanodevices from the immune system, investigators are de-veloping ways to put such devices to work. \"One application could be delivery of therapeutic drugs to a tumor,\" Shih says. \"The nanodevice could serve as a container with a high concentration of the therapeutic agent that kills off tumor cells. The formulation of the device may aid in delivering the drug directly to the tumor cells.\" SCIENCE ILLUSTRATED DNA Nanodevice DNA Adaptor 19 www.dana-farber.org PushING ThE ENVEL oPE IN DNA Pro TECTI oN Two-Layer Lipid Covering Microscopic view of structure, magnified 300,000 times 20 Paths of Progress Fall/Winter 2014 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Opening By sAuL WIsNIA Francisco Baez was a perfect candidate for a colonoscopy. He was in his early 60s with a family history of colon cancer; his brother had died of the disease at age 48. Baez' s primary care physician scheduled him to get the screening several times, but Baez - a native of the Dominican Republic who did not speak English - never showed up for the procedure.The ongoing effort to reduce disparities 21 www.dana-farber.org 22 Paths of Progress Fall/Winter 2014 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute \"I was afraid, because of what people had told me about the test,\" Baez says through an interpreter. \"Even after I started having pain, I didn't want to go until I met Oscar [Sanchez].\" Oscar Sanchez was Baez' s patient navigator at Dana-Farber/ Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC). In this role, Sanchez provided weekly consults at two facilities - the Southern Jamaica Plain Health Center and the Brookside Community Health Center - both located in Boston' s Jamaica Plain neighborhood, where Baez lives. Sanchez met with Baez several times to help allay fears about his colonoscopy appointment. He explained the importance of the procedure in detecting cancer early, assured Baez the discomfort was far less than he envisioned, and even arranged for rides to and from the appointment with the help of DF/BWCC social workers and interpreters. Then, when the screening revealed a large tumor in Baez' s colon, Sanchez was by his side for each step of his surgery and chemotherapy. Stories likes Baez' s among individuals from diverse racial and ethnic background are not uncommon. Minority groups, especially blacks and Latinos, maintain a disproportionately higher burden of colorectal and other cancers, and experi-ence significant inequities in related mortality. Research demonstrates that this disparity can be linked to the fact that members of these minority groups are less likely than whites to undergo screening that would lead to a cancer diagnosis at an earlier and more treatable stage of disease. Such disparities underscore the need to raise awareness about cancer preven-tion, screening, early detection, and survivorship. This is precisely what Dana-Farber' s recently completed three-year Community Health Needs Assessment and the Institute' s Cancer Care Equity Program (CCEP) are focused on doing. A key component of Dana-Farber' s mission is to promote public health among medically underserved popula-tions. This is approached through a \"social determinants of health\" framework by considering factors that affect cancer risk and mortality such as poverty, housing, education, em-ployment, and health behaviors. The Needs Assessment highlights the diversity of Dana- Farber' s priority neighborhoods of Roxbury, Mission Hill, Dorchester, Mattapan, and Jamaica Plain, as well as many of the broad socioeconomic challenges and health care access barriers facing their residents. Individuals living in these communities reported being challenged by issues that go beyond cancer, such as inadequate availability of nutritious food, lack of a safe outdoor environment for physical exer-cise, high rates of unemployment, lack of affordable housing, community violence, and experiences of racism and discrimi-nation within the health care system. \"Despite long-standing efforts by the city of Boston, civic leaders, and the area' s academic medical centers, there con-tinues to be a significantly higher cancer mortality for blacks compared to whites in Boston, which underscores the impor- The knowledge and confidence that Francisco Baez (right) gained in meetings with patient navigator Oscar Sanchez (left) prompted Baez to get a colonoscopy - which revealed his cancer. 23 www.dana-farber.org tance of our community-based work focused on reducing can- cer disparities,\" says Anne Levine, MEd, MBA, vice president of External Affairs at Dana-Farber. \"Dana-Farber has built a portfolio of community-based outreach and engagement activities over the last few decades, and while challenges persist, we continue to focus on the imperative to reduce the cancer burden in our surrounding neighborhoods and ensure that each patient who walks through our doors receives equi-table, patient-centered care.\" As part of Dana-Farber' s broad-based efforts to improve health equity, the Institute' s Community Benefits Office oversees a variety of comprehensive programs including sun safety education and screening, HPV and cervical cancer education, and tobacco control treatment. \"The challenge we have is bringing all these programs and services to a level where they become embedded in the community,\" said Mag-nolia Contreras, MSW , MBA, director of Community Benefits at Dana-Farber. \"We are making a long-term commitment to be part of the fabric of these communities.\" Peer Support One key initiative - Open Doors to Health - is a peer support program focusing on improving screening rates for cervical, breast, and colon cancers, in addition to promoting other primary cancer prevention behaviors. Through well-established partnerships with housing developments in Rox-bury, the program meets residents where they live and seeks to address key socioeconomic factors that have an effect on cancer risk such as a lack of outlets for physical activity and an unhealthy diet. research shows that minority groups have a disproportionately higher burden of cancer , and they can experience significant inequities in related mortality.Statistics from Dana-Farber' s Community Health Needs Assessment support these efforts: 72 percent of Boston residents consume less than adequate daily amounts of fruits and vegetables, and more than 55 percent of residents do not participate in adequate physical activity. The high cost of nutritious foods, the lack of supermarkets in some neighbor-hoods, and the limited access to safe outdoor environments for physical exercise are all factors. \"Our research has taught us that people respond best when encouraged by their peers, so we trained residents living in the housing developments to teach other residents about the importance of cancer screening and invite residents to par-ticipate in activities to keep active and healthy,\" says Eliza-beth Gonzalez Suarez, MA, director of Community Health Practice for Dana-Farber' s Center for Community-Based Research. \"We also provide technical assistance to an orga-nization that owns many of the affordable housing units to make changes in the housing environment that promote walk-ing and consumption of fresh vegetables, such as establishing walking clubs and farmer' s markets.\" In addition to Dana-Farber' s broad foundation of outreach programs, it established CCEP in January 2012 to serve as a bridge between research and outreach efforts in address-ing cancer disparities. The role of CCEP is to improve local outcomes through enhancing access among the medically underserved to the spectrum of preventative medicine, treat-ment, and clinical trials at Dana-Farber; unite and facilitate disparities-related research across the Institute; and strength-en established outreach and educational programs. Through CCEP , Dana-Farber Community Cancer Care at Whittier Street Health Center was launched after more than a decade of partnering with Whittier - a federally qualified health center in Roxbury serving patients from 25 different countries - on early detection and survivorship initiatives. The program provides streamlined diagnosis, treatment, and education of underserved patients with suspected malignan-cies through the various stages of care. This clinical partner-ship is believed to be the country' s first dedicated oncology space in an inner-city health center. In this model, one member of a rotating group of DF/ BWCC oncologists spends a day working with oncology 24 Paths of Progress Fall/Winter 2014 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute nurse Ludmila Svoboda, RN, BSN, every two weeks in Whittier Street' s fifth-floor cancer clinic, meeting with adult patients for screenings, consulta-tions, and educational sessions in a sun-splashed locale dominated by tall windows. A mammography suite is also open at Whittier three days a week as a brick-and-mortar partner to Dana-Farber' s Mammography Van, which has spent many years visiting locations throughout Boston offering mammo-grams and breast health education to women eligible for screening. The overall value of the Whittier Clinic is reflected in a powerful statis-tic: 50 percent of the patients seen there since its January 2012 opening have had a previous experience with cancer - or are diagnosed as the result of a visit. But as Christopher Lathan, MD, director of both Dana-Farber Com-munity Cancer Care at Whittier Street and the Cancer Care Equity Program points out, the program' s job doesn't stop there. \"We need to do more than just keep our doors open - we need to link care delivery to people in these communi-ties, and make it easy for them to get to us,\" explains Lathan. \"If we were not there it might take weeks for a patient referred for oncology care by a primary care doctor to get in for all the treat-ment he or she needs. At Whittier we can expedite the workup and get them connected to Dana-Farber right away.\" Collaboration and Analysis Another key component of CCEP is the development of a health equi-ties database, which is being designed to work in conjunction with Partners eCare, the new integrated electronic health and administrative information system slated to go live at Dana-Farber and Partners HealthCare hospitals next year. The database will allow for more Christopher Lathan, MD (right), treats patients at Dana-Farber Community Cancer Care at Whittier Street Health Center, in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood.Cross-cultural education and workforce development are two in- ternal efforts designed to strengthen Dana-Farber's efforts to lessen cancer disparities. Through a highly successful program, area high school and college students from communities of color intern and are hired for summer jobs in various research, clinical, and support roles at Dana-Farber - an initiative that has already produced a half-dozen full-time hirings. And as the Human Resources department leads ef-forts to increase Dana-Farber's workplace diversity, patients report feeling more welcomed in an environment where they see staff who look like them. Another effort focuses on cultural competency training for clinical staff. \"It's not necessarily about race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status, and which group a patient fits into,\" says Karen Burns White, deputy associate director of the Initiative to Eliminate Cancer Disparities at Dana-Farber. \"It's about understanding all the possible barriers that might impact a patient, and keeping them all in mind when talking to and treating him or her as an individual.\"Focus on Diversity and Cultural Sensitivity 25 www.dana-farber.org targeted research and outreach efforts by including the ethnic and racial back-grounds of patients by disease and other demographics. In addition, CCEP coordinates efforts for disparities researchers to collaborate by bringing together the various groups within DF/BWCC and their contempo-raries at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Can-cer Center that are working on health equity-related research and programs. Lathan leads quarterly meetings where colleagues from these institutions are encouraged to trade ideas and collabo-rate. \"Say you're a basic researcher interested in disparities among triple-negative breast cancer patients, but you don't typically work with social work-ers or other behaviorists,\" says Lathan. \"Maybe there is someone well-versed in those areas that you can link up with to pursue a grant or research project.\" New efforts such as the health equi- ties database complement established initiatives like the patient navigator program that connected patient Fran-cisco Baez to navigator Oscar Sanchez. Patient navigators from Dana-Farber' s Center for Patient and Family Programs and Services help address the needs of individuals from diverse backgrounds who have been diagnosed with or are at risk for cancer. They facilitate access to health care services, particularly for patients who may face challenges as-sociated with low socioeconomic status, limited English proficiency, disability, or insurance status. Navigators work with patients in specific programs at Dana-Farber and Brigham and Women' s Hospital in ad-dition to affiliated community health centers, and the impact of their work is clear. The colorectal cancer navigator program that helped Baez, for example, has demonstrated a reduction in the no-show rate of patients at screening and diagnostic appointments from Learn more at www.dana-farber.org by searching for \"cancer equity.\" 80 percent in 2008 to 16 percent, as observed among patients from two affiliated community health centers. As a result, the \"total trust\" Baez feels for his care team - and his own success-ful treatment - has made him a vocal advocate for colonoscopies among his family and friends. His brother' s cancer was not diagnosed until it was at a very advanced stage; he does not want this same misfortune for his other loved ones. \"I ask everybody their age, and if they are over 50, or having pain, I tell them they should be seen right away,\" says Baez. \"My brother had pain but didn't tell his family. If he did, and if he had the same care I did, I think he would be alive today.\" Left to right: Magnolia Contreras, MSW, MBA, Anne Levine, MEd, MBA, and Elizabeth Gonzalez Suarez, MA, help lead DF/BWCC's work to reduce cancer disparities. 26 Paths of Progress Fall/Winter 2014 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Responde Rsexceptional By rIChArD sALT usFinding genetic causes of dramatic cancer drug responses could have broad benefits 27 www.dana-farber.org hen he decided to try a drug called everolimus for the first time in a rare, highly lethal type of thyroid cancer, oncologist Jochen Lorch, MD, had little hope it would help 57-year-old Grace Silva. \"No therapies have ever worked for anaplastic thyroid cancer,\" he said. In 2011, Silva had exhausted standard treatment andtumors had spread to her lungs. What happened next some might call a miracle. \"Much to our surprise, after about six months, her tumor had almost completely disappeared,\" says Lorch. This response lasted for 18 months, until the cancer became resistant to everolimus, according to Lorch. \"I feel blessed,\" says Silva, who con- tinues to battle the disease in 2014. \"I thought I would never have grandchil-dren - and now I have two!\" Researchers call such dramatic, unex- pected outcomes \"exceptional respons-es.\" They typically involve experimental drugs that have failed in most similar cases but are extraordinarily effective in one or a few individuals. Until now, they have mystified physicians, cancer researchers, and drug makers. But very recently, in a handful of recent reports, researchers have begun solving these puzzles. The answers lie hidden in the genes and chromosomes of a patient' s cancer, which were found to contain rare, unsuspected DNA muta-tions that made the cancer cells highly sensitive to a particular drug. These \"response mutations\" - some of them previously unknown to scien-tists - weren't present in the tumors of most patients, explaining why they did not benefit from the same drug. Silva' s case and that of another patient who had an unusually long-lasting remis-sion after drug treatment were reported in 2014 by scientists at Dana-Farber, Brigham and Women' s Hospital, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, along with collaborators at the White-head Institute for Biomedical Research. These discoveries are opening new windows on what determines a tumor' s response - or lack of one - to cancer drugs. Studying exceptional respond-ers could help cancer scientists identify other patients who may benefit from drugs that had been deemed failures - and increase the precision of personal-ized cancer care. \"Traditionally, the exceptional responses have been anecdotal case reports that may or may not ever be repeated, and you couldn't learn a lot from them,\" says Lorch. \"But now we have the tools to find out why these patients responded so well,\" he adds. Looking for Rare Responses Rare drug-response mutations aren't flukes or miracles; they are signposts that may lead to more accurate drug targeting. More powerful DNA sequencing methods allow researchers to search for the equivalent of a needle in a haystack - combing the large protein-coding genome of a tumor specimen in search of an unsuspected mutation or other critical change in the DNA code. \"Patients with extraordinary respons- es teach us something important - and what we've learned has applications for other patients, clinical trials, and new ways of thinking,\" says Nikhil Wagle, MD, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) and an associate member of the Broad Institute. In 2014, Wagle reported the research on Silva' s response at a meeting of can-cer researchers and published a report on a second case in the journal Cancer Discovery. He is leading new research on exceptional responders, making use of next-generation DNA sequencing platforms to test tumor DNA. This research can help create ex- panded pools of patients whose cancers carry a specific mutation, and who may benefit from a drug, says Dana-Farber' s Early Drug Development Center (EDDC) Director Geoffrey Shapiro, MD. \"Now you know which mutations you can look for and design clinical trials for any cancer that has that muta-tion,\" explains Shapiro. \"We would expect the response rate to be dramati-cally high.\" Shapiro' s center runs phase 1 clinical trials of experimental agents. \"We've had occasional phase 1 patients who get good responses and stay on the trial for years,\" he says. \"We have been col-lecting specimen slides and DNA from some of these patients and we are giving them to Dr. Wagle for sequencing, so W 28 Paths of Progress Fall/Winter 2014 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute he can try to find out what characteristics of the tumor dictate the response.\" Unlike traditional chemo- therapy treatments, which use toxic agents to kill all rapidly dividing cells - both cancer and normal cells - many newer cancer drugs are \"targeted.\" That is, they are aimed at specific molecules involved in cancer growth and survival; these targets are not present in normal cells. Often these targets are networks of genes and pro-teins that cancer cells have hijacked to force the cells into uncontrolled growth. Mutations in these genes and proteins enable the cancer to survive and spread by ignor-ing the normal checks and balances that govern nor-mal cells. These mutations frequently cause growth switches to be stuck in the \"on\" mode, while disabling the molecular \"brakes\" that normally curb excessive growth. The target of everolimus, the drug Lorch tried as a long shot to thwart Silva' s thyroid cancer, is a protein encoded by the mTOR gene. The mTOR protein regulates cell growth and prolifera-tion, and the mTOR path-way is overactive in some cancers. Consequently, drugs like everolimus that inhibit mTOR activity have been approved to treat certain can-cers and are being tested in other cancer types. Silva was the lone patient in the trial to have such a dramatic response. As a result, Lorch and Wagle ana-lyzed the tumor' s DNA for clues. At the Broad, sequenc-ing instruments thoroughly scanned the critical parts of some 20,000 genes, yielding a long and unsorted list of mutations. Researchers then sifted through the list, looking for a mutation that might have caused a chink in the tumor' s defenses. They found one: a mutation in TSC2, one of two genes that regulate the mTOR protein pathway (TSC1 is the other regulating gene). The scientists then tested the mutations to confirm their effects. Muta-tions in these genes have been found in a small proportion of some cancers - including some that responded to mTOR inhibitors. Several years ago, Dana-Farber' s David Kwi-atkowski, MD, PhD, who discovered the TSC1 gene, and Andrew Wagner, MD, PhD, reported that mTOR inhibitors were effective in 50 percent or more of patients with a rare type of sarcoma that had TSC1 or TSC2 mutations. So the \"miracle\" of Silva' s reprieve from her life-threatening thyroid cancer is apparently due to the good fortune of her tumor having the TSC2 mutation. (Less fortunate was that after 18 months, her cancer devel-oped resistance to everoli-mus; DNA sequencing found the resistance was caused by new mutations in the mTOR protein itself. However, Lorch has put her on other drugs that are holding the cancer at bay.) Illustrating how such cases can shape clinical research, Kwiatkowski has designed a clinical trial of everolimus that will be open to patients with any type of \"Patients with extraordinary responses teach us something important - and what we've learned has applications for other patients, clinical trials, and new ways of thinking.\" - Nikhil Wagle, MD 29 www.dana-farber.org 29Learn more about clinical trials at Dana-Farber. www.dana-farber.org/clinicaltrialscancer found to have TSC mutations. \"This will help us determine how often this works,\" he explains, \"and whether any other factors correlate with response to the drug.\" Finding the Target In the second exceptional responder case, Wagle and colleagues at the Broad and the Whitehead institutes studied tumor DNA of a man whose advanced cancer disappeared for 14 months when treated with everolim-us. His response was linked to two mutations in mTOR that hadn't been seen in humans. Wagle says that these two cases, along with a third reported in 2012, are making an argument that screening cancer patients for response mutations could be an effective strategy for increasing the power of pre-cision cancer medicine. In fact, exceptional re- sponder studies are \"telling us that in many cases the targets against which we are aiming drugs are too broad,\" says Jason Luke, MD, FACP , a DF/BWCC oncologist specializing in melanoma re-search and early drug devel-opment. They don't take into account the rare response mutations that can make all the difference, he argues. By analogy, a letter may not reach the intended recipient if it' s addressed only to the state or city, rather than the exact street address. \"We are going to have to be much more specific about what, at the molecular level, a target really is,\" he says. Rivka Schwartz, a patient of Luke' s, is a prime ex-ample. Schwartz, who lives in Israel with her husband, Lenny, was diagnosed in 2011 with an aggressive bladder cancer that invaded her kidney. Despite surgery, chemotherapy, and radia-tion, the cancer' s growth had metastasized to her neck and lungs, forming a lump \"the size of a tennis ball,\" says Lenny Schwartz. Lenny and his brother worked the Internet and consulted with oncologists in Israel and the United States, eventually arranging for ge-netic testing of Rivka' s tumor. The tumor had a mutation in the FGFR gene, which makes a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor. FGFR mutations have been found in up to 20 percent of advanced bladder cancers, like Rivka' s. When the Schwartzes learned that Dana-Farber was one of a limited number of centers in the world test-ing an experimental FGFR inhibitor called BGJ398, they travelled from Israel to Boston. Luke cautioned Riv-ka and Lenny that participat-ing in the trial would require them to live in Boston for at least several months. They took the plunge in May 2013, when Rivka began taking the drug in pill form. Recalls Luke: \"She started feeling better, very quickly, and we could see her large neck mass immediately start to shrink. It was amazing and must have seemed like a miracle after everything she went through.\" CT scans showed the cancerous spots on her lungs getting smaller, \"and within four to six months, the cancer had Nikhil Wagle, MD (far left), is leading research into why certain drugs have sparked exceptional responses in patients like Grace Silva (center, with grandson Maddox) and Rivka Schwartz (at right, with husband Lenny). essentially gone away,\" Luke says. \"There is something different about her tumor beyond just the FGFR muta-tion,\" says Luke. He suggest-ed to Wagle that he arrange for her tumor DNA to be analyzed to find out \"what else is going on.\" So on a recent visit, the Schwartzes hand-carried a set of her specimens for sequencing. Meanwhile, Luke says, Novartis, the maker of BGJ398, has expanded the clinical trial \"to find more patients like Rivka. As far as I can tell, she has no active cancer.\" Exceptional response cases are also being studied in a new initiative at the National Cancer Institute, where Barbara Conley, MD, says about 100 have been culled from clinical trial databases. Tumor DNA from these patients will be searched for response muta-tions, which could lead to new clinical trials. Conley says, \"Y ou could say we're hoping to repeat the miracles.\" 30 Paths of Progress Fall/Winter 2014 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute \"Knowing that you are ma King a difference in an individual 's life, no matter how big or small, is the most rewarding aspect of my career.\" Rana McKay, MDWHY I WORK HERE Born in Lebanon and raised in South Florida, Rana McKay, MD, found a perfect fit at Dana- Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) when she came here for a three-year medical oncology/hematology fellowship in 2011. It suited her so well, she took a full-time role when her fellowship ended. Growing up, McKay was deeply affected by her moth- er' s breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. \"I wanted to take a very proactive role in caring for patients with can-cer,\" she recalls. DF/BWCC' s unique focus on research, patient care, and medical education appealed to her and to her personal connection with cancer. McKay rotated through all of DF/BWCC' s treatment centers during her first year of fellowship, and chose to focus on clinical research in genitourinary cancers. For the past two years, she has served as a clinical research fellow in the Lank Center for Genitourinary Cancer, where her mentors - including Toni Choueiri, MD, and Mary-Ellen Taplin, MD - helped narrow her clinical and research interests. \"Drs. Choueiri and Taplin are amazing clinical mentors,\" she says. \"They are invested in my success on a professional and personal level. They are world-class leaders in their fields and are forward-thinkers in their approach to clinical research. They strike a balance between providing direction and allowing me to be autonomous. Their passion for patient care and research is contagious.\" McKay' s time is split between caring for patients and conducting research. On clinic days, she sees patients with genitourinary cancers. Her research focuses on prostate and kidney cancer and involves designing and implementing clinical trials for each disease. \"I have a particular interest in bone metastases in these malignancies, and studying mechanisms of drug resistance,\" she says. Her work with patients energizes her research efforts. \"The field of oncology allows you to develop meaningful relationships with patients at critical times in their lives,\" she says. \"Patients are incredibly resilient and exhibit a profound amount of strength to overcome adversity. My patients are a constant source of strength and motiva-tion. Knowing that you are making a difference in an individual' s life, no matter how big or small, is the most rewarding aspect of my career.\" Outside of work, McKay recharges by long-distance running and spending time with family, especially with the newest addition, her daughter, Sydney Alice McKay, born May 11 - Mother' s Day. \"She has given my life new meaning,\" she says. \"She is an absolute blessing, and every moment with her is so unique and exciting.\"By NAoMI FuNkhous Er Rana McKay, MD, splits her time between research and patient care at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center. 31 www.dana-farber.org Julia and Mark Pettengill were lucky parents. With two young daughters, the Pettengills had never experienced a broken bone or medical crisis. That changed in April 2010, when then-2-year-old Sophie was diagnosed with leukemia and quickly admitted to Dana-Farber/Boston Children' s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. Here' s what Julia learned from her experiences. Treatment is more than medical care. A few days after her diagnosis, Sophie looked at me and said, \"Why are you crying, mom?\" I decided, from that moment on, we would find joy in each day. Within a week, our 6-year-old, Ava, joined the sibling program and was always welcome at the hospital and clinic, which set the tone for a happy, healthy family. Our nurses also went above and beyond with small gestures of kindness, and the medical team saw us as equal partners. Our best friends during treatment didn't try to \"fix\" things. They were comfortable around my sick child and stepped in gently when needed, without imposing, giving us space to find our way. Making friends in the Jimmy Fund Clinic, where no one gave Sophie what she called \"sad eyes,\" also helped us feel more normal during an abnormal time. Finishing 25 months of treatment was surreal. We felt like we had been through a hur- ricane: We were grateful to survive, but there was so much recovery to do. Family and friends may assume you're done, but you've changed, and it takes months, even years, to reestablish a new sense of normalcy. We felt anxious and scared of the unknown. As told to shANN oN WA TTE rso NJulia PettengillWHAT I KNOW Ending treatment is a process. Don't let it come without being ready. Prepare questions for your medical and psychosocial teams in the final months of treatment, and reconnect with your pediatrician to assess their comfort level with your child' s needs. Educate your support network about how you feel and what support you need. Find out what resources are available. It' s normal to feel a myriad of emotions. Stay connected. We attend the Jimmy Fund Clinic Summer Festival and Holiday Party to reconnect with other clinic families, and participate in the Jimmy Fund Walk. I also serve on the Pediatric Patient and Family Advisory Council, which works to improve quality of care at Dana-Farber/Boston Children' s, including the transition off treatment for patients and their families. Finding a \"new normal\" takes time. During the first year after treatment, I never would have dreamt of taking Sophie away from her medical team. But now, I'm starting to see her as a regular kid again, and even took the girls to visit family in Zimbabwe this summer. Despite our experience, we still find joy in each day.

This discovery will lead to developing drugs that target these mu-tations. Current drugs that target these mutations are being tested and, for the first time, give us hope that the tide is turning on this terrible disease. Our lab group has focused on under- standing key cancer-causing regula-tory proteins and identifying drugs to block their effects. This approach has the potential to develop treatments that are more effective, less prone to tumor resistance, and less likely to cause seri-ous side effects. The first such drug is now in a clinical trial at Dana-Farber and we hope to have at least two more drugs that take this unique approach in clinical trials in the near future.The potential for harnessing the hu- man immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Recent transfor-mative technologies and new immu-notherapy reagents make it possible to provide an entirely new therapeutic approach to achieving cancer cure. This is happening because we are gaining enough understanding of the immune system that we can develop immu-notherapies for patients that are both effective and personalized.Research focusing on treatment for women with HER2+ breast cancers. We conducted a large clinical trial of a less-intense chemotherapy regimen and found the disease recurred in very few patients with this type of tumor. This treatment has now become a standard regimen for women with early-stage HER2+ breast cancer. This work is part of an effort to develop therapies that not only improve patient outcomes but also decrease the toxicity of treatment.
