We see our homeopathic pharmacy as part of a community of doctors, nurses, therapists, retailers and you, our customers. We sell our treatments and remedies directly to the public via our online homeopathic pharmacy, at our East Troy, Wisconsin, location, and through professionals and practitioners who dispense them to their patients. We continue to grow by responding to the unique needs of our community and by honoring our commitment to high-quality ingredients and standards of processing for our remedies, treatments and body care products with the anthroposophic, homeopathic approach. It is our mission to continue to serve the needs of our community with products we believe support the health of our customers and of our planet. Every step of the way, we instill the rhythmic and sustaining qualities of nature into our small-batch manufacturing processes - unlocking the highest potency and effectiveness in our products. History of Uriel Anthroposophic Pharmacy Uriel Pharmacy was founded in 1996 by Mark McKibben, an anthroposophic pharmacist, to meet the needs of doctors and patients in the USA who wanted remedies and natural body care products prepared in the anthroposophic manner. Anthroposophic medicines are used throughout the world. Mark is trained in the WALA and Weleda methods of pharmacy, which are famous around the world for their purity and potency standards. The success of our anthroposophic pharmacy is also based on collaboration with clinicians who have helped to formulate many of our Uriel homeopathic product lines. Located in the biodynamic farming community of East Troy, Wisconsin, USA, we manufacture our remedies in small batches and with great care to ensure their vitality and effectiveness. We source local, biodynamic and organic ingredients whenever possible for all of the homeopathic and all-natural products available in our online store and retail shop. Furthermore, we've even created wifi-free spaces to respect the subtle processes of homeopathic potentization. The Honest Truth In a world that is increasingly disconnected from nature and from an understanding of our self-healing capacities, our mission and products are special. That is why we create all Uriel products according to well studied relationships between nature and human beings. Our products are formulated to treat the root cause of disease and strengthen the ability of the human being to self-heal and become more resilient on all levels of health. This ultimately results in a better quality of life and overall health. Giving Back Each year, we make significant donations and contributions toward different training programs for anthroposphic medicine, integrative medicine and research. It is always our goal to give back where we can. Serving Healing Professions We serve real human needs. We create hundreds of specialized products for individual needs. Following the anthroposophic approach, we generally produce more than 1,000 different homeopathic products every year in small batches. While this is not usually considered the avenue to business success, we make it work because we want to be of service. We are always looking for feedback to help us improve and better meet your needs. A Focus on Customer Service For new customers seeking advice, we can refer you to practitioners who are familiar with homeopathy and our products. If you are a physician, we can refer you to other independent physicians who can advise about training in homeopathy and for mentoring opportunities. Our website was built to serve you and make it easy to purchase homeopathic remedies online. We endeavor to provide outstanding customer service and to ship all orders within 24 hours. Our Company & Staff We strive to create a good environment for our employees at our East Troy, Wisconsin, facilities. Our mission is to create meaningful work through education and moral purpose. To that end, we never compromise quality or philosophy for profit. Our product quality and the level of detail we take in our manufacturing processes will always remain at the core of who we are.
