There's no doubt that at one point or another, you'll need to take a deep breath to quiet your mind and body. Calming herbs can help.* People have used herbs for their health benefits and soothing properties for centuries, and many still use them. These herbs possess unique properties that support feelings of relaxation and soothe tension. This blog post will explore calming herbs to help [soothe feelings of stress and anxiety](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/natural-remedies-anxiety). We will provide an overview of each herb, its benefits, and how to use it effectively. First, let's review a few things about anxiety and [ stress](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/what-does-stress-look-like) in general. The Stresses of Life Do you ever feel trapped in a state of fight or flight? Are you losing sleep over a tough conversation with a loved one, worrying about finances, and can't seem to turn off your brain? Anxiety can manifest in surges or linger in the background, making it difficult to navigate daily life with serenity. Anxiety disorders affect around 40 million adults in the U.S.REF#1270 It's a natural response that helps keep us alive, maintains clear personal boundaries, prompts us to listen to our intuition, and prevents us from taking dangerous risks. However, when restless feelings become unreasonable, unwarranted, or uncontrollable, and situations seem life-threatening, they may be classified as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).REF#1271 Stress can also affect your overall health. For instance, [uncontrolled stress](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/sleep-stress-and-you) can contribute to poor mental health, unhealthy blood pressure levels, poor immune system health, and may even affect the digestive system, which can inhibit nutrient absorbtion.REF#1284 Despite this reality, it's possible to thrive in our stressful, hectic modern lives with resilience and grace. If you're experiencing stress and anxiety, natural remedies may help calm your mind, restore balance, and maintain your well-being.* Calming Herbs to Help Restore Balance* For those who find themselves overwhelmed on a daily basis, finding ways to restore balance to daily life is crucial.

While herbal medicine is a natural alternative to traditional medications, it's important to note that herbs can also have side effects and interact with certain health conditions or medications. They should not replace any current medications prescribed by a healthcare provider. Unlike pharmaceutical drugs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate herbs. It's vital to consult with your healthcare provider and a professional herbalist to ensure that the herbs you're considering are safe for you and won't interfere with any existing health conditions or medications.
