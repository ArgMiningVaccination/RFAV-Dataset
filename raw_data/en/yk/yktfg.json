A career in Naturopathy is rewarding both from the professional point of view as well as from the point of view of serving mankind. What is Naturopathy: One of the seven Ayush systems, Naturopathy is an old traditional system of cure.Its history dates back to centuries ago when there were no drugs. Naturopathy is an art and science of healthy living and a drugless system of healing based on well founded philosophy. It has its own concept of health and disease and also principle of treatment. It is a system of healthcare which promotes the body's own self-healing mechanism. Just the way nature is mainly composed of 5 elements, i.e. fire, water, ether, wood and air; similarly, our human body consists of these following 5 elements which Naturopathy aims to keep in harmony and balance with each other in the body. 1 Fire: Fire represents the digestive juices of the body 2 Water: Water represents all the fluids present in the body, such as blood and lymph 3 Ether: Ether represents the hollow organs such as oesophagus etc. 4 Air: Air represents the inflow and outflow of all the gaseous exchange happening in our body such as oxygen and carbon dioxide 5 Earth: Earth represents the musculoskeletal system of the body. Based on the above principle, Naturopathy treatment takes a holistic approach to wellness, focusing on the body's innate healing ability. Through Naturopathy training, practitioners learn the key principles of Naturopathy. This includes non-toxic therapies, whole-person treatment strategies, and proactive healing practices. Naturopathy lays emphasis on preventive methods more than cure. It's the science that aims at treating the human body, mind, and soul by natural means through nature and not by using any foreign or artificial matter.
