Ehrenkranz School of Social Work 1965 Tisch School of the Arts 1972 Gallatin School of Individualized Study 1963 Mount Sinai School of Medicine (affiliated)The founding of New York University in 1831 by a group of eminent private citizens was a historic event in Ameri-can education. In the early 19th century, a major emphasis in higher education was on the study of Greek and Latin, with lit-tle attention to modern or contemporary subjects. The founders ofNew York University intended to enlarge the scope of higher edu-cation to meet the needs of persons aspiring to careers in business,industry, science, and the arts, as well as in law, medicine, and theministry. The opening of the University of London in 1828 con-vinced New Yorkers that their city, too, should have a university. The first president of New York University's governing council was Albert Gallatin, former adviser to Thomas Jeffersonand secretary of the treasury in Jefferson's cabinet. Gallatin and his cofounders said that the new university was to be a \"nation-al university\" that would provide a \"rational and practical edu-cation for all.\" The result of the founders' foresight is today a univer- sity that is recognized both nationally and internationally as aleader in scholarship. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and uni-versities in America, only 61 private institutions are members of the distinguished Association of American Universities. NewYork University is one of the 61. Students come to the Univer- sity from all 50 states and from 140 foreign countries. The University includes 14 schools and colleges at six major centers in Manhattan. In addition, the University operatesbranch campus programs in Westchester County at Manhat-tanville College and in Rockland County at St. Thomas AquinasCollege. Certain of the University's research facilities, notablythe Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, are located inSterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York. Although overall theUniversity is large, the divisions are small- to moderate-sizedunits\u2014each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty. Enrollment in the undergraduate divisions ranges between 90 and 6,200. While some introductory classesin some programs have large numbers of students, many classes are small. More than 2,500 courses are offered, leading to morethan 25 different degrees.6 INTRODUCTIONThe Schools and Colleges of the UniversityThe College of Arts and Science offers the Bachelor of Arts degree ina wide range of programs in thehumanities, science, social sciences,and foreign languages and literaturesand, in some departments, the Bach-elor of Science degree.

Counselor 12 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE 13The history of the College of Arts and Science begins with the founding of the University by a number of prominent New Yorkers, led by Albert Gallatin, a mem-ber of Jefferson's cabinet. Unlike other institutions at the time, it was to be non- sectarian and to produce a different sort of elite citizen, not born to privilege but set apartfor leadership by talent and effort. To that end it provided a more practical education, whatthe 19th century called \"Useful Knowledge.\" Thus, in addition to offering the standard classical curriculum, early NYU was also a center for science. Samuel F. B. Morse, after whom the current core curriculum is named,invented the telegraph while teaching art and design; John W . Draper invented modernphotography; and the American Chemical Society was founded here. In the arts and culture, too, it can be argued that the College not only participated in but also generated much of the creative energy that has characterized Greenwich Village.The original University Building housed ateliers that were the forerunners of the currentdowntown art scene. And although Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was turned down for ateaching post, literature thrived, with University Building even featured in a 1861 novel byTheodore Winthrop. Finally, this neighborhood and this institution have had a long tradition of social and political activism\u2014from the Stonecutters Riot over the construction of the University'sfirst building in 1834 to the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, a major eventin U.S. labor history that took place in what is now the Brown Building. From its earliest days, then, the College on Washington Square has been at the cutting edge of intellectual, cultural, and social developments. In 1895, however, NYU'sgreat chancellor, Henry MacCracken, decided to reserve Washington Square for the profes-sional schools, which had proliferated under his leadership, and to move University Collegeto a beautiful campus in the Bronx\u2014University Heights\u2014designed by Stanford White. The College's move to the Heights reflected MacCracken's \"Ivy\" aspirations for the school and his successful effort to raise quality by attracting the best students nationally.Also relevant was the ascendant, nonurban collegiate ideal of a residential community, withfine teaching, extracurricular activities, fraternities, and intercollegiate athletics. A few years later an undergraduate presence was restored downtown with the open- ing of a Collegiate Division (1903), soon to become Washington Square College (1913).This school had a more diverse student body, opening its doors to women, recent immi-grants, commuters, and professional students. For over 60 years, undergraduate liberal arts education at NYU took place in two loca- tions\u2014University College (and the Engineering School) at the Heights and the College onWashington Square, both offering excellent, but different, educational and social experiences.A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE College of Arts and Science 14 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCEIn the 1970s the College under- went yet another major transforma-tion. In response to financial pres-sures, the Heights campus closed in1973 and University Collegemerged with Washington SquareCollege. The new institution, whichis now known simply as the Collegeof Arts and Science, is the beneficia-ry of both traditions\u2014the Heights'residential and collegiate culture andthe Square's progressive urban focus.At that time, a decision was alsomade to build aggressively for quali-ty\u2014to recruit the very best faculty and students, to update and expandthe physical plant, and to create dis-tinguished programs both here andabroad. In recent years the College has become recognized as a nationalleader for its efforts to reinvent a lib-eral arts education for the 21st cen-tury. With a challenging liberal artscore, the Morse Academic Plan, atthe center of its curriculum, theCollege emphasizes student inquiryand research, offers unique opportu-nities for international and prepro- fessional study, and makes use of thecity as a site for learning and service.A liberal arts education thus recon-ceived is not only personally enrich-ing but also eminently practical indeveloping the skills and perspec-tives essential to assume a leadershiprole in the 21st century. As the newmillennium proceeds, the Collegecontinues to build on its founders'goal of providing \"UsefulKnowledge.\" COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE 15 COLLEGE DIRECTORY 17College Directory Administrators Matthew S.

Classification of CoursesThe bulletin contains descriptions of the College's departments, pro-grams, and courses. Each course isassigned a letter prefix followed by anumber. The prefix V indicatesundergraduate courses offered in theCollege; G indicates a graduatecourse offered by the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science. Graduate courses open to qualified undergraduates are designated by the departments. The departmental pol-icy in this matter may be indicated in this bulletin or in the GraduateSchool of Arts and Science section ofthe directory of classes, which isavailable during each registrationperiod. Hyphenated courses (e.g., V77.0101- 0102) are full-year courses. Each term is registered for individually,but no credit is granted for com-pleting only the first term of thefull-year course. In the designationof a course where the numbers indi- cating each half of the course areseparated by a comma, not ahyphen, credit will be granted forcompleting only the first term ofthe course unless it is indicated oth-erwise. Students should be awarethat in certain of these courses, sat-isfactory completion of the firstterm of the course is a prerequisitefor entry into the second term of thecourse.MORSE ACADEMIC PLAN 23The Morse Academic Plan (MAP) of the College of Arts and Science is an integrated general education curriculum in the liberal arts. The MAP is named for Samuel F. B.Morse, an early faculty member of the University. Best known as inventor of the tele- graph, Morse taught fine arts at NYU and was an eminent painter. In his breadth of talentand high achievement as both an artist and scientist, Morse symbolizes the range of skills andinterests that the MAP is designed to foster. The MAP provides a core academic experience for undergraduates at NYU. Through a challenging array of foundational courses the program heightens cultural awareness, honescritical reading skills, promotes creative and logical thinking, and gives students extensivepractice writing and speaking English and proficiency in at least one other language. Ratherthan specifying a fixed canon of knowledge, the MAP focuses on modes and methods ofhumanistic and scientific inquiry. In each case, students are free to pursue particular interestsby choosing among a number of courses. Students examine our contemporary culture\u2014itsorigins and social structures, its modes of expression, and its inherent diversity and evolvingpatterns of thought. In other classes, they consider the place and importance of modern science\u2014its quantitative and analytical foundations, its processes of reasoning, and its relationship to technology and to our views of the natural world. By helping them to broad-en their perspectives, gain new pathways for intellectual inquiry, and develop the skills, background, and social awareness to thrive in dynamic circumstances, the MAP thus seeks to prepare students for their later studies and to equip them well for lives as thinking individ-uals and members of society.The Morse Academic Plan DIRECTOR OF THE MORSE ACADEMIC PLAN: Professor Myers DIRECTOR OF THE EXPOSITORY WRITING PRO-GRAM: Professor Hoy Program The MAP has four components: 1.the Expository Writing Program, 2.study of foreign language, 3.the Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC), and 4.the Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI). Though structured and integrat- ed, the MAP curriculum affords stu-dents flexibility in a number of ways.It permits the following: choice of different tracks (foreign language, FCC, FSI), satisfaction of some courses byexamination or Advanced Placement credit (foreign language, FSI), and substitution of departmental cours- es (FCC, FSI). Given this flexibility, students will work individually with advisersto plan course schedules that takeinto account, among other things,their past preparation, current inter-ests, and longer-term goals. Whilethere is no prescribed schedule ofcourses that will be appropriate forevery student, the following broadguidelines should be kept in mind. Incoming freshmen should normal-ly complete their MAP courses by the end of sophomore year. This willleave them free in the junior andsenior years to focus on their majorand elective courses. Some sciencemajors, engineering students, pre-medical students, and studentsplaced in the International WritingWorkshop sequence may need to delay starting, and thus finishing, acomponent of the MAP for a semes-ter or more. Students who pursueinternational study may also need todelay completing their MAP coursesbeyond the sophomore year.24 MORSE ACADEMIC PLAN Students must complete Writing the Essay, V40.0100, during theirfirst year. Those placed into the ProseWriting or International Writing Workshop sequences must begin in their first semester and must registerfor their remaining writing course(s)in the semester(s) immediately following. Although Freshman HonorsSeminars, V50.02xx, are not a part of the MAP , qualifying students arestrongly urged to register for one ofthese classes in their first semester.These seminars with distinguishedfaculty members promise an intellec-tually stimulating experience right atthe start of college. In designing the MAP , the faculty sought to assure that all studentswould receive a broad exposure to the liberal arts early in their collegecareers. With this wide academichorizon, the MAP encourages stu-dents to discover new intellectualinterests outside their intended areasof specialization and to pursue thoseinterests with elective courses outsidetheir majors in their later undergrad-uate years. Expository WritingIt would be hard to exaggerate the value of the ability to communicateclearly and effectively in writing. TheExpository Writing Program atNYU assumes that writing is notmerely a useful skill but also a way oflearning and knowing. Its coursesfocus on the examination of evidence,the development of ideas, and theclear expression of those ideas in avariety of different kinds of essays. In these writing courses students rou-tinely move from exploration toargument as they read and make useof various texts\u2014written, visual,experiential\u2014to create a spectrum ofpersuasive essays. Examined textsbecome more complex, the writingtasks more difficult as students grap-ple with intriguing questions thatlead to richer ideas and more inter- esting forms of expression. The essaysstudents write become more formaland argumentative as the semester'swork progresses. For a complete description of the curriculum, see the Expository Writing Program (40) section of this bulletin. Foreign LanguageThe study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts educa-tion. It nurtures an awareness of thediversity of human culture and servesthe practical need for language skillsin fields such as government, busi-ness, and research. New YorkUniversity is a particularly excitingsetting for language study because ofits location in a great cosmopolitancity, its international student body, itsmany renowned language programsand centers, and its rapidly expandingopportunities for study abroad. In addition to the foreign lan- guage courses offered for academiccredit, the College offers opportuni-ties for students of modern languagesto practice their skills in real-worldsituations outside the classroom.NYU Speaking Freely is a free, non-credit program that allows studentsto practice their speaking and auralcomprehension skills and to explorethe linguistically diverse cultures ofNew York City. For more informa-tion about this popular program,contact the Office of the AssociateDean for Students, Silver Center,Room 909. Increasingly, college graduates must be prepared to function in aglobal society. Apart from the inher-ent interest of learning about othercultures, many NYU students takethe opportunity to study or travelabroad as preparation for their futurecareers. For more information aboutNYU Study Abroad Programs, visit the Student Center for InternationalStudy, Silver Center, Room 904, andconsult the Programs Abroad section of this bulletin. Requirement. To fulfill the for- eign language component of theMorse Academic Plan, students mustshow or attain proficiency in a for-eign language through the interme-diate level. Ordinarily, this is accom-plished by the successful completionof two years of language study in theCollege, through the second semesterof a regular intermediate-level lan-guage sequence. Some languages arealso taught in intensive courses,allowing students to complete theequivalent of two years of study in asingle year. After two years of college lan- guage study or the equivalentdemonstrated proficiency, studentsshould have gained a broad compe-tence in a language; but true fluencyof written or oral expression will notusually have been developed at thispoint. For this reason, all studentsare encouraged to continue their lan-guage study beyond the intermediatelevel. In particular, students studyingmodern languages will find it mostbeneficial to immerse themselves inthe living culture of a language bystudying, traveling, or workingabroad. Likewise, students of all lan-guages, whether ancient or modern,are encouraged to continue theirstudies with elective courses in litera- ture at the advanced level. Exemptions. Students may fulfill the foreign language component ofthe MAP by presenting outstandingscores on the SAT II or AdvancedPlacement Examinations or by pass-ing a departmental proficiency exam-ination. For further information onlanguage placement and exemption,see under \"Placement Examinations\"in the Academic Policies section of this bulletin. For Advanced PlacementExamination equivalencies, consultthe chart in the Admissions section, also in this bulletin. Students whose secondary school- ing was in a language other thanEnglish and other than a languageoffered in the College, or who com-plete the International WritingWorkshop sequence (V40.0003, V40.0004, V40.0009), are exemptfrom foreign language require-ment. Also exempt are students inthe B.S./B.E. program. Courses. Listed below are courses covering the second semester of theintermediate level of language study.Intensive courses, which allow stu-dents to complete the equivalent oftwo years of study in a single year, arealso listed where available.Completion of any of the followingcourses will fulfill the foreign lan-guage requirement.

For information about these courses, visit the Office of AcademicAffairs, Silver Center, Room 908. Foundations of Contemporary CultureThe Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the MorseAcademic Plan is a series of fourcoordinated courses in the humanitiesand social sciences. Within each ofthe four offerings, students are free topursue their particular intereststhrough their choice of individualclasses. Overall, the structure of theFCC ensures that every student in theCollege gains a common core of skillsand experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information on the Foundations of ContemporaryCulture provided in this bulletin,detailed descriptions of each year'scourse offerings may be found in theMAP brochure, published annuallyas a supplement to this bulletin. CONVERSATIONS OF THE WEST Through exploration of contrasting and complementary works in thehumanities from different periods,Conversations of the West provides ahistorical, literary, and philosophicalcontext for education in the liberalarts. Students may choose from four tracks: Antiquity and the MiddleAges, Antiquity and the Renaissance,Antiquity and the Enlightenment,and Antiquity and the 19th Century.In each case, the classes begin withworks from some of the ancient civi-lizations that have shaped the devel-opment of cultures in the West.Typically, the classes have the follow- ing readings in common: the booksof Genesis and Exodus from theHebrew Scriptures, the GospelAccording to Luke and Acts of theApostles from the Christian NewTestament, a Platonic dialogue and a Sophoclean or Euripidean tragedy,Virgil's Aeneid, and Augustine's Confessions. In the second half of the course, the themes and ideas emerg-ing from these texts are followed asthey are maintained, reinterpreted, ordisputed by later thinkers. Conversations of the West is not a survey but, rather, an examinationof how texts influence subsequentthinking, create traditions, andreflect societal ideals. Conversationsof the West thus aims to provide a richer understanding of how culturesare constructed, modified, and repre-sented. WORLD CULTURES The World Cultures courses intro-duce students to the ways in whichcultural traditions are created andthe ways in which cultures definethemselves against internal andexternal alternatives. These coursesintroduce students to the methodsand problems of cultural studies.Like Conversations of the West,World Cultures is not intended as a set of historical surveys. Each courseis designed to examine the chal-lenges of \"translation\"\u2014of appreciat-ing cultural traditions other thanone's own; to introduce students tothe major texts, artifacts, and valuesof another cultural tradition; and todevelop a sense of the diversity andsimilarity of the ways in which peo-ple in different cultural traditionsunderstand, experience, and imaginetheir lives.26 MORSE ACADEMIC PLANSOCIETIES AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES Over the past several centuries, enor- mous social transformations havetaken place around the world. Tounderstand the complexity of thesephenomena, new methods have beendeveloped to study societal structuresand human behavior. Each of thecourses under Societies and the SocialSciences begins from a particular dis-ciplinary approach, social concern, ortopic, in order to orient students tothe characteristic methods of thesesocial sciences. Students learn howissues are objectified for study, howdata are collected and analyzed, andhow new understanding is thereby achieved. Whether through an inter-disciplinary approach, considerationof their historical development, orreflection on critical and positivisticdebates, the courses help studentsboth to appreciate the uniqueinsights afforded by these methodsand to recognize the limits of suchinquiry. In this way, students movebeyond the particular focus of theclass to a broader understanding ofmethods and problems in the socialsciences generally. EXPRESSIVE CULTURE In Expressive Culture studentsexplore the complexities of artisticexpression by focusing on one of fivemedia: sounds, images, words, per-formance, or film. Each course intro-duces requisite historical, formal, andcritical vocabularies; examines funda-mental issues associated with inter-pretation of the arts making use ofthese media; and investigates thecomplex relations between artisticexpression and other facets of socialorganization. The courses also makeuse, whenever possible, of the richcultural resources of New York City. Foundations of Scientific InquiryThe Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) component of the MorseAcademic Plan is a series of threecoordinated courses in quantitativereasoning and the natural sciences.Together, these courses ensure that every student in the College gains afundamental understanding of howmathematics and laboratory experi-mentation advance scientific investi-gation. While some students acquirethis background through coursework offered in the science majors,FSI courses are especially designed tomeet the need of nonscience stu-dents. Within each of the three offer-ings, students are free to pursue theirparticular interests through theirchoice of individual classes. In addition to the information on the Foundations of Scientific Inquiryprovided in this bulletin, detaileddescriptions of each year's courseofferings may be found in the MAPbrochure, published annually as asupplement to this bulletin. QUANTITATIVE REASONING Students in Quantitative Reasoningengage mathematical concepts in avariety of contexts in the natural or social sciences. All courses include asubstantial amount of problem solv-ing that requires both conceptual andcomputational work. NATURAL SCIENCE I Scientific knowledge has its basis inour natural curiosity about the worldaround us and our place in it. Thesecourses approach the physical sci-ences with the intent of asking andtrying to answer interesting ques-tions, dealing with topics rangingfrom the origin of our universe andplanet to how human activity affectsour environment. Students considerthe important roles played by laws ofphysics and chemistry in biology,earth and environmental sciences,astrophysics, and cosmology anddevelop an understanding of how thephysical sciences inform the naturalsciences generally. Mathematics isintroduced in each course with fre-quent applications to the subjectmatter. Predictions that can be madeonly with the use of mathematics areclearly delineated, showing the pow-erful role it plays in our understand-ing of the universe. Wherever possible the courses relate science tosocietal problems and develop a his-torical perspective. NATURAL SCIENCE II The complexity of the biologicalrealm continues to fascinate and chal-lenge modern scientists, who are cur-rently engaged in such diverse pur-suits as exploring the organizationand function of the brain, recon-structing the origin of the humanspecies, linking the multiplicity ofinteractions in ecosystems, and deci-phering the influence of heredity oncomplex traits. The courses inNatural Science II take a nontradi-tional approach to the life sciences,with an emphasis on approaching sci-ence as a dynamic process of investi-gation and discovery. Each courseselects a broad theme that is at theforefront of contemporary research,then uses specific questions andexamples to introduce students to themethodology of scientific inquiry, thecritical evaluation of results, and themathematical tools used to quantifyscientific information. AFRICANA STUDIES 27The Program in Africana Studies offers a wide range of courses on the black experi- ence in the modern world, emphasizing the interdisciplinary approach of culturalstudies. The program's two main areas are Pan-African history and thought and black urban studies. Pan-African history and thought includes the study of such literary andpolitical movements as the Harlem Renaissance, the Negritude movement, black con-sciousness, black feminism, and black intellectual leaders such as W . E. B. Du Bois, ZoraNeale Hurston, C. L. R. James, Malcolm X, Angela Davis, Leopold Senghor, and KwameNkrumah. Black urban studies focuses on the cultural analysis of black people's relations toa wide range of social, cultural, and political institutions such as museums, public offices,music and sports industries, mass media, the police, and public schools. Black urban stud-ies also explores patterns of black migration, black cultural productions, and questions ofclass and gender dynamics within black communities. New York's position as an international crossroads allows the program to bring prestigious scholars and artists for visits of six weeks to one year. Students, faculty, andmembers of the surrounding community interact with such guests through courses, presen-tation of works in progress, and performances in order to capture the international dimen-sion of Pan-Africanism.PROGRAM IN Africana Studies (11) 269 MERCER STREET, SUITE 601, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687.

The adviser for the minor (inconsultation with faculty from the student's major department) is responsible for ensuring that each student's experience remains cohesive. Nonetheless, this minor adheresto the principle of flexibility and inclusiveness. Each student will build the sort of experi-ence that is most appropriate to his or her needs or desires. This means that the boundaries(temporal, spatial, conceptual) will remain permeable. Each student's course of study isdesigned on an individual basis, guided by the student, the student's adviser in his or herown major department, and the adviser from the ancient studies minor. A number of CAS departments and programs, as well as institutes and centers, are directly involved in this program: Anthropology, Classics, Comparative Literature, EastAsian Studies, English, Fine Arts, Hebrew and Judaic Studies, History, Irish Studies, Lin-guistics, Middle Eastern Studies, and the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Stud-ies. The minor consists of five 4-point courses, normally to be selected from the appropriateofferings of the departments listed above. All five of the courses selected must be offered bydepartments other than the student's major department, and not more than two may betaken in any one department. Students are furthermore expected to examine at least three different civilizations or cultures in completing this minor. Language courses may not be used to fulfill therequirements of this minor. It is also required that students who choose this minor com-plete, as a capstone experience, an independent study course. The adviser for the ancientstudies minor may assist students in designing a project and in finding an appropriate fac-ulty member to direct this independent study. All programs must be approved by theancient studies adviser before the student begins to take courses that would fulfill the minorrequirements.PROGRAM IN Ancient Studies Minor 25 WAVERLY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790.

ADVISER: Professor Marincola (Classics)The Department of Anthropology is one of the country's leading graduate and under- graduate centers for cultural anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthropology,and biological anthropology\u2014the four principal subfields of anthropology studied in the undergraduate curriculum. The department considers its greatest assets to be the var-ious individual areas of faculty expertise: archaeological specialties such as European, NearEastern, and South Asian prehistory; biological anthropology areas such as molecular pri-matology, primate behavior and ecology, and paleoanthropology; linguistic anthropologyfoci such as discourse analysis and language socialization; and cultural anthropology spe-cialties such as the ethnography of North America, Africa, India, the Near East, theCaribbean, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and the South Pacific. Major theoreticalemphasis is on the systems of thought and symbolic representation of the self and society;the relation between female and male domains of interaction; changing patterns of socialorganization and hierarchy within small-scale societies, urban settings, and bureaucraticinstitutions; medical anthropology; science studies; race and ethnicity; and the problem ofethnographic representation in film and other media. Departmental resources include an extensive film and video collection as well as teaching and research labs for archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological anthro-pology, which can be used for research by advanced undergraduates. A regular colloquiumseries and an undergraduate student association welcome undergraduate participation. For-mal and informal cooperative arrangements with museums, zoos, and other academic pro-grams in the greater New York area place at students' disposal a group of anthropologicalscholars, materials, and internship possibilities unparalleled in this country.DEPARTMENT OF Anthropology (14) 25 WAVERLY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6790. (212) 998-8550. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Myers DIRECTOR OF UNDER-GRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Disotell 32 ANTHROPOLOGYFacultyCharles F. Noyes Professor of Urban Anthropology: Professor Anthropology: GinsburgProfessors: Beidelman, OF INQUIRY Cultural anthropology is the study ofsocial organization and the systemsof thought and values that bothreflect and inform social practice indifferent cultures. Cultural anthro- pology is interdisciplinary in orienta-tion, analyzing and synthesizing religious, artistic, economic, andpolitical practices through the com-mon medium of culture. Traditional- ly cultural anthropology emphasizedthe maintains such interests but increasingly applies itsinsights and methods to complex,urban, and industrialized societies.An emphasis of the department isthe ethnographic study of cultural,social, and political processes thatshape our lives and those of otherpeople, especially as we are drawntogether and influence one another inincreasingly transnational and globalinteractions. The department participates in the University's Hagop KevorkianCenter for Near Eastern Studies, theCenter for Latin American andCaribbean Studies, the Institute ofFrench Studies, the Program inMuseum Studies, the Program inCulture and Media, and the Centerfor Media, Culture, and History. Linguistic anthropology focuses on how language is interpreted andused in cultural contexts. Languageuse is socially organized; it is a keyto understanding the ways in whichspeakers create and change socialrealities. Studied within historical aswell as cultural frameworks and inrelation to other social institutions(e.g., politics, education, law, medi-cine), variation in ways of speakinglanguage(s) adds to our understand-ing of how social categories such asethnicity, race, and gender are inter-actionally constituted across con-texts, cultures, and societies. Anthropological archaeology is the use of artifacts and other materialremains to understand human cul-ture. It attempts to breathe life intoa material record that at first glanceappears static and fragmentary. Theresearch interests of anthropologicalarchaeologists range from the earliestproduction of durable tools 2.5 mil-lion years ago to the refuse currentlybeing generated by modern cities.All aspects of past human existence,including art, technology, religion,gender, economic and social organi-zation, and food-getting strategies,are addressed by researchers inanthropological archaeology. Physical anthropology encom- passes the study of human biologicaldiversity and includes the anatomy,genetics, behavior, ecology, and evo-lution of the human species andother primates. It is linked to theother subfields of anthropology by itscommitment to the study of humanbiology and evolution within thecontext of culture, society, and ecolo-gy. Close ties with the AmericanMuseum of Natural History, the New York University School of Med-icine, and the Wildlife ConservationSociety International Programs at theBronx Zoo facilitate the department'sdiverse research interests in physicalanthropology. DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES Anthropology courses contribute to undergraduate education in twoways. First, the scope of the disci-pline's interests effectively bridgesthe humanities, the social sciences,and the natural sciences. Anthropolo-gy asks basic questions concerningthe origins and development ofhumans and their cultures and diver-gent systems of thought, belief, andsocial order. By systematically ana-lyzing various cultural traditions\u2014contemporary as well as historicallyknown\u2014anthropology raises criticalquestions concerning the bases ofboth world civilizations. An under-standing of the distinctive wayanthropology formulates andattempts to answer its basic ques-tions is a necessary component of acomprehensive liberal education. Second, the department offers concentrated programs of study forthe minor, major, or honors student.A minor usually emphasizes one ofthe four subdisciplines. For themajor, the department encouragesstudy in all of the subdisciplines,because each supplements and com-plements the others in presentinghumans as both biological and socialbeings. An honors program includesin-depth research in one aspect ofphysical, archaeological, linguistic, orcultural anthropology. The director of undergraduate studies works closely with minorsand majors students in designingprograms of study that integrates thegoals of individual students with theofferings and intellectual goals of thedepartment and complementary disciplines. The department prides itself on its graduate and undergraduate pro-grams' integrated nature, whichenables minors, majors, and honorsstudents to participate in a variety ofchallenging graduate courses andseminars. There is an active Anthro-pology Undergraduate Student Asso-ciation (AUSA) that connects stu-dents to one another through eventsand E-mail forum (listserv).MAJOR The major consists of 36 points,which include V14.0001, V14.0002,V14.0003, and V14.0017 (which isoffered only during the spring semes-ter). The other courses may be select-ed from any subfield of anthropology.Internships, however, may not beapplied toward the major, and agrade of at least C is required inevery course to be counted towardthe major. Any course with a gradeof C- or lower will not count towardthe major. Majors should consultregularly with the director of under-graduate studies in order to take fulladvantage of the seminars andresearch opportunities open to them.

The category of Asian/Pacific American includes people of East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands living in the United States aswell as in other parts of the Americas. This program takes a critical community studiesapproach that uses field research as the central methodology to examine the relationshipbetween theory and practice and between structure and agency, in the study of A/P/A com-munities. Students develop important analytical skills that will help them negotiate today'smultiracial, multiethnic environment, as well as gain a level of cross-cultural awareness andskills that will be useful to them in any field of study they choose to enter. The two main areas of concentration for this program are urban studies and dias- pora studies. Urban studies examines the formation of A/P/A communities in relation to thevarious cultural, social, and political institutions in urban settings, with special emphasison the New York metropolitan area. Diaspora studies investigates the processes that enableA/P/A communities in the United States to sustain ties with communities throughout theworld. To study these two areas of concentration, the program insists on an interdisciplinaryapproach that takes into consideration analyses of cultural production\u2014social, political, andeconomical processes\u2014as well as cross-cultural conflict and collaboration. In coordination with the program, the A/P/A Studies Institute brings renowned artists, scholars, writers, and activists to campus. This provides the opportunity for discus-sion, performance, and reflection with students, faculty, and community members.PROGRAM IN Asian/Pacific/American Studies (15) Minor 269 MERCER STREET, SUITE 609, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687.

Over the past severalyears, biology has been revolution-ized with the development of power- ful techniques in molecular and cel-lular biology, genomics, and bioin-formatics that are now being appliedto research across the spectrum of thescience, from genetics and differenti-ation to biomedicine, field studies,and animal behavior. The depart- ment's programs of study andresearch reflect this contemporaryview of biology. The department offers students the opportunity to explore the vari-ous areas of current biology in anNote: The Department of Biology administers the earth and environ-mental science courses and minoroffered by the College. For moreinformation, see Earth and Environmental Science (49).46 BIOLOGYintegrated yet diverse program that builds from a solid foundation of thebasic elements of molecular and cel-lular biology, genetics, evolution,organ systems, and population stud-ies. Students are exposed to modernconcepts, state-of-the-art approaches,and current methods of experimenta-tion in molecular biology and bio-chemistry within introductory cours-es taken at the very outset of theirstudies. A variety of intermediatecourses then provides in-depth explo-ration of the major areas of biology,from molecular genetics to field biol-ogy. Advanced students may registerfor graduate-level courses, which aremost often given in the specializedareas of faculty research. Manyoptions are available to create indi-vidualized programs of study, includ-ing a track in environmental science.For more information, see Earth and Environmental Science (49). Courses are reviewed and updated regularly toreflect the advances made in the bio-logical sciences. This program provides outstand- ing preparation for careers inresearch, academia, medicine, den-tistry, and related fields. Graduates ofthe department have a remarkablerecord of success in acceptance intoprofessional schools and in establish-ing notable careers in the biomedicalsciences. Other courses offered by the department are designed to acquaintnonscience majors with contempo-rary issues in biology. Such coursesare often topical, addressing prob-lems like environmental pollution,limits of the earth, human physiolo-gy, and sexually transmitted diseases. Outstanding and highly motivat- ed students are offered special oppor-tunities for honors work, indepen-dent study, summer laboratoryresearch, internships, and otherenhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in facul-ty laboratories through the many for-mal and informal opportunitiesafforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important research accomplishmentand contains several specializedresearch and laboratory facilities thatare integrated into the educationalprograms. These include the under-graduate Molecular Biology Labora-tory, the Scanning and TransmissionElectron Microscope Facility, and theTissue Culture Facility. Field studiesare carried out at many regional sites, including Black Rock Forest, a3,700-acre preserve for research andeducation in ecology and environ-mental science, located about oneand a half hours from New York Cityand operated by the Black Rock For-est Consortium, of which New YorkUniversity is a member. The depart-ment offers other field courses inbiology and environmental sciencethat involve travel to differentregions of the United States and toforeign countries. Students with questions about majoring or minoring in biologyshould visit the office of the Depart-ment of Biology. Those declaring amajor in biology are assigned a facul-ty adviser from the department; stu-dents meet with that professor todesign a program of study, determinecourse selections, and discuss careergoals. The faculty adviser is alsoavailable to provide guidance con-cerning the many options and oppor-tunities afforded by the departmentfor curricular enhancement, includ-ing research experiences.

The Department of Chemistry has a long tradition at the University, dating back well before the founding of the American Chemical Society at New York University in1876. Professor John W . Draper, the first president of the society and chair of the department, was an early pioneer in photography, working with Samuel F. B. Morse. The department has undertaken a major development plan, strengthening its faculty, instructional laboratories, course offerings, and research facilities in the areas of physical, bio-physical, bioorganic, and theoretical chemistry. Research areas represented by faculty membersinclude experimental and theoretical biophysical and physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry,photochemistry, and organic and bioorganic chemistry. Qualified undergraduates are encour-aged to participate in research as early as their sophomore year of study. The department hous-es state-of-the-art laboratory facilities for its undergraduate chemistry courses. Majoring in chemistry at the College of Arts and Science provides strong prepara- tion for graduate study in chemistry; professional education in patent law, medicine, or den-tistry; and careers in industrial or pharmaceutical chemistry and biotechnology.DEPARTMENT OF Chemistry (25) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 1001, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688.

Aknowledge of chemistry has alwaysbeen fundamental to the investigationof the physical world as well as to anin-depth understanding of living sys-tems. The range of modern chemistryspans from chemical physics to molec-ular biology, merging the traditionaldivisions of analytical, organic, inor- ganic, and physical chemistry. In itsrecent development, the departmentis focusing its interest on physical,biophysical, and bioorganic chemistry,exploiting interdisciplinary areas oftheory, materials science, and biologi-cal chemistry. The department has alarge and active theoretical group inthe areas of chemical physics and bio-molecular modeling. Active researchareas in the department include can-cer research, spec- troscopy, and combinatorial chem-istry. Graduates of the departmenthave found rewarding careers andachieved distinction in all phases ofscientific life, from basic research tocommercial product development.The late Gertrude Elion, a 1941 M.S.in chemistry from New York Univer-sity, shared the 1988 Nobel Prize inmedicine and physiology for herresearch in pharmaceutical chemistry.CHEMISTRY 55The department offers the major in chemistry and in biochemistry. Aselection of elective advanced cours-es, undergraduate and graduate, canbe combined to provide a broad, var-ied program of study in chemistry.The department also offers a numberof courses for nonscience studentsand service courses for students inthe other schools. The programs ofstudy in chemistry prepare studentsfor graduate work toward the mas-ter's degree or the doctorate forcareers in research, development, orteaching or for further study in areassuch as medicine, dentistry, basicmedical sciences, or allied healthcareers. In addition, both majorsleave students well prepared to pur-sue patent law or, with a minor ineconomics, to enter the field of tech-nology investment as well as man-agement in the chemical industry. For highly motivated students or for students who anticipate majoringin chemistry, the department offersspecial honors courses that satisfy thefirst two years of chemistry requiredfor majors and for the prehealth cur-riculum in medicine, dentistry, andso forth. Students need permissionfrom the department to register forthese courses, which are limited tosmall classes. Permission is based onseveral factors, including backgroundin both mathematics and physics;performance in high school chem-istry courses; and, if offered, a place-ment examination. Students may bedeemed eligible to enter the secondyear honors course (organic) based onexceptional performance in the regu-lar General Chemistry course. MAJORS Students thinking of majoring inchemistry, or biochemistry, arestrongly urged to seek course advise-ment from the Department of Chem-istry as early in their academiccareers as possible. Chemistry is asequential subject with coursesbuilding on earlier courses. Delay intaking certain key prerequisite cours-es can make it impossible to com-plete a major in four years withoutsummer attendance. A grade of C or better in chem- istry and other required courses isneeded for graduation in any majorin this department. Students who donot have an average of 2.0 in depart-mentally required courses by thetime they have completed 64 pointsin all courses may be asked to change their major. The major in chemistry builds on a core of required courses in chem-istry, physics, and mathematics. Therequired courses, two semesters ofcalculus and two semesters of generalphysics are required. A third semes-ter of calculus is strongly recom-mended as preparation forV25.0651. For students interested inpursuing chemistry on the graduatelevel or with an interest in theoreti-cal chemistry, additional courses inmathematics are recommended.These include Calculus III,V63.0123, and Linear Algebra,V63.0124. One year of intensive cal-culus, V63.0221 and V63.0222,may be substituted for calculusV63.0121 and V63.0122, plusV63.0123. The core, describedabove, provides a basic backgroundin chemistry. Students normally areencouraged to complete the coursesin general chemistry, organic chem-istry, physics, and calculus prior toentry into physical chemistry in thethird year. Alternative programs arealso possible. It is strongly advised,however, that an advanced levelchemistry course be taken in thethird year of study, allowing at leastthree more semesters to complete allmajor requirements. Undergraduate specialization in organic, biochemical, physical, ortheoretical chemistry may be accom-plished through combinations ofelective advanced undergraduate andgraduate courses open to undergrad-uates. These courses should be cho-sen in consultation with the Depart-ment of Chemistry. For students interested in prepa- ration for careers in the chemicalindustry, there are several alternativesavailable. The major in chemistrywith a minor in economics gives thestudent training in chemistry with abusiness background. Students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or basic medicalsciences may wish to consider the major in biochemistry. Additionalcourses in biology may be desirablefor such students. The appropriatepreprofessional adviser should beconsulted for details. The Department of Chemistry offers the following majors: 1. Major in chemistry: The min- imum requirements, in addition tothe core courses cited above, arecompletion of Experimental Meth-ods, V25.0661, and two advancedelective courses. 2. Major in biochemistry: The minimum requirements, in additionto the core courses cited above, areBiochemistry I and II, G25.1881,1882; Experimental Biochemistry,G25.1885; and Biophysical Chem-istry, G25.1814. Students in thismajor are reminded that these cours-es must be taken in the proper order.Careful course planning is requiredto ensure that this can be done with-in a normal four-year program. In addition to these majors, the department offers several programsand options that may be of interestto students: American Chemical Society Certification: Students majoring in either chemistry or biochemistry maybe certified by the American Chemi-cal Society on graduation. Interestedstudents should consult with thedirector of undergraduate studiesregarding the additional courserequirements for this certification. Program in Chemistry- Chemical Engineering: The College of Arts and Science offers a jointB.S./B.E. program with StevensInstitute of Technology. For studentsinterested in chemistry, the programleads to the B.S. degree from NewYork University and the B.E. (chem- ical or environmental engineering)from Joseph Hemmesand Ms.Aara Kupris Menzi in theCollege Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington SquareEast, Room 905; (212) 998-8130. Bachelor of Science Degree: Stu- dents who complete the requiredcore courses plus ExperimentalMethods, three advancedelectives V25.0995,0996; and one course in computer56 CHEMISTRYscience approved by the Department of Chemistry may elect to graduatewith the degree of Bachelor of Sci-ence (B.S.) instead of the Bachelor ofArts (B.A.). Students should notethat the B.S. program is very diffi-cult to complete within a normalfour-year academic program and thatit confers no particular advantage tostudents in premedical or predentalprograms. MINOR Completion of any four 4-pointcourses numbered V25.0101 or high-er constitutes a minor in chemistry.Only three of the four courses mayalso be used to satisfy another depart-ment's major. No grade less than Cwill count, and an average of 2.0 orbetter in all chemistry courses isrequired. GENERAL INFORMATION Laboratory courses in chemistry:Due to the potential hazard of allchemical experimentation, safetygoggles must be worn at all times inthe laboratories. Laboratory equip-ment, which is lent to the student forthe duration of the course, must bereplaced by the student if it is dam-aged or broken. Purchase cards mustbe acquired for this purpose and cost $25. Purchase cards may be obtainedfrom the stockroom during the firstweek of the term. Unused portions ofthe deposit are redeemable. Studentswho do not return borrowed labora-tory equipment at the end of a courseare charged an additional fee, andtheir grade may be recorded asincomplete and not released until\"checkout\" is completed. Advanced standing: Students who have taken college-level coursesin secondary schools and who haveachieved a grade of 4 or 5 on theCollege Entrance Examination BoardAdvanced Placement Test will begranted advanced placement. Fordetails, see the section on theAdvanced Placement Program underAdmission. However, unless priorlaboratory work is extensive, GeneralChemistry II Laboratory, V25.0104,or in exceptional cases, the FreshmanHonors Laboratory, V25.0112, mustbe taken before taking advancedchemistry courses such as OrganicChemistry I, V25.0243, and its labo-ratory. Advice about the appropriatecourse should be obtained from thedirector of undergraduate studies inthe department. Research: The department endeavors to make research opportu-nities available during the summer and the academic year to well-quali-fied students at all levels. In order toparticipate in research in the depart-ment, students must both meet theprerequisites for and register for theresearch courses Advanced IndividualStudy and Research, V25.0997,0998, or, if eligible, Senior Honors inChemistry, V25.0995, 0996. Ineither case, permission of the directorof undergraduate studies is requiredbefore registering in these courses. HONORS PROGRAM Candidates for a degree with honorsin chemistry must have an overallgrade point average of 3.5 and agrade point average of 3.5 inrequired courses in chemistry. Theymust take two semesters of SeniorHonors in Chemistry, V25.0995,0996. A senior thesis based on thiswork must be prepared, approved bythe adviser and presented at a specialseminar in the spring term of thesenior year. Students desiring entryinto the honors program must obtainthe approval of the director of under-graduate studies prior to the end oftheir junior year. For general require-ments, please see Honors and Awards. Courses The following courses are lectures unless otherwise indicated.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES Courses in classics offered in the Graduate School of Arts and Scienceare open to all undergraduates whohave reached the required advancedlevel of Greek or Latin languageinstruction. Comparative literature is an innovative, interdisciplinary major that allows students to explore literature and literary questions unfettered by national borders and institu-tional boundaries as well as to understand literature as a unique cultural form through investigating its relation to other cultural practices. In comparative literature, stu-dents develop a multifaceted critical approach that both emphasizes the integrity of litera-ture and expands on the understanding of textuality to include all cultural artifacts andmodes of thought that involve language and representation. The Department of ComparativeLiterature encourages students to pursue theoretical and philosophical modes of reading andto understand the importance of engaging texts in the original language by taking advancedcourses in a national literature and studying the practice of translation. To interrogate howliterature is enmeshed in nonliterary contexts, comparative literature majors develop exper-tise in relevant related disciplines such as art history, philosophy, history, anthropology, andcinema studies. Comparative literature departmental course offerings include lecture classesin world literature and interdisciplinary studies that provide a transition from MAP into themajor and small seminars where students work intensively with a distinguished facultycomposed of scholars in African, Caribbean, Slavic, Latin American, Chinese, and Japaneseareas as well as specialists in the European and Anglo-American traditions.DEPARTMENT OF Comparative Literature (29) 19 UNIVERSITY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4556.

CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Associate Professor Ruttenberg DIRECTOR OF UNDER- GRADUATE STUDIES: Assistant Professor Vincent 66 COMPARATIVE LITERATUREFaculty of Languages:Ngu~g~i Professors: Y\u00fadice Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES The undergraduate major is designed to foster serious work in literature atthe advanced level, while giving stu-dents a strong background in criticaland cultural analysis and a keen abil-ity to pose questions and write withlucidity and force. The major pro-vides an ideal intellectual site forstudents to draw connections across cultures, periods, genres, and disci-plines in a rigorous yet individuallydesigned way. A comparative litera-ture major could lead to theadvanced study of literature at thegraduate level but could just as read-ily be a strong basis for advanceddegrees and/or careers in publishing,journalism, international relations,international law, cultural studies,medicine, philosophy, education, public policy, film and entertain-ment industries, the Internet, andcomputer software. GENERAL INFORMATION Many comparative literature majorswish to study literature in its inter-national contexts, having masteredone or more foreign literatures.COMPARATIVE LITERATURE 67However, such mastery is not required in all courses or of allmajors, and courses are open to awide range of nonmajors with eclec-tic and interdisciplinary interests. MAJOR To declare a major, a student must successfully complete one courseoffered by the Department of Com-parative Literature. The major hastwo tracks, each consisting of ten 4-point courses organized as follows: Track 1: Literature. This track includes the following courses: 1.Four courses originating in the Department of Comparative Litera-ture, including one introductory-level course and one junior seminarwhen available. These four coursesmust be taught by a faculty memberof the Department of ComparativeLiterature; they cannot be cross-list-ed courses originating in anotherdepartment. 2.Four courses in a national liter- ature department at the 100 level orabove conducted in the language ofthat literature (including the prereq-uisite course). 3.Two courses in a related cul- tural field or discipline. Fields couldinclude history, art history, religion,philosophy, classics, politics, cinemastudies, and so on and could also beanother foreign language or literary area. If the national literature depart-ment selected for specialization isEnglish, these two courses must bein a foreign language. The choice ofthese courses will be made in consul-tation with the adviser to form acoherent intellectual field and adefined objective in the major. Track 2: Literary and Cultural Studies. Track 2 includes the follow- ing requirements: 1.Four courses originating in the Department of Comparative Litera-ture, including one introductory-level course and one junior seminarwhen available. These four coursesmust be taught by a faculty memberof the Department of ComparativeLiterature; they cannot be cross-list-ed courses originating in anotherdepartment. 2.Four courses in a related cul- tural field or discipline. Fields couldinclude history, art history, religion,philosophy, classics, politics, cinemastudies, and so on. The choice ofthese courses will be made in consul-tation with the adviser to form acoherent intellectual field and adefined objective in the major. 3.Two courses in a foreign litera- ture department in the language ofthat literature, normally at the 100level or above. MINOR Four courses originating in theDepartment of Comparative Litera-ture (i.e., not cross-listed coursesoriginating in other departments)and a demonstrated reading knowl-edge of one of the foreign literaturesstudied in these courses. ADVISEMENT The director of undergraduate stud-ies serves as adviser to all compara-tive literature majors and minors. HONORS To receive honors in the major, a stu- dent must maintain at least a 3.5average in the 10 courses required forthe major and must write a seniorhonors essay in his or her finalsemester.

The value of a computer science degree in a liberal arts program is consistently growing due to demand for graduates withboth general knowledge and specialized skills. The department offers a computer science major, a computer science minor, and a minor in computer applications. The goal of the major is to train students in fundamentalprinciples of computer science as well as many practical aspects of software development.The goal of the minors is to train students to be proficient users of computers and com-puter software with less emphasis on mathematical tools. Courses combine practical pro-gramming experience with techniques for analyzing problems and designing computeralgorithms. Advanced undergraduate students can work on a variety of research projects with the faculty. Outstanding undergraduates may pursue a master's degree through an acceler-ated five-year program.DEPARTMENT OF Computer Science (22) 251 MERCER STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10012-1185. (212) 998-3010.

The focus of the program is primarily on language and literature and the way in which these four civilizations have interacted with the Western world to reconstitute received cultures into modern societies. By intensive study of Asian culture, thestudent is encouraged to reflect on the global interrelatedness of human society. At present,three language sequences are offered: a six-semester Chinese language sequence, a six-semes-ter Japanese language sequence, and a six-semester Korean language sequence. Fourth-year study is also offered in all three languages. In addition, various courses in Asian culture are offered in the Department of East Asian Studies, while courses in his-tory, politics, and art are available in other departments. Starting with the summer sessionof 2000, the program has arranged a series of courses at Nanjing University in China. The proximity of Chinatown to the College of Arts and Science gives students access to many cultural events, such as festivals and theatre, that highlight the social back-ground of Asian thought. In New York City, important collections and exhibitions of Asianart are always available to the interested student.PROGRAM IN East Asian Studies (33) 715 BROADWAY , 3RD FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6806.

Zhang (Cinema Stud-ies), ReligiousStudies)Language Lecturers: Goto, Lee, S. Lee, Shao Instructors: Lam, Wang Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES The program has two objectives: (1) to develop a high level of compe-tence in Chinese, Japanese, andKorean and (2) to introduce studentsto the authentic voices of Asian cul-tures through the study of translatedliterary and cultural documents (pri-marily literature, religion, and phi-losophy) created within those soci-eties. Moreover, ongoing study ofthose cultures is encouraged as ameans of acquiring a broad compara- tive perspective and an appreciationof the human problems common toall cultures. The courses are offeredthrough various departments, under-scoring the multidisciplinary natureof the program. MAJOR The program leads to an East Asianstudies humanities major in either oftwo ways: 1.Students may complete Chi-nese, Japanese, or Korean through the advanced level and four approvedcourses from among the College'sofferings in the geographic area. Ele-mentary levels I and II of these threelanguages will not be countedtoward fulfilling the major require-ment. Substitutions for the languagecourses may be made if a student candemonstrate equivalent languagecompetence through a placementtest; credit is not given for place-ment test results.82 EAST ASIAN STUDIES2. Students who have already completed the CAS languagerequirement (two years) with eitherChinese, Japanese, or Korean,through a language placement test oraccredited course work, are requiredto complete language study throughthe third year (advanced level II) andmay take six nonlanguage coursesrelated to the geographic region asdefined above. Although the suggested major requirements of language combinedwith nonlanguage instruction arestrongly recommended and enforced,in certain cases, a student's programcan be individually designed in con-sultation with the director of under-graduate studies. For example, if astudent prefers not to study a lan-guage in the program, he or she mayachieve a major by completing eightnonlanguage courses. Note: (1) All East Asian studies majors\u2014as well as students planningto major in this field\u2014are expected,prior to commencing their studies inEAS, to complete one of the follow-ing courses in fulfillment of MAPrequirements:V55.0506 Chinese and Japanese World Cultures: JapanV55.0512 World China(2) Asian/Pacific/American stud- ies offers several courses, some ofwhich can be used on a limited basistoward the completion of an EastAsian studies major or minor. Thesecross-listings are determined on asemester-by-semester basis. (3) Cantonese and Tibetan lan- guages may not be counted towardeither major or minor requirements. MINOR Consists of four nonlanguage courses.A language minor can be obtainedby taking four courses in Chinese,Japanese, or Korean. However, ele-mentary levels I and II of these threelanguages will not be countedtoward fulfilling the minor require-ment. A student's minor programcan be determined individually inconsultation with the director ofundergraduate studies.HONORS PROGRAM Eligibility: Students must spend at least two full years in residence at theCollege of Arts and Science, complet-ing at least 60 points of graded workin the College. Students must main-tain a general grade point average of3.5 and a major average of 3.7. Requirements: 1.Completion of the major requirements. 2. Under the supervision of a departmental faculty member, anhonors paper written as part of Inde-pendent Study, V33.0997 andV33.0998, for 4 points in total (2points during each semester) in thestudent's senior year, in addition tothe course work required of allmajors. The faculty supervisor andthe subject of the honors paper arechosen in consultation with thedirector of the program.

The Invention of Modern Japanese Literature V33.0720 Vincent. 4 points. This course focuses on the partplayed by \"literature\" in the estab-lishment of national and individualsubjectivity in prewar Japan (1868-1945). It is one of the great ironies ofmodernity that the emergence ofnational community is marked by anever-greater isolation of the individ-ual subject. Readings of literary textsin combination with critical essayshelp students to examine this para-dox in relation to changes in thepractice of reading, the constructionof the \"reader\" and the \"author,\" thepractice and effects of translation andtravel, the privileging of the spokenvoice, and the solidification of the\"novel\" as a genre. We pay as muchattention to formal questions such aspoint of view and narrative strategyas to \"content\" and are ever wary ofthe fact that we are reading in trans-lation. Modern Japanese Literature in Translation II V33.0721 Vincent. 4 points. This course exposes students to someof the most provocative and enter-taining novels written in Japanesesince the end of the Second WorldWar. Students see how the collapse of totalizing ideologies brought byJapan's defeat led to an extremelyfertile and yet somewhat atomizedliterary landscape. In this new post-war terrain, it became increasinglydifficult to think of literature interms of \"schools\" or \"influences,\" asquestions of cultural and individualidentity became harder and harder toanswer in a world of material pros-perity and cultural hybridization.

A major or minor in eco-nomics is also useful as a background for careers in law, health, international affairs, business management, public administration, journalism, and politics. Despite the fact that the department is large, student-faculty rapport is excellent, with advanced and honors students working individually with professors. The economics faculty is involved in active research, using the University's excel- lent computer facilities and libraries. Many faculty members are associated with researchinstitutes. The C. V . Starr Center for Applied Economics, directed by Professor MarkGertler, bridges the gap between academic research and decision making in business andgovernment. It analyzes issues with important economic and social consequence and dis-seminates the results of its research to the business community through a series of confer-ences, monographs, seminars, and research papers. The Institute for Economic Analysis,directed by Edward Wolff, is an institute that explores theoretical and empirical questionsusing input-output as a primary tool of analysis.DEPARTMENT OF Economics (31) 269 MERCER STREET, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687. (212) 998-8900. WWW .ECON.NYU.EDU. CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Gale DIRECTOR OF UNDER-GRADUATE STUDIES: Professor Ramsey ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATESTUDIES: Associate Professor Topa Faculty Professor Emeritus: Haines Paulette Goddard Professor of Political Economy:Benhabib Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Economics:GertlerJay MAJOR In order to allow students to selectan approach to the study of econom-ics that is more suitable to their per-sonal aptitudes and interests, a majorin economics can be taken in eitherof two concentrations as describedbelow. Transfer students should note that normally the only courses thatwill be accepted toward the major ineconomics are courses that have been passed with a grade of C or better atuniversities with an intensive four-year program. A grade of C or better is required for a course to count toward themajor in economics. Note: if a stu- dent fails a course required for themajor, the course must be retaken inthe department; a course taken out-side the University will not normallybe allowed to substitute for a failed course. No course for the major maybe taken as \"Pass/Fail.\" Policy concentration. The policy concentration is intended for the stu-dent who is primarily interested inthe application of economic princi-ples to understanding current events,economic institutions, and the for-mation of government policy. Theintroductory and intermediate theoryECONOMICS 87courses provide the student with a solid foundation of the basic frame-work for economic analysis with anemphasis on economic applications.The elective courses focus on eco-nomic policy and institutions. Thisconcentration is particularly wellsuited for students planning careersin law, public policy, business, or anyother field in which a thoroughunderstanding of economic problemsand the economic way of thinkingwould be beneficial. At least 42 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Department ofEconomics: fourelectives, at least two must be num-bered V31.0300-399. At least one ofthese electives must be V31.0323,V31.0324, V31.0351, or V31.0353. A typical sequence of courses sophomore V31.0002, V31.0018;junior year: V31.0010, V31.0012,V31.0238; senior year: four electives. Students are strongly advised to pay close attention to the prerequi-sites for each course. While calculusis not a formal requirement for thepolicy concentration, students shouldbe aware that Precalculus (V63.0009),or its equivalent, is required and thatit is inevitable that some mathemat-ics will be used throughout the pro-gram. Because of this, students areurged to take Calculus I (V63.0121)in order to facilitate their training ineconomics. Theory concentration. The theory concentration is intended for the stu-dent who wishes to begin the formalstudy of economic reasoning with anemphasis on mastering the analyticaltools. This concentration relies on ahigher level of abstraction and focus-es on techniques of economic analysisrather than on the understanding ofspecific economic problems or insti-tutions. It is particularly well-suitedfor students who intend to pursue aPh.D. degree in economics or thosepursuing careers or higher degrees inquantitative fields such as finance. At least 40 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Department ofEconomics that must includeV31.0005, num-bered V31.0300-399 stu-dents must complete V63.0122, and V63.0123. These cal-culus courses should be completedbefore or during the student's firstyear in the program. A typical course sequence V31.0005,V31.0006, Changing concentrations. Students with permission from the director ofundergraduate studies may changefrom the policy concentration to thetheory concentration, or vice versa;however, certain rules apply. Ineither case no course may be takenfor which the student does not havethe appropriate prerequisites; thisincludes the mathematics prerequi-sites. A student moving from thepolicy concentration to the theoryconcentration after having takenV31.0001 and V31.0002 need nottake V31.0005, but must takeV31.0006. A student moving fromthe theory concentration to the poli-cy concentration need not take eitherof the Principles courses, providedthey have completed V31.0005 andV31.0006. Transferring between concentra- tions after students have completedany of the intermediate theory cours-es is very difficult, more so in goingfrom the policy to the theory concen-tration. Students who are unsureabout which concentration to takeshould seek departmental advicebefore beginning their major. MINOR Students may minor in economics ineither concentration. A minorenables a student to acquire a usefulunderstanding of economic conceptsand analysis without the same degreeof coverage as would be obtained in amajor. A grade of C or better is required for a course to count toward theminor in economics. Note: If a stu- dent fails a course required for theminor, the course must be retaken inthe department; a course taken out-side the University will not normallybe allowed to substitute for a failedcourse. No course for the minor maybe taken as \"Pass/Fail.\" Policy minor. At least 26 points (6 courses) to be taken in the Depart-ment of Economics, includingV31.0001, V31.0002, V31.0018,either V31.0010 or V31.0012, and two additional 4-point coursesfor which the student has the prerequisites. Theory minor. At least 24 points (6 courses) to be taken in the Depart-ment of Economics to includeV31.0005, V31.0006, V31.0020, atleast one of V31.0011 or V31.0013,and any other two courses for whichthe student has the prerequisites. JOINT MAJOR IN ECONOMICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE This is an interdisciplinary major offered by the Department of Com-puter Science with the Departmentof Economics. There are require-ments in three departments, includ-ing mathematics. A grade of C orbetter is required in all courses. The mathematics requirements are V63.0120, V63.0121, V63.0122,and may one of V63.0124, V31.0020, V31.0266,plus any three economics electivecourses, of which mustbe a theory electives numberedV31.0300 to V31.0399. One ofthese electives may be replaced byV22.0444. JOINT MAJOR IN ECONOMICS AND MATHEMATICS A joint major is offered by the Departments of Economics (31) andMathematics (63). In the economicsdepartment, joint majors with math-ematics may only take the theorysequence. Nine courses must betaken from each department. The mathematics requirements are nine 4-point courses numberedV63.0120 or higher, which mustinclude V63.0325 and V63.0326.The computer science courseV22.0101 may be credited economics requirements V31.0266,plus any three economics elective88 ECONOMICScourses, least two of which must be theory electives numberedV31.0300 to V31.0399. Interested students should con- sult with the director of undergradu-ate studies in both departments foradditional information. HONORS PROGRAM Honors may be taken in either con-centration. Students interested ingoing to graduate school or profes-sional schools are strongly urged totake honors. A 3.5 overall grade point average and a 3.5 average in economicscourses are required. Honors studentsare required to complete eitherV31.0266 (theory concentration) orV31.0380 (policy concentration).Students are also required to write anhonors thesis under faculty supervi-sion. Students interested in taking honors register for V31.0410 in thefall semester of the senior year inorder to prepare for V31.0400, to betaken in the spring semester of thatyear. Students are strongly advised tobegin the process toward the end ofthe spring semester of the junioryear. Interested students should con- sult with the director of undergradu-ate studies. For general requirements,see under Honors and Awards. INCOMPLETES The Department of Economics expects all students to complete theircourses on time. Incompletes are per-mitted only under exceptional, well-documented circumstances. Toobtain an incomplete, a student mustsubmit a form that has to be signedby the professor and the director of undergraduate studies in economics;the student should do this immedi-ately. Incompletes must be removedby the end of the semester followingthe incomplete or they will revertautomatically to a grade of F. All makeup finals should be scheduled with the department inthe first month of the followingsemester. A fee is collected by thedepartment to pay for proctoring.Any student who fails to complete acourse on time will receive an F, notan incomplete, unless the procedurefor incompletes outlined above is fol-lowed. A student may petition for anextension of time to remove theincomplete, but such requests willonly be granted under the mostunusual circumstances. Courses In the list of courses below, somecourses are designated either \"P\" or\"T.\" \"P\" represents courses to betaken only by students in the policyconcentration; \"T\" represents coursesto be taken only by students in thetheory concentration. With permis-sion of the director of undergraduatestudies, students may take courses inthe other concentration; the majorconstraint is that such students havethe required prerequisites to enterthe course. Economics course numbers fall into four major groups. Core coursesare numbered below 0100. Coursesnumbered 0100 require courses.

The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager fora liberal arts experience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Oncompletion of this five-year program, students receive the Bachelor of Science degree fromthe College of Arts and Science at New York University and the Bachelor of Engineeringdegree from Stevens Institute of Technology. Students with this combination of degrees arelikely to find excellent employment opportunities. The available dual degree combinations are as follows: B.S. in biology/B.E. in chemical in engineering;B.S. and B.S. in physics/B.E. inmechanical engineering. Detailed programs of study for each of the curricula are available from Mr. Joseph Hemmes and Ms. Aara Kupris Menzi, the advisers for all students in the various programs.They may be contacted at the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 WashingtonSquare East, Room 905; (212) 998-8130.

(212) 998-8130. DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM AT NEW YORKUNIVERSITY: Associate Professor Brenner DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM AT STEVENSINSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY: Professor Cole ASSISTANTS TO THE DEAN FOR ENGINEERINGSTUDENTS: Joseph Hemmes and Aara Kupris Menzi Program REQUIREMENTS The dual degree program is designed to meet the educational and careerinterests of students with strongqualifications, as evidenced by theirgrade point average in high schooland by their performance in mathe-matics and science. Students whorank near the top of their class andwho have done well on standardizedtests, particularly in mathematics, are especially well suited. Students should have completed a rigorous college preparation pro-gram, including mathematics(through trigonometry), chemistry,and physics, and exhibited substantialextracurricular activity and leadership. Students are usually admitted to the program as freshmen and mustbe prepared to begin with Calculus I, V63.0121, in the first semester ofcollege. Students must also be pre-pared to take Introduction to Com-puter Science I, V22.0101; thiscourse has a prerequisite, Introduc-tion to Computers and Program-ming, V22.0002, which may bewaived by placement examination forstudents with prior programming94 ENGINEERINGexperience. Given the highly struc- tured curricula, transfer into the pro-gram after the first year may be diffi-cult. Students must maintain satis-factory performance in courses appro-priate to the high technical require-ments in order to remain in the pro-gram. Their records are reviewedyearly by a faculty committee, andstudents are approved by this com-mittee for transfer to Stevens at theend of the third year. THE PROGRAM Students accepted into the programspend their first three years of studyin the College of Arts and Science atNew York University. In the firstyear at the College, the different cur-ricula call for many of the samecourses. This gives students time toconsult with faculty at both schoolsbefore committing themselves to aparticular science/engineering major.A typical first-year program mightconsist of the following Fall semester: Writing the Essay, V40.0100; Calculus I, V63.0121;Engineering Design Laboratory I,V37.0111; Physics I, V85.0091; andeither General Chemistry I,V25.0101, and General ChemistryLaboratory I, V25.0103, or Introduc-tion to Computer Science I,V22.0101. Spring semester: a course from the Morse Academic Plan (MAP);Calculus II, V63.0122; EngineeringDesign Laboratory II, V37.0112;Physics V25.0102,and General Chemistry LaboratoryII, V25.0104, or Introduction toComputer Science II, V22.0102. At the end of the first year, if they have not already done so, stu-dents select a major area for their remaining two years of study at NewYork University from the disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer sci-ence, mathematics, and physics. Seminars by Stevens departmen- tal faculty advisers and by profession-al engineering leaders from privatefirms are included in the Society ofEngineering Students' weekly meet-ings to provide information to stu-dents about opportunities in the var-ious engineering fields represented.Students should choose their desiredengineering major by the end of thesecond year. In the spring of thethird year, an orientation programhelps students prepare for the transi-tion to Stevens in the fourth year. Inthese first three years of the program,students also satisfy their MAPrequirements. In the first year stu-dents are introduced to the engineer-ing design experience with Engineer-ing Design Laboratory I and II. Inthe second and third years, studentsare required to take engineeringcourses, taught by Stevens faculty atthe Washington Square campus.These courses are all subjects in the\"core\" engineering curriculum, takenby all engineering students, regard-less of engineering major. Thesecourses are at the first level of engi-neering study and give students anopportunity to learn the technicalfeel of various engineering subjects.The second-year courses are V37.5126 and Circuitsand V37.7245, Electronicsand V37.7246, andEngineering Design Lab IV ,V37.0232. These introductory cours-es must be completed prior to enter-ing the fourth year at Stevens. These are difficult curricula, and some programs may require summercourses for some students. Stevenshas permitted students in the pro-gram tuition-free enrollment in a fewsummer courses offered only atStevens (but not at NYU) to assiststudents in maintaining curricularprogress. Students may elect to with-draw from the dual degree programin engineering and complete only theCollege of Arts and Science generaland major requirements at New YorkUniversity. Financial aid and scholar-ships, housing, dining, and other ser-vices are provided by New York Uni-versity during the first three years. The final two years of study are undertaken at Stevens Institute ofTechnology at Castle Point in Hobo- ken, New Jersey, directly across theHudson River and a short PATHtrain ride from New York University'sGreenwich Village campus. At Stevens, students complete the remaining technical courses, themajority of the engineering courses,and the senior design project in thefifth year. Programs in engineeringavailable to students in the NYU-Stevens dual degree program includechemical engineering, civil engineer-ing, computer engineering, electricalengineering, environmental engi-neering, and mechanical engineering. In the last two years of the pro- gram, financial aid, housing, dining,and other services are provided byStevens at the Castle Point campus.Separate transcripts are supplied by the two schools, and students may make use of the facilities of thecareer and placement offices of bothinstitutions.

By learning toread critically and to write with analytical precision, students who major in English prepare themselves to participate intelligently in their culture while forging a lifelong,enriching relationship with literature. The department's offerings are bolstered by the strong literature collections avail- able on campus at the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, which also houses the Fales Library ofEnglish and American Literature. Students are also encouraged to make use of the researchopportunities presented by the excellent collections of the New York Historical Society andthe New York Public Library. The department provides opportunities for specializedresearch through seminars, independent study courses, and an honors program that culmi-nates in the writing of an honors thesis during the senior year under the supervision of a faculty member. The department also offers elective credit for internships in publishing, atliterary agencies, and at other professional offices. The rich cultural life of New York City,and of Greenwich Village in particular, make NYU an ideal location for the study of English and American literature.DEPARTMENT OF English (41) 19 UNIVERSITY PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-4556.

The problem, for which thetools of several academic disciplinesshould be applicable, will be thebasis for the major research project. Majors in European studies must have or attain an advanced levelknowledge of a major European lan-guage other than English (e.g.,French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian,German, Russian). In order to provethis knowledge students must suc-cessfully complete an advance levellanguage course. The alternative tothis is to have passed the CAS profi-ciency exam prior to graduation.Nine courses that deal with Europeare required: two in history (beyondthe introductory level); two in litera-ture (preferably in the language ofspecialization); two in the social sci- ences; two in philosophy, fine arts, orcinema studies; and one senior hon-ors seminar in European studies. Thesenior seminar is interdisciplinaryand includes the requirement of amajor research project (or thesis). Asequence of courses might beginwith two advanced history coursesand two literature courses in thesophomore and/or junior years, fol-lowed by two social science and twophilosophy, fine arts, and/or cinemastudies courses. The interdisciplinaryseminar should be taken during thefirst semester of the senior year. Majors who entered the college in fall 2000 and thereafter are requiredto complete a semester abroad. Stu-dents may petition the director ofthe center for exemption from thisrequirement. Students who fulfill the require- ments of the major with an overall106 EUROPEAN STUDIESgrade point average of at least 3.5 and at least 3.5 in European studieswill receive the B.A. degree with\"honors in European studies.\" Thehonors designation recognizes thework beyond the normal course workrequired of students in the seniorseminar and in the major researchproject. MINOR All students minoring in West Euro-pean studies must demonstrate profi-ciency in at least one West Europeanlanguage above the intermediatelevel (French, German, Italian, Por-tuguese, or Spanish). They must alsofulfill the following course require-ments: one course in modern Euro-pean history; one course in Europeanpolitics, anthropology, or economics(V53.0150, V14.0111, orV31.0224); and three additionalcourses in at least the follow-ing areas: modern European history;politics; anthropology; sociology;economics; Hebrew and Judaic and Italian, French, German, orSpanish civilization. No more thantwo of these courses may focus onany one specific country. All courseprograms must be designed in con-sultation with the center's under-graduate program adviser. B.A./M.A. PROGRAM This new program offers qualifyingmajors in European studies theopportunity to earn both the B.A.and the M.A. degrees in a shorterperiod of time and at reduced tuitioncost. By taking some of their gradu-ate requirements while still under-graduates, students can complete theprogram in a maximum of five years.In the graduate portion of the pro-gram, students receive a fellowshipthat covers up to half of the tuitionfor the courses required for the M.A. European studies majors may apply for admission to the programafter they have completed at least 32points in the College and threecourses toward the major. Applica-tions are reviewed by the GraduateAdmission Committee of the Centerfor European Studies, using the nor-mal criteria for the M.A. program,except that applicants are notrequired to take the GREs. The com-mittee bases its decision on students'undergraduate records and recom-mendations of NYU instructors. A working knowledge at an advanced level of a European lan-guage (other than English) isrequired to complete the program,and knowledge of a second Europeanlanguage is encouraged. Studentsmust spend at least one semester inan approved academic program inEurope, normally during their junioryear. Students are also required towrite a senior honors thesis and mas-ter's thesis (see below) to earn thetwo degrees. The program requires a total of 19 courses: nine undergraduatecourses and 10 graduate courses. Forthe first four years, students focustheir work on a \"problem area\" thatwill eventually become the subject oftheir master's thesis. is an integrative pro-ject within the \"problem area\" devel-oped by the student and his or heradviser. It may be an expansion of aresearch paper written for an under-graduate course. The graduate por-tion of the degree comprises threetracks\u2014Politics and Society, Euro-pean Union Studies, and Humanitiesand Cultural Trends\u2014and studentsmust choose one of these by thebeginning of their fifth year. Of the10 graduate courses, two are required(one a graduate introductory historycourse, the other a graduate researchseminar in European studies), andtwo others must be chosen from thegraduate program's \"core\" courses,depending on which of the threetracks the student chooses for spe-cialization. Students are also requiredto take five additional graduatecourses in their chosen track. Aninternship, arranged and approved bythe center, is recommended as thefinal course. With prior approval, astudent may take a graduate seminarin lieu of an internship. Each student's program is orga- nized with his or her adviser at thetime that he or she enters the pro-gram. The first draft of the thesis isdeveloped in the undergraduate Sem-inar on European Studies (V42.0300),taken in the fall semester of thefourth year. The master's thesis is arevision of this project and is furtherdeveloped in the graduate ResearchSeminar (G42.3000), taken in the fallsemester of the fifth year. The M.A.thesis must be defended at an oralexamination during the spring semes-ter of the fifth year. TIRES For students who have an interest inquestions of immigration, CES offersa special exchange program with fourEuropean universities: The Universi-taet van Amsterdam, Institut d'Etudes Univer-sit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, and Europa-Universit\u00e4tViadrina, Frankfurt (Oder). The TIRES program (Transnationalism,International Migration, Race Ethno-centrism and the State) is a coherentset of courses organized by each ofthe European universities togetherwith workshops and seminars avail-able to all students who participate.Mobility and language learningstipends are available to studentswho qualify. EUROSIM EUROSIM is an annual model Euro-pean Union simulation designed toenhance students' classroom knowl-edge of the workings of a politicallyand economically integrated Europe.The simulation exercise models thelegislative procedure of the EuropeanUnion from the introduction of adraft resolution by the EuropeanCommission to the acceptance (orrejection) of an amended documentby the European Council. Each year, New York State col- leges and universities send a delega-tion of undergraduate students toEUROSIM to represent one of themember states of the EuropeanUnion and the European Commis-sion. The legislation on which dele-gates work is focused on one maintheme chosen for its relevance to cur-rent European issues. Students indi-vidually play the roles of real-lifegovernment ministers, members ofthe European Parliament, and mem-bers of the Economic and SocialCommittee and the Committee ofthe Regions. EUROSIM is held in alternating years in the United States and inEurope. In addition, several Euro-pean universities send students to bepart of their respective member statedelegations alongside the Americanstudents. In this way, U.S. studentsreceive a \"home-grown\" perspectiveof the issues that they are debating.

Students at the introductory level examine art objectsand learn the basic critical and historical vocabulary through which these objects may be understood and appreciated. At the advanced level, majors and nonmajors alike havethe opportunity to investigate aspects (e.g., style, iconography, patronage) of the arts in aparticular geographical area at a given historical time. This advanced work, in conjunctionwith appropriate language training, provides a solid foundation for those who plan to go tograduate school in preparation for a career in the arts (e.g., scholarship, teaching, museums,writing). The urban design and architecture studies program provides both a broad, human- istic perspective on the physical aspects of the city and preprofessional training for futurearchitects, city planners, public administrators, and writers on urban problems. An internationally renowned faculty and a diverse group of students share the Grey Art Library and Study Center, which includes lecture and seminar rooms, offices, a referencelibrary, and ample space for the study of visual materials.DEPARTMENT OF Fine Arts (43) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 303, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688.

The four FCC courses intro- duce students to the modes of inquiry by which societies may be studied, social issuesanalyzed, and artistic activity explored. Together they give undergraduates a broadmethodological background on which to draw when later engaged in the more focusedwork of their major courses of study. As a result, students receive a richer education thanany single major could provide. Through this core experience in humanistic and social-scientific inquiry and its focus on a number of similar readings across different course sections, the FCC frameworkallows students to enter into a dialogue with one another despite differences in their courseschedules and in this way also encourages lifelong habits of intellectual curiosity andengagement. As they learn the sound employment of the academic approaches at the center of their FCC classes, students develop their abilities to read critically, think rigorously, andwrite effectively. By building these skills and an appreciation of the diversity of human expe-rience, the FCC seeks to prepare students for their continued learning in and beyond college,for active participation in their communities, and for lives in a rapidly changing world. All FCC courses are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished professors. In addition to two lectures a week, every FCC course includesrecitation sections led by graduate student preceptors, allowing for small-group discussionof the readings, close attention to students' written work, and personal concern for students'progress.Foundations of Contemporary Culture (55) 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 903, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688.

CONVERSATIONS OF THE WEST Conversations of the West sections all share a recommended reading listof works from Greek, Roman, andNear Eastern antiquity. Typically, theclasses have the following readings incommon: the books of Genesis andExodus from the Hebrew Scriptures,the Gospel According to Luke andActs of the Apostles from the Christ-ian New Testament, a Platonic dia-logue and a Sophoclean or Euripi-dean tragedy, Virgil's Aeneid, and Augustine's Confessions. Additional readings for each class are selected bythe individual instructors, who taketheir guidance from the recommend-ed reading lists for the several tracks. In addition to the traditional lec- ture/recitation format, selected sec-tions of Conversations of the Westare also offered in writing-intensiveversions in conjunction withV40.0100, Writing the Essay. Con-sult the Directory of Classes for each semester's schedule. Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle AgesV55.0401 4 points. Continues with Dante's Inferno, selec- tions from Paradiso, and with other readings from the Middle Ages. Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the RenaissanceV55.0402 4 points. Continues with Machiavelli's Prince, a Shakespearean play or Milton's Sam- son Agonistes, and with other readings from the Renaissance. Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the EnlightenmentV55.0403 4 points. Continues with Pascal's Pens\u00e9es, Rousseau's Confessions, and with other readings from the Enlightenment.Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th CenturyV55.0404 4 points. Continues with Marx's Communist Manifesto, selections from Darwin, Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality, or Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and with other readings from the19th and early 20th centuries. WORLD CULTURES World Cultures: The Ancient Near East and EgyptV55.0501 4 points. Egypt and Mesopotamia, the twogreat non-Western civilizations ofthe Ancient Near East, examinedthrough ancient texts illustratingtheir historical development and cul-ture. These are the civilizationswhere writing began; and each had asignificant impact on Israel, Greece,Rome, and, eventually, the West.Egypt and Mesopotamia are com-pared and contrasted for develop-ments such as urbanism and stateformation, imperialism, religion,warfare, family life, trade and econo-my, kingship, the roles of men andwomen, literature, cosmology, andart. Students explore literature in thebroadest sense, including documentsthat might otherwise simply beclassed as historical. World Cultures: Islamic Societies V55.0502 4 points. Examines the common base andregional variations of Islamic soci-eties. An \"Islamic society\" is hereunderstood as one that shares, eitheras operative present or as historicalpast, that common religious basecalled Islam. For Muslims, Islam isnot simply a set of beliefs or obser-vances but also includes a history; itsstudy is thus by nature historical,topical, and regional. The emphasisin the premodern period is first onthe Quran and then on law, politicaltheory, theology, and mysticism. Forthe more recent period, the stress ison the search for religious identity.Throughout, students are exposed toIslamic societies in the words of theirown writings.World Cultures: Africa V55.0505 4 points. Key concepts related to understand-ing sub-Saharan African cultures andsocieties, concentrating in particularon teaching students how to thinkcritically and consult sources sensiblywhen studying non-Western cul-tures. Topics include problems in theinterpretation of African literature,African history, gender issues, thequestion of whether African thoughtand values constitute a unique sys-tem of thinking, the impact of theslave trade and colonialism uponAfrican societies and culture, and thedifficulties of and means for translat-ing and interpreting the system ofthought and behavior in an Africantraditional society into terms mean-ingful to Westerners. Among thereadings are novels, current philo-sophical theory, and feminist inter-pretations of black and whiteaccounts of African societies and theplace of women in them. Issues areapproached with the use of analysesfrom history, anthropology, sociology,literary theory, and philosophy. World Cultures: The Chinese and Japanese TraditionsV55.0506 4 points. Essential aspects of Asian culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism,and Shintoism\u2014studied throughcareful reading of major works ofphilosophy and literature. A roughlyequal division between Chinese andJapanese works is meant to give abasic understanding of the broadsimilarities and the less obvious, butall-important, differences among thecultures of Confucian Asia. One read-ing is a Vietnamese adaptation of aChinese legend. The last two read-ings, modern novellas from Japanand China, show the reaction of thetraditional cultures to the Westerninvasions. World Cultures: Japan\u2014A Cultural HistoryV55.0507 4 points. A consideration of the prehistory toJapan's modernist transformationthrough an analysis of key literary, 120 FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTUREwho complete a major in one areaand a minor in the other may satisfyboth components. A list of the areadesignations of major and minor pro-grams in the College may be foundin the MAP brochure, published annually as a supplement to this bul-letin, and on the MAP Web site. CAS students can also satisfy Societies and the Social Sciences andExpressive Culture by completing approved departmental courses. For acurrent list of approved courses, con-sult the MAP Web site or the MAPbrochure.FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE 121religious, and artistic texts. Concen- trates on the historical experiencesthat produced elements of a nationalculture before there was a nation andon the consciousness of being Japan-ese before there was a \"Japan.\" Exam-ines how key cultural elements wereused to make a modern nation-state. World Cultures: Russia Between East and WestV55.0510 4 points. Distinctive historical and geographi-cal dichotomies and issues in Russianculture. Emphasis is on primary doc-uments, including literary works,travel notes, works of art, and politi-cal statements from all periods, cho-sen to establish the particular matrixof competing positions that make upthe Russian national and culturalidentity. World Cultures: Middle Eastern SocietiesV55.0511 4 points. The popular American picture of theMiddle East as a place of violence,veiled women, and oil wealth por-trays none of the richness or com-plexity of most people's lives in theregion. How can we make sense ofthese seemingly unfamiliar societiesand think critically about Westernimages of the unfamiliar? Questionsexamined in depth include the fol-lowing: What variety of sources dopeople in the Middle East draw on todefine their sense of who they are\u2014as members of particular households,regions, nations, or religious commu-nities? How do women and men con-struct their gender identity? In whatways are village, town, and city livesbeing transformed? Do people of theMiddle East experience their region'spolitics the way it is portrayed in theWest? What are some of the causes of political repression, armed strug-gle, or terror? How did Europeancolonialism reshape the lives of peo-ple in the region, and how do theytoday encounter the cultural and eco-nomic power of the United Statesand Europe? Readings are drawnfrom history, anthropology, politicaleconomy, and the contemporary liter-ature of the region. World Cultures: China V55.0512 4 points. Fundamental concepts and practicesof Chinese society and culture, exam-ined using primary sources in trans-lation whenever possible. By study-ing the social, political, religious,ideological, ritual, economic, and cultural life of the Chinese, studentsgain a sense of the core values andissues of Chinese civilization andhow these have affected and continueto have an impact on the way peoplethink and live. World Cultures: Pre-Columbian AmericaV55.0513 4 points. The beliefs and practices of twomajor societies and cultures of pre-Hispanic Mexico: the Aztecs and theMayas. We examine the nature ofcultures based primarily on an oraltradition; how these cultures sawtheir origins and history; how theydefined their relationship to commu-nity, to nature, to the gods, and tothestate; their ways of seeing life and death; and their concept of time andreality. Themes include politics andgovernance, religion and ritual, his-tory and myth, narrative and poetry,codices and stelae, urban centers andceremonial spaces. Students come tounderstand non-Western ways ofthought and practice and to see thecontinuity of these traditions intopresent-day indigenous culture. Alsoconsidered is the issue of the authen-ticity of sources translated from theiroriginal languages and transcribed inthe post-conquest period. World Cultures: Ancient Israel V55.0514 4 points. The culture of the ancient Israelitesocieties of biblical times, coveringthe period from about 1200 B.C.E.t o the conquests of Alexander theGreat, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law andsocial organization, prophetic move-ments, Israelite religion, and ancientHebrew literature. The HebrewBible preserves much of the creativi-ty of the ancient Israelites, butarchaeological excavations in Israeland neighboring lands, as well as thediscovery of ancient writings inHebrew and related languages, haveadded greatly to our knowledge oflife as it was lived in biblical times.The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light onIsraelite culture. Of particular inter-est is the early development ofIsraelite monotheism, which, intime, emerged as ancient Judaism,the mother religion of Christianityand Islam.World Cultures: Latin America V55.0515 4 points. Explores the cultural, social, andpolitical organization of indigenouspeople before the period of Europeancolonization. Studies the dynamics ofthe colonial encounter, focusing onsuch themes as indigenous responsesto European rule, the formation of\"Indian\" society, and the interactionof Europeans, Africans, and indige-nous people. Considers postcolonialLatin America, focusing on themessuch as political culture, competingideologies of economics and socialdevelopment, and the construction ofcollective identities based on region,race, ethnicity, gender, and class.Readings consist mostly of primarysources and allow students to heardiverse voices within Latin Americansociety. Works by European con-querors, Inca and Aztec descendantsin the colonial period, and Africanand creole slaves are studied. Coursematerials also include novels, shortstories, films, photographs, andmusic. World Cultures: India V55.0516 4 points. Considers the paradoxes of modernIndia: ancient religious ideas coexist-ing with material progress, hierarchi-cal caste society with parliamentarydemocracy, India's cultural valueswith social-scientific perspectives ontheir contemporary relevance. Examines problems such as protec-tive discrimination for lower castesand cultural nationalism and showshow democracy involves difficultchoices among competing, oftenopposed, ancient and modern cultural values. World Cultures: Native Peoples of North AmericaV55.0519 4 points. Since well before contact with Euro-peans, native peoples living in theUnited States and Canada have spoken many different languages,practiced many varied lifeways, andorganized their societies distinctively.To convey a sense of the range and diversity of contemporary NativeAmerican life and to understand theimpact of colonial and postcolonialhistories on current affairs, conceptsand images developed in a variety ofacademic disciplines as well as inpopular culture are discussed andexamined critically. Anthropological,122 FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURElinguistic, sociological, historical, and literary works and studies ofsocieties in three geographic areas(the Northwest, the Southwest, andthe Northeast) are used to exploreparticular problems confronting ana-lysts and native peoples alike. Topicsinclude how we understand socialand cultural diversity and complexi-ty, differing systems of value andsocial inequality, language use, usesof documentary and oral histories,the impact of urban and rural life-ways, museums, federal acknowledg-ment or recognition of tribal status,and repatriation (the return of bonesand objects of cultural importance tonative peoples). World Cultures: Muslim Europe V55.0520 4 points. From the early eighth century C.E. onward, Islamic civilization, whichembraced both sides of the Mediter-ranean, made far-reaching and criti-cal contributions to the course ofWestern development. The past and present of Muslims within theboundaries of present-day Europe areexamined beginning with the foun-dation of the oldest Islamic societiesof the West, with particular empha-sis on the art and science of Al-Andalus (medieval Spain) and on theearly modern government and socialstructure of the Ottoman Balkans.Through history, literature, and thevisual arts, we then consider thediversity of the modern Muslimexperience in Europe, from Russia toEngland, and address the dilemmasof self-definition and survival thatconfront citizen and immigrant alikeas minorities within predominantlyChristian nation-states. World Cultures: Islam in Asia V55.0523 4 points. Two-thirds of the world's Muslims today live in Central, South, andSoutheast Asia. How did Islamic tra-ditions spread from the Middle East?What has been the nature of theensuing dialogue between Muslimsand adherents of existing traditions(Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucian-ism, Christianity, shamanism)? Top-ics include the nature of dialogueand conflict between the adherents ofIslam and those of other religioustraditions, the economic and socialissues behind conflicts waged in thename of religion, the different andconstantly evolving \"Islams\" that thrive in Asia, and the politics of Islam today, from Afghanistan east-ward to the Philippines. World Cultures: New Guinea V55.0524 4 points. How has the outside world imagined,toured, colonized, and portrayed theisland of New Guinea? Conversely,how internalizing and contestingexternal depictions and domination?We study the contrasting ways out- siders and New Guineans have nar-rated these overlapping experiencesand histories. The topic is approachedthrough specific dramas, events, andprocesses (for example, first contactand colonialism, missionization, theSecond World War, and indepen-dence). Course materials include different media and modes of repre-sentation. Students view historicaland contemporary films by and aboutNew Guineans, listen to recordingsand radio programs, and read writ-ings by indigenous and non-NewGuinean authors. World Cultures: Muslim Spain V55.0527 4 points. Considers one example of the long-term establishment of a Muslim poli-ty in Europe. Traces the politicalflow of events from the Arab-Berberconquest of the peninsula and theirexperiments in state-formation to theemergence of Christian rivals in thenorthern kingdoms and the reversalof the tide until the final submissionof the surviving Muslim enclave ofGranada in 1492. Of chief concern isthe construction of a remarkablesocial and intellectual culture out ofthe various indigenous and importedelements; how the three indigestibleingredients called Islam, Christianity,and Judaism fared in that meltingpot the Spaniards called convivencia, particularly when one of the otherswas stirring; and the problems posedby the notion of \"Muslim Spain\" forSpanish historians and for Westernersgenerally. World Cultures: Russia Since 1917 V55.0528 4 points. Major periods, developments, andinterpretative issues in Russian poli-tics, history, and society, from the1917 revolution to the present.Emphasis is on the Soviet experience,though the czarist past and post-Soviet developments are also consid-ered. Special attention is given to therole of historical traditions, leader- ship, ideology, ramifying events, andsocioeconomic factors. World Cultures: Contemporary Latino CulturesV55.0529 4 points. Examines the growth and develop-ment of \"Latino\" as a distinct catego-ry of identity out of the highlydiverse populations of Latin Ameri-can background in the United States,paying particular attention to thesocial processes shaping its emer-gence. Provides a detailed examina-tion of the processes of cultural cre-ation behind the rising growth oftransnational cultures and identitiesworldwide, and of the forces that arefueling their development. Begins byexploring the immigration of LatinAmerican peoples to U.S. cities, thenturns to three case studies of emerg-ing Latino communities, and ends byexamining contemporary issuesinvolving Latinos in urban centerssuch as New York. SOCIETIES AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES Note that the prerequisite for all Societies and the Social Sciencescourses is completion of V55.04xxand V55.05xx and completion of orexemption from V40.0100 orV40.0009. Societies and the Social Sciences: Topics in Interdisciplinary PerspectiveV55.0600 4 points. Examines social phenomena thatcross the boundaries among the various social-scientific disciplines.Topics vary each term and may include, for example, human migra-tion, religion, fascism, or colonialism.By considering the methodologiesappropriate to the study of these top-ics, students learn to appreciate thecharacteristic approaches of the socialsciences, their power to help usunderstand such phenomena, andtheir limitations. Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives onGender and PowerV55.0607 4 points. How does gender structure our socialworlds? How do gender systems, assystems of power, shape the lives ofwomen and men cross-culturally?How do different social theories andanalytical frameworks allow us toFOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTURE 123think more clearly about these ques- tions? The course analyzes gendersystems in diverse societies (Africa;South, East, and Southeast Asia;Eastern and Western Europe; and theMiddle East) and considers theeffects that historical and contempo-rary interconnections among societieshave had on gender systems andwomen's lives. Topics include theo-ries of women's status; forms ofanalysis; comparative revolution(China, France, Iran); rights, needs,and citizenship; the politics of repro-duction; women's work in the globaleconomy. Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives onCapitalismV55.0615 4 points. What is capitalism? By the end ofthe 20th century it seemed to haveconquered the world. Countrieseverywhere are turning to the idea ofthe free market and are being pulledor pushed in the global economy ofcapitalism. Despite capitalism's suc-cess, social scientists have neveragreed about what it is or how itworks. We examine some of the dif-ferent ways in which social scientistsover the last two hundred years havetried to tell the story of how capital-ism works and also explores some thedifferent kinds of capitalism thatexist today and the different ways inwhich social scientists understandthem. Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives onthe Language of America's EthnicMinoritiesV55.0616 4 points. Examines the role of language incommunities in the United States,specifically within African American,Asian American, Latino, and NativeAmerican populations. Explores therelationship of language to culture,race, and ethnicity. In particular,looks for similarities and differencesacross these communities and consid-ers the role that language experiencesplay in current models of race andethnicity. Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives onMetropolitan StudiesV55.0631 4 points. Considers the major approaches thathave been deployed to investigatethe urban experience in the modernworld and explores the historicalgeography of capitalist urbanization with particular attention to NorthAmerican and Western Europeancities, to colonial and postcolonialcities, and to the global contexts ofurban development. Major topicsinclude urban and regional planning,urban politics and governance, suburbanization and regional devel-opment, gentrification and urbansocial movements, the gendering andradicalization of urban space, racialsegregation, and urban design andarchitecture. Society and the Social Sciences: Anthropological PerspectivesV55.0640 4 points. Anthropology concerns the ways inwhich people live in society, especial-ly as mediated through culturalprocesses. Deeply concerned withnon-Western as well as Western waysof life and the relations betweenthem, anthropology addresses theproblem of differences and similari-ties within and between human pop-ulations, including the use of differ-ences to establish or resist powerwithin social formations. Anthropol-ogy views such differences not sim-ply as situations of the past but asconstantly being produced in newglobal formations of power and com-merce. Students explore how anthro-pologists use data to develop basicpremises about the nature of humansocieties and the foundations of dis-tinctive regimes of sociality, and theyexamine theories of social life in theterms of a commitment to graspingthe perspectives, knowledge, andlived experience of social actorsthrough the methodology of ethno-graphic fieldwork. Societies and the Social Sciences: Economic PerspectivesV55.0650 4 points. Economics explores the ways thatindividuals in society assign value,act to optimize the gain of what theyconsider valuable, and seek to limitthe risk of losing those valuables. Tounderstand how people make thesedecisions, economists model the waysthat individuals take account ofuncertain circumstances, the limitsof their own knowledge, and theinefficiency of social institutions inwhich they participate. Topics of thiscourse may include decision theory,markets, and the historical develop-ment of economic analysis. With thisperspective, students go on to con-sider social issues such as votingbehavior or fiscal and trade policy. Consideration is also given to cri-tiques of economics methods and todiscussion of other social-scientificapproaches. Societies and the Social Sciences: Linguistic PerspectivesV55.0660 4 points. Examines language from a dual per-spective: as part of mankind's biolog-ical endowment and as a social phe-nomenon. Considers the structure,universality, and diversity of humanlanguage. Introduces the core areas ofgrammar: its sound system, thestructures of words and sentences,and meanings. Examines the repre-sentation of language in the brain,first language acquisition, and pro-cessing. Introduces linguistic univer-sals, dialect, sociolects, and themechanism of linguistic change. Societies and the Social Sciences: Political PerspectivesV55.0670 4 points. The study of politics uses social sci-ence methods to understand theinstitutions that societies constructto address their problems and needs.Topics of this course may include interstate war, ethnic conflict, envi-ronmental degradation, democratictransition, poverty, globalization, orgovernment gridlock. Students ana-lyze the institutional strategies thathave been devised to deal with theseissues and examine related theoreti-cal concerns with concrete implica-tions for reform. For instance: Whatis the best way to foster internationalcooperation in an area where little ornone exists? How can formerly non-democratic states successfully make atransition to democracy? Howimportant is an independent judicia-ry, and how can it be established?What, if anything, can be done toensure genuine competition betweenpolitical parties, and on what does itdepend? Also considered are impor-tant questions of social sciencemethod such as the role of theoreticalmodels in explanation, the status ofinferences made from small samples,and the widespread problem of selec-tion bias in nonexperimental data. Societies and the Social Sciences: Psychological PerspectivesV55.0680 4 points. Why do people do what they do,think what they think, feel whatthey feel? Psychology is the scientificstudy of the mind and of the indi-124 FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CULTUREvidual's behavior. It assumes that mental and behavioral events\u2014nor-mal and abnormal\u2014have biological,psychological, and social or culturalcauses. Studying these causes, howthey operate, and what their conse-quences are yields greater under-standing of oneself, other people, andour society; it may also have implica-tions for social policy and for how welead our lives. Analyzing data fromobservations, surveys, and experi-ments, students consider the currentstate of psychological knowledge,how it is obtained, and its limitations. Societies and the Social Sciences: Sociological PerspectivesV55.0690 4 points. How can we understand the uniquelysocial or collective aspects of humanlives? Sociology begins with therecognition that the lives of individ-uals are profoundly shaped by socialgroups and institutions. It maintainsthat these groups and institutionshave a reality of their own, whichcannot be understood simply as theproduct of individual actions, beliefs,and desires; and that they shape indi-viduals as much as, or even morethan, individuals shape society. Stu-dents consider the relationshipbetween individuals, groups, andinstitutions in particular contexts,examining topics such as socialprotest, law and criminality, socialpolicy, the economic organization ofsociety, the arts, and contemporaryconflicts over religion, race, class,and gender. They explore how vari-ous social-scientific theories andmethods illuminate such issues andhow these insights may help us toaddress important social problems. EXPRESSIVE CULTURE Note that the prerequisite for allExpressive Culture courses is comple-tion of V55.04xx and V55.05xx andcompletion or exemption fromV40.0100 or V40.0009. Expressive Culture: Words V55.0710 4 points. What is literature or the literary? Isthere a literary language that worksdifferently from ordinary language?What is literary style and form?What is the position of the writer orartist in relation to society, and whatis the function of the reader? Is liter-ature a mirror of the world that itdescribes, an attempt to influence areader's ideas or opinions, an expres- sion of the identity of the writer, ornone of these? Expressive Culture: Images V55.0720 4 points. What is the place of art in an image-saturated world? We begin by con-sidering the power and taboo ofimages and the ways in which indi-viduals and institutions that consti-tute \"the art world\" classify some ofthese images as works of art; turn toexplore the visual and conceptualchallenges presented by major worksof sculpture, architecture, and paint-ing; and conclude with a selection ofproblems raised by art today. Stu-dents develop the vocabulary to bothappreciate and question the artistic\"gestures\" of society in various placesand times. Expressive Culture: Images\u2014 Painting and Sculpture in NewYork Field Study V55.0721 4 points. New York's public art collectionscontain important examples of paint-ing and sculpture from almost everyphase of the past, as well as some ofthe world's foremost works of con-temporary art. Meeting once a weekfor an extended period, the coursecombines on-campus lectures withgroup excursions to the museums orother locations where these works areexhibited. Expressive Culture: Images\u2014 Architecture in New York FieldStudyV55.0722 4 points. New York's rich architectural her-itage offers a unique opportunity forfirsthand consideration of the con-cepts and styles of modern urbanarchitecture, as well as its social,financial, and cultural contexts.Meeting once a week for an extendedperiod, the course combines on-cam-pus lectures with group excursions toprominent buildings. Considerationis given both to individual buildingsas examples of 19th- and 20th-centu-ry architecture, as well as to phenom-ena such as the development of theskyscraper and the adaptation ofolder buildings to new uses. Expressive Culture: Sounds V55.0730 4 points. Our lives pulsate with patterns ofsounds that we call music. Weencounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons; theyaccompany us to the grocery store,the dentist's office, and the movies.Yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a series ofspecific case studies we investigatethe function and significance of musicand the musician in human life. Weraise basic questions about how musichas been created, produced, per-ceived, and evaluated at diverse his-torical moments, in a variety of geo-graphical locations, and among differ-ent cultural groups. Through auralexplorations and discussion of howthese vivid worlds \"sound\" in timeand space, we assess the value ofmusic in human experience. Expressive Culture: Performance V55.0740 4 points. Examines \"performance\" both as apractice and as a theoretical tool withwhich to understand today's world.The broad spectrum of live perfor-mance is explored by means of lec-tures, discussions, and field trips.Students look at theatre and dance,performance in everyday life, rituals,popular entertainments, and intercul-tural performance. performances,such as Native American powwow,Indian Hindu ritual drama, off-Broadway theatre and dance,African-American gospel, street per-formers, and courtroom trials. Expressive Culture: Film V55.0750 4 points. Film is a medium that combines anumber of arts. It lies at the intersec-tion of art and technology and of artand mass culture, and at the bound-aries of the national and the global.Film is also a medium that coincideswith and contributes to the inven-tion of modern life. By exploring theexpressive and representationalachievements of cinema in the con-text of modernity and mass culture,students learn the concepts to graspthe different ways in which films cre-ate meaning, achieve their emotionalimpact, and respond in complexways to the historical contexts inwhich they are made.FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY 125Science and technology play such a central role in the modern world that even individ- uals not directly engaged in scientific or technical pursuits need to have solid skills inquantitative and analytical reasoning and a clear understanding of scientific investiga- tion. Even more than their forebears, citizens of the 21st century will need competence andconfidence in dealing with the approaches and findings of science if they are to makeinformed decisions on vital political, economic, and social issues. Rather than striving for encyclopedic coverage of facts, Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) courses stress the process of scientific reasoning and seek to illustrate the role ofscience and mathematics in our understanding of the natural world. The objectives of the FSIsequence are to give students who will not be science majors a positive experience in scien-tific inquiry and to encourage learning about how science is done. The quantitative compo-nent of these courses emphasizes the critical role of mathematics in the analysis of naturalphenomena. The courses within the FSI are collected into three groups\u2014Quantitative Rea-soning, Natural Science I, and Natural Science II. All lectures are taught by regular faculty,including some of the University's most distinguished professors, and each course includesworkshops or related laboratory sections led by graduate student preceptors.Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (55) 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6687.

NATURAL SCIENCE I Note that the prerequisite for allNatural Science I courses is comple-tion of or exemption fromV55.01XX. Natural Science I: The Cosmos and the EarthV55.0202 4 points. Focuses on the modern scientificfindings relating to major questionsabout the universe and our place init. What is the origin of the uni-verse? How did the elements form?Where do stars and planets comefrom? How did life on Earth origi-nate? How did intelligence developand human beings come to exist?And, are we alone in the cosmos?Evidence for the big bang theory ofthe creation of the universe and theformation of elements during stellarevolution is presented, along withhow that evidence is extracted fromthe analysis of light coming from thestars. The constituents of the uni-verse, from the large-scale realm ofthe galaxies to exotic objects such asneutron stars and black holes, arediscussed. The course then focuses onthe earth and other earthlike planets;outlines the evolution of life andintelligence in the context of thesometimes catastrophic geologic his-tory of our planet; and ends with adiscussion of the possibilities forintelligent life in the cosmos. Labora-tory projects include studies of thenature of light and the observedspectra of starlight; the evidence foran expanding universe; experimentalstudies of impact cratering on plane-tary the impacthazard; the geologic evidence forcontinental drift; and the catastrophiccauses of mass extinctions life.2. one of fol- lowing College ChemistryI (V25.0101) and lab Physics I (V85.0011); andPhysics I (V85.0091) and lab(V85.0092).NATURAL SCIENCE II (V55.03XX) 1.

Topics include theatmosphere, ozone and its depletion,greenhouse gases, and acid rain. Casestudies from the New York Cityenvironment, such as the HudsonRiver, are used to focus discussions.Finally, the basis of our need forenergy, fossil fuels and their supplies,and the available alternatives are dis-cussed. Natural Science I: Einstein's UniverseV55.0204 4 points. Addresses the science and life of Ein-stein in the context of 20th-centuryphysics, beginning with 19th-centu-ry ideas about light, space, and timein order to understand why Ein-stein's work was so innovative. Ein-stein's most influential ideas are con-tained in his theories of special rela-tivity, which reformulated concep-tions of space and time, and generalrelativity, which extended these ideasto gravitation. Both these theoriesare quantitatively explored, togetherwith wide-ranging applications ofthese ideas, from the nuclear energythat powers the sun to black holesand the big bang theory of the birthof the universe. Natural Science I: Exploration of Light and ColorV55.0205 4 points. Color science is an interdisciplinaryendeavor that incorporates both thephysics and perception of light andcolor. This course is an introductionto color and the related topics oflight and optics, including theirapplications to photography, art, nat-ural phenomena, and technology. Sci-ence has provided a rich understand-ing of visual effects that has dramati-cally enriched our appreciation ofwhat we see. Topics include howcolor is described and measured (col-orimetry); how light is produced;how atoms and molecules affectlight; how the human retina detectslight; and how lenses are used incameras, telescopes, and microscopes.Our investigation necessarily toucheson aspects such as the anatomy of theeye and aspects of human vision thatinfluence how we see color. Laboratory projects include additive and subtractive color mixing, pinholephotography, cow eye dissection, col-orimetric measurements, and colorclassification schemes. Natural Science I: From Plato to Pluto\u2014Scientists View the SolarSystemV55.0206 4 points. The first half deals with the basicphenomena of astronomy: the earthand sky, the motions of stars, sun,moon, and planets. It then considersthe historical development of astron-omy from antiquity to the 17th cen-tury. The last quarter is devoted tothe space-age exploration of the solarsystem. Laboratory exercises helpfamiliarize students with basic astro-nomical concepts. Natural Science I: Systems of the Human BodyV55.0207 4 points. Aims to develop the sciences neces-sary for understanding the variousinterrelated systems operating withinthe human body. The skeletal-musclesystem converts muscle contractioninto human motion (the science ofbiomechanics is relevant here). Thecardiovascular system transportsblood throughout the body, carryingoxygen to the site of muscle contrac-tions and removing carbon dioxideand heat (fluid dynamics). The con-sumed oxygen is converted into workand heat, and the rate of consump-tion varies with speed in walking,running, etc. (thermodynamics). Thenervous system transports electricalsignals from the sensory perceptorsto the brain and from there to themuscles; these signals determinehuman reaction time, coordination,and optimal strategies for humanperformance (electrodynamics andoptimal control theory). All of thesesystems, working together, makepossible human motion and thought. NATURAL SCIENCE II Note that the prerequisite for allNatural Science II courses is comple-tion of or exemption fromV55.01XX and V55.02XX. Natural Science II: Human GeneticsV55.0303 4 points. We are currently witnessing a revo- lution in human genetics, where theability to scrutinize and manipulate DNA has allowed scientists to gainunprecedented insights into the roleof heredity. This course explores thefoundations and frontiers of modernhuman genetics, with an emphasison understanding and critically eval-uating new discoveries in this rapid-ly evolving field of research. The syl-labus begins with an overview of theprinciples of inheritance, where sim-ple Mendelian genetics is contrastedwith the interactions of genes andenvironment that influence complexphysical or behavioral traits. In thiscontext, we develop the statisticaltechniques used to quantify geneticinheritance or establish a linkagebetween genes and characteristics.Descending to the molecular level,the course investigates how geneticinformation is encoded in DNA andexamines the science and socialimpact of genetic technology, includ-ing topics such as cloning, genetictesting, and the human genome pro-ject. The course concludes by study-ing how genes vary in populationsand how geneticists are contributingto our understanding of human evo-lution and diversity. The laboratoryprojects throughout the semesterintroduce students to the methodolo-gy of genetic research, ranging fromdiagnosing inherited traits in fami-lies to hands-on explorations of thetechniques of genetic engineering. Natural Science II: Human OriginsV55.0305 4 points. The study of \"human origins\" is aninterdisciplinary endeavor thatinvolves a synthesis of research froma number of different areas of sci-ence. The aim of this course is tointroduce students to the variousapproaches and methods used by sci-entists to investigate the origins andevolutionary history of our ownspecies. Topics include reconstruct-ing of stableisotopes to reconstruct dietary behav-ior in prehistoric humans; solving a2,000-year-old murder mystery; theimportance of chimpanzeesfor understanding human behavior;and the four-million-year-old fossilevidence for human evolution. 128 FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRYNatural Science II: Brain and BehaviorV55.0306 4 points. This course covers current andimportant topics in neuroscience.Why do so many people drink alco-hol and take drugs? What doesProzac do to the brain? Is the braincloser to a computer or a plant? Stu-dents gain an understanding of therole of the brain and the nervous sys-tem in such areas as learning, percep-tion, drug addiction, depression,stress, and Alzheimer's and Parkin-son's diseases. Laboratory topicsexplore brain anatomy, basic neuralprocesses, sensory systems, receptorfunction, and behavior throughhands-on experiments and computerdemonstrations. Handling of animalsand animal brain tissue is required insome labs. Natural Science II: The Molecules of LifeV55.0310 4 points. Our lives are increasingly influencedby the availability of new pharma-ceuticals, ranging from drugs thatlower cholesterol to those that influ-ence behavior. This course examinesthe chemistry and biology of biomol-ecules that make up the molecularmachinery of the cell. Critical to thefunction of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional structure thatendows them with a specific func-tion. This information provides thescientific basis for understandingdrug action and how new drugs aredesigned. The course begins with theprinciples of chemical binding, mole-cular structure, and acid-base proper-ties that govern the structure andfunction of biomolecules. It thenapplies these principles to study thevarieties of protein architecture andhow enzymes facilitate biochemicalreactions. It concludes with anoverview of molecular genetics andhow recent information from the Human Genome Project is stim-ulating new approaches in diagnos-ing disease and designing drug treatments. Natural Science II: Lessons from the BiosphereV55.0311 4 points. Provides a foundation of knowledgeabout how Earth's biosphere works.This includes the biggest ideas andfindings about biology on the globalscale\u2014the scale in which we live.Such knowledge is especially crucialtoday because we humans are per-turbing so many systems within thebiosphere. The course has four mainsections: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today?(2) Life's Diversity: What is life liketoday on the global scale? (3) Cyclesof Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) TheHuman Guild: How are humanschanging the biosphere, and howmight we consider our future withinthe biosphere? The course includeslaboratory experiments and an explo-ration at the American Museum ofNatural History. Natural Science II: Earth, Life, and TimeV55.0312 4 points. Over the last four billion years, lifeon Earth has evolved in response tochanges in the environment. At thesame time, major innovations in thehistory of life have led to transforma-tions of the Earth's physical environ-ment. The course examines the histo-ry of the intimate relationshipbetween the Earth's changing envi-ronment and the evolution of life onthe planet. This long-term historicalperspective provides a context forunderstanding current environmentalissues such as global warming, tropical deforestation, and loss ofbiodiversity.

ACCELERATED B.A./M.A. PROGRAM IN FRENCHSTUDIES The Department of French and the Institute of French Studies offerqualified students the opportunity toearn the B.A. and M.A. degrees in ashortened period of study. While stillundergraduates, students enrolled inthe program may earn up to 8 pointstoward the M.A. by completing twograduate courses in the Departmentof French or at the Institute ofFrench Studies. In order to earnadvanced standing, these points maynot be counted toward an undergrad-uate degree but must be in excess ofthe 128 points required for the B.A. Under normal circumstances, this can be achieved by students who reg-ister for the maximum allowablenumber of points in their senior year.Earned in this manner, advanced standing has the additional advan-tage of enabling qualified students tostart graduate work not only at anearlier stage but also in the mostcost-efficient way. Students majoring in French lan- guage and literature (program 1) mayapply credits thus earned toward theM.A. in French literature, which canbe completed in the Department ofFrench. Students majoring in Frenchlanguage, society, and culture (pro-gram 2) may apply the credits eithertoward the M.A. in French languageand civilization offered by the depart-ment or toward the M.A. in Frenchcivilization to be completed at theInstitute of French Studies. Studentswho plan to enroll at the latter areexpected to earn advanced standingby selecting from among several corecourses taught at the institute. Admission to the program is open to students who have complet-ed 90 points with a grade point aver-age of at least 3.3 and with a cumu-lative grade point average in themajor of 3.5 or higher. Applicationto the program can be made throughthe director of undergraduate studiesin French, 19 University Place, 6thfloor. Final acceptance into the grad-uate sequence of the program is con-tingent on successful completion ofthe B.A., formal admission into theGraduate School of Arts and Science,and approval by the director of grad-uate studies or, in the case of stu- dents seeking the M.A. in Frenchcivilization, the director of the Insti-tute of French Studies. FACILITIES The University has two special facili- ties for students of French.

These seminars aim to introduce students, at the beginning of their college careers, to demanding and challenging standards of analysis and argumentation, oral as well as writ-ten. They do so by means of intensive discussion, papers on focused topics, and reading thatemphasizes critical interpretation rather than absorption of information. Except wherenoted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student's part.Enrollment is usually limited to 16 students. As a rule, the seminars are given only in the fall semester. The array of seminars changes from year to year. A brochure describing all the fall offerings and their instructorsappears in late spring. Below is a sampling of Freshman Honors Seminars that have beentaught more than once in recent years.PROGRAM IN Freshman Honors Seminars (50) 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 908, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688.

The human brain, one of the mostfascinating and challenging frontiersin modern science, contains hundredsof individual chemical systems thatform interacting networks adaptedfor the survival of the organism andthe species. This course focuses onthe cells that release a small amino-acid derivative called serotonin. Sero-tonin has been implicated in a vastarray of functions, ranging fromaggression, sexual behavior, sleeping,and learning to regulation of hor-mone release, and neu-rotrophic secretion. neurons. In humans,serotonin dysfunction is associatedwith such mental disorders as bulim-ia, depression, autism, Down's syn-drome, and Alzheimer's disease. Thecourse prior my, neurology, and psychiatry. Read-ings and discussions are comple-mented by laboratory visits, demon-strations, and films. Exploring Reader Theory V50.0204 Maynard. 4 points. This seminar seeks to develop stu-dents' awareness of the range of criti-cal theories and critical approachesthat pay special attention to the roleof the reader, a universal critical issuemost recently given the label of read-er response theory and criticism witha cognate development in receptiontheory. The seminar seeks not toinculcate one discourse of reader-ori-ented criticism or one practicalapproach to assessing the role of thereader in interpretation. Rather, thestudent is encouraged to read widelyin the theoretical literature andapplied criticism in order to deter-mine to what extent this range ofcritical focus can be useful in devel-oping his or her critical stance. Topicsconsidered include the following:Where is meaning? In the text? Inthe reader? In both together? What do we mean author's intention andhow does it/would it work? What arethe (many) ways in which we canrespond to the text? How is receptionof texts reshaped by changing readersand cultural history? Students areencouraged to experiment with appli-cations of theoretical ideas to theirown interpretations of works of liter-ature and to reflect critically on whatthey have done. No prior work intheory is required or expected. New York City Baseball in the 20th CenturyV50.0206 Prince. 4 points. Baseball is neither a metaphor for lifenor a perfect explanation for theuniqueness of American culture orAmerican character. But sport\u2014and,for some cogent reasons, baseball inparticular\u2014does provide a way intoan examination of major contempo-rary historical questions in the areasof race, gender, and class. The Brook-lyn Dodgers' pioneering role inAmerican racial integration in theyears after World War II, for exam-138 FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARSple, and the Yankees' early failure to follow suit provide useful laborato-ries for a study of race. The stronglymacho character of baseball revealsbasic gender aspirations and preju-dices more subtly evoked in otherareas of American life. To the extentthat baseball is indeed a working-class game, fan involvement revealsmuch about the nature of urban classvalues and tensions in the 20th cen-tury. A full-length baseball-relatedresearch paper is required. Computer Simulation V50.0207 Peskin. 4 points. This is a hands-on course in whichstudents learn how to program com-puters to simulate physical and bio-logical processes. The course meetsalternately in a classroom and in acomputer laboratory setting. Thetechniques needed to perform suchsimulations are taught in class andthen applied in the laboratory by thestudents themselves, who work indi-vidually or in teams on computingprojects and report on these projectsto the group as a whole. Studentslearn how to make the computergenerate graphics, movies, andsounds, as needed for presentation ofthe results of the different simula-tions. Examples to be emphasized inclass include the orbits of planets,moons, comets, and spacecraft; thespread of diseases in a population;the production of sound by musicalinstruments; and the electrical activi-ty of nerves.

The course explores the possibilitythat a common ground existsbetween the so-called two cultures ofscience and the humanities. It positsthe hypothesis of a correlationbetween postclassical science (e.g.,quantum theory) and and examined areHeisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\"and the \"undecidability\" of decon-structive theory. The discussion ofthese notions, and their implicationsin literary works, revolves aroundtheir effect on classical logic, the ref-erential function of language, and thetraditional goal of a complete expla-nation/description of reality. Read-ings include selections from theworks of Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon and from nontechnicaltexts on quantum and chaos theories. The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion andState in AmericaV50.0218 Sexton. 4 points. Should members of the Native Amer-ican Church be allowed to smokepeyote at religious ceremonies? Can apublic high school invite a rabbi togive a benediction and convocation atgraduation? Should a state legislatorrely on his or her religious convic-tions in forming a view about thelegality of capital punishment orabortion? The course divides thesequestions into three subject areas:religious liberty; separation of churchand state; and the role of religion inpublic and political life. It focuses onhow the Supreme Court has dealtwith these areas and, more important,invites students to construct a newvision of the proper relationshipamong religion, state, and society in a20th-century liberal constitutionaldemocracy. East and West: Intercultural Readings in Philosophy and LiteratureV50.0228 Roberts. 4 points. This seminar concentrates on fiveAsian classics ( The Analects of Confu- cius, The Tao Te Ching of Lao-tzu, Tale of Kieu, Dream of the Red Chamber, and Tale of Genji ) and five Western classics (the Book of Job, Oedipus, Oedipus at Colonus, Antigone, and King Lear). Students are encouraged to explore the analogies of theme andcharacter to be found in the worksand to consider how differences ofhistorical and cultural context affectthe interpretation of the individualtexts.

Family Values, Past and Present V50.0231 Gordon. 4 points. During several periods in Americanhistory, \"family values\" have beenmuch discussed and disputed. Theyears between 1970 and the presentform one such period. Family-relatedcontroversies\u2014such as gay marriage,divorce, permissive child-raising,abortion, single motherhood\u2014occu-py a prominent place in politicaldebate today. This seminar arisesfrom the conviction that a historical approach can raise the level of thesedebates, while family history pro-vides a useful introduction to the\"new social history,\" which has sig-nificantly changed how history isbeing written today. The seminarexamines general changes in Ameri-can families over the last two cen-turies, considers racial/ethnic andclass variety in family structure andbehavior, looks in more detail at par-ticular aspects of family life, includ-ing childhood, aging, marriage, andreproduction, and concludes byrethinking contemporary polemicsfrom a historical perspective.

Congress passes a law to purgeindecency from on-line communica-tions. A tobacco company sues amajor television network for libel.Press disclosures threaten the fair-trial rights of defendants in theOklahoma City bombing trial.Although the First Amendmentappears on its face to prohibit anygovernmental restrictions on speech,the Supreme Court in fact balancesfree and open expression againstother vital interests of society. Thiscourse begins by examining thestruggle against seditious libel (thecrime of criticizing government orits officials) that was not won in thiscountry until the landmark decisionin New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. Students examine freedom ofspeech through the prism of a richvariety of contemporary conflicts,including political dissent that advo-cates overthrow of the government;prior restraints against publication;obscenity and pornography; flagburning; the new law that bans inde-cency from on-line services; hatespeech; and inflictions of emotionaldistress. Students read and analyzeimportant decisions of the U.S.Supreme Court. The Special Theory of Relativity V50.0241 Sokal. 4 points.

Was Einstein'sspecial theory of relativity really aradical break with the past? Or wasFRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS 139 it an essentially conservative updat- ing of ideas going back to Galileo?This course begins by analyzing theconcepts of space, time, and motionproposed by Aristotle, Galileo, andNewton, as well as the challenge toNewtonian ideas posed by Maxwell'selectrodynamics. The heart of thecourse works through, step by step,the thought-experiments that ledEinstein to his special theory of rela-tivity. Finally, it works through acase study in which special relativityis applied: five original articles fromthe early era of elementary-particlephysics (1947-1956), which trace thephenomenon of \"V-particles\" from itsfirst subse-quent experimental elucidation to apartial theoretical understanding(still incomplete today).Realism and How to Get Rid of It V50.0244 Bishop. 4 points. Realism relates both to a permanentconcern of literature and art and to a\"school\" that became the dominantmode of 19th-century artistic expres-sion.

Attention is con-centrated on form and language, onconventions, and on the relationshipof the work to the reader or specta-tor. Film viewings concentrate onnonnarrative cinema (Renais, Anto-nioni). The work of realist and non-realist painters is also discussed.140 GENDER AND SEXUALITY STUDIESThe Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies offers a broad interdisciplinary inves- tigation of gender and sexuality as keys to understanding human experience. At itscore, the program encourages students to question the meanings of \"male\" and \"female,\" Western and non-Western societies. Courses seek to unravel the ways ideas about gen-der and sexuality come into being and shape social roles and identities, as well as the waysin which race, class, and ethnicity function in the experience of gender and sexuality with-in a culture. The Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies challenges the privileging ofsome categories (e.g., male or heterosexual) over others, and analyzes the social and politicalimplications of such hierarchies. The curriculum makes gender and sexuality central ratherthan peripheral terms of analysis and seeks to complicate what is presented as \"natural\" or\"normal\" in traditional academic curricula.PROGRAM IN Gender and Sexuality Studies (97) CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF GENDER AND SEXUALITY , 285 MERCER STREET, 3RD FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6653.

Themajor requires 32 points in genderand sexuality studies (across at least three disciplines that are not the disci-pline of the student's departmentalconcentration) and 16 points in thestudent's departmental concentration.Because 8 of these points may overlap(V97.0021, for instance, may counttoward both the gender and sexualitystudies major and a concentration insociology), some students will com-plete the major with 40 points. All majors must complete at least one of the two introductory-levelcourses, Introduction to Gender and Sexuality Studies (V97.0010) orStudying Gender, Studying Sexuality(V97.0011), and Senior Seminar(V97.0999). Because of the interdis-ciplinary nature of scholarship in thesubject, remaining gender and sexu-ality studies electives must be drawnfrom at least three different depart-ments or areas. Individual programs must be approved by the director of under-graduate studies.GENDER AND SEXUALITY STUDIES 141MINOR A gender and sexuality studies minor requires 16 points (four courses)drawn from at least two differentdepartments or areas.

INDEPENDENT STUDY Independent StudyV56.0997 Prerequisite: Permission of the department. 2-4 points. HISTORY 161History is the study of human experience of all kinds, considered in relation to par- ticular times and places. It is also a method of thinking characterized by its atten-tion to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. By mastering this method of thinking, students of history gain invaluable skills and techniques. They learn toanalyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural, social, economic, andpolitical\u2014to organize it into a coherent whole and present it clearly with style in writtenor oral form. In doing so, students also learn to justify and to question their own and oth-ers' conclusions, for history is always an argument about what actually happened. Indeed,rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions is one of the most important\u2014andmost interesting\u2014tasks of the historian. Notable among the department's areas of scholarly strength are American urban, social, labor, and ethnic history; medieval, early modern, and modern European history;and American and European women's history. The sub-Saharan African, Latin American, andAsian areas are also strong and tend to be multidisciplinary. Through independent study andthe Honors Program, students find challenging opportunities for special concentration andindividual research. The internship program enables students to engage in special kinds ofsupervised historical projects for credit. Many of the projects are at cultural institutions inNew York and at the United Nations. The University's Elmer Holmes Bobst Library is rich in works of history, and stu- dents also may also use the collections of the New York Public Library, the historical soci-eties and museums in New York City, and neighboring universities.DEPARTMENT OF History (57) 53 WASHINGTON SQUARE SOUTH, 7TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10012-1098.

JOURNALISM AND MASS COMMUNICATION 185At New York University, we believe that journalism has a serious public mission and can make a difference. We want to educate those who agree. Opportunities aboundin the media world, but the opportunity to do compelling work that informs, engages\u2014and matters\u2014is what drives our faculty, motivates our students, and informs ourentire approach. Great journalism has always come from the great cities of the globe, andthere is no better place to learn the craft than the city of New York\u2014where power andwealth concentrate, news and culture originate, and daily events fascinate. Centrally located in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, the department immerses stu- dents in the richness and vitality of the city, while attracting to campus many of the lead-ers and thinkers in the journalism profession. New York City is our laboratory\u2014and ourinspiration. The very first lesson we offer students is this: Tap into it, with our help. NYUstudents study as interns in almost every major news organization in the city. They oftengraduate to jobs in newspapers, magazines, broadcast outlets, and on-line operations head-quartered in New York, though some choose to go elsewhere. And every day, students moveoutward from the classroom to the city, on assignments that take them all over town. The full-time faculty is itself of national stature in the journalism world. As writ- ers, reporters, producers, and critics, NYU professors continue to practice the journalismthey teach and preach, holding the profession to its highest standards of public service.Course work begins with the basic skills of reporting, writing, and research, but simulta-neously students are taught what journalism at its best can be\u2014and what it should accom-plish in a free and democratic society. They are also encouraged to publish their work, withassignments, internships, and on-line projects geared to this end. Housed within the arts and sciences core of a leading university, the department sees journalism as an essential strand in the liberal arts tradition and a critical factor in pub-lic culture. But we also recognize that news these days is a business. When our skilled grad-uates enter that business, they are prepared to improve and enliven it. Department facilities include four state-of-the-art newsrooms, modern broadcast production facilities, the Associated Press wire service, and desktop publishing.

It seeks to determine that which is nec- essary in human language, that which is possible, and that which is impossible.While linguists work to determine the unique qualities of individual languages, they are constantly searching for linguistic universals, for properties whose explanatory powerreaches across languages. The discipline of linguistics is organized around syntax (the prin-ciples by which sentences are organized), morphology (the principles by which words areconstructed), semantics (the study of meaning), phonetics (the study of speech sounds),phonology (the sound patterns of language), historical linguistics (the ways in which lan-guages change over time), sociolinguistics (the interaction of language with society), psy-cholinguistics, and neurolinguistics (the representation of language in the brain). Currentresearch by faculty members extends across the field: it includes topics in the interaction ofsyntax and semantics, phonetics and phonology, languages in contact, pidgin and creole lan-guages, urban sociolinguistics, and computer analogies of syntactic processes.DEPARTMENT OF Linguistics (61) 719 BROADWAY , 5TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6860.

CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Szabolcsi DIRECTOR OF UNDER-GRADUATE Associate Professor Affiliated Faculty in Other Departments: Aaronson (Psychology), Frysc\u00e1k(Russian and Slavic Studies), Grishman (Computer Science), Marcus (Psychology), McChesney(Middle Eastern Studies), McElree(Psychology), Momma (English),Sager (Computer Science), Schieffelin(Anthropology), Schiffer (Philosophy) Program MAJOR REQUIREMENTS The major consists of eight 4-pointcourses (32 points) in linguistics.These must include (1) LinguisticPerspectives, V55.0660, or Languageand Mind, (4) V61.0013; (5) (6) two courses freelychosen from the offerings of thedepartment, including those listed in(5). It is highly recommended thatmajors and joint majors take thecourses in (1), (2), and (4) first, since(3) and (5) have these as prerequisitesor generally presuppose their content. Note: No grade lower than C may be counted toward the major ortoward a joint major. All linguisticsmajors, joint majors and combined majors must register for linguisticscourses through the director ofundergraduate studies in the linguis-tics department. If any course fulfillsthe major or minor requirements inany other department or program atNYU, it may not be used simultane-ously to fulfill the requirements forthe linguistics majors. Joint majors: It is possible for a student to complete a joint major inlinguistics and in one of the foreignlanguages listed below. The linguis-194 LINGUISTICStics part of this major may be satis- fied by taking (1) V61.0001,V61.0028, or V55.0660, (2)V61.0011, (3) V61.0013, and (4) atotal of two courses, from anytwo of the following areas: historicallinguistics, sociolinguistics, phonolo-gy, syntax, semantics, and computa-tional linguistics.

The11th course will be one of the above-listed courses that has not alreadybeen chosen to satisfy the depart-mental components. Joint majors should consult with the respective directors of undergrad-uate studies of the departmentsinvolved. MINOR Four courses (16 points) in linguis-tics with a grade of C or better ineach. If any course fulfills the majoror minor requirements in any otherdepartment or program at NYU, it may not be used simultaneously tofulfill the requirements for the lin-guistics minor. RECOMMENDED WORK OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT To meet standards currently set in the linguistics field, as well as gradu-ate school admission requirements,students majoring in linguistics areadvised to gain competence in theareas listed below during theirundergraduate studies: 1.One or more foreign languages 2.Psychology for issues of lan- guage and the mind and anthropolo-gy for issues of language and culture 3.Mathematics or logic for an understanding of modern algebra andmathematical logic 4. Philosophy of language5. One or more computer languages Majors and minors should avail themselves of the NYU study abroadprograms. Any course substitution ortransfer credit toward a requiredcourse for the major must be con-firmed by a letter from the directorof undergraduate studies. HONORS PROGRAM A major or joint major who wishesto graduate with honors must havean average of 3.6 or better in all lin-guistics course work. Students wish-ing to participate in the honors pro-gram will work with the director ofundergraduate studies, beginning inthe student's junior year, to map anadvanced course of study, one thatwill culminate in an honors thesis.The course of study will entail extrawork in two or more relevant under-graduate linguistics courses or willinstead entail completion of at leasttwo relevant graduate courses withinthe department (or a combination ofthese two strategies). In the course ofdoing this additional work, the stu-dent will construct a thesis proposaland select an adviser with whom towork. The student will then com-plete the thesis while enrolled in anindependent study course with thethesis adviser, ordinarily in the stu-dent's final semester prior to gradua-tion.

Focus is onthe extent to which Caribbean peo-ple were given or demanded the free-dom to create and maintain a post-colonial Caribbean identity. We firstdiscuss the sociohistorical conditionsthat led to the creation of newCaribbean languages called \"pidgins\"and \"creoles\" as the English languagewas transplanted from Britain to theThird World. We then explore therelationship of the English-based cre-oles to the social, cultural, political,and literary/expressive aspects of thecontexts in which they existed, andin which they continue to exist todayin the Caribbean, as well as inBritain and the United States. As faras possible, parallels are drawn toFrench- and Spanish-influencedCaribbean communities. Grammatical Diversity V61.0027 Prerequisite: V61.0013 or permission of the instructor.

An introduction to study of theinternal structure of words. The twomain problems in morphology are(1) how to account for the surfacevariability of formatives (allomorphy)and (2) how to account for theircombinatorial properties (mor-phosyntax). Beginning from thetechniques and problems of analysis, approaches areintroduced: the the word-based model. Inmorphosyntax, we concentrate on thequestion to what extent morphologi-cal combination is a matter of syntaxvs. the lexicon. Emphasis is on con-structing morphological hypothesesand linguistic argumentation. Theassignments involve in-depth analy-ses of data from various languages. Language in Latin America V61.0030 Guy. 4 points. Examines the diversity of languageusage in modern Latin America andconsiders historical perspectives as tohow the present situation cameabout.

Considers Span-ish- and Portuguese-based creolesand the question of prior creolizationin the popular speech of Brazil,Cuba, and other areas with a sub-stantial population of African decent.Other topics include bilingualism,code switching, language attitudes,the impact of contact with English,and the present status of indigenouslanguages. Form, Meaning, and the Mind V61.0031 Prerequisites: V61.0004 or permission of the instructor, andV61.0013. Baltin. 4 points.This course deals with the relation-ship between cognitive organizationon the one hand and the interactionbetween syntax and semantics in nat-ural language. It focuses on thedebate within cognitive science as toLINGUISTICS 197whether or not the mind is modular (divided into distinct faculties, suchas language, vision, and perhaps oth-ers). Discusses the relationship ofthis debate to the debate within lin-guistics as to whether or not syntaxis an autonomous component of agrammar that feeds semantics, butdoes not depend on semantics itselffor its functioning. Examines worksin cognitive science about modulari-ty and works in linguistics that bearon the question of the autonomy ofsyntax.

It focuses on the history, institutions, lan-guages, literatures, thought, faith, art, and music of Europe and the Mediterranean world from the collapse of Roman authority to about 1600 C.E. It is during this importantperiod\u2014which shaped and transmitted the classical heritage\u2014that the social, artistic, intel-lectual, and scientific culture of present-day Europe and the Middle East was formed. The curriculum in medieval and Renaissance studies links undergraduates with NYU's outstanding humanities faculty, with the superb libraries, museums, and collectionsin the New York area, and with musical and theatrical performances of works from this peri-od that are given regularly in the city. It also enriches students' intellectual and artistic expe-rience in CAS Programs Abroad. Students design their own programs in consultation withthe program director and faculty: they thus experience the intimate guidance of a center ofexcellence within the parameters of a great university.PROGRAM IN Medieval and Renaissance Studies (65) THE MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE CENTER, 726 BROADWAY , ROOM 628, NEW YORK, NY 10003-9580.

It is specifically designedfor students wishing to work in morethan one field of specialization and todevelop majors around their owninterests rather than those of a depart-mental major. Individual advisementenables students to develop a coherent course of study that suits their needsand interests. The fields of specializa-tion from which students may drawto develop their programs currentlyinclude (1) language and literature:classics, comparative literature, Eng-lish, French, Italian, Middle Eastern(Arabic), Hebrew and andSpanish and (2) fine arts;(3) history; (4) music; and (5) philoso- phy and religion. Available to majors and minors is the Marco Polo Travel Award, whichis granted to an outstanding studenteach year to allow her or him to travelabroad for research. Majors in this program have gone on to graduate work in medievalstudies, Celtic studies, archival stud-206 MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIESies, religious studies, history, art his- tory, and English, as well as to pro-fessional schools. Other majors havegone on to careers in business and ineducation. MAJOR Ten courses in medieval and Renais- sance studies, of which at least fivemust be in a single field of concen-tration; four or, preferably, threecourses in one or more other fields ofconcentration; and one or, preferably,two courses in an interdisciplinaryseminar. In addition, students areexpected to show proficiency throughcourse work or examination in Latin(or another language central to theirarea, such as ancient Greek, Arabic,or Hebrew) and in one other lan-guage appropriate to the field of con-centration. MINOR Five courses, of which at least twomust be in a single field of concen-tration, one in each of two otherfields of concentration, and an inter-disciplinary seminar. PROGRAM APPROVAL AND ADVISEMENT The director is happy to discuss with students their general educational andcareer aims as well as the specificopportunities provided by the Pro-gram in Medieval and Renaissance Studies. All major and minor pro-grams require the approval of thedirector of the program. HONORS PROGRAM The general requirements for depart-mental honors are outlined in theHonors and Awards section of this bulletin. In addition, students wish-ing to receive their degree with hon-ors in medieval and Renaissancestudies are required to complete asatisfactory thesis on a topic of theirchoice demonstrating their ability tocontrol the relevant sources, bibliog-raphy, and methodology. Students who meet the general College requirements must seek writ-ten approval of the director of theprogram before beginning the seniorthesis\u2014an essay of 30 to 60 pages ona research topic\u2014at which time athesis director will be chosen. Oncethe topic has been defined, the stu-dent will meet with the thesis direc-tor to discuss bibliography andresearch plans. Students will normallytake one independent study duringthe course of the research and writingof the thesis. The independent studycourse will be supervised by the the-sis director and may not replace anyof the primary or secondary concen-tration requirements for the major.Deadlines for completing the honorsthesis are the following: the thesisoutline and bibliography are due one month after the opening date of theterm; the completed first draft is duetwo months after the opening of theterm; the completed final draft is duethree weeks before the end of theterm. This schedule enables studentsto compete for awards, honors, andfellowships. STUDY ABROAD MARC prepares and encourages itsstudents to complement their workin medieval and Renaissance studiesat one of NYU's Study Abroad pro-grams in Florence, London, Madrid,Paris, and Prague or at one of theWestern European exchange univer- sities.

In their course work, studentsdevelop a critical understanding of how metropolitan areas evolve while they examine thoseareas' core problems. The program exploits one of NYU's major assets\u2014its New York City location\u2014in a variety of ways. In many courses, students learn through assignments involving indepen-dent fieldwork, observation, and analysis in both Manhattan and the greater metropolitanarea. All majors participate in an 8-point internship program enabling them to work in gov-ernment or nonprofit agencies while participating in a seminar in order to link this practi-cal experience with theoretical and historical issues. The internship allows students to getinvolved in the community, gain experience in a professional setting, and explore careeroptions. There is an honors program for qualified students that culminates in a senior the-sis written under supervision of a faculty member. The program draws on faculty active in the city's government, community, and nonprofit agencies. The major provides excellent training for students who wish to pursuefurther professional or graduate studies as well as for those seeking careers in the public,nonprofit, or private sectors. It provides particularly valuable preparation for students inter-ested in law, the health professions, teaching, journalism, social work, architecture, city andregional planning, public policy, public administration, nonprofit administration, and com-munity organization. An accelerated B.A./M.P .A. arrangement exists with New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.

DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM: Professor W TchenT212 METROPOLITAN STUDIESProgram MAJOR Students majoring in metropolitan studies take two introductorysequence courses, four elective areacourses, and four research core cours-es, including the internship. Themajor is structured sequentially.With the introductory sequence, the student begins a general, compara-tive, and historical overview of citiesand how they change, comprehen-sively addressing cultural, political,and economic issues. The studentthen takes four electives that exploreparticular urban topics or issues.Thereafter the student develops hisor her interests through an internshipin a related area. Finally, two researchseminars enable the student to devel-op skills in primary research andwritten communication, as well asdata and policy analysis. The introductory sequence con- sists of Introduction to MetropolitanStudies, V99.0101 (or Societies andthe Social Sciences: InterdisciplinaryPerspectives on Metropolitan Studies,V55.0631), and Crisis of the ModernCity: New York City in Comparativeand Historical Perspective,V99.0103. Additionally, there is arequired research core of four courses: Internship Fieldwork, V99.0401;Internship Seminar, V99.0402;Research Methods in MetropolitanStudies, Students mustcomplete one introductory sequencecourse before taking Research Meth-ods in Metropolitan Studies and twointroductory sequence courses plusResearch Methods before takingSenior Research Seminar. Finally, stu-dents choose four courses in threeelective areas of concentration\u2014social welfare and public policy,urban culture and identity, and thematerial city. MINOR The minor consists of four courses.Introduction to Metropolitan Studies(or Societies and the Social Sciences:Interdisciplinary Perspectives onMetropolitan Studies, V55.0631) isrequired. INTERNSHIP PROGRAM The internship complements andenhances the formal course work ofthe metropolitan studies program. Students intern at agencies dealingwith a range of urban issues and takea corequisite seminar that enablesthem to focus the work experience inmeaningful academic terms. Studentsmajoring in metropolitan studies arerequired to take an internship,although many nonmajors alsoenroll. The goals of the internshipare threefold: (1) to allow students toapply the theory they have gainedthrough course work, (2) to providestudents with the analytical tools toimprove urban life, and (3) to assiststudents in exploring professionalcareer paths. HONORS PROGRAM Honors work consists of a yearlong,12-credit individualized researchproject to be completed during thesenior year and conducted through asequence of independent study cours-es in consultation with a facultymember. Honors students presentand defend their completed researchbefore a committee of metropolitanstudies faculty. For general require-ments, please see under Honors and Awards. Courses INTRODUCTORY CORE COURSES Introduction to Metropolitan Studies (or Societies and theSocial Sciences: InterdisciplinaryPerspectives on MetropolitanStudies, V55.0631) 4 points. A broad and interdisciplinary intro-duction to the field of urban studies.Surveying the major approaches thathave been deployed to investigate theurban experience in the contestedsocial space of the modern city, thiscourse explores the historical geogra-phy of capitalist urbanization withparticular attention to North Ameri-can and European cities, to colonialand postcolonial cities, and to theglobal contexts of urban develop-ment. topics include urbanpolitics regional social the gender-ing of urban space; and racism, racialsegregation, and the politics of urbanspace.

Experimental approaches in neural science vary from analyses ofmolecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and groups of nerve cells to behavioral and psychological studies of whole organisms. Theoretical tools include mathe-matical and computational modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas ofscience. Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and neurochemicalmechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural circuits consisting of small num-bers of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the relationship between theactivity of elements of the nervous system and the behavior of organisms. The Center forNeural Science offers a B.S. degree in neural science. The requirements for the major include V80.0100, V80.0201 lab), course in neural science and one in either psychology or biology are alsorequired. Students should see the director of undergraduate studies for approval of electivechoices. Prehealth students must take, in addition, V85.0012 and V25.0244-0246, but arenot required to take V80.0301. A grade of B or better in Introduction to Neural Science isrequired for entrance into the major; a grade of C or better must be achieved in all othercourses required for the major. The following courses are recommended: V25.0244-0246and V85.0012. Honors: To graduate with honors in neural science, students must achieve a grade point average of 3.5 or better for courses required for the major and 3.5 for all other coursestaken for credit.

The four main branches are metaphysics (What is the ultimate nature ofreality? What really exists and what is mere appearance?); epistemology (What, if anything, can be known and how?); logic (What are the principles of correct reasoning?);and ethics (What is moral value? And what moral values should we adopt?). Other, morespecific, branches of philosophy address questions concerning the nature of art, law, medi-cine, politics, religion, and the sciences. Everyone tends to have or assume answers to these questions. The aim of the department is to enable students to identify, clarify, and assess these answers, both ancientand modern. Philosophy prepares students for a more reflective life, for advanced studies inthe subject, as well as for professions that emphasize analytic thinking and argumentation,such as law, business, and programming.DEPARTMENT OF Philosophy (83) SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 503, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688.

PHYSICS 233Physics at the College of Arts and Science is a multidimensional discipline. The department offers several tracks of study designed for preprofessional students as wellas aspiring physicists. A detailed curriculum is worked out for each student, with individual attention to progress and career plans. The physics major may participate in internationally recognized research activities carried out by the faculty. Some major areas of specialization include astrophysics, atomicphysics, condensed matter physics, and elementary particle physics. In addition to technical physics courses, the department offers general interest courses intended to broaden the scientific background of nonscience majors.DEPARTMENT OF Physics (85) ANDRE AND BELLA MEYER HALL OF PHYSICS, 4 WASHINGTON PLACE, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6621. (212) 998-7700. CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Mincer DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE Program DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES The Department of Physics offers several programs for majors inphysics, leading to either the Bache-lor of Arts or the Bachelor of Sciencedegree. A minor in physics and aminor in astronomy are also offered.The B.A. major is particularly wellsuited for preprofessional and otherstudents who, while not planningcareers in physics, would like to havethe benefits and background of anundergraduate major in physics. TheB.A. intensive major is for studentswho plan to continue their study ofphysics in graduate school or whointend to work in physics or relatedfields. The B.S. degree provides somebreadth in other sciences. In a joint program between New York University and Stevens Insti- tute of Technology, a physics majorat NYU can be combined with anengineering major at Stevens. The five-year program leads to a B.S.degree in physics and a B.E. degreein either civil engineering, electricalengineering, or mechanical engineer-ing. For further information, contactMr. Joseph Hemmes, coordinator ofthe B.S./B.E. program, at the CollegeAdvising Center, Silver Center, 100Washington Square East, Room 905; (212) 998-8130. For students not majoring in physics, the following courses aresuitable for single electives, have noprerequisites, and assume no mathe-matical background beyond the highschool level. Of special interest tothe nonscience major are the follow-ing: Light and Color in Nature andArt, V85.0009; Sound and Music,V85.0010; 20th-Century Conceptsof V85.0007; and Originsof Astronomy, V85.0008. Also ofinterest is Observational Astronomy, V85.0013, for which a prerequisiteis recommended. Physics is the most highly devel- oped of the natural sciences. For thisreason, it is frequently taken as theexemplar of the scientific method,the model for other quantitative sci-ences. Those trained in physics arefound in many occupations. A higherdegree opens the possibility of cre-ative research in industry or teachingand research in colleges and universi-ties. Men and women with degreesin physics often are employed in various fields of engineering. Under-graduate training in physics is valuable preparation for careers inmedicine and dentistry, computertechnology, environmental and earthsciences, communications, and sciencewriting. It is fairly common for thoseplanning research careers in molecu-lar biology, chemical physics, orastronomy to major in physics while234 PHYSICSCoursesundergraduates. Because of their physical intuition, ability to developabstract models, and expertise inquantitative reasoning, physicists arefrequently members of interdiscipli-nary groups engaged in studyingproblems not directly related tophysics.

In addition, the department provides instruction in political economy and research methodology. Many graduates of the program enter law school. However, the orientation of the department is not strictly preprofessional, and its students are well prepared to enter a num-ber of fields: teaching, business, journalism, government (including the foreign service),social work, urban affairs, and practical politics. The department has an internship program that has helped to place advanced stu- dents with New York State and City government, congressional staffs, public policy inter-est groups, and international organizations with offices in New York. The department alsosponsors a Washington Semester Program for which a limited number of students areaccepted each semester. For details of this program, see course descriptions (V53.971), andconsult the director of undergraduate studies. The honors program provides an opportunity for outstanding students to under- take specialized advanced work and independent research during their junior and senioryears. For details on this program, see below.DEPARTMENT OF Politics (53) 715 BROADWAY , 4TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6806. (212) 998-8500.

HONORS PROGRAM For admission to and completion ofthe department's honors program,students must have and sustain aGPA of 3.5 overall and in the major.Applications to the honors programare considered on a continual basis;admission to the honors programpermits students to register for theJunior Honors seminar (V53.0912),held in the junior year. In addition to other program requirements, honors students writea senior thesis in the fall or spring oftheir senior year. The thesis isreviewed by a committee of at leasttwo faculty members during an oralexamination. Successful completionof all honors requirements permitsstudents to graduate \"with honors inPolitics.\" Detailed information aboutthe program may be obtained at thedepartment. MINOR The minor requires four 4-pointcourses (16 points) in the depart-ment chosen in consultation withpolitics departmental advisers andcompleted with a grade of C or bet-ter. A minor program may reflect aspecial emphasis in one of politicalscience's four fields or subfields suchas prelaw. A course from another dis-cipline cannot be substituted for apolitics course in fulfillment of theminor requirements. THE WASHINGTON SEMESTER PROGRAM This program is sponsored by the Department of Politics in conjunc-tion with American University. Sem-inars are taught by the faculty ofAmerican University in Washington,DC.

Only the seminar (8 points)can be applied to the requirementsfor a major in politics. Applications may be submitted in October andMarch of each year for the followingsemester. PRELAW Although law schools do not requireany particular major or course ofstudy, political science is an especial-ly useful field for students planninglegal study and a later career in law.For this reason, it is not surprisingthat, over the years, more law stu-dents have majored in this field thanin any other. The Association ofAmerican Law Schools has suggestedthat among the areas of importancein prelegal education are the study ofthe political organization of societies;the democratic processes of Westernsocieties; the freedom of individuals;and the art of peaceful, orderly adap-tation to change.

GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES 1000- and 2000-level courses are open to exceptional undergraduateswith an adequate background in pol-itics. Requires written permission ofthe instructor or, in his or herabsence, the director of graduatestudies.PRE-BUSINESS STUDIES 245 Abroad liberal arts education\u2014which includes a general education (MAP) and a major in a liberal arts discipline or interdisciplinary field\u2014provides a sound foundation formany careers in business. The skills and perspectives of the liberal arts\u2014in analysis, communication, etc.\u2014are practical as well as personally enriching. Liberal arts students, how- ever, can considerably enhance their preparedness for business by also completing a small num-ber of more specific courses. In consultation with the Undergraduate College of the Stern Schoolof Business, the College of Arts and Science has identified a set of such courses. These courses\u2014some offered by CAS and some by the Stern School of Business\u2014are incorporated in the minorin pre-business studies. By completing this CAS minor, students will have acquired core knowl-edge and quantitative skills that are invaluable assets for success in the business professions. Intended especially for students interested in the humanities, the minor in pre- business studies is open only to students in College of Arts and Science and is administeredby the College Office. Students considering the minor should consult with the pre-businessadviser in the College Preprofessional Advising Office. This person's responsibilities includeadvising prospective and declared minors, evaluating the applicability of transfer credit,approving course substitutions when warranted, and meeting with Stern on matters ofCAS/Stern articulation.PROGRAM IN Pre-Business Studies Minor SILVER CENTER, 100 WASHINGTON SQUARE EAST, ROOM 901, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6688. (212) 998-8160. Program The minor consists of six courses, as indicated below. CAS COURSES: V31.0001 Economic Principles I 4 points. V31.0002 Economic Principles II 4 points.

V89.0062 Industrial and Organizational PsychologyPrerequisite: V89.0001, 4 points. The minimum acceptable grade in any of the courses to be countedtoward the minor is C-, and the min-imum overall grade point average inthe minor is 2.0. Students may countno more than two overlapping coursesfor both the pre-business minor andtheir major or other minor. Thosemajoring or minoring in economics ormajoring in international relations, allof which require half or more of thecourses required by the pre-businessminor, must therefore complete addi-tional courses, as indicated above. 246 PSYCHOLOGYThe Department of Psychology at NYU approaches the study of mind and behavior from many perspectives. Experimental cognitive psychologists focus on perception,memory, attention, language, and thinking. Behavioral and physiological psycholo- gists focus on environmental and biological contributions to behavior. Clinical psychologistslook at emotions, stress, relationships, and disruptions of normal psychological functioning.Community psychologists consider the broader social context for healthy development andfunctioning. Experimental social psychologists determine how social beliefs, attitudes, anddecisions are formed and maintained. Organizational psychologists examine the utility ofpsychological theories in real world contexts. These many perspectives are reflected in under-graduate course offerings, all of which emphasize the scientific basis of psychology. In addition to its course offerings, the department encourages advanced under- graduates to become involved with the research of individual faculty through the ResearchExperiences and Methods and the Honors Program. Highly qualified students are admittedto the Honors Program in their sophomore or junior years, take special seminars, and writean honors research thesis under close faculty supervision. NYU psychology majors are well prepared for graduate study of the discipline and are accepted by top programs throughout the country. Others go on to careers in law, busi-ness, medicine, and education. The major's rigorous training in research methodology andsocial science may account for the high placement rate of graduates who enter the workforcedirectly from their baccalaureate program.DEPARTMENT OF Psychology (89) 6 WASHINGTON PLACE, ROOM 158, NEW YORK, NY 10003-6634.

CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Associate Professor Carrasco ASSOCIATE CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT: Professor Trope DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES: Associate Professor Maloney ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATESTUDIES: Dr. Richard Bock Faculty Professors Oettingen ADVANCED PLACEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGY AND STATISTICS Entering students who have taken the Advanced Placement Exam inPsychology may be eligible for amodification of the standard psychol-ogy major. Students who havereceived a 5 on the AP exam willreceive credit for the Introduction toPsychology course and can completethe major with the eight otherrequired courses or three otherrequired courses for the minor. Stu-dents who receive a 4 on the APexam are exempt from taking theIntroduction to Psychology class butmust still complete nine courses inpsychology for the major or fourcourses for the minor. Entering students who have taken the Advanced Placement Examin Statistics may also be eligible for amodification of the standard psychol-ogy major. Students who havereceived a 5 on the AP exam willreceive credit for the Statistical Rea-soning for the Behavioral Sciencecourse and can complete the majorwith the eight other required cours-es. Students who receive a 4 on theAP exam are exempt from taking theStatistical Reasoning for the Behav-ioral Science class but must stillcomplete nine courses in psychologyfor the major. For those students who have received a 4 on the AP exam, anycourse (or courses, if the studentreceived a 4 on both exams) that isnormally credited toward the psy-chology major, as well as HonorsSeminar I and Honors Seminar II,can be taken by these students tocomplete the major. In addition,selected courses in other departmentscan be counted toward the major orminor. A list is available from thepsychology department's Office ofAcademic Affairs. MAJOR Nine 4-point courses includingIntroduction to Psychology,V89.0001; Statistical Reasoning forthe Behavioral Sciences, V89.0009;two courses from Core A (psychologyas a natural science); two coursesfrom Core B (psychology as a socialscience); one laboratory course fromCore C; and two advanced electives.In order to declare a major or minorin psychology, a grade of C or bettermust be earned in Introductory Psy- chology, V89.0001. Credit towardthe major is not given for a course inthe major completed with a grade ofless than C. The curriculum involves a variety of possible sequences of courses thatproceed from introductory toadvanced. It is best that Introductionto Psychology be taken first, prefer-ably in the freshman year. Statisticsshould be taken next as it lays themethodological groundwork for theresearch to be discussed in the corecourses. Statistics must be amongthe first four psychology coursestaken. Core A and B courses ofgreatest interest to the studentshould be taken early as preparationfor the relevant Core C laboratorycourse and advanced electives thatfollow. For instance, if a studentexpects to do graduate work in thearea of perception, then the Core Acourse Perception should be taken inthe sophomore year, so that Labora-tory in Perception and AdvancedSeminar in Perception can be takenlater. Students are discouraged fromtaking two Core A courses in thesame term. In general, it is advisable that students complete their Core C labo-ratory course requirement before tak-ing advanced courses, preferably bythe spring of the junior year. GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS Students interested in graduate training in psychology should seri-ously consider becoming involved inresearch. Research Methods andExperience, V89.0999, offers stu-dents the opportunity to participatein faculty research, providing themwith a supervised research experi-ence as well as training in researchpresentation and criticism. Thiscourse is of great assistance to stu-dents in deciding about career direc-tions and, because of the direct con-tact with faculty involved, can resultin a letter of recommendation thatgraduate schools are likely to takevery seriously. Students who are particularly interested in graduate work in clini-cal psychology are encouraged toinclude Physiological Psychology,V89.0024; Personality, V89.0030;Laboratory tions. Personality,V89.0031, Psy-chology, V89.0034, are appro-priate choices. Finally, Fieldwork,V89.0995, is a pass/fail course thatcan provide valuable experience in areal-world setting in which psychol-ogy is in professional practice. Thedepartment provides special advise-ment for students interested ingraduate work in clinical areas ofpsychology and related fields. Con-tact the undergraduate programoffice for details. When choosing a minor concen- tration or elective courses in otherdepartments, the student should beguided by two sets of considerations:(1) If the student has a vocationalgoal such as a research or appliedresearch career (particularly in CoreA areas), courses in mathematics,chemistry, biology, physics, andcomputer science will be most use-ful. If a career in business-organiza-tional psychology is the goal, theneconomics, sociology, and mathe-matics will be most useful. Notethat selected courses in these andother departments can be countedtoward the psychology major. Con-tact the Department of Psychology'sOffice of Academic Affairs fordetails. The student should makeuse of psychology faculty advisers formore detailed advice. (2) The aboveshould be tempered by the nonvoca-tional goal of becoming a well-rounded, educated person. TheMorse Academic Plan of the Collegewill work toward that end, but thethoughtful student will keep thebroad goal in mind throughout theundergraduate years. MINOR Four 4-point courses includingIntroduction to Psychology,V89.0001; one course from Core A;one course from Core B; and oneadvanced elective. In order todeclare a minor in psychology, stu-dents must have earned a grade of Cor better in Introduction to Psychology, V89.0001. Credittoward the minor is not given forcourses completed with a grade ofless than C.248 PSYCHOLOGYSPECIAL MAJOR: LANGUAGE AND MIND This major, intended as an introduc- tion to cognitive science, is adminis-tered by the Departments of Lin-guistics, Philosophy, and Psychology.Eleven courses are required (four inlinguistics, one in philosophy, five inpsychology, and one additionalcourse) to be constituted as follows.The linguistics component consistsof Analysis,V61.0012; toSemantics, V61.0004. V83.0015; Philosophy ofLanguage, V83.0085; and Logic,V83.0070. The psychology compo-nent consists of four required cours-es: Introduction to Psychology,V89.0001; Statistical Reasoning for the Behavioral Sciences, V89.0009;The Psychology of Language,V89.0056; and Cognition,V89.0029; in addition, one coursechosen from Seminar in Thinking,V89.0026; Language Acquisitionand Cognitive Development,V89.0300; and Laboratory inHuman Cognition, V89.0028. The11th course will be one of the above-listed courses that has not alreadybeen chosen to satisfy the depart-mental components. For more infor-mation, contact Professor McElree. HONORS PROGRAM The aim of the honors program is toprovide students with a strongrecord in the major an opportunityto engage in closely supervised butindependent research and scholar-ship. This program both preparesstudents for graduate level work inpsychology or any of the related pro-fessional fields such as business, law,or medicine and aids them in impor-tant career decisions. Students mustapply for admission to the honors program in the sophomore or junioryear, with occasional exceptions forlate transfer students. Admission isbased on grades and the ability tobenefit from a program that empha-sizes seminars in current researchissues and independent work. Hon-ors students take the Honors Semi-nar sequence in either their junior orsenior year: Honors Seminar I in thefall, and Honors Seminar II in thespring. An honors research thesis,usually based on an expansion of aresearch project and serving as evi-dence of individual thought and cre-ativity, is submitted for facultyapproval near the end of the senioryear. Details and application forms(the deadline is normally April 15)are available from the Department ofPsychology, Faculty of Arts and Science, New York University, 6 Washington Place, Room 158,New York, NY 10003-6634.

Decisions by state, local, fed- eral, and international organizations influence the quality of the environment,access to health care, international development, and the emergence of a global media industry. The minor in public policy, jointly developed and administered by theCollege of Arts and Science and the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service,is designed for undergraduates interested in understanding such key issues and problemsof the modern world and in approaches to dealing with them. This interdisciplinary, interschool minor offers students a meaningful cluster of courses in a professional area where the liberal arts disciplines can provide important per-spectives. It also furthers several related goals: it links the classroom to the city, encouragesstudents to apply their theoretical learning, and provides a minor that is coherent and sub-stantial, in that it entails five courses, one of which is a capstone experience whereby stu-dents gain a deeper understanding of how public policies are made and carried out. An executive committee of College of Arts and Science and Wagner School of Public Service faculty oversees the public policy minor. For each track, there is a desig-nated adviser to students. For communications and the media, it is Professor Michael Ludlum, Department of Journalism and Mass Communication, 10 Washington Place,Room 605B, (212) 998-7972. For health, it is Ms. Beverley Warner, Wagner School,4 Washington Square North, Room 24, (212) 998-7476.

We seek to understand the full range of social institutions and practices, from couples andsmall groups to organizations such as businesses and government agencies, to the functioning of communities, cities, and nations. Our methods of research are diverse, rang-ing from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches such as in-depthinterviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen, an expert in some special field, or a socially active trailblazer, we offer the tools and knowledge to help students make senseof the world around them. Students preparing for careers in law, social service, health, pub-lic administration, and other professional areas will find sociology an excellent major andcan choose from many relevant substantive courses. Those interested in social research andpolicymaking will benefit especially from courses that teach practical skills of data gather-ing and analysis. In all of these courses, we encourage students to study issues from a vari-ety of perspectives, to develop a critical awareness of social life, and to use a \"sociologicalimagination\" to analyze social problems and act effectively. NYU's Department of Sociology reflects the scope of our discipline. The faculty includes experts in a variety of fields, including gender studies and the family; crime, law,and deviance; political sociology, including social movements and social policy; organiza-tions and economy; education; inequality; community and urban life; social theory; and cul-ture.

ARREARS POLICY The University reserves the right todeny registration and withhold allinformation regarding the record ofany student who is in arrears in thepayment of tuition, fees, loans, orother charges (including charges forhousing, dining, or other activities orservices) for as long as any arrearsremain. The unpaid balance of a student's account is subject to an interestcharge of 12 percent per annum fromthe first day of class until payment isreceived.

The Universitycannot be responsible for the inclu-sion in the current official graduationlist of any candidate who pays feesafter the first day of May, September,or January for degrees in May, Sep-tember, or January, respectively. Following the payment of allrequired fees and on approval of thefaculty, the candidate will be recom-mended for the degree as of the dateof the next regular meeting of theUniversity Board of Trustees atwhich the awarding of degrees is apart of the order of business. WITHDRAWAL AND REFUND OF TUITION A student who for any reason finds it impossible to complete a course forwhich he or she has registered shouldconsult with an academic adviser inthe College Advising Center, SilverCenter, Room 905, and file a com-pleted Change of Program form withthe Office of the Bursar. (Note: Anofficial withdrawal must be filed if acourse has been canceled, and, in thiscase, the student is entitled to arefund of tuition and registration feespaid.) Withdrawal does not necessar-ily entitle the student to a refund oftuition paid or a cancellation oftuition still due. A refund of tuitionwill be made provided such with-drawal is filed within the scheduledrefund period for the term (seeschedule below). Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdraw-al, nor does notification to theinstructor. A stop payment of acheck presented for tuition does not constitute withdrawal, nor does itreduce the indebtedness to the Uni-versity. The nonreturnable registra-tion fee and a penalty fee of $10.00for a stopped payment must becharged in addition to any tuitionnot canceled. The date on which the Change of Program form is filed, not the lastdate of attendance in class, is consid-ered the official date of the student'swithdrawal. It is this date that servesas the basis for computing anyrefund granted the student. The refund period (see schedule below) is defined as the first four cal-endar weeks of the term for whichapplication for withdrawal is filed.The processing of refunds takesapproximately two weeks. REFUND PERIOD SCHEDULE (FALL AND SPRING TERMS ONLY) This schedule is based on the totalapplicable charge for tuition, exclud-ing nonreturnable fees and deposits. Withdrawal before the official opening of the term: . . . . . .100% Withdrawal within theopening date of the term: . . .100% The first calendar week consists of the first seven (7) calendar days beginningwith the official opening date of the term.(Note: not the first day of the class meeting.) Withdrawal within the second calendar week from theopening date of the term: . . . .70% Withdrawal within the third date of the term: . . . .55% Withdrawal within the fourth date of the term: . . . .25% Withdrawal refund schedule is not applicable to students whose regis-tration remains within the flat-fee range. 1Students automatically enrolled in the Basic Plan or the Comprehensive Plan can changebetween plans, waive the plan entirely (andshow proof of other acceptable health insur-ance), or select the UHC Only plan.286 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AIDNote: A student may not with- draw from a class after the ninthweek of the fall or spring semester orthe last two weeks of each summersession. The registration and services fee is in no case returnable. Exceptions to the published refund schedule may be appealed inwriting to the refund committee inthe College Advising Center, SilverCenter, Room 905, and should besupported by appropriate documen-tation regarding the circumstancesthat warrant consideration of anexception.Federal regulations require adjustments reducing financial aid ifa student withdraws even after theNYU refund period. Financial aidamounts will be adjusted for stu-dents who withdraw through theninth week of the semester and havereceived any federal grants or loans.This adjustment may result in thestudent's bill not being fully paid.NYU will bill the student for thisdifference. The student will beresponsible for payment of this billbefore returning to NYU and willremain responsible for payment evenif he or she does not return to NYU.For any semester a student receives any aid, that semester willbe counted in the satisfactory acade-mic progress standard. This mayrequire the student to make up creditsbefore receiving any further aid.Please review the \"satisfactory aca-demic progress\" standard for yourschool so you do not jeopardize futuresemesters of aid. Students who with-draw should review the \"Refund\"page on the NYU Office of the Bur-sar Web site (www.nyu.edu/bursar). Financial Aid New York University believes that students should be able to choose thecollege that offers them the bestrange of educational opportunities.In order to make that choice possi-ble, New York University attemptsto aid students who are in need offinancial assistance. Financial aid is awarded in an effort to help students meet the dif-ference between their own resourcesand the cost of education. All awardsare subject to availability of fundsand the student's demonstrated need.Renewal of assistance depends onannual reevaluation of a student'sneed, the availability of funds, thesuccessful completion of the previousyear, and satisfactory progress towardcompletion of degree requirements.In addition, students must meet thepublished filing deadlines. Detailedinformation on financial aid is for-warded with the admission applica-tion (and see also the Office of Finan-cial Aid Web site at www.nyu.edu/ financial.aid). Many awards are granted purely on the basis of scholastic merit. Oth-ers are based on financial need. How-ever, it is frequently possible toreceive a combination of awardsbased on both. Thus Universityscholarships or fellowships may begranted by themselves or in conjunc-tion with student loans or FederalWork-Study employment. To ensure that maximum sources of availablesupport will be investigated, stu-dents must apply for financial aid bythe appropriate deadline. Student responsibilities. It is the student's responsibility to supplytrue, accurate, and complete informa-tion and to inform the Office ofFinancial Aid immediately of anychanges or corrections in his or her housing status or financial situation,including tuition remission benefitsor outside grants, once applicationhas been made. A student who has received a financial aid award must inform his or her department and the Office ofFinancial Aid if he or she subse-quently decides to decline all or partof that award. To neglect to do soprevents use of the award by anotherstudent. If a student has not claimedhis or her award (has not enrolled) bythe close of regular (not late) registra-tion and has not obtained writtenpermission from his or her depart-ment and the Office of Financial Aidfor an extension, the award may becanceled, and the student maybecome ineligible to receive scholar-ship or fellowship aid in future years. Determination of financial need is also based on the number of coursesfor which the student indicates he orshe intends to register. A change inregistration therefore may necessitatean adjustment in financial aid. HOW TO APPLY Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid(FAFSA), and later, New York Stateresidents must also complete thepreprinted New York State TuitionAssistance Program (TAP) applica-tion, which is mailed automaticallyto the student by the New YorkState Higher Education Services Cor-poration (HESC) after the FAFSA isprocessed. The FAFSA is the basicform for all student aid programs; besure to complete all sections. Stu-dents should give permission on theFAFSA for application data to be sentdirectly to New York University (the NYU federal code number is002785). Note: There is no separate application for NYU scholarships.All students are automatically con-sidered for academic (merit-based)and financial need-based scholarshipsafter applying for admission andfinancial aid. The FAFSA and theadmissions application contain all theinformation needed for scholarshipdetermination. Students are encouraged to apply for financial aid electronically\u2014thefastest and most accurate method.Information is transmitted directly tothe U.S. Department of Educationand eliminates the additional pro-cessing time and potential error asso-ciated with a traditional paper FAFSA.The process is quicker and better forboth the student and New York Uni-versity. See www.nyu.edu/financial.aid or www.fafsa.ed.gov. The FAFSA is also available from the student's current high school orinstitution or from the Office ofFinancial Aid, New York University,25 West Fourth Street, New York,NY 10012-1119. Entering freshmenshould submit the application byFebruary 15 for the fall term or byNovember 1 for the spring term.Continuing undergraduate studentsshould consult the Financial AidWeb site for information. For return- ing undergraduates, the deadline forthe government to receive the\"Renewal FAFSA on the Web\" isMarch 1. Students requiring summer finan- cial aid must submit a summer aidapplication in addition to the FAFSAand TAP application. The applica-tion becomes available in Februaryand can be obtained from the Finan-TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 287cial Aid Web site or the Office of Financial Aid. Complete all applica-tions at least 12 weeks before thebeginning of the term in whichfunds are needed.

Academic year earnings are not credited toward tuition and fees orroom and board but are paid directlyto the student on a biweekly basis.Money earned from employment isnormally used for books, transporta-tion, and personal expenses. It is not necessary to be awarded academic year earnings in order touse the services of the Student Employment and Internship Center.All students may use the center assoon as they have paid their tuitiondeposit and may also wish to use thecenter as a resource for summeremployment. Extensive listings ofboth on-campus and off-campus jobsare available. Resident Assistantships.

Readmitted students must fulfill the requirements as listed in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin published during the year of their readmission, unless their readmission letter states otherwise. In very exceptional cases, a student may petition the Committee on Undergradu- ate Academic Standards for approval of a change in the requirements as stated in the bul-letin. The petition form may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean for Stu-dents, Silver Center, Room 909B.Degree Requirements Conferring of DegreesDegrees are conferred in September, January, and May. The formal con-ferring of degrees by the president ofthe University takes place annually at Commencement in May. The Major Major requirements, varying fromdepartment to department, are speci-fied in the section devoted to thecourse listings of individual depart-ments and programs. Generally, alittle more than one-third of thetotal points are earned in the major concentration. Every student must complete a major with a cumulative grade point average in the major of at least 2.0. One-half of the courses(and in some departments, one-half of the points) used to complete themajor must be taken in the Collegeof Arts and Science. The studentmust be accepted as a major in thedepartment and must review his orDEGREE REQUIREMENTS 313her program with a department adviser each term. DECLARATION OF MAJOR Students go to the office of thedepartment or program in questionto declare a major and have it postedin the Student Information System.Students who have earned 64 ormore points must declare a major.Those with fewer than 64 points are strongly encouraged to declare amajor as early in their academiccareer as possible. DOUBLE MAJOR Students may take a double (second)major. The same requirements,including the maintenance of a min-imum grade point average of 2.0,apply to the second major as to the first. In some cases, courses may beapplicable to both majors. Studentsmust then obtain the writtenapproval for the course(s) from thedirectors of undergraduate studies ofboth departments. The second majoris declared in the same way as thefirst (see above). The Minor The minor requirements are found inthe departmental sections of the bul-letin. The minor must be completedwith a minimum grade point aver-age of 2.0. Except for the minors ineducation, studio art, and social work, one-half of the courses used tocomplete the minor must be Collegeof Arts and Science courses. Theminor is declared at the office of thesponsoring department or program. No more than one minor can becompleted outside of the College inorder for the credits to count towardthe degree requirement. Regulations Pertaining to Both Major and MinorThe major and minor requirements to be followed are those stated in thedepartmental sections of the bulletinin effect during the semester of thestudent's first registration in the Col-lege. No credit toward the major orminor is granted for grades of D+ orlower, although such grades will becomputed into the grade point aver-age of the major or the minor, aswell as into the overall grade pointaverage. A number of departments have higher minimum grade require-ments, and students should refer tothe departmental sections of the bul-letin for specific information. No course to be counted toward the major or minor may be taken ona pass/fail basis (see \"Pass/FailOption\" under Academic Policies ). Except for the minors in educa- tion, pre-business studies, studio art,and social work, no courses given in other NYU divisions may be countedtoward the major or minor, and onlyone minor from among these pro-grams will count toward the 128-credit degree requirement. Transferstudents from other colleges and uni-versities must have the writtenapproval of the director of undergrad-uate studies to count transfer coursestoward the major or the minor. Time Limit All requirements for a degree in the College must be met within a periodof eight years from the date ofmatriculation. For transfer studentsand for students who are readmitted to the College, the length of time isproportionately reduced. Transfercredit is not granted for coursestaken more than 10 years before the student's matriculation in the College. Residence RequirementAll students must complete their last 32 points while registered in theCollege of Arts and Science. In addi-tion, students must be registered inthe College during the semesterimmediately prior to graduation,unless officially approved for a leaveof absence in that semester. One-half of the courses used to complete themajor or the minor must be taken inthe College. Any transfer courses tobe applied toward major or minorrequirements must be approved bythe department. Registration inanother undergraduate division of NYU does not constitute registra-tion in the College for any purposes,including fulfillment of the residencerequirement or completion of thelast 32 points. Transfer StudentsTransfer students must complete 48 points in the College with a cumu-lative grade point average of at least2.0 overall, in the required major,and in the optional minor. At leastone-half of the courses used to com- plete the major and any minor mustbe courses offered by the College.Any transfer courses to be appliedtoward major or minor requirementsmust be approved by the depart- ment. Courses in which a grade ofC- or lower was obtained are nottransferable.314 PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMSPreprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs Internships The College of Arts and Science offers academic internships in the followingdepartments or programs: anthropolo-gy, biology, classics, dramatic litera-ture, East Asian studies, English,French, German, history, Italian, jour-nalism and mass communication,metropolitan studies, Middle Easternstudies, politics, psychology, sociolo-gy, and Spanish and Portuguese. Under these programs, qualified students are given an opportunity toapply the theory and skills attainedin the classroom. Students are placedin New York City area businesses,institutions, and agencies where they can acquire hands-on experience in their field of interest. Eligibility requirements for intern- ships in most departments or pro-grams are outlined in this bulletin. Ifthey are not, please consult the direc-tor of undergraduate studies for thisinformation. Although the require-ments for these 2- to 4-point coursesvary from department to department,internships must be taken within the12-point maximum allowed for independent study. (Placements aredependent on the availability ofopportunities each term.) Internshipsfor credit must be sponsored by an academic department within the College of Arts and Science. The College's Career Assistance Program can help place students notonly in internships for academic cred-it but also in noncredit internships.This program's counseling on acade-mic choices and career optionsemphasizes the planning of intern-ships. For more information, see \"TheCareer Assistance Program\" underStudent Activities, University Services, or make an appointment with a careercounselor by coming to the SilverCenter, 100 Washington Square East,Room program lege of Arts and Science is designedfor any student who wishes to under-take preprofessional preparation forapplication to medical, dental, vet-erinary, osteopathic medical, optom-etry, or podiatry school. The pro-gram of study for a student interest-ed in any of these areas minimallyrequires completion of the followingcourses: Principles of Biology I andII, V23.0011, V23.0012; ChemistryII, Introduction to Gen-eral OrganicChemistry II, OrganicChemistry II V25.0246;General Physics I and II, V85.0011,V85.0012; Writing the Essay,V40.0100, and one elective from theEnglish Department; and Calculus I,V63.0121. Some professional schoolsmay require additional courses. While striving to earn the best grades possible, prehealth studentsmust also keep in mind that schoolsof the health professions look atevery aspect of a candidate's back-ground when making admissiondecisions. Therefore, students are encouraged to pursue a major ofheartfelt interest, to participate inextracurricular activities of theirchoosing, and to develop intellectualpursuits and hobbies outside theirschoolwork. Additionally, all pre-health students are very stronglyencouraged to get either paid or vol-unteer work experience in the areathey would like to follow. The reason for this experience is twofold: students will be able tomake an intelligent decision aboutwhether or not they should pursuethis profession, and admissions com-mittees can see that an applicant isdedicated enough to find out about aparticular profession and that he orshe has made an attempt to becomeaware of both its positive and itsnegative aspects. The College's Preprofessional Advisement Office, Silver Center,Room 901, telephone: (212) 998-8160, has an extensive evaluationprocess that enables the chair of theCommittee on Recommendations toSchools of the Health Professions towrite a letter of recommendationusing information from as manysources as possible. Students fill outevaluation forms each semester.Additionally, students preparing forthe admissions tests and subsequent application undergo an extensiveinterview process during the springsemester before application. Studentsare encouraged to keep in touch withthe Preprofessional AdvisementOffice so that they are informedabout deadlines for the evaluationprocedures. Any student even remotely con- sidering a career in one of the healthprofessions is strongly urged to seean adviser in the PreprofessionalAdvisement Office as early as possi-ble. Being \"premed\" is not a major,does not affect earning one's degree,and is not an irrevocable commit-ment should the student change hisor her mind. The PreprofessionalAdvisement Office will also helpstudents from other NYU divisionswho wish to follow a prehealth cur-riculum. Much more detailed infor-mation about the undergraduateexperience as a prehealth student,about health schools, and about theapplication process is available in thePreprofessional Advisement Office.Advisers there can help students atevery stage of their prehealth careers.PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS 315Accelerated and Joint ProgramsB.A./M.D. PROGRAM The B.A./M.D. program is an eight- year joint program between the Col-lege of Arts and Science and theSchool of Medicine at New YorkUniversity.

Barbara and Evan Chesler Prelaw ProgramProspective law students are free to choose from the wide variety ofcourses offered at the College of Artsand Science. The College endorses theposition of the Association of Ameri-can Law Schools that a single \"best\"preparation for law school cannot berecommended. As a result, there is noprescribed prelaw curriculum. PURPOSE OF PRELAW STUDY While the College considers the pre- scription of particular courses unwise,it recognizes an essence of undergrad-uate instruction it believes funda-mental to the attainment of legalprofession. Courses that requireextensive reading, research, and writ-ing should therefore be undertaken.The College's core curriculum is anexcellent beginning for prelaw stu-dents since it offers a rigorous andmultidisciplinary foundation foradvanced study in the humanities,social sciences, and natural sciences.The honors programs offered by sev-eral departments provide opportuni-ties to do extensive written work during the junior and senior years.Second, the precision of methodologyand thought required of students inmathematics, computer science,logic, and the natural sciences willaid in the development of analyticskills. Finally, a background in thebehavioral sciences and the humani-ties (politics, economics, history, lit-erature, philosophy, anthropology,and sociology) is suggested since eachwill offer a critical understanding ofthe human institutions and valueswith which the law deals. ADVISING The services of the Prelaw AdvisingOffice, Silver Center, Room 901,telephone: (212) 998-8160, are avail-able to students seeking consultationon general course selection, lawschool applications, and relatedissues. The office serves as a clearing-house for the dean's letter of recom-mendation, required by a number oflaw schools as part of their admis-sions process. The Lawyer AlumniMentoring Program (LAMP) offers CAS students an opportunity toapply for one-on-one mentoring withexperienced attorneys who are alumnifrom the College. OTHER ACTIVITIES The New York University School ofLaw, conveniently located across thesquare from the College, sponsorsmany events open to the Universitycommunity. The school's proximityallows prelaw students to sit in onfirst-year law school classes and tomeet and talk informally with stu-dents actively pursuing legal studies.The College and the Prelaw Societyalso sponsor talks by guest speakerson law-related topics and field tripsto courts and schools of law; arrangefor representatives from various lawschools to visit the College anddescribe their programs; and admin-ister sample Law School AdmissionsTests (LSAT) in the fall and spring of each year. For further information,please contact the prelaw adviser.PREPROFESSIONAL, ACCELERATED, AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS 317Accelerated Programs Leading to Graduate and Professional DegreesACCELERATED B.A./M.P .A. PROGRAM The College of Arts and Science and the Robert F. Wagner GraduateSchool of Public Service offer selectedstudents the opportunity to earn theB.A. and M.P .A. degrees in a short-ened period of study. This programcombines the benefits of a broad lib-eral arts education at the undergrad-uate level with professional trainingat the graduate level. Admission to the program is open to students who have complet-ed 75 points toward the B.A., with aGPA of 3.0 or higher and who havefinished at least 32 of those points atthe College. Formal application tothe program is made in part throughits College coordinator in the CollegeAdvising Center, Silver Center,Room 905. In order to gain the greatest ben- efit from the combined degree pro-gram, the student should complete,while still an undergraduate, 28 ofthe 60 points required for the M.P .A.This advanced standing can beearned by enrolling in approvedcourses at Wagner or by takingundergraduate equivalents, a list ofwhich may be obtained from theprogram coordinator. The courses areselected in consultation with theCollege coordinator or with theWagner coordinator. Metropolitan studies majors follow a course ofstudy that allows them to take fulladvantage of the joint degree pro-gram. Interested students shouldspeak with the associate director ofthe Program in Metropolitan Studies. ACCELERATED BACHELOR'S/MASTER'S PROGRAM The College of Arts and Science and the Graduate School of Arts and Sci-ence offer students in many depart-ments or programs the opportunityto earn both the bachelor's degreeand the master's degree in a shorterperiod of time and at less cost than isnormally the case. Intended for stu-dents for whom a master's degree issufficient preparation for the pursuitof their career goals, this programeven allows for the possibility thatthe department of the master'sdegree is different from that of thebachelor's degree. The master's option is currently available in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Comparative Lit- erature, Computer Science, Econom-ics, English, French, German, Histo-ry, Mathematics, and Psychology, aswell as in the Center for EuropeanStudies, the Program in AfricanaStudies, the Program in French Stud-ies, and the Draper InterdisciplinaryProgram in Humanities and SocialThought. Students may apply to the pro- gram once they have completed aminimum of 48 credits toward thebachelor's degree but not more than96 credits or six semesters, whichevercomes first. Participating departmentsset minimum GPA requirements foradmission to and continuation in theprogram; neither may be below 3.5.The undergraduate courses requiredfor the master's program are deter-mined by the graduate department.In their remaining undergraduatesemesters, students can accelerate bytaking some graduate courses duringregular terms and/or during the sum-mer. In the graduate portion of theprogram, they can qualify for a schol-arship covering up to 50 percent ofthe tuition for the master's degree. Students in the program must satisfy all of the requirements of boththe bachelor's degree and the master'sdegree; there is no double-countingof courses. In order to complete theprogram in five years, students areadvised to finish at least a fourth ofthe master's requirements before thebeginning of the fifth year. Interested students should con- sult the relevant department or pro-gram or the College Advising Center,Silver Center, Room 905; (212) 998-8130. JOINT B.S./B.E.

THE GENERAL EDUCATION MINOR The five-course, 18-credit minor in general education, offered in coopera-tion with the Steinhardt School ofEducation, gives College of Arts andScience students the opportunity to explore a career in teaching and tolearn about important issues facingtoday's students and educators. Thecourse work in this minor deals withsuch topics as ways to promote andassess learning; the needs of a diversestudent body; relations between edu-cational systems and society; the his-torical evolution of approaches toeducation; the emotional and intel-lectual development of children andadolescents; and the role technologyplays in the classroom. This minor does not allow stu- dents to gain provisional certificationon graduation. However, therequired courses are part of the corerequirements for all teachers, and,therefore, the minor gives students a\"head start\" toward working on amaster's degree and certification. It isalso excellent preparation for suchprograms as Teach for America andNew York City Teaching Fellows orfor teaching in private schools andother educational environments inwhich certification is not required. By giving students a broad, well- balanced grounding in educationaltheory, history, and practice, thisminor prepares them to later special-ize in the area of education thatinterests them most, no matter whatage group or subject they plan toteach. The minor is also broad-basedenough to be of value to studentswho plan to teach at the college levelor to pursue a career in educationaladministration or school counseling.Finally, pedagogical skills are trans-ferable to almost any career thatrequires the ability to present infor-mation to others in a clear, orga-nized, and persuasive fashion. Interested students should con- tact the advisers for the general edu-cation minor in the College AdvisingCenter, Silver Center, Room 905, todiscuss declaring the minor officially.Students should keep in mind thatthey are allowed to count all 18 cred-its of a declared general educationminor toward their degree, but maynot count other courses outside ofthe College of Arts and Sciencetoward their degrees. See the sectionon Academic Policies in this bulletin for further information on takingcredits outside of the College.

Incomplete grades received because of a missed final examinationmust be removed within the semes-ter following the one in which theIncomplete was received. In the caseof students who are out of atten-dance, such grades must be removedwithin one year after the end of thecourse concerned. A grade of Incom-plete that is not removed within thistime limit becomes an F and is com-puted in the average. GRADES Students may obtain their finalgrades for each semester over thetelephone or on the Web by means ofa personal identification number.The parents or guardian of a studentwho is a minor (under 18 years ofage) may, on a written request to theOffice of the University Registrar,obtain the student's grades at anytime. The following symbols indicating terminal grades are used: A, B, C, D,P, F, and W . The following symbol indicates incomplete work: I. Onlygrades of A, B, C, D, or F earnedwhile matriculated in the College, orearned in any of the College's courses(A/V prefixed courses) while matric-ulated in another division of NewYork University, are computed in theaverage. The following grades may be awarded: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+,C, C-, D+, D, F. In general, A indi-cates excellent work, B indicatesgood work, C indicates satisfactorywork, and D indicates passable workand is the lowest passing grade. Findicates failure. The weightsassigned in computing the gradepoint average are as follows: A = 4.0,A- = 3.7, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- =2.7, C+ = 2.3, C = 2.0, C- = 1.7,D+ = 1.3, D = 1.0, and F = 0.0. Computing the grade point average: The grade point average can be obtained by determining thetotal of all grade points earned (qual-ity points) and dividing that figureby the total number of credit hourscompleted (quality hours). For example: A student who has completed 8 points of A (4.0), 4points of B (3.0), and 4 points of C(2.0) has a grade point average of3.25. This is obtained by adding 8(points of A) x 4 (point value of A), 4(points of B) x 3 (point value of B),and 4 (points of C) x 2 (point valueof C), which totals 52 (the total of allgrade points earned), and then bydividing 52 by 16 (the total numberof credit hours completed). Thisgives the grade point average of 3.25. Once a final grade has been sub- mitted by the instructor and record-ed on the transcript, the final gradecannot be changed by turning inadditional course work. In the case of a course that has been repeated, only the second grade,whether higher or lower, is comput-ed into the average. The initial grade,however, remains on the transcript. The grades for courses taken abroad in one of New York Universi-ty's programs or at one of theexchange sites are recorded on thetranscript and are also included inthe grade point average. The gradesfor graduate and professional coursestaken at other divisions in the Uni-versity are included in the gradepoint average, provided that permis-sion to enroll is obtained prior toregistration for the courses. Not included in the undergradu- ate grade point average are grades forthe first year of professional coursestaken by those students in the three-year accelerated dental, law, or med-ical programs; grades for work doneat institutions other than New YorkUniversity (except for exchange sitesabroad); and grades for work done in courses that are not prefixed with anA or a V (non-A/V courses) whileenrolled in another division of NewYork University. P:The grade of P (Pass) indicates a passing grade (A, B, C, or D) in acourse taken under the pass/failoption. It is also used to indicatenongraded courses. The grade of P isnot computed in the average. Thegrade of F under the pass/fail optionis computed in the average. For more information and dures to obtain the pass/fail option,see under \"Pass/Fail Option,\" below. W:The grade of W indicates an official withdrawal of the studentfrom a course. Please see \"Change ofprogram\" and \"Withdrawing fromcourses,\" above, for information onthe regulations and procedures forwithdrawing officially from courses. I:The grade of I (Incomplete) is a temporary grade that indicates thatthe student has, for good reason, notcompleted all of the course work butthat there is the possibility that thestudent will eventually pass thecourse when all of the requirementshave been completed. A studentmust ask the instructor for a grade ofI, present documented evidence ofillness or the equivalent, and clarifythe remaining course requirementswith the instructor. The incompletegrade is not awarded automatically.It is not used when there is no possi-bility that the student will eventual-ly pass the course. If the course workis not completed after the statutorytime for making up incompletes haselapsed, the temporary grade of Ishall become an F and will be com-puted in the student's grade pointaverage. INCOMPLETES All work missed in the fall termmust be made up by the end of thefollowing spring term. All workmissed in the spring term or in asummer session must be made up bythe end of the following fall term.Students who are out of attendancein the semester following the one inwhich the course was taken have oneyear to complete the work. Studentsshould contact the College AdvisingCenter for an Extension of Incom-plete Form, which must be approvedby the instructor. Extensions of thesetime limits are rarely granted.ACADEMIC POLICIES 329INDEPENDENT STUDY Most departments offer independent study courses for students withexceptional qualifications. In thesecourses, the work is planned specifi-cally for each student. Independent study courses allow the student to work independentlywith faculty supervision and counsel.The courses are generally numberedV**.0997, 0998 and typically carryvariable credit of 2 or 4 points eachterm. They are normally limited toupper-class majors but may be opento other well-qualified students. Toregister for independent study, a stu-dent must have written approval ofthe director of undergraduate studiesof the department in which thecourse is offered. The result of theindependent study course should be apaper or objective tangible evidenceof completion of the work. The indi-vidual departments may grant creditfor not more than 8 points of inde-pendent study (V**.0997, 0998) forwork approved in advance. In gener-al, students are not permitted to takemore than 12 points of independentstudy and/or internship, and no morethan 8 points may be taken in anyone department. Independent studycourses taken in other divisions ofthe University or at other universitiesdo not count toward the Collegedegree. More specific information can be found under the individual depart-mental descriptions. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Students who wish to be out ofattendance from the College for onesemester or an academic year may be granted an official leave of absence. The student should submit a request to the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905, andhave an interview with an adviserbefore the beginning of the term.Leaves are not granted after the thirdweek of the term unless there arecompelling personal or medical reasons. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal applica-tion for readmission as long as he orshe returns to the College within theagreed-upon time (a maximum oftwo semesters). The student on leaveis responsible for financial aid dead-lines. If students are on probationwhen the leave is granted, they willreturn on probation. If they haveattended another college during theleave, they must submit an officialtranscript to the College AdvisingCenter, College of Arts and Science,New York University, Silver Center,100 Washington Square East, Room905, New York, NY 10003-6688. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and whowish to return to the College mayapply for readmission. See underAdmission. PASS/FAIL OPTION Students may elect one pass/fail option each term, including the sum-mer sessions, for a total of not morethan 32 points during their collegecareer. The pass/fail option is notacceptable for courses completed atother institutions. The choice must be made beforethe completion of the fifth week of the term (second week of a six-weeksummer session); after that time thedecision cannot be initiated orchanged. No grade other than P or Fwill be recorded for those studentschoosing this option. P includes thegrades of A, B, C, and D and is notcounted in the average. F is countedin the average. The pass/fail option is not accept- able in the major, the minor, or anyof the courses taken in fulfillment ofthe Morse Academic Plan require-ments. Students considering thepass/fail option in their area of studyor in required preprofessional coursesshould consult with their advisersabout the effect of such grades onadmission to graduate and profes-sional schools. Students who changetheir majors may not be able to usecourses taken under the pass/failoption to satisfy the requirements oftheir new majors. The form fordeclaring the pass/fail option may beobtained in the College AdvisingCenter, Silver Center, Room 905. PETITIONS The Faculty Committee on Under-graduate Academic Standards willconsider petitions of students towaive requirements or modify poli-cies and regulations of the College.Students should be aware that onlyvery exceptional cases, supported byvalid and documented reasons, willbe considered. Petition forms may beobtained in the Office of the Associ-ate Dean for Students, Silver Center,Room 909B. Placement Examinations, Analysis of Academic Progress, and TranscriptsPLACEMENT EXAMINA- TIONS I. Foreign Languages. A. Testing and Placement. Most entering students take a proficiency/placement test prior to their first reg-istration in the College. SAT II-typereading tests are used as proficiency(exemption) and placement instru-ments in classical Greek, French, Ger-man, Italian, and Spanish. Studentswho took a foreign language SAT IItest while in high school are encour-aged to present the score instead of orin addition to taking the College'stest. Written examinations are alsogiven in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese,Korean, modern Greek, modern Hebrew, Portuguese, Russian, andTagalog. Testing in Cantonese can be arranged through the Department ofEast Asian Studies. Testing in Gaelic(Irish) can be arranged through Ire-land House. Testing in Arabic, Turk-ish, Persian, and Hindi/Urdu can bearranged through the Department ofMiddle Eastern Studies. Because theseare reading examinations, studentsshould choose to be tested in the lan-guage in which they have good read-ing skills. Tests can result either in an exemption from the foreign-languagerequirement (see \"Foreign Language\"under Morse Academic Plan) or inplacement into the appropriate-level course. Placement into a lower-levelcourse means that the student mustcontinue his or her studies of thatlanguage (or begin a new language)until completion of the intermediatelevel of that language. In some cases,adjustments in placement may bemade during the first weeks of class. Information on placement testing can be obtained from Crystal Parsonsat the Office of Academic Affairs,Silver Center, Room 908. Studentswho place at a level below thatwhich they have completed at anoth-er college will lose transfer credit ifthey repeat course work at the Col-lege of Arts and Science.B. Testing Exemptions. The proficiency/placement test isrequired of all entering studentswith the following exceptions: stu-dents who will begin a languagethey have not previously studied;students whose entire secondaryschooling was in a language otherthan English and other than thoselanguages taught in the College; andforeign students who complete thesequence of required English coursesfor international students. Studentsin these categories should contact theCollege Advising Center to verifythat they have satisfied the foreign-language requirement. II. Quantitative Reasoning. All students who are planning to registerfor Quantitative Reasoning(V55.01xx), or to satisfy this MAPrequirement by sufficiently highscore on a test, must take the Quan-titative Reasoning screening/exemp-tion test. III. Chemistry. A chemistry assessment examination is given toall freshmen who intend to takechemistry. IV . Biology. A biology assess- ment examination is available toentering students to determinewhether they have the qualificationsfor immediate placement into Molec-ular and Cell Biology I and II(V23.0021 and V23.0022). ANALYSIS OF ACADEMIC PROGRESS Via the Web ( www.albert.nyu.edu), by means of their personal identificationnumber (PIN), all students have access to their Analysis of AcademicProgress as generated by the Officeof the University Registrar. This is aStudent Information System (SIS)accounting of completed and remain-ing degree requirements. TRANSCRIPTS OF RECORD Requests for official transcriptsrequire the signature of the student requesting the transcript. Currently,we are not accepting requests fortranscripts by E-mail.

Students are able to access their grades at the end of each semester viaTorchTone using a Touch-Tone tele- phone and a personal identificationnumber (PIN). Instructions on howto use TorchTone are available in theOffice of the University Registrar.Students may also access grades viathe Web at www.albert.nyu.edu. ARREARS POLICY The University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold allinformation regarding the record ofany student who is in arrears in thepayment of tuition, fees, loans, orother charges (including charges forhousing, dining, or other activities orservices) for as long as any arrearsremain. Diploma ApplicationStudents may officially graduate in September, January, or May. TheCommencement ceremony for allschools is held in May. You mustapply for graduation by dialingTorchTone (212) 995-4747. In order to graduate in a specific semester,you must apply for graduation with-in the application deadline period indicated on the calendar. (Studentsmay view the graduation deadlinescalendar and general informationabout graduation in the Office of theUniversity Registrar's Web page atwww.nyu.edu/registrar. ) It is recom- mended that you apply for gradua-tion no later than the beginning of the semester in which you plan tocomplete all program requirements.If you do not successfully completeall academic requirements by the endof the semester, you must reapply forgraduation for the following cycle. 330 ACADEMIC POLICIESAcademic Standards and DisciplineACADEMIC STANDARDS The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards reviews studentrecords throughout the academic year.All of its actions are based on thegrades to date at the end of the term. Academic alert. Students with cumulative grade point averages of2.0 to 2.25 will receive an academic alert letter reflecting the committee'sspecific recommendations for achiev-ing an appropriate standard for acad-emic performance. Academic probation. Any stu- dent whose record is deemed unsatis-factory will be placed on academicprobation and will be so informed byletter. A record will be deemed unsatisfactory if, in any semester, thecumulative or semester grade pointaverage falls below 2.0 or if it fails toshow steady and substantial progresstoward the degree. Steady and sub-stantial progress toward the degreeentails the completion, with satisfac-tory grades, of more than half of theACADEMIC POLICIES 331courses (and points) for which a stu- dent registers in any semester. Inaddition, it entails satisfactoryprogress in the student's major. Failure to satisfy the conditions of probation will result in further acad-emic sanctions and possibly dismissalfrom the College. The conditionsusually require that the student (a)achieve a grade point average of atleast 2.0 during the term he or she ison probation, (b) not receive anygrade below a C or any grade of I,and (c) not withdraw from any coursewithout securing the permission ofthe Committee on UndergraduateAcademic Standards prior to thewithdrawal. Students on academicprobation are also required to have aspecial probation interview with anadviser in the College Advising Cen-ter in order to receive registrationclearance for the next semester. Morespecific requirements may beimposed. The Committee on Undergradu- ate Academic Standards may sum-mon students with unsatisfactoryrecords to discuss their problems andto determine whether and underwhat conditions they may continuein the College. In special circum-stances, the committee may recom-mend to the dean that students maybe granted or placed on leave for aperiod not to exceed two semesters. Students on academic probation may not engage in any extracurricu-lar activities (except for departmentalclubs) and may not hold office inthese clubs without the approval ofthe Committee on UndergraduateAcademic Standards. Students on academic probation should be aware that they are usuallyineligible for financial aid. Academic dismissal. Students who are dismissed from the Collegefor poor academic performance areinformed in writing by registeredmail. Students who have paid tuitionfor the next term at the time of dis-missal will receive a full refund oftuition and fees. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Community of the MindThe College is a \"community of themind.\" Its students, faculty, and staffall share the goal of pursuing truththrough free and open inquiry, andwe support one another's endeavorsin this regard. As in any community,membership comes with certainrights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is academic integrity.Cheating on an exam, falsifying data,or having someone else write a paperundermines others who are \"doing iton their own\"; it makes it difficult orimpossible to assess fairly a student'sinterest, aptitude, and achievement;and it diminishes the cheater, depriv-ing him or her of an education. Mostimportant, academic dishonesty is aviolation of the very principles uponwhich the academy is founded. Thus,when students enter the College, oneof the first things that they are askedto do is to sign a community com-pact, recognizing these principles ofacademic integrity. For this reasonalso, violations of these principles aretreated with the utmost seriousness. Procedures and Sanctions The penalty for academic dishonestyis severe. The following are the pro-cedures as approved by the Faculty ofArts and Science. 1.If a student cheats on an exam- ination or in laboratory work orengages in plagiarism, appropriatedisciplinary action should be taken.The department can take the follow-ing actions: a)The faculty member, with the approval of the director of under-graduate studies (director), mayreduce the student's grade or give thestudent an F in the course. b) If after lowering the grade or assigning an F the departmentbelieves a more severe penalty (i.e.,probation, suspension, expulsion) iswarranted, it can refer the case to thedean or his or her representative(associate dean for students) for fur-ther action. 2.In all cases of either (a) or (b), the director shall inform the depart-ment chair of any action in writingand send copies of this letter to thedean and to the student. The lettershall include the nature of theoffense, the penalty, and the right ofthe student to appeal such penalty. Acopy of the letter shall be kept in aconfidential chairman's file and notin the student's departmental file.The dean's office copy shall also bekept in a confidential file. (The pro-fessor and/or the director is encour-aged to meet with the student anddiscuss the nature of the offense andthe action taken.) 3.For cases involving a first offense at New York University, thedean shall send the student by regis-tered mail a notice that a second offense will result in a one-semestersuspension or a more severe penalty.(The student is also called in to dis-cuss the offense and review the con-sequences of the disciplinary action.) 4.For cases involving a second offense, the dean shall proceed as follows: a)Upon receiving a second direc- tor's letter concerning a given stu-dent, the dean shall convene a three-member ad hoc committee, with nomember being from the departmentinvolved, to examine the evidence.This ad hoc committee shall considerif there are reasonable grounds tobelieve that cheating/ plagiarism hasoccurred and if so, shall affirm thesuspension penalty. It shall report itsconclusion to the dean within threebusiness days. b)If the committee affirms the suspension, the dean shall send thestudent by registered mail the sus-pension letter within two businessdays of receiving the report. The let-ter shall advise the student of his orher right to appeal. The student shallhave two business days from the let-ter's delivery to request an appeal ofthe suspension as provided in Section5 (below). The suspension shall ordi-narily be stayed during the pendencyof appeal. c)If the committee does not affirm the suspension, the reportshall be kept on file for a one-yearperiod. 5.The student in all cases has the right to appeal to the dean. In theevent of an appeal, the dean shallelicit a written complaint from thefaculty member and proceed asdescribed above. DISCIPLINE Students are expected to familiarizethemselves and to comply with therules of conduct, regulations, andestablished practices of the Universi-ty and the College of Arts and Sci-ence, as stated in the Student Disci- pline Rules and Procedures of the Collegeof Arts and Science and as outlined in the chapter \"University and StudentGovernance, Policies, and Proce-dures\" in the NYU Student Guide. If pursuant to such rules, regulations,or practices, the withdrawal of a stu-dent is required before the end of theterm for which tuition has been paid,a refund will be made according tothe standard schedule for refunds.Below is a summary of the offenses for which students may be subject todisciplinary charges by the Commit-tee on Student Discipline: 1.False representation or forgery of academic documents 2.Deliberate destruction, theft, or unauthorized use of laboratorydata, research materials, computerresources, or university property 3.Disruption of an academic event 4.Actual or threatened violence or harassment Depending on the seriousness of the offense, the following penaltiesmay be imposed after a hearing by theCommittee on Student Discipline: Censure. Written reprimand for violation of specified regulation,including the possibility of moresevere disciplinary sanction in theevent of a subsequent violation ofany University regulation within aperiod of time stated in the letter ofreprimand.Disciplinary probation. Suspen- sion of privileges or exclusion fromparticipating in extracurricular Uni-versity activities as set forth by theCommittee on Student Discipline fora specified period of time. Suspension. Exclusion from classes as well as suspension of privi-leges and exclusion from other activi-ties as set forth in the notice of sus-pension for a definite period of time.A student who has been suspendedand who is found \"not guilty\" shallbe allowed full opportunity to makeup whatever work was missedbecause of the suspension. Dismissal. Term ination of stu- dent status for an indefinite period.The conditions for readmission, if anyare permitted, shall be stated by thecommittee in the order of dismissal. If, as a result of disciplinary action, the withdrawal of a student isrequired before the end of the termfor which tuition has been paid, arefund will be made according to thestandard schedule for refunds. STUDENT GRIEVANCE Students in the college of Arts andScience are referred to the StudentGrievance Procedure applicable to allthe schools of New York Universityas found in the NYU Student Guide. The College adheres to all articles ofthe Student Grievance Procedure asset forth in the University's Policies and Procedures section of the NYU Student Guide. UNIVERSITY POLICY ON PATENTS Students offered research opportuni- ties are reminded that inventionsarising from participation in suchresearch are governed by the Univer-sity's \"Statement of Policy onPatents,\" a copy of which may befound in the Faculty Handbook or obtained from the dean's office. 332 ACADEMIC POLICIESFACUL TY 333Faculty of Arts and Science Professors Doris R.
