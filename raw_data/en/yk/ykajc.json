Key Words: tic disorders, Tourette 's disorder, treatment, Practice Parameter This Parameter is intended to guide the practice of medical and mental health pro- fessionals that assess and treat youth with tic disorders including Tourette 's disorder. Child and adolescent psychiatrists are often not therst point of contact for the assessment and treatment of tic disorders, but more often areinvolved when comorbid conditions arise orwhen tics develop while treating another neuro- developmental disorder. Given the increased complexity in assessing the medical and psychi-atric well-being of children presenting with thesetic disorders and related comorbid conditions, aswell as recent developments in evidence-basedpharmacologic and behavioral treatments, a com-prehensive and developmentally sensitive Prac-tice Parameter is needed. The recommendations in this Parameter are applicable to children, adoles- cents, and young adults. METHODOLOGY Information and treatment recommendations usedin this Parameter were obtained by using the termsTourette 's Disorder, Tourette syndrome, orTic Disor- der, English Language, andHuman Studies to search by iterative bibliographic explora- tion of articles and reviews. Beginning with more inclusive and sensitive searches using the searchterms noted above, multiple free text and relevantmedical subject headings (MeSH terms), and thetime period from January 1, 1965 to March 29,2013, yielded 3,764 citations in Medline, 3,172 inPsycINFO, and 3 reviews in the Cochrane Library.The search was narrowed to the following desig- nations: Meta-Analysis (11 all, 2 child), Practice Guideline (5 all), Review (811 all, 296 child). The original search was also narrowed to the followingdesignations: Treatment and 0-18 (1206), and Treatment and 0-18 and RCT (87). We selected 149 publications and 25 RCTs that enrolled pediatricsubjects with an effective N /C2120 for careful ex- amination based on their weight in the hierarchy of evidence, the quality of individual studies, and their relevance to clinical practice. This PracticeParameter has been reviewed by acknowledgedexperts in the eld, and their comments and sug- gestions are included. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND COURSE A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmicmovement or vocalization. Tics can be simple(rapid, meaningless) or complex (more purpose-ful, elaborate, or orchestrated), and transient orchronic. Chronic tic disorders (CTD), includingTourette 's disorder (TD) and persistent motor or This article can be used to obtain continuing medical education (CME) at www.jaacap.org JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY VOLUME 52 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2013 www.jaacap.org 1341vocal tic disorder, are long-lasting neuropsychi- atric disorders, typically of childhood onset ( <18 years). They are characterized by multiple motor and/or vocal/phonic tics that wax and wane in severity and are often accompanied by an array ofbehavioral problems, including symptoms ofattention-de cit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).Persistent motor or vocal tic disorder has tics limited to each of those domains whereas TD has bothmotor and vocal tics at some point in the illness. 1 For either diagnosis, however, tics need to bepresent for at least one year. For tics present forless than 1 year, provisional tic disorder (formerly transient tic disorder) is used. Other speci ed tic disorder or unspeci ed tic disorder diagnoses are used for tic disorders that do not meet full criteriafor TD, persistent tic disorder, or provisional ticdisorder. In the case of the other speci ed tic disorder, clinicians specify the reason the full criteria were not met (e.g., atypical clinical pre-sentation or age of onset). 1 The clinical manifestations of CTD2may involve varying combinations of fluctuating tics. Simple motor tics are fast, brief movementsinvolving 1 or a few muscle groups, such as eyeblinking, shoulder shrugs, head jerks, or facial grimaces. Complex motor tics are sequentiallyand/or simultaneously produced relatively coordinated movements that can seem purpose- ful, such as tapping the bottom of the foot.Simple vocal/phonic tics are solitary, meaning-less sounds and noises such as grunting, snif ng, snorting, throat clearing, humming, coughing,barking, or screaming. Complex vocal/phonictics are linguistically meaningful utterances andverbalizations such as partial words (syllables), words out of context (Oh boy!), repeated sen- tences, coprolalia, palilalia, or echolalia. Sensoryphenomena that precede and trigger the urge totic have been described and are referred to aspremonitory urges. 2Patients with CTD can voli- tionally suppress tics for varying periods of time,particularly when external demands (e.g., socialpressure) exert their in fluence or when deeply engaged in a focused task or activity. For this reason, teachers and family often perceive thatwhen the child is not suppressing his/her tics thatthey are \"choosing \"to tic, that tics are intentional or are habits that can be easily stopped. Althoughparents may describe a rebound effect of increasedfrequency of tics at the end of the school day, TABLE 1 Repetitive Movements of Childhood Description Typical Disorders Where Present Tics Sudden rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic vocalization or motor movementTransient tics, TD, CTD Dystonia Involuntary, sustained, or intermittent muscle contractions that cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or bothDYT1 gene, Wilson 's, myoclonic dystonia, extrapyramidal symptoms due to dopamine blocking agents, Chorea Involuntary, random, quick, jerking movements, most often of the proximal extremities, that flow from joint to joint.

This gure may be an underestimate, given that most cases of tics aremild and may be misdiagnosed or unrecognizedby medical professionals. 2Prevalence rates for all tics (chronic or transient) range from 5.9% to 18%for boys and from 2.9% to 11% eral, CTD have a male preponderance, with agender ratio of at least 2:1 or higher. 11,20Tic dis- orders have been reported in numerous Asian, Middle Eastern, and European samples. Althoughethnic differences in prevalence are understudied, the Great Smoky Mountains Youth Study and theCDC study found higher rates in white compared to African American youth. 20,21 ETIOLOGY Although the pathophysiology of CTD is not entirely understood, there is evidence that motorprograms at both a cortical and subcortical levelare not properly modulated. Tics are proposedto be the result of dysfunctional cortico-striatal- thalamo-cortical circuits, prominently those sub- serving motor function. Magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) morphometric studies havedemonstrated a loss of the normal asymmetry ofthe caudate nucleus and, in some studies, otherregions as well. 22,23Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed a pattern of decreasedactivity in the basal ganglia, often with asym- metries that are not consistent from 1 study to the next (although a left-sided preponderance is oftennoted). 23Greater activity in sensorimotor regions (e.g., cortex, putamen) andreduced activity in the anterior cingulate andcaudate during spontaneous tics have suggesteddecient engagement of circuits that inhibit either tic behaviors or the sensorimotor urges. 24 Other studies have revealed that during the performance of a motor task, a larger area ofcortex was recruited in subjects with TD thanin controls. 25Transcranial magnetic stimulation revealed that the cortical silent period wasshortened and intracortical inhibition reduced;abnormalities that were particularly prominentwhen tics were present. 26Motor threshold and peripheral motor excitability, however, did not differ from that of controls.26During tic sup- pression, there were signi cant changes in signal intensity in the basal ganglia and thalamusand interconnected cortical regions. Thesechanges in signal intensity were inversely corre-lated with the severity of tic symptoms. 27,28Male predominance in CTD and childhood OCD may be due to in fluences of sex hormones on the neurodevelopment of these cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits, as re flected by a study of anti-androgens in the treatment of TD. 29 Relatives of those with TD have repeatedly been shown to be at an increased risk for devel-oping tic disorders. Family studies suggest a 10-to 100 fold increase in the risk of CTD among rst-degree relatives compared to rates in the general population. 30Twin studies also support a JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY VOLUME 52 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2013 www.jaacap.org 1343AACAP OFFICIAL ACTIONgenetic 31,32 not yielded de nitive sus- ceptibility genes for TD; results of a large-scale,recent association study revealedthat reached assays and analysis of copynumber variations have shown overlap with other neuropsychiatric disorders, and affect a small percentage of those with TD. 34A para- metric linkage study has ignited interest in histi-dine decarboxylase that has implications forhistaminergic and dopaminergic signaling in thestriatum. 34,35 Tics appear to be sensitive to an array of envi- ronmental stimuli such as temperature changes,36 stress,37illness,38and fatigue that can exacerbate tics. Some cases of tic disorders have been pro-posed to result from an infection-triggered auto-immune process similar to that of Sydenhamchorea (SC). 39Swedo coined the term PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disordersassociated with streptococcus) to describe cases ofchildhood-onset OCD and/or tics that resemble SC characterized by an acute onset following a strep- tococcal infection, accompanying neurologicalsigns, and an episodic course. More recently, PANS(pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome)has been used to describe a subtype of sudden-onset OCD (tics are not a required feature) inchildren, as a link to prior streptococcal infectionsis not always evident. 40In addition to a diagnosis of OCD and/or tics, children with PANS/ PANDAS were frequently observed to havesymptoms of separation anxiety, nightmares, per-sonality change, oppositional behaviors, and dete-rioration in mathematics skills and handwriting.Increasingly, studies suggest that, in some cases, aprior history of infections may increase risk fordeveloping tic disorder, although this remains controversial. 41 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Other repetitive movements may mimic tics, such as those in stereotypies, myoclonus, dystonia, andchorea (Table 1). 42,43Perhaps the most common difculty for pediatric providers is differentiating repetitive behaviors that are more stereotypic than is typical of tics. Although stereotypies may closely resemble tics, stereotypies are typically rhythmicmovements and do not demonstrate the change in body location or movement type over time that istypical of tics. Stereotypies are observed in autism spectrum disorders and in stereotypic movement disorders. They can co-occur with tic disorders.The context, onset, type, and course of the move-ments should help to differentiate the movementtypology. In addition, stereotypy lacks a premon-itory urge (i.e., many children say that they are\"thinking, \"or parents report that the stereotypy occurs when the child is excited). Compulsions may be dif cult to differentiate from tics motivated by \"just right \"feelings, as many patients describe a sensory component thatthe compulsion alleviates. Similarly, compulsivetics with strong premonitory urges will overlap inpresentation with compulsions, making it dif - cult to distinguish a tic from a compulsion inthose patients who clearly have OCD and tics. 44 Age may confound a child 's ability to introspec- tively describe symptoms. Tics may be idiopathic or may result from a variety of medications or general medical condi-tions. Some of the substances reported to poten-tially worsen tics include stimulants, selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), lamo-trigine, and cocaine. 45If tics develop in close temporal relationship to the initiation or dosage increase of a substance and then remit within afew weeks of stopping the substance, a causalrelationship is possible. The possibility thatstimulants may trigger tics in a child without aprior history of tics has been a long-time concernof many clinicians and families (see the ADHDPractice Parameter 46for a brief review). Howev- er, there is no scienti c evidence in controlled studies that stimulants increase tics.47 Tics should be differentiated from a variety of developmental and benign movement disorders(e.g., benign paroxysmal torticollis, Sandifer 's syndrome, benign jitteriness of newborns, orshuddering attacks). 48Furthermore, tics may present in various neurological diseases.48Pa- tients with tics that occur in the context of declining motor or cognitive function should bereferred for further neurological assessment. Ex-amples of possible general medical conditionsinclude CNS insult that may occur with a tumor,trauma, anoxia, or neurological disease pantothenate of frontal - subcortical brain lesions). 49However, it is rare for tics to be the only manifestation in those diseases. JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY 1344 www.jaacap.org VOLUME 52 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2013AACAP OFFICIAL ACTIONCOMORBID PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS In clinical samples of CTD, co-occurring psychiatric disorders are common.44Frequently, patients with CTD will meet criteria for 2 or more conditions that are often viewed by the patient and family asmore problematic than the tics per se. 50 Obsessive-Compulsive DisorderThe association between CTD (especially TD) tobe bidirectional, with 20% to 60% of TD patients meeting criteria for OCD, and 20% to 38% of youth with OCD reporting comorbid tics. 51 However, youth with comorbid CTD and OCDmay not have tic or OCD severity scores as highas do youth with a CTD or OCD alone. 52Delin- eating OCD symptoms from tic symptoms cansometimes be a challenge, especially when thechild presents with evening up, \"just right, \"or cit/Hyperactivity Disorder Attention-de cit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) co-occurs in as many as 50% of all childhood CTDcases 53; however, estimates in clinically referred patients suggest that rates of ADHD among in-dividuals with TD may be as high as 60% to 80%. 54Even in mild cases of CTD, the incidence of ADHD is 7 to 8 times greater than in thegeneral population. 55The co-occurrence of CTD and ADHD is often accompanied by disruptivebehaviors, including low frustration tolerance,outbursts, noncompliance, and aggression as wellas learning disorders and academic dif culties. 56 Together, these disorders may worsen social adjustment and academic achievement57beyond the effects of CTD alone. In a study of 138 youthwith CTD (age range, 5 -18 years), problems, with those hav-ing comorbid 4-foldincreased risk dif culty. 58Notably, co-occurrence may be in flated because of referral bias\u2014youth with comorbidities may be more likely to seek treatment. Learning Disabilities Studies of children with TD demonstrate highrates of school-related problems, 59particularly in those with ADHD symptoms.58Erenberg et al. revealed that 36% of 200 pediatric TD cases hadsome degree of academic dif culties. 60Although most patients with tics possess average intelli- gence,61learning disabilities (LD) are common inyouth with chronic tics (approximately 23%),59,62 especially among those with comorbid ADHD.63 Male gender and a history of perinatal problems also increase the risk of LD in youth with tics.59 The impact on learning and academics because of poor sleep quality that is frequently reported inyouth with TD has not been fully explored. 64 Neuropsychological impairment in youth withCTD may be attributed to comorbid ADHD 65 rather than to the presence of a tic disorder.However, there is some evidence that even after controlling for ADHD, youth with CTD may have increased problems on tasks of executivefunctioning, attention/concentration, and visual-motor decoding (in contrast to healthy controlsand youth with OCD). 66Fine motor de cits have been implicated to predict adult tic severity in asmall study. 12 Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Some pa- tients with tic disorders will display symptoms found on the autism spectrum.67Careful assess- ment to determine symptom onset, course, lan-guage development, and social ability is neededto differentiate rst whether the child has primary TD, primary ASD, or ASD with co-occurringtics. Burd et al. found that 4.6% of youth with TD had a comorbid ASD and that youth with TD and ASD were more likely to be male and had an increased number of other comorbidities. 68 EVIDENCE BASE FOR PRACTICE PARAMETERS In this Parameter, recommendations for best assessment and treatment practices are stated inaccordance with the strength of the underlyingempirical and/or clinical support, as follows: /C15Clinical Standard [CS] is applied to recom- mendations that are based on rigorous empir-ical evidence (e.g., meta-analyses, systematicreviews, individual randomized controlledtrials) and/or overwhelming consensus /C15Clinical Guideline [CG] is applied to recom- mendations that are based on strong empiricalevidence (e.g., non-randomized controlled tri-als, cohort studies, case-control studies) and/orstrong consensus /C15Clinical Option [OP] is applied to recommen- dations that are based on emerging empiricalevidence (e.g., uncontrolled trials or case se- ries/reports) or clinical opinion, but lack strong empirical evidence and/or strong clinicalconsensus JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY VOLUME 52 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2013 www.jaacap.org 1345AACAP OFFICIAL ACTION/C15Not Endorsed [NE] is applied to practices that are known to be ineffective or contraindicated The strength of the empirical evidence is rated in descending order as follows: /C15[rct] Randomized, controlled trial is applied to studies in which subjects are randomlyassigned to 2 or more treatment conditions /C15[ct] Controlled trial is applied to studies in which subjects are non-randomly assigned to 2or more treatment conditions /C15[ut] Uncontrolled trial is applied to studies in which subjects are assigned to 1 treatmentcondition /C15[cs] Case series/report is applied to a case series or a case report RECOMMENDATIONS Assessment Recommendation 1. The psychiatric assessment should involve routine screening for unusualmovements, stereotypies, tics, and family his-tory of tic disorders. [CS] Parents and youth should be asked about unusual movements or vocalizations during theinitial assessment. Screening for abnormal mo-vements before initiation of any psychotropic medications and assessing previous psychotropic medication exposure/dosage changes is impor-tant when evaluating for abnormal movementsin children. Many families are unaware thatfrequent snif ng, coughing, or blinking may be indicative of tics, attributing these behaviors toallergies or visual problems. Careful assessmentof the timing, triggers, and characteristics may help differentiate tics from another medical problem. If the clinician is unsure, referral to apediatric specialist (allergist, pulmonologist, andophthalmologist) is warranted. Commonly usedparent-rated behavioral screening tools suchas the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 69and the 90-item version of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham (SNAP)70include tic-speci c questions. Recommendation 2. If screening is positive, a more thorough assessment for tic disordersshould be conducted. [CS] If the clinician 's screening receives endorse- ment of the possibility of tics or the clinicianobserves tics during the evaluation, a more sys-tematic assessment for tics will be needed, including the age of onset, types of tics, tic fre- quency, alleviating and aggravating factors, anda family history of tics. Rating scales speci cf o r tics may be used. Parent report rating scalesfor type, severity and impairment of tics include theMotor tic, Obsessions and compulsions, Vocal tic Evaluation Survey (MOVES), 71Tic Self-Report Scale,72Tourette 's Disorder Scale,73Parent Tic Questionnaire (PTQ)74(freely available at : http:// www.uab.edu/ot/practice/tourette-syndrome-clinic/parent-tic-questionnaire) and Child Tourette 's Disorder Impairment Scale -Parent Version. 75For clinician-rated tic severity, the most commonly used is the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS),76 which assesses the nature of motor and phonic tics over the previous week. This scale hasexcellent clinicometric properties and treatmentsensitivity has been documented. 76-78TheTourette Syndrome Severity Scale (TSSS)79contains 5 ordinal scales with differing ranges and item weights thatfocus on TD-related social impairment. The Tourette Syndrome Global Scale (TSGS) 80assesses the frequency and impairment of simple andcomplex tics, as well as common comorbidproblems (e.g., behavioral problems, functionalimpairment). Short, structured videotape pro-tocols have been used to count tics, 81although issues have been raised with their scoring struc-tures, feasibility, and ease of implementation. Recommendation 3. The assessment for tic dis- orders should involve a careful examination forgeneral medical condition or substance etiol-ogies. [CS] A medical workup should be considered for new-onset tics or tic-like movements. Certainclinical features such as the sudden onset of se- vere tics, atypical tics, or mental status abnor- malities suggestive of an organic process (i.e.,disorientation, inability to copy gures or to draw a clock) should prompt further medicalinvestigation. Basic laboratory measures such as a hemo- gram, renal/hepatic function panel, thyroidpanel, and ferritin, along with urine drug screen for adolescents, are reasonable. For new sudden (overnight) -onset or severe symptom exacerba- tion, the provider may assess for co-occurringinfection with diagnostic tests that indicateacute illness (e.g., culture, rapid viral tests). 41 EEG and brain imaging are not routinely rec- ommended and are reserved for cases with otherneurological ndings. In cases with unusual or complex presentations, additional specialty consultation (e.g., pediatric neurology, genetics)may be helpful.

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY 1350 www.jaacap.org VOLUME 52 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2013AACAP OFFICIAL ACTIONRecommendation 4. The assessment for tic dis- orders should involve a careful examination for comorbid psychiatric conditions. [CS] Any assessment of a child or adolescent that reveals the presence of tics should promptassessment for common externalizing and in-ternalizing psychiatric disorders, and current so-cial functioning along with any developmentaldelays. Given the frequent comorbidity of CTDwith other psychiatric conditions, 82incorporating measures for comorbid conditions into the assessment of youth is frequently warranted,depending on the clinical presentation. Althoughthose individuals with uncomplicated CTD areless likely to present with neurocognitive de cits, those with comorbid conditions (especiallyADHD) have signi cant risk of educational struggles and in most cases should be consid- ered for educational testing. 66,83A complete discussion of these comorbid conditions isoutside the scope of this paper; thus the reader isreferred to the AACAP Practice Parameters 84for each disorder. TREATMENT Recommendation 5. Education regarding CTD should be provided regarding expectations for course and prognosis, and treatmentplanning should consider classroom-based accommodations. [CS] Psychoeducation should be provided to the youth and family regarding tics including com-mon symptom presentations, risks related to co-occurring conditions, the typical course acrossthe lifetime, prognosis (25% with tics into adult-hood), and treatment options. 9,10The youth 's typical exacerbating (e.g., illness, stress, heat) andalleviating factors (e.g., rest, listening to music) should be reviewed. Families (and clinicians) can nd an abundance of information related to CTD that is especially produced for clinicians, parents,youth, or educators (including information onschool-based accommodations and local advo-cacy groups) on the Tourette Syndrome Asso-ciation website (www.tsa-usa.org) or on theTourette Syndrome \"Plus\"website (www.tour ettesyndrome.net/). Classroom accommodations are often neces- sary to help the child best access his or hercurricula, and an Individualized Education Plan(IEP) or 504 plan may be necessary. Parentsshould be guided to information on tic disordersdesigned for teachers and school personnel.Approximately 72% of children with tic disorders receive some form of accommodation from their teachers, with the most common being ignoringTABLE 3 Tic Disorder Medications, Doses, Uses, and Comments Medication Starting Dose (mg) Usual dose range (mg/d) Comments Haloperidol 0.25 e0.5 1 e4 FDA approval for TD, EPS concerns; reports of anxiety flares Pimozide 0.5 e1.0 2 e8 FDA approval for TD, ECG monitoring, 2D6 pharmacogenomic testing e10 10 e40 Current available doses above those used in RCT Olanzapine 2.5 e5.0 2.5 e12.5 Metabolic effects are Quetiapine 25 Metabolic effects Aripiprazole 1.0 e2.5 2.5 No of in OCD Sulpiride 50 e100 (2 mg/kg) 100 e500 Not larger pediatric (N \u00bc189) Tiapride 50 e100 (2 mg/kg) 100 e500 Not approved in USA Tetrabenazine 25 37.5 e150 Sedation, weight gain, depression, recommended Clonidine 0.025 e0.05 0.1 e0.4 Sedation, short acting, most helpful for those with initial insomnia, ADHD Clonidine ER 0.1 0.1 e0.4 FDA approved for ADHD Guanfacine 0.5 e1.0 1.0 e4.0 Support especially for tics \u00feADHD Guanfacine ER 1.0 1 e4 FDA approved for ADHD Clonazepam 0.25 0.25 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY VOLUME 52 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2013 www.jaacap.org 1351AACAP OFFICIAL ACTIONof the tics and permission to leave the room as needed.85 Recommendation 6. Treatment for CTD shouldaddress the levels of impairment and distresscaused by the tics as well as any comorbidconditions. [CS] The decision to treat tics is a sensitive one, made in conjunction with the child and family based on the level of impairment and distresscaused by the tics. If the tics are mild in severity,there may be no need for intervention after psy-choeducation is provided. Often children andfamilies cope well with tics of mild to moderateseverity until the child enters the pre-teen agegroup or middle school, at which time teasing from peers may prompt the child and family to request intervention. Potential adverse eventsassociated with treatment interventions should becarefully weighed. When establishing the treatment hierarchy, one should begin with the most impairing con-dition. In many circumstances, it is the comorbidcondition, and not the tic disorder, that causes the most impairment in functioning or has the most impact on quality of life. Frequently the initialinterventions address target symptoms from acomorbid condition, with only ongoing moni-toring of tics. Recommendation 7. Behavioral interventions for CTD should be considered when tics causeimpairment, are moderate in severity, or ifbehavioral-responsive psychiatric comorbiditiesare present. [CG] Behavioral intervention offers a non- pharmacological alternative to tic treatment. Themajority of those with tics experience them assomewhat voluntary. 86In addition, many in- dividuals with tics describe a distinct aversivesensation or a buildup of tension that is relieved bytic expression. 87,88Termed a premonitory urge,86,88 this pattern of tension buildup and release is similar to the relationship between obsessions and compulsions in OCD, but with a sensory triggerrather than a cognitive one. 89In a similar manner, tic expression eliminates the aversive premonitorysensation just as completing the compulsion elim-inates the obsession, suggesting that tics aremaintained, in part, by negative reinforcement (i.e.,removal of an unpleasant stimulus). 87 The behavioral intervention with the strongest empirical support relies on this formulation andis called habit reversal training (HRT). Typicalcomponents of HRT include awareness training, building a competing response and social sup-port. HRT has been shown to have ef cacy in youth with moderate or greater tic severity compared to those not receiving HRT. 90[rct]In that randomized trial comparing HRT to anattention control in 25 youth with tic disorders,HRT was associated with a 50% response rate,30% reduction in tic severity, and approximately50% reduction in tic-related impairment. 90[rct]In the HRT group, 46% were classi ed as treatment responders versus only 25% of those in the attention control arm. A therapist guide andparent workbooks for HRT are available. 91 The multisite, randomized controlled Com- prehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics(C-BIT), co-sponsored by the Tourette SyndromeAssociation (TSA) and National Institutes ofHealth, evaluated an HRT-based protocol versus a psychosocial control. 92[rct]In the C-BIT trial, 126 youth with TD were randomized in the control condition; thepercent reduction in tic symptom severity was51% and 30% for HRT and control respectively (between-groups effect size \u00bc0.64). In addition to HRT, the C-BIT intervention included ses-sions focused on the functional assessment oftics. These sessions aimed to help parents toidentify factors that sustained or exacerbatedtics. The biological etiology of tics was empha-sized; however, the role of environmental op-erant factors such as escape and attention were highlighted as well. The functional analysis involved identi cation of antecedents and con- sequences in fluencing tics, followed by the implementation of behavioral strategies to miti-gate tic severity/frequency. 91The C-BIT inter- vention also included 93In this study, 87% of those receiving HRT were also taking medications. A pilot trial suggests C-BIT delivered by telemed- icine can be effective.94[rct] Behavioral treatment may also address less adaptive coping strategies (e.g., avoidance,withdrawal) that develop secondary to tics andcontribute to heightened impairment. In someyouth, self-concept can become overly centeredon having tics rather than focusing on their areas of strength and resilience. The unfortunate consequence of this adaptation to illness (e.g.,lingering dependence on parents) can compound JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY 1352 www.jaacap.org VOLUME 52 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2013AACAP OFFICIAL ACTIONthe sense of marginalization. Skill-based thera- pies that target distorted cognitions and avoid-ance should be bene cial in improving quality of life and reducing sustained reliance on problematic coping mechanisms. There is pre-liminary support for structured parent trainingto address disruptive behavior problems inyouth with chronic tics. 95[rct]This study enrolled 24 youth with tics and at least moderate disrup-tive behavior symptoms. Seven of the 11 youthreceiving 10 sessions of structured behavioral parent training were considered responders, compared to 2 of 12 controls. There are no systematic studies to date co- mparing HRT to medication or combined thera-pies in youth. HRT is nonetheless an excellentexample of a therapy that offers the advantageof having lower risks compared to metabolicadverse effects of medications. Severe tics or tics whose character interferes with the child 's ability to function in school may require medicationintervention at an earlier time or combinedmedication and HRT. In all cases, the treatingclinician must balance tic severity and treatmentefcacy with the adverse effect pro le. Recommendation 8. Medications for CTD should be considered for moderate to severe tics causing severe impairment in quality of lifeor when medication responsive psychiatriccomorbidities are present that target both ticsymptoms and comorbid conditions. [CG] Large, multi-site, randomized, placebo- controlled trials for the treatment of tic disor-ders are few in number, especially in pediatric populations (Table 2). 77,78,92,96-117Most medica- tion treatment studies target moderate to severetic severity, resulting in symptom reduction butnot remission. Despite the limited number ofstudies, however, medi cal treatments for tics should have evidence-based support wheneverfeasible. 7T h eo n l y2F o o da n dD r u gA d m i n i s - tration (FDA) -approved medications to treat TD are haloperidol and pimozide; however, most clinicians use atypical antipsychoticsbefore these agents (Table 3). Recent ap-proaches and suggested dosing. 118,119A clinician survey found that the most common medicationsused to treat tics are risperidone followed byclonidine then by aripiprazole, 120and another survey found aripiprazole to be most commonly used, followed by clonidine followed byrisperidone. 121a-2 Agonists a-Adrenergic medications have demonstrated an size of 0.5 for the amelioration oftics. 103[rct],107[rct]Some prescribers antipsychotic medica- tions because of the adverse effect pro le, which is perceived as less serious than with anti- psychotic medications. A recent meta-analysisfound that trials that enrolled subjects with ticsand ADHD demonstrated a medium-to-largeeffect in reducing tic severity (0.68), whereas trialsthat excluded subjects with ADHD demonstr-ated only a small, nonsigni norepi- nephrine release that may diminish tics. The startingdose is 0.05 mg per day with gradual increases up to0.3 mg per day to control tics often administered individed doses 3 to 4 times per day. The mainadverse effect limiting its use is sedation. 123A transdermal patch of clonidine is available, as isa sustained release oral formulation that was recently approved for the treatment of ADHD, 124 but has not been studied for use in children and adolescents with CTD. Compared to clonidine, guanfacine appears to bind more selectively to postsynaptic to enhance functioning showed ef cacy for tic sever- ity.103[rct]A sustained release formulation has been approved for ADHD126and trials for CTD are underway. Antipsychotic Medications Several conventional antipsychotic medications have been shown to be effective for decreasing tic severity, although these studies enrolled primar-ily adults. Haloperidol has been shown to beeffective in several randomized controlled trials(RCTs); however, up to 84% of patients haveexperienced adverse events with roughly one-third having extrapyramidal side effects. 99A haloperidol and pimozide more effec- tive at reducing total number of tics and tobe better tolerated as compared with haloper-idol. 99[rct]Although much lower doses are needed when using typical or atypical antipsychotics forCTD than for bipolar or psychotic disorders, acareful risk/bene t assessment and adverse effect monitoring are recommended. Concerns about adverse effects have led to studies with the atypical antipsychotics for the JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY VOLUME 52 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2013 www.jaacap.org 1353AACAP OFFICIAL ACTIONtreatment of TD. The best studied atypical anti- psychotic to date is risperidone with 4 randomizedcontrolled trials 78[rct],102[rct],105[rct]; however only 1 of the trials was conducted exclusively with chil- dren and adolescents, showing risperidone to be aneffective treatment. 77[rct]Active comparator trials (clonidine and pimozide versus risperidone) foundrisperidone at least as effective. In pediatric subjects,common adverse effects were weight gain andmild to moderate sedation. No clinically sign - cant extrapyramidalsymptoms in pediatric patients were observed. 77,78Effective doses for patients with TD ranged from 1.0 to 3.5 mg per day.78 In an RCT of ziprasidone, a 39% decrease on the YGTSS scale compared to 16% for placebowas observed. 101[rct]No differences were found in vital signs or ECG measures. Despite those re-sults, concerns about ECG changes persist. Aprospective study evaluating ECG changes in pediatric patients taking ziprasidone for TD, OCD, or a pervasive developmental disorder re-ported a mean increase in the QTc interval frombaseline to peak of 28 /C626 milliseconds, leading to a recommendation of obtaining screeningECGs read by experienced cardiologists ifconsidering ziprasidone treatment. 127 Several open-label or pilot trials been published128[ut],129[ut],130[ut],131[ct]and 1 double-blind crossover with olanzapine andpimozide. 132[rct]Only 2 of these studies were with pediatric patients.129[ut],131[ct]In these trials, although olanzapine resulted in a decrease in bothtics and aggression, there was a mean increase inweight of 9 to 12 pounds. 129,131Thus, despite potential reduction of tics and co-occurring symptoms, the risk of weight gain and meta- bolic effects suggests that olanzapine should notbe the rst line medication for CTD. A recent open-label trial with aripiprazole f o u n da5 2 %r e d u c t i o ni nt h eK o r e a nv e r s i o nof the YGTSS with 79% of patients reported tobe\"much improved \"or\"very much improved \" on the CGI-I. 133[ut]T h em e a nd o s ei nt h i ss t u d y was 9.8 mg per day; the most common adverse effects were hypersomnia (37.5%), nausea(20.8%), and headache (16.6%). In open trialso fy o u t hw i t hC T D ,t i ci m p r o v e m e n tw a sobserved at lower doses with mean weight gainof 2 to 5 pounds. 134[ut],135[ut]Further double- blind controlled trials are underway. Treatment in Context of Comorbidity Comorbid OCD. The ef cacy of pharmacotherapy for OCD in pediatric populations has beendemonstrated in several controlled trials with clomipramine and SSRIs (see AACAP Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder136). Some studies suggest that the presence of tics may yield a less robust response to SSRIs. In aresponse rate analysis from a large pediatricparoxetine trial, the response rate for patientswith a diagnosis of OCD only (75%) was signi - cantly greater chopathology, (56%), (39%). 137[rct]Similarly, individuals with comorbid tics in the PediatricOCD Treatment Study (POTS) did not respond aswell to sertraline as did those without tics. 138The use of an antipsychotic with SSRI therapy mayresult in additional bene t for those with OCD and tics. A meta-analysis of the adult literature examining the use of antipsychotic augmentation in the treatment of OCD showed that the NNT forOCD and tics was 2.3 compared to 5.9 for thosewith OCD alone. 139One open-label study re- ported improvement in OCD severity when ari-piprazole was used to treat tic disorders. 134[ut] Comorbid ADHD. Treatment of ADHD in the context of tic disorders can, at times, be chal- lenging because of concerns of worsening ticseverity. 140For children with ADHD, recent studies have demonstrated that tics are not uni-versally increased by stimulant medication 47,140; however the FDA package insert for stimulantsdoes list tics as a contraindication. No differenceswere observed in worsening of tics in children with comorbid ADHD and a CTD taking methyl- phenidate, clonidine, or with about 20%in each group showing an exacerbation. 107[rct]The presence of tics did appear to limit the maximumdose achieved. Other options are the use of atom-oxetine with reported bene ts on tic symptoms as well as ADHD 110; however, occasional reports of tics worsening exist.141,142Guanfacine has been shown to have a clinically relevant effect size for both ADHD and tic symptoms.103[rct]TCAs have shown bene t for ADHD with comorbid tics,106[rct],143[rct]but cardiovascular risks likely outweigh the bene t of this option. Please refer to the Cochrane Database review for a detailedoverview. 140 Comorbid Mood/Anxiety (Non-OCD). This area is understudied, but with TDhave co-occurring mood and non-OCD anxietydisorders. 51Currently, the best approach is to use evidence based treatment for the co-occurringmood or anxiety disorder. JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY 1354 www.jaacap.org VOLUME 52 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2013AACAP OFFICIAL ACTIONExplosive/Rage Symptoms. Anger and rage out- bursts are not uncommon among patients withtics, with a survey of clinicians estimating 37% of their tic patients present with anger control problems. 144In some cases, OCD symptoms or sensory issues (too hot, too noisy) may serve astriggers, and other times anger is due to poorfrustration tolerance. Behavioral therapies thataddress antecedents and anger management maybe useful. In clinic-referred tic samples, up to 80%of youth are estimated to have co-occurring disruptive behavior disorders. 54,143There are no controlled pharmacological studies in youth withtic disorders and aggressive/anger outbursts.Although there are preliminary data for olanza-pine, 129[ut],131[ct]aripiprazole145[cs]and risperi- done,146[cs]in reducing disruptive behavior disorder symptoms, these ndings should be interpreted cautiously given signi cant design limitations, small samples, relatively weak effects, and risks associated with these medications.Similarly, a reduction in rage attacks wasobserved after an 8-week open trial of paroxe-tine, 147[ut]but the age range was markedly vari- able (n \u00bc45, aged 6 -55 years) and self-report was used to assess rage. Recommendation 9. Deep brain stimulation, repetitive magnetic stimulation, special diets,and dietary supplements lack empirical supportfor the treatment of CTD/TD and are not rec-ommended. [NE] Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical treatment approach that may hold bene tf o ra few treatment-refractory adults; however, few cases have been reported of youth receiving DBS for severe, treatment-resistant tics. At this time,DBS guidelines have advised that this procedureshould not be conducted in individuals less than25 years of age outside of a research setting,because the severity of TD often diminishes inlate teen/early adulthood. 148[ut] An open-label study examining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in youth with TD has been conducted with noreported adverse outcomes. 149Small studies examining rTMS in the treatment of adults withTD have shown negative results. 150[ct],151[ct]Very few youth have received rTMS and this treatmentoption should be considered preliminary untillarger blinded studies have resolved issues regarding the safety, ethics, and long term impact on development. 152Notably, neurosurgery and neurostimulation should be considered only inrefractory cases, and clinicians should carefully weigh the risks and bene ts for these experi- mental procedures before recommending them for use in pediatric patients. Many parents have found purported therapies (e.g., special diets, supplements, brushing) via theInternet or support groups. Although many pa-tients with tic disorders do use complementaryand alternative medical therapies, 153support for this practice is not currently at the evidence basedlevel. 118,154,155Some therapies, such as high-dose vitamin B6 or St. John 's wort, have the potential for adverse outcomes or interactions with psy-choactive medications and are not recommendeduntil studied appropriately in children. 156 PARAMETER LIMITATIONS AACAP Practice Parameters are developed to assist clinicians in psychiatric decision making.

Parameter development is an iterative process between the primary author(s), theCQI, topic experts, and representatives from multiple constituent groups, including AACAP membership, relevant AACAP Committees, the AACAP Assembly of Regional Organizations, and the AACAPCouncil. Details of the Parameter development process can be accessed on the AACAP website. Responsibility for Parameter content and review rests with the author(s), the CQI, the CQI Consensus Group, and the AACAP Council. The AACAP develops both patient-oriented and clinician-oriented Practice Parameters. Patient-oriented Parameters provide recommen- dations to guide clinicians toward best assessment and treatmentpractices. Recommendations are based on the critical appraisal of empirical evidence (when available) and clinical consensus (when not), and are graded according to the strength of the empirical and clinicalsupport. Clinician-oriented Parameters provide clinicians with the in- formation (stated as principles) needed to develop practice-based skills. Although empirical evidence may be available to support JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY VOLUME 52 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2013 www.jaacap.org 1355AACAP OFFICIAL ACTIONcertain principles, principles are primarily based on clinical consensus.
