How to Keep Your Kitchen Safe and Healthy While we often hear about the importance of a healthy diet, have you ever considered what kind of toxins and chemicals might be lurking in your food because of the tools you used to prepare it? Not all cookware is created equal in terms of safety. This week we will explain how to keep your food and your family free from common toxins found in certain kitchen essentials. Let's first get clear on which kitchen essentials may be causing the problems. Non-stick (Teflon): Pots and pans labelled as non-stick or Teflon often contain polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE, which is what makes the pan non-stick. PTFE is a known carcinogen and can last for years in our bodies. More research is needed to know the long-term effects of exposure, but the Environmental Working Group has found connections with exposure to PTFE and obesity, thyroid issues, kidney and testicular cancer. Aluminum: The aluminum found in aluminum foil and other cookwares/appliances can leach this neurotoxin into our bodies. While aluminum is economical, exposure inside the body has been connected with neurological problems, autoimmune conditions and Alzheimer's disease. Copper: It is important to get some copper in our diets, but we recommend obtaining it from other sources rather than using copper cookware because over time, frequent use of copper pots and pans can lead to elevated levels of copper in your body. Too much copper causes an imbalance of zinc, which can impair your immune and thyroid function. Ceramics: There is certainly properly made ceramic cookware out on the market, but many ceramics that are mass-manufactured can leach toxic metals into the body. Do you have ceramic cookware you are worried about? An easy way to check their safety is by using [3M's Lead Check Swabs](https://www.amazon.com/3M-717834209102DUPE-LeadCheck-Swabs-8-Pack/dp/B008BK15PU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&keywords=3m%20lead%20check%20swabs&qid=1494879299&sr=8-1). Now that we've covered the culprits, we will dive into the cookware we found to be the safest for frequent use. Bare Cast Iron: Cast iron cookware is essentially non toxic, non-stick, and usable for both stove-top and oven cooking. It adds a bit of iron to your food so anyone with an overabundance of iron should be mindful of use. When seasoned and cared for correctly, a cast iron pan becomes non-stick. [Here](https://www.lodgemfg.com/discover/cleaning-and-care/cast-iron/how-clean-cast-iron)is an easy how-to for caring for Enamel Coated Cast Iron: Enamel coated cast-iron is bare cast iron coated with an enamel that is non-toxic and durable for many years. While it may be a bit pricier than bare cast iron, it requires less maintenance and offers more design options. Glass: Glass cookware is also completely non-toxic and fairly economical. One common brand is Pyrex, but many others exist as well for food storage, oven, and stovetop use. Stainless Steel: Stainless steel cookware is also 100% non-toxic and is extremely durable and the most economical option of the four we listed. While it is not non-stick, enough oil can make it so.
