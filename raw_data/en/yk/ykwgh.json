The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has made progr ess in expanding surveillance of infections from certain antibiotic -resistant bacteria in the United States and abroad but faces several challenges. 2001 -2017 Cumulative Spread of One Type of Highly Resistant Bacteria in the United States Note: This fig ure tracks a type of carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), which, according to CDC, is a \"nightmare bacteria\" resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Shading indicates CDC confirmed the presence of these bacteria within that state in that y ear or a previous one. CDC faces challenges in conducting surveillance for antibiotic resistance due to the limited data it is able to collect through various surveillance systems. For example, CDC's primary surveillance system for gonorrhea \u2014which CDC classified as an urgent antibiotic resistance threat affecting over half a million patients annually \u2014currently tracks only an estimated 1 to 2 percent of all U.S. cases and only in males. CDC has not fully evaluated the representativeness of the gonorrhea surv eillance system's results. However, it could do so, for example, by comparing the trends in their limited sample population with trends it can establish in the overall U.S. population via additional studies. Such an evaluation could give CDC more confidenc e that the system's data accurately reflect national trends. Federal agencies have taken steps to advance the development and use of diagnostic tests to identify antibiotic -resistant bacterial infections, but these efforts have limitations. For example, ag encies have conducted some studies to establish whether testing can lead to positive health care outcomes, such as reduced rates of antibiotic -resistant infections. However, more such studies are needed, according to experts and agency officials. Without i nformation to guide test usage, clinicians may not be able to select appropriate treatments for their patients. One reason for the insufficient number of studies is that Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies that are in a position to condu ct or fund such studies\u2014 such as CDC and the Biomedical Advanced Research and View GAO -20-341.

Why GAO Did This Study Bacteria l infections have become more difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat due to antibiotic resistance, which occurs when bacteria develop the ability to defeat the available drugs designed to kill them. Concerns about rising rates of resistance to avail able treatment options prompted the federal government to create the 5-year National Action Plan in 2015. The plan called for federal agencies to strengthen surveillance, advance the development of diagnostic tests and new antibiotics, and slow the emergen ce of resistant bacteria, among other things. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to address antibiotic resistance. This report examines federal efforts and challenges related to (1) surveillance of antibiotic resistance, (2) the development and use o f diagnostic testing to identify antibiotic resistance, (3) the development of treatments for resistant infections, and (4) appropriate antibiotic use. GAO reviewed literature and agency documents; interviewed agency officials and health care industry, drug industry, and other stakeholders; and held a meeting of international and U.S. experts to obtain their views. What GAO Recommends GAO is making eight recommendations to strengthen the federal response to combating antibiotic resistance. HHS concurred with seven recommendations and did not concur with one. More details are provided on the next page. United States Government Accountability Office Development Authority \u2014disagree about what each agency should do. By clarifying roles and responsibilities, HHS agencies could more effectively address the need for more studies. The resulting studies could help demonstrate the value of diagnostic tests for antibiotic resistance, potentially increasing their use and improving patient care. Experts warn that the current pipeline of antibiotics in development is insufficient to meet the threat of resistance. Several challenges impede the development of new treatments for resistant infections, notably inadequate return on investment for drug companies largely due to low prices and a limited patient population for whom these treatments would be appropriate. While HHS and Department of Defense agencies have provided financial premarket incentives to support antibiotic research and development, experts, federal officials and antibiotic developers agree that more postmarket incentives are needed to overcome the econom ic challenges. Advisory groups, including a presidential advisory council, and others have called for new postmarket incentives and identified multiple options for their design, including market entry rewards and reimbursement reform (see figure). However, HHS has not developed a strategy to further incentivize development of new treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections, and it may need to request authority and appropriations to create and implement certain types of incentives. Until such incentives a re developed, more drug companies may exit the antibiotic development sector, and the pipeline of new treatments may continue to decrease. Examples of Possible Postm arket Incentive Options to Encourage the Development of Antibiotics Identified by Advisory Groups and Others Data for Highlight Examples of Possible Postm arket Incentive Options to Encourage the Development of Antibiotics Identified by Advisory Groups and Others Market entry reward A market entry reward could be awarded in addition to , or in replacement of , sales revenues Lump s um payment Monetary reward paid to developers of new antibiotics Could be paid over multiple years Transferable v oucher Voucher that could be sold or auctioned and would confer additional market exclusivity for a differ ent pharmaceutical drug Reimbursement reform Licensing arrangement Antibiotic purchasing arrangement in which hospitals would pay a fixed fee to access the drug, which would allow them to use a certain number of doses Add-On payment Payments to hospitals f or use of certain antibiotics that are made in addition to the bundled payment the hospital already receives for a patient's inpatient stay What GAO Recommends In response to the findings presented in this Highlights, GAO recommends that: \u00b7 CDC ensure that its evaluation of its surveillance system for antibiotic -resistant gonorrhea includes measures of the system's representativeness of the U.S. population; \u00b7 HHS identify leadership and clarify roles and responsibilities to assess the clinical outcomes of diagnostic testing; \u00b7 HHS develop a strategy to further incentivize the development of new treatments for antibiotic - resistant infections, including through the use of postmarket financial incentives; \u00b7 HHS direct the CARB Task Force to include in its annual updates to the President plans for addressing any barriers prevent ing full implementation of the National Action Plan. In addition, GAO is making four recommendations to address other CDC efforts in surveillance and reporting and to address FDA efforts in monitoring diagnostic tests. HHS did not concur with the recommend ation that it develop a strategy that includes the use of postmarket financial incentives to encourage the development of new treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections, citing its ongoing analysis to understand whether postmarket incentives should be included in such a strategy. GAO recognizes the complexity of this issue and maintains that this recommendation is warranted given that experts and others have called for additional postmarket incentives and the insufficiency of the current pipeline o f new treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections. United States Government Accountability Office Federal agencies have made several efforts to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics across health care settings through antibiotic stewardship \u2014giving patients the right antibiotic at the right time, in the right dose, and for the right duration. However, key challenges remain. For example, federal agencies require only certain types of health care facilities to imp lement stewardship programs. In addition, CDC is limited in its ability to monitor and improve appropriate antibiotic use, in part because providers are not generally required to report antibiotic use data to a centralized database. The 5 -year National Act ion Plan for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (National Action Plan) calls for strengthening antibiotic stewardship and for the timely reporting of antibiotic use data across health care settings. An executive order directs an interagency task force \u2014the Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (CARB) Task Force, coordinated by HHS \u2014to provide annual updates to the President on, among other things, plans for addressing any barriers to full implementation of the National Action Plan. However, in its prog ress reports covering the first 4 years of the National Action Plan's implementation, the task force did not identify plans to address barriers to expanding antibiotic stewardship programs or the collection of antibiotic use data. Until it does so, the gov ernment will not have reasonable assurance that it is fully implementing the National Action Plan and addressing antibiotic resistance.Page i GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Contents Why GAO Did Th is Study 2 What GAO Recommends 2 What GAO Found 2 What GAO Recommends 3 Letter 1 Background 8 CDC Has Expanded Surveillance of Antibiotic Re sistance, but Faces Challenges Determining the Magnitude of the Problem 17 Federal Agencies Have Helped Advance Diagnostic Tests and Promoted Their Use, but These Efforts Have Limitations 37 Federal Efforts Have Not Fully Addressed Challenges to Developing New Treatments for Antibiotic -Resistant Infections 57 Federal Agencie s Have Undertaken Several Efforts to Promote the Appropriate Use of Antibiotics, but Key Challenges Remain 80 Conclusions 98 Recomme ndations for Executive Action 100 Agency Comments and Our Evaluation 102 Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology 106 Appendix II: Expert Meeting Participant List 114 Appendix III: Additional Examples of Federal Efforts to Support Antibiotic Research and Dev elopment 117 Appendix IV: Additional Information on Federal Efforts to Promote Appropriate Antibiotic Use 120 Appendix V: Comments f rom the Department of Health and Human Services 126 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Devices ........................ 137 Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staf f Acknowledgments 146 Page ii GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Tables Data for Highlight Examples of Possible Postmarket Incentive Options to Encourage the Development of Antibiotics Identified by Advisory Groups and Others 3 Data table for Figure 1: Bacteria CDC Considered to Be Threats in 2013 and 2019 11 Table 1: Examples of Key Roles and Responsibilities of Select Department of Health and Human Services Agencies Related to Combating Antibiotic Resistance 16 Table 2: Description of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Surveillance Systems and Priority Bacteria Tracked 18 Table 3: Examples of Federal Agencies' Funding of Research and Develo pment for New Treatments for Antibiotic -Resistant Infections 65 Data for Figure 3: Examples of Currently Available Federal Incentives for Antibiotic Development 71 Table 4: Examples of Factors That Drive or Deter Antibiotic Prescribing Behavior 97 Table 5: Additional Examples of Federal Efforts to Support Antibiotic Research and Development 117 Table 6: Examples of Federal Efforts to Promote the Appropriate Use of Antibiotics 120 Antimicrobial Susceptibi lity Test Devices ........................ 137 Figures Figure 1: Bacteria CDC Considered to Be Threats in 2013 and 2019 10 Figure 2: Resistant Gonorrhea Sentinel Surveillance Sites and Regional Testing Laboratories, 2018 27 Data table for Figure 2: Resista nt Gonorrhea Sentinel Surveillance Sites and Regional Testing Laboratories, 2018 27 Figure 3: Examples of Currently Available Federal Incentives for Antibiotic Development 71 Figure 4: Examples of Possible Postmarket Incentive Options to Encourage the Development of Antibiotics Identified by Advisory Groups and Others 75 Data for Figure 4: Examples of Possible Postmarket Incentive Options to Encourage the Development of Antibiotics Identified by Advisory Groups and Others 75 Page iii GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Figure 5: Percentage of U.S. Hospitals R eporting Antibiotic Use Data to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network, by State, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, as of August 2019 92 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Devices ........................ 137 Abbreviations AHRQ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AR Option Antimicrobial Resistance Option AU Option Antimicrobial Use Option AUR Module Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module BARDA Biomedical Advanced Res earch and Development Authority CARB Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria CARB -X Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CLSI Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institu te CMS Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services DOD Department of Defense eGISP Enhanced Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project EIP Emerging Infections Program FDA Food and Drug Administration GISP Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Program GLASS Glob al Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System GPRA Government Performance and Results Act HHS Department of Health and Human Services LPAD Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs MIPS Merit -based Incentive Payment System MRSA Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus NARMS National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System NHSN National Healthcare Safety Network NIAID National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIH National Institutes of Health PACCARB Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic -

Washington, DC 20548 Letter March 30, 2020 The Ho norable Lamar Alexander Chairman The Honorable Patty Murray Ranking Member Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions United States Senate The Honorable Frank Pallone, Jr. Chairman The Honorable Greg Walden Republican Leader Committee on Energy an d Commerce House of Representatives The Honorable Diana DeGette Chair The Honorable Brett Guthrie Republican Leader Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Committee on Energy and Commerce House of Representatives Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, many life -saving antibiotics have been developed that have allowed previously incurable infections to be easily treated. However, many types of infections have become more difficult or impossible to treat as bacteria have developed resistance to most \u2014or, in some cases, all \u2014currently available antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers antibiotic resistance Letter Page 2 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance to be one of the greatest global public health threats of our time.1In 2019, CDC estimated that at least 2.8 mill ion people get sick and at least 35,900 die each year from antibiotic -resistant infections in the United States.2 While bacteria naturally develop resistance to antibiotics over time, this problem has been accelerated by the overuse and misuse of antibioti cs in 1Antimicrobial resistance refers broadly to drug -resistant bacterial, fungal, viral, and other types of microbial infecti ons. For the purpose of this report, we focused on antibiotic resistance. CDC uses the term \"antibiotics\" to refer to drugs that can kill bacteria or fungi. See Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 (Atlanta, Ga.: Nov. 13, 2019), p. 7. Our review focused on resistance of bacteria against antibiotic drugs and did not focus on resistance of fungi against drugs. In contrast, under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the term \"antibiotic drug\" means \"any drug (except drugs for use in animals other than humans) composed wholly or partly of any kind of penicillin, streptomycin, chlortetracycline, chloramphenicol, bacitracin, or any other drug intended for human use containing any quantity of any chemical substan ce which is produced by a micro organism and which has the capacity to inhibit or destro y micro organisms in dilute solution (including a chemically synthesized equivalent of any such substance) or any derivati ve thereof.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(jj). Note that under the definition under the 21st Century Cures Act, which amended Section 319E of the Public Health Service Act, that for certain purposes of the law, the term \"antimicrobial\" includes \"any antibacterial or an tifungal drugs, and may include drugs that eliminate or inhibit the growth of other microorganisms, as appropriate.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d -5(k). 2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Antibiotic Resistance Threats, 2019. In 2013, CDC had estimated at leas t 2 million people got sick and 23,000 people died each year from antibiotic -resistant infections; however, in its 2019 report, CDC revised its 2013 estimates by using new data sources and stated that the annual number of antibiotic - resistant infections in 2013 was at least 2.6 million, with 44,000 deaths. See Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Antibiotic Resistan ce Threats in the United States, 2013 (Atlanta, Ga.: Apr. 23, 2013) . A study funded by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimated 671,689 antibiotic -resistant infections and 33,110 deaths caused by antibiotic -resistant infections in 2015 throughout the European Union and the European Economic Area. In addition, the study estimated the health burden of five types of infections with antibiotic - resistant bacteria using a metric called disability -adjusted life -years. A. Cassini et al., \"Attributable Deaths and Disability -Adjusted Life -Years Caused By Infections with Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria in the EU and the European Economic Area in 2015: a Population -Level Modelling Analysis,\" Lancet Infectious Disease, vol. 19, no. 1 (2019), pp. 56-66. A 2014 study estimated that as many as 10 million people globally could die each year by 2050 if no action is taken to combat antimicrobial resistance. This study examined a limited number of types of bacteria, as well as other pathogens such as mala ria, noting that this limitation resulted from a lack of readily available data.

Letter Page 3 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance human health, food animals, and the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the world urgently needs to change the way antibiotics are prescribed and used, and CDC has highlighted the need for antibiotics to be used more appr opriately \u2014a concept called antibiotic stewardship \u2014to preserve their effectiveness and help slow the development of antibiotic resistance.3CDC officials note d that poor infection control and limited communication between health care facilities also contrib ute to the spread of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, WHO and others warn ed that the pipeline of antibiotics in development is insufficient to tackle the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.4 Additionally, diagnostic testing used to identify antibio tic-resistant bacteria is not available for all bacteria of concern. These gaps may hinder the correct diagnosis of antibiotic -resistant infections, which could delay treatment with appropriate antibiotics, contribute to antibiotic overuse, and impede over all surveillance efforts.5 Recognizing the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, by Executive Order No. 13676, September 2014, the President established the Task Force for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (CARB Task Force), co-chaired by the Secr etaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Defense (DOD), and Agriculture.6In 2015, the CARB Task Force issued the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic - Resistant Bacteria (hereafter referred to as the National Action Plan), setting forth goals over 5 years to slow the development of resistant bacteria, strengthen national surveillance efforts, advance the development and use of diagnostic tests, and accelerate the development 3World Health Organization, \"Antibiotic Resistance,\" accessed February 13, 2020, https://www.who.int/en/news -room/fact -sheets/detail/antibiotic -resistance . WHO is the Geneva -based coordinating authority on international health within the United Nations system. CDC defines antibiotic stewardship as the effort to measure and optimize antibiotic use with the goal of optimizing the treatment of infections while reducing the adverse events associated with antibiotic use. Antibiotic stewardship aims to have all patients treated with the right antibiotic at the right time, in the right dose, and for the right duration for a given diagnosis. 4World Health Organization, 2019 Antibacterial Agents in Clinical Development: An Analysis of t he Antibacterial Clinical Development Pipeline (Geneva, Switzerland: 2019). 5Disease surveillance is the process of reporting, collecting, analyzing, and exchanging information related to cases of infectious diseases. 6Exec.

Letter Page 4 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance of new treatments, among other things.7Because of t he severity of the problem that antibiotic resistance presents for humans and the federal government 's commitment to fight it, you asked us to provide information on federal efforts to combat antibiotic resistance. This report examines 1. CDC 's efforts to con duct surveillance of antibiotic resistance and any challenges to these efforts; 2. federal efforts to advance the development and use of tests for diagnosing antibiotic -resistant infections; 3. challenges to developing new treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections and federal efforts to address the challenges; and 4. federal efforts to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics and any challenges that remain. To address all four objectives, we reviewed relevant agency reports and documents; interviewed official s from federal agencies, experts on topics related to antibiotic resistance, and representatives from stakeholder organizations; reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, literature, and GAO reports; and attended two national conferences.8We focused our review primarily on agency actions since 2015, when the National Action Plan was published. We also focused our review on human health, as we have reported on federal efforts to address the use of antibiotics in food animals and recommended actions to improve these efforts for more than 20 years.9Additionally, we focused our review on antibiotic -resistant bacteria. Finally, we generally excluded federal efforts related to infection 7The White House, National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (Washington, D.C.: March 2015). 8The two conferences were the World Anti -Microbial Resistance Congress and t he Gordon Research Conference on chemical and biological threat defense. 9GAO, Antibiotic Resistance: More Information Needed to Oversee Use of Medically Important Drugs in Food Animals , GAO -17-192 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 2, 2017); Antibiotic Resistance: Agencies Have Made Limited Progress Addressing Antibiotic Use in Animals , GAO -11-801 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 7, 2011); Antibiotic Resistan ce: Federal Agencies Need to Better Focus Efforts to Address Risk to Humans from Antibiotic Use in Animals , GAO -04-490 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 22, 2004); and Food Safety: The Agricultural Use of An tibiotics and Its Implications for Human Health , GAO/RCED -99-74 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 28, 1999). Letter Page 5 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance prevention and control in human health care, on which we have previousl y reported.10 We interviewed officials from federal agencies responsible for implementing the aspects of the National Action Plan related to our objectives: HHS 's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation , the Biomedical Advanced Researc h and Development Authority (BARDA) , CDC , the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) , the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , the National Institutes of Health (NIH) , and the Office of Global Affairs ; as well as DOD and the Department of Veterans A ffairs (VA). We also interviewed experts and representatives from organizations involved in public health and epidemiology, infectious diseases and microbiology, antibiotic research and development (R&D), antibiotic stewardship, and other issues relating to antibiotic resistance. Because antibiotic resistance is a global problem, we also interviewed officials from WHO and other international entities. We identified experts and organizations through literature and other documents we reviewed and through refe rrals from agency officials and other experts we interviewed. In addition, in September 2018, with the assistance of the National Academy of Sciences, we convened a meeting of experts in antibiotic resistance epidemiology, diagnostic testing, antibiotic de velopment, and antibiotic stewardship. (In this report, we refer to such experts as \"experts at our meeting. \") For each of our objectives, we identified and reported on actions taken by federal agencies to address antibiotic resistance, and we evaluated th ese actions against relevant criteria, as applicable, such as Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and GAO 's leading practices on interagency collaboration.11 To examine CDC 's efforts to conduct surveillance for antibiotic resistance and any challenges to these efforts, we reviewed documentation and conducted interviews with agency officials and other key stakeholders on each of the surveillance systems across CDC that collects antibiotic resistance data and reviewed CDC 's Antibiotic Resi stance Threats in the 10GAO, Health -Care -Associated Infections in Hospitals: Leadership Needed from HHS to Prioritiz e Prevention Practices and Improve Data on These Infections , GAO -08-283 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 31, 2008). 11GAO, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , GAO -14-704G (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 10, 2014) and Managing for Results: Key Considerations for Implementing Interagency Collaborative Mechanisms, GAO -12-1022 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 27, 2012). Letter Page 6 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance United States, 2013 (2013 Threats Report) and Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 (2019 Threats Report) reports .12This included a review of health care facility participation data by state and territory in a CDC a ntibiotic resistance reporting system. We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing them for any outliers or anomalies and inquiring with agency officials about their source and any known reliability issues. We determined that these data were suf ficiently reliable for assessing facility participation rates by U.S. state and territory. We also reviewed documents from WHO 's Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System and interviewed WHO and CDC officials to identify challenges that limit CDC 's ability to assess threats from abroad. To examine federal efforts to advance the development and use of diagnostic tests, we also interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of six diagnostic test manufacturers to encompass different types of tests, based a l ist of manufacturers compiled from our previous work, interviews with select experts, and internet research. We limited our scope to FDA - authorized tests \u2014which we are defining as tests that have been reviewed and cleared or granted authorization by FDA for marketing in the United States \u2014that can identify resistance in at least one type of bacteria categorized as a priority in CDC 's 2013 Threats Report.13Some of these tests are called antibiotic susceptibility tests, but we use \"tests \" to refer to the entire class of such tests. We included in our scope tests that can differentiate between viral and bacterial infections, because these types of tests are included in the National Action Plan. To identify challenges to developing new treatments for antibiotic - resistant infections and examine federal efforts to address these challenges, we also reviewed literature and reports written by health policy advisory groups on topics related to antibiotic development challenges and incentives for development. Our examinat ion of challenges and related federal actions focused on treatments and, therefore, did not include products designed to prevent infections, such as 12We started our audit work in 2018, prior to the issuance of CDC's 2019 Threats Report . 13FDA officials told us that the tests under our review are Class II devices and are appropriately referred to as cleared when granted marketing authorization. For a further description of device classes, see our previous report, GAO, Medical Devices: Challenges and Capabilities to Enable Rapid Diagnoses of Infectious Diseases , GAO -17-347 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 14, 2017). Other types of diagnostic tests, such as laboratory - developed tests, are not within the scope of this report. FDA describes laboratory - developed tests as tests designed, manufactured, and used within a single lab oratory. Letter Page 7 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance vaccines. We also interviewed 11 randomly selected companies that conduct R&D on new treatments for bacteri al infections.14 To examine federal agency efforts to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics and any challenges that remain, we also analyzed CMS data and related documentation on quality measures and improvement activities related to antibiotics. We re viewed the data for any obvious outliers or anomalies and determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for reporting on the number of clinicians who reported implementing these quality measures and improvement activities. In addition, we reviewed aggregated data from CDC on the total number of eligible U.S. hospitals reporting their antibiotic use data to a CDC system. We assessed the reliability of the aggregated data by reviewing them for any obvious errors or missing data totals and inquiring wi th agency officials about their source and any known reliability issues. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for reporting hospital participation rates in CDC 's antibiotic use reporting system. We focused our review on antibiotic use i n the United States, rather than global antibiotic use. Appendix I contains more detailed information on the scope and methodology of our review. Appendix es I and II contain more detailed information about our expert meeting. We conducted this performance audit from February 2018 to March 2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. 14We selected from among companies that are researching or developing antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotics \u2014which we call \"nontraditional products\" in this report \u2014and we included companies that do and do not have existing FDA -approved drugs o n the market. Letter Page 8 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Background Antibiotics are drugs that work by killing bacteria or slowing th eir growth.15 However, some bacteria have developed ways to resist the effects of antibiotics, for example, by preventing antibiotics from entering the cell or pumping them out after the antibiotic enters. Bacteria that are able to survive in the presence o f antibiotics will multiply and pass on their new genetic material that confers resistance to future generations of bacteria and, in some cases, to other types of bacteria.16Resistance can arise in bacteria in humans, animals, and the environment, includin g in health care settings, and can spread through contact with infected people or animals, contact with contaminated water, soil or surfaces, or consumption of contaminated food.17 The spread of antibiotic resistance threatens not only the ability to fight bacterial infections but also threatens to reverse some significant medical gains. For example, in addition to treating infections, antibiotics have allowed for numerous medical procedures, such as joint replacements, caesarian sections, organ transplants, chemotherapy, and dialysis \u2014all of which would be significantly riskier without effective antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance also poses a significant economic burden resulting from the direct costs of treating those with resistant infections and the loss o f economic productivity from those who get sick or die.18 15We note that in its 2019 report, consistent with applicable authorities, CDC uses the term \"antibiotics\" to refer to drugs that can kill bacteria or fungi. CDC's Antibiotic Resistance Threats, 2019 , p. 7 . See also, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(jj); 42 U .S.C. \u00a7 247d -5(k). However, as we explained previously, we have only considered those antibiotics that can kill bacteria. 16Scientists have identified more than 1,600 genes that confer resistance for bacteria. Of significant global scientific concern is the mcr gene, which confers resistance to polymixins, known as the \"drugs of last resort\" for treating certain types of infections. The mcr gene was first discovered in China in 2015 but has since been found in bacteria cultured from humans and animals on at least five continents, including in the United States. 17The National Action Plan includes a goal to strengthen surveillance of antibiotic resistance using a \"One -Health\" approach, which recognizes the interaction between humans, animals, and the environmen t. 18According to CDC, antibiotic -resistant infections require extended hospital stays, additional follow -up visits to health care providers, and the use of treatments that may be more costly and potentially more toxic. Letter Page 9 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance In the 2013 Threats Report, CDC identified 17 bacterial pathogens that the agency considers to be \"urgent, \" \"serious, \" or \"concerning \" because they have developed enough resistance to antibiotics to be considered a threat to human health. (See fig. 1.) According to CDC, certain types of bacteria, called gram -negative bacteria, are particularly worrisome because they are becoming resistant to nearly all drugs that would be considered for treatment.19 19Gram -negative bacteria are characte rized by a double cell membrane, which can pose as a barrier to antibiotics trying to enter the cell, and pumps that can expel antibiotics from the cell.

CDC also reported that, in 2019, they focused on \"carbapenem -resistant \" cCDC dropped Vancomycin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus from its threats list in 2019, noting that the 14 identified cases of infection with this bacteria were considered isolated cases, and spread from patient to patient has never been documented. The most serious gram -negative infections can be acquired in hospitals or other health c are settings and can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis. Nine of the 17 bacterial threats on CDC 's threat list are gram -negative. One of the bacteria CDC considers to be an urgent threat \u2014Clostridioide s difficile (C. difficile )\u2014is classified as a threat not because it is resistant to antibiotics, but because it is caused by the same factors that drive antibiotic Letter Page 12 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance resistance, such as antibiotic use. CDC estimates that C. difficile alone accounted for 12,8 00 deaths in U.S. hospitals in 2017.20CDC 's 2013 Threats Report also identified one type of fungus \u2014Candida auris \u2014that it considered to be a serious threat (see text box). Candida auris Is a Resistant Fungal Threat Candida auris (C. auris ) is an emerging in fectious fungus that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), presents a global health threat in part because it is highly resistant to anti -fungal drugs and is challenging to address. C. auris was first identified in Japan in 20 09. CDC reported 806 confirmed cases in the United States, as of August 31, 2019. According to CDC, C. auris is highly transmissible and some commonly used hospital surface disinfectants appear to be less effective against C. auris . A CDC official told us C. auris is a good example of an emerging threat that requires more research and associated efforts to properly address. Addressing C. auris is challenging for reasons including the rise of resistance and limitations in diagnostic tests. According to CDC, there are three classes of antifungals available to treat C. auris . However, CDC has identified strains that are resistant to all three classes. A CDC official noted that getting new antifungals to market is challenging because, among other things, the dem and for antifungals, relative to antibiotics, is low. Additionally, according to FDA, although reliable tests for identifying C. auris exist, commonly used laboratory tests may misidentify this fungus, posing a barrier to correct diagnosis. In 2018, the Fo od and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared a test based on mass spectrometry to identify C. auris , but this test cannot characterize resistance. FDA officials told us there are three FDA -cleared tests available for testing for other Candida species ' resistan ce to fluconazole. However, none of these tests can provide rapid results, such as within an hour. Finally, interpretation of culture -based diagnostic tests, which examine how well bacteria grow in the presence of an antibiotic, is challenging due to the l ack of established interpretive criteria for C. auris , by both the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, which promotes the development and use of voluntary laboratory consensus standards and guidelines within the health care community, and by FDA.

See K. J. Suda et al., \"Antibiotic Expenditures by Medication, Class, and Healthcare Setting in the United States, 2010 - 2015,\" Clinical Infectious Diseases , vol. 66, no. 2 (2018): pp. 185 -90. Letter Page 13 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance inappropriate.22According to CDC, approximately 85 to 95 percent of the nation 's antibiotic use, by volume, occurred in outpatient settings from 2010 through 2015; and roughly 270 million antibiotic prescriptions \u2014 equivalent to 836 per 1,000 persons in the United States \u2014were written in these settings in 2016. (For more information on antibiotic use in the United States, see text box.) Antibiotic Use in the United States A 2017 Centers for Disease Contr ol and Prevention (CDC) report estimates that about 30 percent of antibiotics used in U.S. hospitals are inappropriate (unnecessary or prescribed incorrectly), and as much as 50 percent of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings \u2014such as physicians ' offices, emergency departments, urgent care centers, and retail clinics \u2014may be inappropriate. For example, CDC reports that each year, an estimated 47 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are written in physicians ' offices and emergency departments . Most of these unnecessary prescriptions are for respiratory conditions most commonly caused by viruses \u2014 including common colds, viral sore throats, and bronchitis \u2014that do not respond to antibiotics, or for bacterial infections that do not always need antib iotics, like many sinus and ear infections. Furthermore, CDC reports that even when antibiotics are needed, prescribers often favor drugs that may be less effective and may carry more risk over more targeted, \"first-line\" drugs recommended by nationally re cognized antibiotic prescribing guidelines. (First -line drugs are the drugs generally recommended for initial treatment for a given diagnosis, often combining the best efficacy with the best safety profile or the lowest cost.) According to CDC, antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed medications in nursing homes, with up to 70 percent of residents receiving one or more courses of systemic (non -topical) antibiotics in a year; CDC also cites studies showing that 40 to 75 percent of antibiotics pr escribed in nursing homes may be inappropriate. CDC further reports that harms from antibiotic overuse include the risk of serious diarrheal infections from C. difficile , increased adverse drug events and drug interactions, and increased risk of infection with antibiotic -resistant organisms. Source: CDC, Antibiotic Use in the United States, 2017: Progress and Opportunities (Atlanta, G a.: 2017), The Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship for Nursing Homes (Atlanta, Ga. : 2015), and \"Measuring Outpatient Anti biotic Prescribing, \" . and Human Services, Ce nters for Disease Control and Prevention, Antibiotic Use in the United States, 2017: Progress and Opportunities (Atlanta, Ga.: 2017) and Antibiotic Use in the United States, 2018 Update: Progress and Opportunities (Atlanta, Ga.: 2019). According to CDC of ficials, \"unnecessary\" antibiotic use means the antibiotic was prescribed when no antibiotic was needed, based on clinical practice guidelines. \"Inappropriate\" antibiotic use includes both unnecessary antibiotic use, as well as inappropriate antibiotic sel ection, dosing, or duration when antibiotics are indicated. CDC officials also told us they consider \"misuse\" and \"inappropriate use\" to be synonymous terms. Letter Page 14 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance The National Action Plan and Federal Agency Responsibilities In September 2014, the President signed Executive Order No. 13676 (Executive Order), which directed that several federal actions be initiated related to antibiotic resistance. For example, the Executive Order directed the creation of the National Action Plan, which th e White House released in 2015, to provide a roadmap for federal agencies to respond to the threat of antibiotic resistance.23The National Action Plan set five major goals over 5 years related to (1) slowing the emergence of resistant bacteria and preventi ng the spread of resistant infections; (2) strengthening national One -Health surveillance efforts to combat resistance;24(3) advancing the development and use of rapid and innovative diagnostic tests for the identification and characterization of resistant bacteria; (4) accelerating basic and applied R&D for new antibiotics, other therapeutics, and vaccines; and (5) improving international collaboration and capacities related to the first four goals.25 In addition, the National Action Plan discusses the impo rtance of preventing and controlling infections, such as through rapid detection, to combat antibiotic resistance domestically and globally (see text box). Within each of these five goals, the National Action Plan contains numerous objectives, sub -objectiv es, agency -specific milestones, and other performance targets called significant outcomes. For example, the National Action Plan set a significant outcome of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use by 50 percent in outpatient settings and by 20 percent in inpatient settings by 2020. 23Exec. Order No. 13676 (Sept. 23, 2014). 24One-Health recognizes the interaction between humans, an imals, and the environment. 25Similarly, the objectives of WHO's Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance are to (1) improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance though effective communication, education, and training; (2) strength en the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research; (3) reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene, and infection prevention measures; (4) optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health ; and (5) develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries and to increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions. World Health Organization, Global Action Plan o n Antimicrobial Resistance (Geneva, Switzerland: 2015). Vaccines Can Also Help Prevent Antibiotic Resistance While we did not include vaccines in the scope of this report, vaccines play a role in helping combat antibiot ic resistance because they are designed to prevent infections, including resistant infections. In addition, by preventing infections from occurring, they can reduce the need to use antibiotics, which in turn, can slow the development of antibiotic resistan ce. For example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), since introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine among children in 2000, rates of antibiotic -resistant infections caused by certain Streptococcus pneumoniae strains decreased by 97 percent among children under 5 and by more than 60 percent among adults. However, few vaccines are available that target antibiotic -resistant bacteria on CDC's threat list. Source: GAO summary of CDC information. | GAO -20-341 Letter Page 15 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Infection Prevention and Control According to the World Health Organization (WHO), effective infection prevention and control measures are a practical and scientific approach to reduce health care - associated infections in patie nts and health care workers, and help combat antibiotic resistance. Infection prevention and control measures serve as the cornerstone of actions needed to address epidemics, pandemics, and antibiotic resistance. Such measures include implementing hand hyg iene practices, providing vaccinations, cleaning and disinfecting hospital rooms, isolating patients with infectious diseases, decontaminating and sterilizing medical equipment, and tracking data about emerging infectious diseases. WHO states that health c are-associated infections are a global challenge from which no country or health care facility is immune. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has taken actions to address and track health care-associated infections, including antibiotic -resistant infections. For example, in 2009, CDC issued guidance for infection control targeting Enterobacteriaceae that may be resistant to carbapenem, a class of antibiotics. In 2018, CDC published a study suggesting that a tracked decline in the proportion of resistant bacteria, including carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae, observed in some health care settings, could be attributable \u2014at least in part \u2014to actions such as those outlined in its 2009 guidance. In addition, CDC has reported that U.S. hospita ls have made major progress since 2005 in declining rates of methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia because of infection prevention measures.

Representatives from HHS agencies \u2014including BARDA, CDC, CMS, FDA, and NIH \u2014make up nearly two -thirds of the task force 's participants (see table 1). According to the HHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation officials who coordinate it, th e task force is developing a new National Action Plan that will span the years 2020 through 2025. To provide additional advice to the CARB Task Force and the Secretary of HHS, the Executive Order also created the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB), which is composed of 15 non -governmental members.26 26Exec. Order No. 13676, \u00a7 4 Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic - Resistant Bacteria, 79 Fed. Reg. 56931 (Sept. 23, 2014); continued by Exec. Order No. 13708 \u00a7 1(jj), 80 Fed.

Letter Page 16 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Table 1: Examples of Key Roles and Responsibilities of Select Department of Health and Human Services Agencies Related to Combating Antibiotic Resistance Agency Examples of key roles and responsibilities Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) AHRQ 's mission is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable. AHRQ funds research to develop improved methods for combating antibiotic resistance and conducting antibiotic stewardship. AHRQ also conducts nationwide projects that work with front -line clinicians to promote the implementation of evidence -based methods for infection prevention and antibiotic s tewardship in hospitals, long -term care, and ambulatory care settings. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) BARDA 's mission is to help secure the nation from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, as well as fro m pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases. Through public -private partnerships, BARDA invests in products, such as antibiotics and diagnostic tests, which can be used to fight the threat of antibiotic resistance. BARDA, along with the National Institutes of Health, helped launch the Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB -X) in 2016, which is a public -private international partnership that funds research and development of new antibiotics, diagnostic tests, va ccines, and other treatments to combat antibiotic resistance.a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CDC has a primary responsibility to protect the public health through the prevention of disease and health promotion. CDC monitors the emergen ce of antibiotic -resistant infections and the use of antibiotics. CDC provides state and local health departments with resources to detect and track antibiotic -resistant pathogens, support antibiotic -resistance experts to implement infection control activi ties, and respond to outbreaks to stop the spread, in addition to promoting appropriate use of antibiotics in human health care to prevent the emergence of new resistance. CDC also supports research on and implements prevention strategies, such as educatio nal programs targeting the public and health care providers that are designed to provide information on the appropriate use of antibiotics. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) CMS is responsible for administering the Medicare and Medicaid progr ams. Medicare provides federally financed health insurance coverage to people age 65 and older and certain other individuals. Medicaid is a joint federal -state program that finances health care coverage for low -income and medically needy individuals. CMS s ets payment rates for Medicare beneficiaries receiving treatment in hospitals, including those with antibiotic -resistant infections. In addition, CMS determines patient health and safety requirements for certain types of health care facilities (such as hos pitals and nursing homes) participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.b CMS also administers other programs designed to improve the quality of health care provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries as well as other patients. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Part of FDA 's responsibility for protecting the public health involves ensuring the safety and efficacy of human drugs and medical devices marketed in the United States, including antibiotics and diagnostic tests. FDA reviews and approve s drugs, reviews and authorizes marketing for diagnostic devices, and provides educational information to consumers and health care providers about the appropriate use of antibiotics. FDA also approves, regulates, and collects data on antibiotics used in f ood animals, and monitors antibiotic -resistant bacteria in retail meat and poultry. National Institutes of Health (NIH) NIH's mission is to apply fundamental knowledge about living systems to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disabilit y. According to NIH officials, NIH and its National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) fund and conduct research to better understand how antibiotic resistance develops, and supports the research and development of new diagnostic tests, t reatments, and vaccines for antibiotic -resistant infections. For example, NIAID 's Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group provides extramural funding to a global consortium of scientific experts leading clinical research on important scientific questions related to antibiotic resistance. Office of Global Affairs The Office of Global Affairs represents the United States in international negotiations that set the worldwide agenda to address antibiotic resistance and coordinates across federal agencies to inform policies and programs. The office co -chairs the Transatlantic Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Executive Order also charged the CARB Task Force with providing annual updates to the President regarding progress made in implementing the National Action Plan, plans to address any barriers preventing its full implementation, and recommendations for any new or modified actions, taking federal government resources into consideration. Since 2015, the CARB Task Force has pr oduced four progress reports, which summarize agency actions toward meeting the goals and milestones laid out in the National Action Plan; these reports were provided to the President and are publicly available.27 CDC Has Expanded Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance, but Faces Challenges Determining the Magnitude of the Problem Since the National Action Plan was released in 2015, CDC has made progress in expanding surveillance for antibiotic resistance in the United States and abroad. However, the magnitud e of the problem and its trends over time remain unknown, in part because of challenges in three areas: (1) tracking antibiotic resistance across all health care settings, (2) reporting complete and timely information on magnitude and trends of antibiotic resistance, and (3) tracking and assessing the global antibiotic resistance threat. CDC Has Expanded Surveillance of Priority Bacteria To better assess the full extent of antibiotic resistance, CDC has expanded its surveillance of priority bacteria in the United States in order 27United States Taskforce for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (CARB Task Force), National Action Plan for Combating An tibiotic -Resistant Bacteria: First 180 Days Report (November 2015), National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria: Progress Report for Years 1 and 2 (October 2017), National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria: Progre ss Report: Year 3 (October 2018), and National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria: Progress Report: Year 4 (September 2019). Letter Page 18 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance to better assess the full extent of antibiotic resistance since the 2015 National Action Plan was released. CDC tracks antibiotic resistance through several infectious disease surveillance systems in collaboration with state and loca l health officials, health care providers and facilities, and laboratories.28Rather than establishing a single surveillance system for antibiotic resistance, CDC generally incorporates tracking of antibiotic resistance into broader surveillance systems, ac cording to agency officials. The surveillance systems are spread across various divisions within CDC that specialize in specific types of infection or certain settings. (See table 2 for a description of each system and the resistant bacteria it tracks.) Table 2: Description of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Surveillance Systems and Priority Bacteria Tracked Surveillance system Description of system Priority bacteria tracked Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network (AR Lab Network) The AR Lab Network provides nationwide lab capacity to rapidly detect antibiotic resistance in health care, food, and the community, and inform local responses to prevent spread and protect people. It includes labs in 50 states, several large cities, and Puerto R ico, including seven regional labs and the National Tuberculosis Molecular Surveillance Center. Testing for: Neisseria 28Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health -related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice.

It provides access to bacterial and fungal samples for testing and detailed clinical case data.a EIP has population level data, and does not focus on infections occurring in health care facilities as does the National Healthcare Safety Network. The three main programs within EIP collect different types of resistance data: \u00b7 Active Bacterial Core provides clinical information and resistance data for bacteria that cause infections predominately in the community \u00b7 The Healthcare -Associated Infections - Community Interface provides clinical information and resistance data for bacteria and fungi that cause infections at the intersection of health care and the general community \u00b7 Foodborne Diseases Active Surveil lance Network (FoodNet) supplies clinical and epidemiologic data on the human enteric isolates followed in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) Active Bacterial Core: Streptococcus list) Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Program (GISP) A program to track antibiotic resistance data for gonococcal isolates. Isolates are collected from sexuall y-transmitted disease clinics in approximately 28 cities. Neisseria gonorrhoeae National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) A national public health surveillance system that tracks changes in the susceptibility of foodborne and other enter ic bacteria to antibiotics of human and veterinary medical importance. NARMS is a collaborative effort among CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and state and local health departments. CDC tests bacteria isolate d from human samples, while FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture test bacteria isolated from samples taken from retail meats and food animals at slaughter, respectively. Salmonella Campylobacter Shigella Escherichia coli O157 National Healthcare Saf ety Network (NHSN) A system that collects and provides data on infections and drug resistance in health care settings. Since NHSN collects data directly from health care facilities, it can provide facility -level information on health care -associated infect ions and antibiotic resistance to those facilities and to CDC.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis Source: GAO summary of information from CDC websites. | GAO -20-341 aCDC also tracks a fungal infection, fluconazole -resistant Candida, in the Emerging Infections Program. bAccording to CDC, MRSA was formerly a part of the Active Bacterial Core. According to CDC and other officials and documents we reviewed, including th e National Action Plan Year 3 Progress Report, CDC has taken the following actions, among others, to expand surveillance in order to better assess the scope of antibiotic resistance: \u00b7 Established the Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network in 2016 to impro ve testing capacity to better identify antibiotic resistance in the United States. The network consists of 55 state and local (including Puerto Rico), and seven regional, public health laboratories and the National Tuberculosis Molecular Surveillance Cente r.29The network is improving and expanding laboratory capacity response at public health laboratories around the country, as well as at regional centers, according to representatives from two national professional organizations of state and local health of ficials and epidemiologists. \u00b7Expanded antibiotic resistance -related efforts in its Emerging Infections Program (EIP), a network that seeks to monitor, prevent, and control emerging infectious diseases. For example, since 2015, more of the existing 10 EIP s ites are conducting surveillance for invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections, carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and C. difficile , among others. Separately, the National Action Plan had included a goal for CDC to expand EIP by adding up to 10 sites within 3 years. However, CDC officials told us 29The seven regional laboratories in the network are located in Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. The laboratories were estab lished under CDC's new efforts through the Antibiotic Resistance Solutions Initiative in 2016 to help health departments nationwide tackle antibiotic resistance and other patient safety threats, including through the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity fo r Infectious Diseases Cooperative Agreement. Letter Page 21 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance that in light of resource limitations, they chose to instead increase the number of pathogens reported at existing EIP sites. They told us they determined this was a better use of the limited funds, and that existing EIP sites are sufficient for current EIP efforts related to antibiotic resistance. \u00b7 Updated the domestic tuberculosis surveillance system by incorporating advanced drug susceptibility testing and reporting and by developing capacity for state surve illance systems to report their tuberculosis test data electronically to CDC laboratories. \u00b7 Supported state and local health departments to better track, investigate, and prevent resistant foodborne disease, among other things, through the National Antimicr obial Resistance Monitoring System for Enteric Bacteria (NARMS). For example, the system can now carry out whole genome sequencing for all the pathogens it tracks, which enhances its detection and response capabilities, such as by expanding CDC 's ability t o detect new and emerging resistance, according to CDC officials. \u00b7 Launched the Enhanced Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Program (eGISP), which augments the main Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Program (GISP). Whereas GISP only collects samples from the urethras of men with symptoms of gonorrhea, in select sexually transmitted disease clinics, eGISP also collects samples from women and from other sites on the body, such as the throat. The specimens are sent to regional laboratories for resistance testing.30 CDC has also worked with international partners to expand surveillance of antibiotic resistance abroad. These efforts involved CDC collaborations with WHO, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, the government of the United Kingdom, other g overnments, and other multi - country efforts, such as the Surveillance and Epidemiology of Drug - Resistant Infections Consortium and the Transatlantic Taskforce on 30Regional laboratories for gonorrhea resistance testing as part of GISP and eGISP are located in Maryland, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington. Letter Page 22 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Antimicrobial Resistance (TATFAR).31The collaborations aimed to develop technical guidance to help improve surveillance in other nations and to organize an international forum. CDC also launched its Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Solutions Initiative, which invests in national and international infrastructure to address resistant infections across heal th care settings and communities and from food. The Precise Magnitude and Trends of Antibiotic Resistance Are Unknown, in Part Because of Challenges CDC Faces in Three Areas CDC faces three general challenges in tracking and reporting trends in antibiotic resistance. First, it faces limitations in data reporting and resistance testing from hospitals, as well as challenges ensuring that its resistant gonorrhea surveillance system is representative of the U.S. population. Second, CDC faces challenges in repor ting complete and timely information on the magnitude of and trends in antibiotic resistance. Finally, CDC faces challenges to detecting resistance threats abroad. Challenges in Tracking Resistance The first challenge CDC faces in tracking trends in resist ance is addressing low hospital participation in a new option of CDC 's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system intended to address some limitations in NHSN. NHSN is, among other things, an online system for tracking health care -associated infectio ns. It provides facilities, states, regions, and the nation with data needed to identify problem areas, 31The UK -based charitable organization the Wellcome Trust launched the Surveillance and Epidemiology of Drug -Resistant Infections Consortium to help countries track, share, and analyze information about antimicrobial resistance. The consortium brings together international experts in infectious diseases, epidemiology, and hum an and animal health to identify gaps in surveillance, help countries strengthen and sustain their capacity to collect data on drug -resistant pathogens, and improve global coordination. The group also provides technical expertise and knowledge to help impr ove surveillance networks and look at how technology can be used to better understand resistance mechanisms and how infections spread. TATFAR was created in 2009 to address the urgent threat of antibiotic resistance. TATFAR's technical experts from Canada, the European Union, Norway, and the United States collaborate and share best practices to strengthen domestic and global efforts. Letter Page 23 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance measure the progress of prevention efforts, and ultimately eliminate health care -associated infections, according to CDC.32 CDC established three modules within NHSN that allow hospitals to report select antibiotic -resistant infections, among other things, which include reporting required by states or by CMS, according to agency officials. Two modules track patients who have an infection associated with a medical device or resulting from a surgical procedure. Hospitals only report on resistance in these modules for specific combinations of antibiotics and bacteria, such as carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The third module tracks certain hospital patients who test positive for certain multidrug -resistant infections, including methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA )\u2014a type of bacteria f ound on people 's skin that is usually harmless but can cause serious infections, according to CDC.33However, according to CDC, many antibiotic - resistant infections detected during hospital care do not fall into one of these three modules and therefore woul d not be captured in NHSN, limiting CDC 's ability to identify important new resistances or trends. In 2014, to help address this limitation, CDC officials told us they introduced a new option for hospitals to report data on antibiotic resistance \u2014the Antimi crobial Resistance Option (AR Option). This option allows for reporting of data on antibiotic resistance for certain bacteria, regardless of whether the patient has a health care -associated infection.34In contrast to the other three modules, reporting to t he AR Option is voluntary. As a result, while about 86 percent of the 17,529 eligible U.S. health care facilities participate in at least one of the older three antibiotic -resistance reporting modules, only about 10 percent of the 6,836 eligible hospitals participate in the newer, voluntary AR Option, according to our analysis of 32CDC, VA, and DOD are collaborating to report some antibiotic resistance data to CDC via NHSN. 33The module tracks methicillin among others. 34Hospital types in NHSN include general acute care hospitals, critical access hospitals, children's hospitals, oncology hospitals, long -term a cute care hospitals, and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. The AR Option is part of a reporting module called the Antimicrobial Use and Resistance Module (AUR Module) that also tracks antimicrobial use through an \"AU Option.\" Health Care -Associated Infect ions Patients in settings such as hospitals and long-term care facilities (e.g., nursing homes) in many cases already have a weakened immune system or an underlying illness, making an antibiotic -resistant infection especially dangerous, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A high proportion of the morbidity and mortality associated with antibiotic resistance is seen in health care -associated infections. Tracking resistance in health care settings is therefore critical to natio nal surveillance efforts.

According to CDC officials, it is particularly challenging for many smaller hospitals and Indian Health Service facilities with resource constraints to participate, as it requires significant information technology investment.38The Jo int Public Health Informatics Task Force report noted two other common challenges: low capacity for information technologies needed to support data submission to the AR Option, and a lack of motivated leadership, such as a facility \"champion, \" to oversee t he development and maintenance of needed reporting infrastructure. For example, the maintenance of reporting infrastructure could address changes to electronic medical records that are not immediately compatible with the AR Option reporting format. 35Fewer facilities are elig ible for the AR Option because that option does not extend to, for example, dialysis clinics or long -term care facilities. These totals do not include military bases outside the United States. 36Our analysis found there were no hospitals in the five U.S. te rritories participating in the AR Option as of June 2019, although some hospitals were enrolled in NHSN and eligible to participate in the AR Option. 37The Joint Public Health Informatics Task Force is a coalition of nine national public health associations , co-chaired and staffed by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials and the National Association of County and City Health Officials, that helps U.S. governmental public health agencies build modern information systems across a spectrum o f public health programs. 38Beginning 2018, facility participation in the AUR Module was incentivized through making it an option for public health registry reporting under the Promoting Interoperability Program established by CMS to encourage clinicians a nd eligible hospitals, including critical access hospitals, to adopt, implement, upgrade, and demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology. CDC officials told us that the AUR Module requires all data to be reported electronic ally, because manual reporting of these data would be time and staff prohibitive. Letter Page 25 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance CDC off icials told us the agency is taking some steps to increase participation in the AR Option. For example, it is encouraging the over 1,500 hospitals (as of December 31, 2019) that are participating in a related reporting effort \u2014known as the Antimicrobial Use Option (AU Option) \u2014but not in the AR Option to participate in both. In addition, the agency is working with vendors of equipment and electronic health record software to make it easier for hospitals to participate in the AR Option. One of CDC 's goals for the AR Option is to use reported data to conduct regional and national assessments of resistance. To help meet this goal, officials said they would like participation by all eligible hospitals in the AR Option, but they have not determined the needed parti cipation rates or appropriate distribution of participating hospitals. Our past work has shown that leading practices for federal strategic planning include articulating specific goals, establishing a method to assess progress toward these goals, and align ing the plans and goals with the agency 's mission.39By taking steps to determine the participation rates and distribution of participation hospitals needed for CDC to meet its goal of conducting regional and national assessments of antibiotic resistance of public health importance, CDC would have more reasonable assurance that it can achieve its goal. The second challenge CDC faces is ensuring representativeness of its resistant gonorrhea surveillance system. CDC has classified resistant gonorrhea as one of the most urgent antibiotic -resistance threats in the nation, affecting over half a million patients annually. According to the agency, resistant gonorrhea warrants this designation because of the limited remaining treatment options, the high number of gon orrhea infections, potential adverse outcomes (such as increased transmission of 39We have previously reported that the strategic planning practices required at the federal agency level by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 can serve as leading practices for planning at lower levels within agencies such as individual programs or initiatives.

Letter Page 26 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance HIV), and the prospect that gonorrhea may become incurable if new resistance arises and spreads. It is not clear, however, that GISP data are representative of the general U.S. population because GISP draws on a limited sample of that population.40Specifically, GISP collects culture specimens \u2014-called isolates \u2014and accompanying epid emiologic data from only the first 25 men with inflammation of the urethra consistent with gonorrhea visiting each participating sexually transmitted disease clinic each month. It does not collect culture specimens from women. In addition, the number of participating clinics each year has varied from 21 to 30 (see fig. 2 for the current sites).41CDC estimates that the cases of gonorrhea identified through GISP surveillance represent only about 1 to 2 percent of all reported cases of gonorrhea in the United States each year. Further, the GISP sample design also over -represents cases in the western United States, where antibiotic -resistant gonorrhea has tended to initially emerge, according to CDC.42According to CDC, this design allows for more rapid detection of emerging resistance by ensuring a sufficient sample size from the western United States because resistance tends to emerge from that area. CDC has two projects \u2014Strengthening the United States Response to Resistant Gonorrhea (SURRG) and eGISP \u2014 intended t o, among other things, enhance domestic gonorrhea surveillance and learn more about the representativeness of GISP through limited testing of women and of body sites other than urethras, respectively.43 40GISP was established in 1986 not only to mo nitor resistance trends in gonorrhea, but also to provide a basis for the selection of therapies to treat gonorrhea. GISP data are thus important for informing treatment recommendations, which can directly affect health care provider prescribing practices. 41According to CDC officials, each sentinel site has used a standard protocol, sampling methods, and culture -based laboratory methods consistently since GISP's inception, allowing for interpretation of trends over time. Sentinel surveillance is the study o f disease rates in a specific cohort, such as in a geographic area or population subgroup to estimate trends in a larger population. 42According to CDC, isolates from the western United States are over -represented in GISP compared with the geographic distri bution of nationally reported gonococcal infections in men. For example, CDC reported that in 2014, isolates from the West represented 40 percent of GISP isolates but less than 25 percent of reported cases. 43SURRG is a project to enhance domestic gonorrhe a surveillance and infrastructure and build capacity for rapid detection and response to resistant gonorrhea, among other things. eGISP was mentioned earlier in this report. The Urgent Threat of Resistant Gonorrhea According to the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention (CDC), gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States, with over 500,000 infections reported in 2017. However, CDC estimates that the true number could be as many as 820,000 each year. In add ition to being a very common infection, gonorrhea is developing resistance to treatment options. As recently as 2006, CDC had five recommended options, but it estimates that nearly half of U.S. infections are now resistant to available antibiotics, includi ng combinations. Consequently, it now recommends only one regimen. In 2014, a case of dual -therapy failure was reported in the United Kingdom, and in February 2018, a similar case in the United Kingdom was reported that also failed to respond to the last -resort therapy, spectinomycin, resulting in treatment failure. As of June 2019, CDC reported that it had not received any reports of verified clinical treatment failures to any cephalosporin in the United States.

In the Gonococc al Isolate Surveillance Program, selected demographic and clinical data are abstracted from medical records, and isolates are tested for antibiotic susceptibility at regional laboratories. However, CDC 's current methodology may limit its ability to establi sh a representative trend. According to CDC officials, GISP could improve its representativeness by adding clinics or covering more of the population at its current sites. However, efforts to expand GISP would be difficult due to limited local capacity (se e text box). Letter Page 29 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Barriers to Expanding the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Program (GISP) GISP currently tracks a limited sample of the U.S. population. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials, a more thorough expansion of GIS P would be more difficult because of limited local capacity to conduct culture -based testing for resistance in gonorrhea. Specifically, laboratories increasingly use newer gonorrhea testing technology that gives more rapid results but cannot currently be u sed to test for resistance. This trend has contributed to the reduced capability of many laboratories to perform the gonorrhea culture -based testing for antibiotic susceptibility testing, to the point that many clinics cannot collect specimens for testing, according to CDC officials. Furthermore, officials said that adding new clinics to GISP would require financial and other resources for, among other things, establishing culture testing for resistance and information technology needed to report data to th e system. Most gonorrhea cases are diagnosed outside sexually transmitted disease clinics. However, expanding GISP to non -sexually transmitted disease clinic sites could be particularly costly and inefficient, officials said, because these sites tend to se e many fewer gonorrhea cases per year compared to sexually transmitted disease clinics; therefore they may not be able to contribute significant data to GISP. Through the Strengthening the United States Response to Resistant Gonorrhea (SURRG) project, CDC is currently exploring options to work with states to enhance gonorrhea testing capacity. This program was established in 2016 but has not received the funding needed to expand capacity to the extent CDC had planned. In addition, physicians and other provi ders have limited time to devote to data collection and reporting needed to participate in GISP. CDC officials also told us the reimbursement rates for providers for these services are inadequate. Source: GAO summary of CDC documents and interview with CDC officials. | GAO -20-341 CDC has taken some steps to assess the representativeness of the current GISP design, but it has not conducted a comprehensive study to assess the representativeness of the trends identified in GISP. A 2015 CDC evaluation conclude d that the representativeness of GISP was \"good \"on a scale of fair, good, or great.44However, the evaluation covered only part of fiscal year 2014 and consisted of a limited comparison of selected demographic characteristics captured in gonorrhea cases id entified in GISP to those captured through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, according to CDC officials, and which has its own limitations. Further, the results of this evaluation have not resulted in any changes to the GISP design. CDC officials told us they hope to learn more about the representativeness of GISP urethral isolates from testing women, patients in non -sexually transmitted disease clinic sites in the SURRG project and eGISP, and testing at other body sites, and then compar ing some of these results to those of GISP. However, these efforts overall were not specifically designed to fully assess the representativeness of GISP and may not 44A 2007 evaluation of GISP noted that only males are represented; private practice patients are not included; the system relies on urethral cultures, so isolates from pharyngeal and rectal cultures are not represented; only 25 -30 cities are represented; and these cities are weighted toward the West Coast. Letter Page 30 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance provide a sufficient assessment for impacting changes to the GISP design. CDC 's guidelines of efficient and effective public health surveillance systems state that, in order to be representative, the data from a public health surveillance system should accurately reflect the characteristic s of the health -related outcome \u2014such as resistant gonorrh ea\u2014under surveillance.45A more precise evaluation of the representativeness of the surveillance system can be done via carefully designed studies to obtain complete and accurate data for the health event in question \u2014namely, the urgent threat of antibiotic -resistant gonorrhea. By evaluating the surveillance system for resistant gonorrhea to ensure that it includes measures of its representativeness, such as by comparing the trends in the sample population with those in the overall U.S. population, using spec ially designed studies if needed, CDC would have better assurance that the trends detected in GISP accurately reflect the characteristics of the health -related outcome the system is designed to monitor. In addition to the limited design of GISP, CDC faces the challenge of competing priorities under reduced funding that precluded it from completing its plans to expand the SURRG project. The SURRG expansion was designed to address a National Action Plan goal of controlling resistant gonorrhea, among other thi ngs, but also affects surveillance, as CDC officials told us SURRG was established to address some limitations in GISP surveillance. Specifically, one of the plan 's milestones assigned to CDC is to maintain advanced capacity for rapid response to antibioti c-resistant gonorrhea for at least 20 state health departments. Such capacity includes detection, diagnosis, and investigation of suspected resistant cases within their state or region and assistance for health care providers in appropriately treating infe cted patients. CDC officials told us that because they received about half of the appropriations they had requested, CDC had to make cuts in some of 45These characteristics general ly relate to time, place, and person. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , vol. 50, no. RR -13 (20 01). Letter Page 31 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance their projects, and SURRG was one of those that CDC chose to reduce.46 Eight SURRG sites, rather than the 20 recommended by the National Action Plan, collect and analyze data. However, in its progress reports covering the first 4 years of the National Action Plan 's implementation, the CARB Task Force did not identify plans to address barriers related to expandin g the SURRG project.47The CARB Task Force coordinators told us that the progress reports have not identified plans to address barriers largely because the task force focused on reporting the agencies ' accomplishments in implementing the National Action Pla n. The coordinators also said that, in response to our inquiries during this review, the task force intends to identify agencies ' plans for addressing barriers in the progress report to be published in fall 2020. The Executive Order directs the CARB Task F orce to provide annual updates to the President on federal government actions to combat antibiotic resistance, including progress made in implementing the National Action Plan, plans for addressing any barriers preventing its full implementation, and recom mendations for any new or modified actions, taking federal government resources into consideration. Without reporting its plans to address such barriers, the CARB Task Force has not provided all the information required by the Executive Order and has not f ully carried out its role to facilitate and monitor implementation of the National Action Plan, which may reduce the effectiveness of federal efforts to combat antibiotic resistance. The third challenge CDC faces tracking antibiotic resistance is addressin g limitations to the use of test results in surveillance in health care settings. For example, some health care facilities are not using the most up -to-date testing methods for determining whether the bacteria causing an infection are resistant to certain antibiotics, according to CDC officials and a report 46For example, CDC officials provided documentation establishing that it requested $264.3 million for fiscal year 2016 for combating antibiotic -resistant bacteria initiatives. CDC also provided documentation supporting that its fiscal year 2016 operati ng plan included about $160 million for these initiatives; thus, CDC chose not to allocate the resources to implement all activities outlined in the National Action Plan, including the full implementation of the SURRG sites. 47CARB Task Force, National Acti on Plan: Progress Report for Years 1 and 2 , National Action Plan: Progress Report: Year 3 , and National Action Plan: Progress Report: Year 4 . Letter Page 32 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance from the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Task Force.48In addition, laboratories may only report an interpretation of the test result to CDC (e.g., whether the bacteria is resistant or susceptible to a n antibiotic) and not the quantitative results (e.g., measures of the growth of bacteria in the presence of the antibiotic). This presents a challenge for comparing data from different laboratories, since they may not be using consistent testing thresholds for determining antibiotic resistance. Another limitation is that some test equipment may be designed to give limited results for the purposes of guiding treatment recommendations and stewardship efforts, which may also limit the information available to CDC.49For example, the test may inform the user that the infection is susceptible to one antibiotic but \"suppress \" information on susceptibility to other antibiotics, in order to guide the user toward treatment with the preferred first -line treatment. The Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Task Force report noted that some suppression is done by the testing equipment itself and some by software systems that record, manage, and store data for clinical laboratories. CDC officials told us they are working with some diagnostic test manufacturers to explore these issues and develop solutions to address them. The Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Task Force is also working to address the diagnostic test challenges related to antibiotic resistance surveillance. Challenges in Reporting Complete and Timely Information on Magnitude and Trends CDC also faces challenges in reporting timely and complete information on the magnitude of and trends in antibiotic resistance in the agency 's Threats Reports. One challenge is i n providing information in these reports on the uncertainties in reported numbers of deaths from antibiotic - resistant infections. Another challenge is in issuing such reports in regular, timely intervals. As a result of these challenges, among others, the true magnitude of, and trends in, antibiotic resistance over time are unknown, including trends in various places and among people with various characteristics. 48The 2018 report from the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Task Force, led by the Council of State and Territor ial Epidemiologists, indicated that although FDA has adopted new breakpoints for antibiotic resistance tests and equipment manufacturers are able to implement them, many clinical laboratories use some old breakpoints. The task force further noted that stan dardized and widely used up -to-date breakpoints are fundamental to quality of data and the effective and coordinated action based on the data. 49We discuss antibiotic stewardship later in this report. Letter Page 33 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Surveillance for antibiotic resistance is complex and costly, according to experts at our meeti ng, CDC officials, and literature we reviewed. Experts told us such surveillance encompasses diverse pathogens, diseases, and health care settings and requires a variety of data sources and collection efforts. Furthermore, experts from our meeting told us the fundamental data required \u2014such as data on the number of illnesses and deaths attributable to resistance and data on related health care costs \u2014are currently insufficient. One expert added that there is a lack of real -time monitoring data, such as data t hat are available within hours or days of being generated. The data gaps are especially large for infections acquired in the community, as opposed to in a health care setting, because there is very limited tracking of such infections and whether they are resistant. As a result, CDC officials said, it is challenging to provide ranges of uncertainty, a critical component of any effort to measure and report on magnitude and trends.50 Neither the 2013 Threats Report nor the 2019 Threats Report provided quantitat ive measures of uncertainty, such as confidence intervals, for CDC 's estimates of morbidity and mortality resulting from antibiotic - resistant infections. For example, the report stated that there are at least 23,000 deaths a year as a direct result of anti biotic -resistant infections, but it did not include an upper limit or a single point estimate for this number. Similarly, the 2019 Threats Report stated that there are at least 35,900 deaths a year, without an upper limit or a single point estimate. A recent re-estimate by a group of scientists has put the likely minimum number of deaths annually in the United States at approximately 153,000, or about four times the 2019 CDC minimum estimate.51 CDC officials told us that because of several limitations, its e stimates were the best that could be derived from the data available. For example, for the 2013 Threats Report, CDC only had data from a national hospital survey intended to produce estimates of all health care -associated infections and indirect estimates of the proportion of infections that were 50One type of uncertainty range is the confidence interva l, which gives a range of values that is likely to include the true value. In the case of CDC's 2013 Threats Report and the Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 report, confidence intervals would provide a range for the number of infect ions and deaths, along with a degree of confidence \u2014usually expressed as a percentage \u2014that the true values fall with that range. 51J. P. Burnham, M. A. Olsen, and M. H. Kollef, \"Re -estimating Annual Deaths Due to Multidrug -Resistant Organism Infections,\" Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology , vol. 40, no. 1 (2019): pp. 112 -113. This recent estimate by a group of scientists has put the likely minimum number of deaths annually in the United States at approximately 153,000. Lette r Page 34 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance resistant. These data did allow CDC to calculate confidence intervals for infections by specific pathogens, but this information was not disclosed in the Threats Reports. Because the data sources were not intended for this purpose, the 2013 intervals were wide, from approximately 26 percent to 380 percent of the point estimates for each pathogen. CDC officials told us they elected not to include these ranges of uncertainties to avoid confusion in the 2013 Threats Re port, because the report was intended for a variety of audiences, including the general public. Officials told us they planned to provide confidence intervals in an appendix of the 2019 Threats Report, but they did not.52CDC officials explained that they elected not to include confidence intervals in the 2019 Threats Report because several publications are pending that provide more granular data for many of the estimates included in the report.53It is thus unclear whether CDC plans to include any measures o f uncertainties in future Threats Reports. Federal standards for agency dissemination of information it produces stipulate that when information products are disseminated, error estimates are calculated and disseminated to support assessment of the appropr iateness of the uses of the estimates or projections.54Providing measures of uncertainties in antibiotic resistance estimates, such as standard errors or confidence intervals, as appropriate, in its Threats Reports would help CDC and others compare informa tion within and across reporting efforts, without having to consult multiple documents over time. CDC and others could use this information to draw appropriate conclusions about the characteristics of antibiotic resistance in the United States, including l imitations associated with reported findings and conclusions. Additionally, CDC does not have a plan for timely, regular issuance of their Threats Reports. It took CDC over 6 years to update the 2013 Threats report. CDC officials told us this length of tim e between reports 52Both the 2013 and 2019 CDC Threa ts Reports have an appendix that discusses sources of data and methodologies but does not provide estimates of uncertainties. In some cases, CDC disclosed ranges, such as for the attributable costs of certain C. difficile infections. 53CDC officials told us they wanted to publish CDC's methodology in a peer -reviewed journal to allow for stakeholder input. They said multiple publications, including articles containing confidence intervals for some pathogens in the 2019 Threats Report, are pending. 54Office of Management and Budget, Standards and Guidelines for Statistical Surveys (September 2006). Letter Page 35 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance was in part because, following issuance of the 2013 Threats Report, the agency was focused on implementing priority actions to improve antibiotic resistance surveillance data, including those efforts prescribed by the National Action Plan . In some cases, implementing these actions involved new data collection efforts that took time to establish, including that it can take up to 2 years to get new surveillance variables cleared by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), CDC officials tol d us. In addition, CDC officials said it is time consuming to coordinate across the decentralized structure of antibiotic -resistance tracking at CDC to compile a consolidated report. However, lack of timely, regular updates may affect the information available to the public as well as policy -makers. For example, the 2013 Threats Report stated that there are at least 23,000 deaths a year as a direct result of antibiotic -resistant infections. The 2019 report stated the number of deaths each year to be at leas t 35,900 deaths a year. This report also revised the 2013 estimate from 23,000 to 44,000 deaths a year, suggesting a nearly two -fold revision to the initial 2013 estimate. CDC officials told us they would like to publish the report more frequently than eve ry 6 years, and that it is reasonable they would develop such a plan for frequency of publication following the 2019 report. However, they said the agency does not currently have a plan for how often it will release future consolidated reports.55CDC 's attr ibutes of efficient and effective public health surveillance systems include timely data dissemination for planning, implementing, and evaluating public health policies and programs.56By developing a plan for more frequent dissemination of consolidated rep orting on priority pathogens at regular intervals, CDC would have more timely trend data and other information necessary for users of the data, including policymakers, to prioritize, plan, implement, and evaluate public health actions to address antibiotic resistance. 55According to the 2013 Threats Report, CDC stated it would update the assessment of priority bacteria at least every 5 years, although it did not specify that the rep orting of the priority bacteria would occur every 5 years. CDC officials told us CDC shares antibiotic resistance data at regular intervals, such as through GISP reports, but these are for specific pathogens or subsets. This does not address the timing of regular reporting of CDC's consolidated reports, such as the 2013 and 2019 Threats Reports. 56Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems.\" Letter Page 36 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Challenges in Tracking and Assessing the Global Threat Through interviews with WHO and CDC officials, experts at our meeting, and document reviews, we identified three key challenges to CDC 's ability to detect antibiotic resistance threats from abroad.57These challenges are as follows: \u00b7 Data completeness, quality, and representativen ess. Data on antibiotic resistance from the national surveillance systems of some countries are incomplete because of a lack of capability and resources for implementing standardized protocols, according to WHO officials. Moreover, most information on anti biotic -resistant infections is limited to laboratory test data and does not include epidemiological data, such as data on the patient and location, which could provide additional insight about the circumstances around the resistant infection. Also, a lack of a sampling strategy for the detection of cases that are antibiotic -resistant may bias the representativeness of the data and interpretation of results. Specifically, when case identification is done only on the population of patients that seeks medical care and is tested, or when testing of the population varies such as across health care settings, the incidence and trends determined from this population may not represent the total population of concern. \u00b7 Aggregated data reporting. Some countries report a ggregated, rather than isolate, or infection -level, data to the WHO 's Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), a practice that WHO officials stated creates a challenge for data analysis and results interpretation.58According to official s, such aggregation limits statistical analysis that can be performed and limits analysis of factors such as the specific antibiotic -resistant bacteria, or the age or gender of the patient, among other things. 57International surveillance, including surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, is a key component of the 2018 U.S. National Biodefence Strategy. Specifically, the strategy states that \"Goal 1: Enable risk awareness to inform decision -making across the biodefen se enterprise\" is to build risk awareness by ensuring that domestic and international biosurveillance and information -sharing systems are coordinated and are capable of timely bioincident prevention, detection, assessment, response, and recovery. The White House. National Biodefense Strategy, 2018 (Washington, D.C: September 2018). 58An expert from our meeting later told us that WHO has begun to collect some isolate - level data within the GLASS platform, and it is working to expand these isolate -level reporti ng modules. The Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System In October 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS). The objectives of GLASS are to foster national surveillance systems and harmonized global standards and estimate the extent and burden of antimicrobial resistance globally by selected indicators, among other things. As of November 2019, 86 countries were enrol led in GLASS, a 25 percent increase over 2018. Participants were in various stages of economic development (13 lower -income countries, 23 lower -middle - income countries, 17 upper -middle -income countries, and 33 high -income countries) and in all WHO regions. Seventy -five countries provided descriptive information on their surveillance systems for tracking antimicrobial resistance, and 57 countries provided resistance data for 2018. Source: GAO summary of WHO information. | GAO -20-341 Letter Page 37 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance \u00b7 Surveillance is a complex function. Many diffe rent health care and public health professionals are involved in the multistep process for generating data, according to a WHO report on GLASS. According to WHO officials, obtaining the staff commitment and training needed to ensure high -quality data can p ose a challenge to public health agencies and health care organizations. As we noted above, CDC has worked with, and continues to work with, international partners to expand surveillance of antibiotic resistance abroad, including through U.S. participation in GLASS. For example, CDC has helped develop technical guidance for surveillance programs in other countries and has organized international forums for surveillance. CDC officials also told us portions of domestic surveillance systems data collection inc lude collection of patient travel history. Federal Agencies Have Helped Advance Diagnostic T ests and Promoted Their Use, but These Efforts Have Limitations Federal agencies have helped advance the development of new FDA - authorized tests and the use of exis ting tests for diagnosing antibiotic - resistant infections, but these efforts have limitations. Specifically, HHS and DOD have funded studies and taken other steps to advance testing, but they have not defined leadership, roles, and responsibilities to address a key barrier to the use of tests: a lack of clinical outcome studies. FDA has taken additional steps to advance testing; however, it has not regularly monitored test updates. Letter Page 38 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Agency Efforts toward the Development and Use of Diagnostic T ests HHS and DOD Have Funded the Developmen t of New Tests HHS and DOD have awarded grants and contracts for the development of new FDA -authorized tests for diagnosing antibiotic -resistant infections.59 Some of these awards address specific needs in the current availability of FDA-authorized tests, w hile others support more general research and development efforts. In addition, these agencies have taken steps to help reduce the chances of duplicative funding. According to experts, tests for antibiotic resistance not only help clinicians decide what an tibiotics to use, they also provide important information for surveillance, including the number of cases of resistant infections in a population and the mechanisms of resistance. Agencies have funded the development of some tests to address critical needs . We identified three such needs through interviews with federal agency officials and with experts. Specifically, according to agency officials and experts, there are no FDA -authorized tests that can do the following: \u00b7 Detect resistant gonorrhea or resistan t campylobacter infection, which CDC identified as urgent and serious threats, respectively, in both the 2013 and 2019 Threats Reports. 59This report focuses on FDA -authorized tests, which account for the majority of tests used in the United States, according to experts. According to FDA officials, there are non - FDA-authorized diagnostic tests for resistance available for all ba cteria, including all of those on the 2013 threats list. Non -FDA-authorized tests can only be conducted by laboratory personnel meeting proficiency standards set by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment. However, experts told us the majority of tes ts used in the United States are FDA -authorized tests. For example, one expert estimated that more than 95 percent of laboratories using culture -based tests \u2014tests that examine how well bacteria grow in the presence of an antibiotic \u2014in the United States use some FDA - authorized tests. Challeng es in Addressing Diagnostic Test Gaps According to federal documents and literature, challenges to diagnostic test development include: \u00b7 Lengthy and costly regulatory requirements, including additional regulatory hurdles in other countries \u00b7 Limitations in te chnical feasibility assessments due to intellectual property protection and conflict of interest requirements \u00b7 Differences in expertise between manufacturers and regulatory bodies \u00b7 Limited evidence on cost -effectiveness and clinical outcomes for using tests \u00b7 Limited resources in some settings to transport specimens, conduct, and maintain tests Source: GAO summary of Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria and other documents. | GAO -20-341 Letter Page 39 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance \u00b7 Rapidly detect resistance for seven other priority bacteria, according to the 2013 Threats Report.60 \u00b7 Differentiate betwee n viral and bacterial infections. Such a test would be useful primarily in preventing use of antibiotics for viral infections, which can contribute to the development of resistance in bacteria, among other things. HHS and DOD have awarded funding to addres s these needs. For example: \u00b7 CARB -X\u2014a program supported by NIH and BARDA within HHS \u2014has awarded funding to a company to develop a rapid test to both diagnose gonorrhea and test for antibiotic resistance. \u00b7 CARB -X is funding other companies to, among other thi ngs, develop rapid testing for identification of and resistance in bloodstream infections, including for some priority bacteria. \u00b7 In September 2016, NIH and BARDA announced the Antimicrobial Resistance Rapid, Point -of-Need Diagnostic Test Challenge. As of December 2019, there were five finalists, working on such projects as developing a rapid test to differentiate viral from bacterial infections and developing a test that can identify or detect antibiotic -resistant bacteria, including antibiotic -resistant go norrhea.61 \u00b7 Within DOD, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency officials told us that the agency used fiscal year 2015 funding on contracts for the development of rapid molecular tests for resistant gonorrhea and to distinguish between viral and bacte rial infections. Federal agencies have also funded more general research and development efforts related to resistance testing. For example: 60The seven priority bacteria are Streptococcus , and clindamycin -resistan t Group B Streptococcus. FDA officials noted there is no test for resistant C. difficile , but we do not count this as a gap because CDC's priority bacteria list does not include resistant C. difficile, only C. difficile . There is no single federal definiti on of the term \"rapid.\" It can range from minutes to hours, depending on context. 61According to NIH officials, NIH is responsible for the overall coordination, oversight, and management of the challenge. It is anticipated that all tests will have a maximum time to result of 90 minutes. Letter Page 40 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance \u00b7 NIH officials told us their agency has supported extramural projects related to the development of tests for antibi otic resistance by issuing grants and entering into contracts since fiscal year 2015. \u00b7 Separately from the Antimicrobial Resistance Diagnostic Challenge, BARDA entered into contracts with three organizations to develop tests focusing on the advanced stages of test development, including clinical trials, according to BARDA officials. \u00b7 Within DOD, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency is funding three projects using Other Transaction Authority or direct funding to a DOD Service laboratory, for developing tests.62 Federal agencies have also taken steps to help reduce the chances of duplicative funding, including working with some international efforts to develop tests, according to agency officials. For example, NIH reviews current and pending support of key project personnel prior to issuing of any research award, to help ensure NIH support complements support from other agencies and organizations. Similarly, officials from HHS 's Office of Global Affairs worked during the creation and launch of the NIH - BARDA challen ge and an analogous United Kingdom innovation foundation competition called the Longitude Prize to help ensure these programs were designed to support different aspects of needed diagnostics.63 HHS Has Funded Some Studies of Clinical Outcomes, but Has Not Clearly Identified Leadership, Roles, and Responsibilities HHS has funded some studies to assess the extent to which testing patients to identify whether they have antibiotic -resistant infections leads to improved clinical outcomes, such as more effective t reatment for patients or more judicious use of antibiotics.64However, HHS ha s not 62Other Transaction Authority, in this case, is the term used by DOD to refer to legal acquisition instruments other than contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements, to carry out certain prototype projects. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2371b . 63The Longitude Prize, run by a United Kingdom -based innovation foundation, is a 10 million pound prize with an 8 million pound payout intended to foster the development of an affordable, rapid, point -of-care test that will conserve antibiotics and improv e delivery of global health care. See \"Longitude Prize,\" accessed May 22, 2019, https://longitudeprize.org . 64Previously, we reported that clinical benefits have not been well -established for some types of tests f or infectious diseases. GAO, Medical Devices: Challenges and Capabilities to Enable Rapid Diagnoses of Infectious Diseases , GAO -17-347 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 14, 2017). Letter Page 41 GAO-20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance identified relevant leadership, roles, and responsibilities among the HHS agencies that could fund such studies. Clinical outcome studies are important for encouraging the u se of diagnostic tests for antibiotic resistance, among other things, because such studies can demonstrate the benefits of those tests. According to PACCARB, there is very limited information on why clinicians sometimes forgo diagnostic testing, but one po ssible explanation is that there may be limited data demonstrating the value of such testing. In the absence of such data, a clinician may choose to treat the patient immediately rather than using a test for antibiotic resistance that has unknown value. Research into the clinical outcomes associated with such testing could therefore be used to help promote the use of those resistance tests that are found to be beneficial. As a result, patient care could be improved and clinicians could be guided towards app ropriate antibiotics to prescribe. Two HHS agencies have awarded grants for studies on the clinical outcomes of resistance testing, according to agency officials. For example, NIH provided grant support for a study that found, among other things, that usin g a rapid blood test for a range of potential bacteria and antibiotic resistance led to more judicious use of antibiotics.65Similarly, officials from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) stated that the agency is funding investigator -initiated grant studies to assess the impact of tests on antibiotic stewardship. However, agency officials only mentioned these and a few other examples of studies they have funded on clinical outcomes. 65R.

S1 (2017): pp. S41 -S47. Letter Page 42 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Agency officials and experts agree that more needs to be done to evaluate clinical outcomes associated with use of d iagnostic tests for antibiotic resistance. For example, in 2017, PACCARB reported that \"there is a lack of clinical and economic outcome studies showing that any diagnostic test could prevent the emergence of antibiotic -resistant bacteria and would be cost effective. \"66Officials we interviewed from AHRQ, BARDA, CDC, FDA, and NIH all agreed with that PACCARB statement. Additionally, experts told us that such studies are lacking but important for advancing the use of tests. For example, one health care organi zation official told us the decision to adopt a test is based at least in part on whether there will be a clinical benefit. An infectious disease expert noted that to provide incentives for test use there needs to be some evidence that tests affect and imp rove care, but that most tests do not come with any evaluation of how they perform in practice. International organizations expressed similar opinions. One reason for the relatively low number of studies is that those agencies that could conduct or fund di agnostic outcome studies have not clearly identified leadership, roles, and responsibilities for doing so. Although they agree that more such studies are needed, they have not identified which agency or agencies should take the lead, and what the roles of the other agencies should be. Instead, agencies have offered differing views on what each agency could do. For example, BARDA officials told us their agency has not funded such studies because it generally does not play a role in test adoption. BARDA offic ials, as well as officials from DOD and NIH, said that CDC should play a role in funding or conducting the studies. However, CDC officials told us that a lack of resources has prevented their agency from doing so, and that the responsibility should fall at least partly on BARDA. Our previous work shows that key practices for interagency collaboration include identifying a lead agency (or, if leadership is shared, clearly identifying roles and responsibilities among the lead agencies), as well as clarifying the roles and responsibilities of all participating agencies.67By taking these actions, agencies \u2014including AHRQ, BARDA, CDC, FDA, and NIH \u2014could more effectively address the need for clinical outcome 66Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria, Recomme ndations for Incentivizing the Development of Vaccines, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics to Combat Antibiotic Resistance (Washington, D.C.: September 2017). 67GAO, Managing for Results: Key Considerations for Implementing Interagency Collaborative Mechanisms, GAO -12-1022 (Washington, D.C.: September 27, 2012). International Needs for Diagnostic Tests for Antibiotic Resistance To better understand international needs for antibiotic resistance tests, we interviewed officials from international organizations and the Office of Global Affairs within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). A Public Health Englan d official told us that United Kingdom users are not confident that these tests will have a clinical impact or be cost effective. Similarly, an official from a trade organization of British medical test manufacturers told us that the value of tests for ant ibiotic resistance needs to be captured and disclosed, especially because people are more willing to pay for treatment than for tests. However, other factors could also be important in determining which tests will be useful internationally. World Health Organization officials told us that they are working to determine what characteristics health care providers worldwide identify as key to making tests useful, so industry can develop such tests. They noted that tests designed for use in the United States may not be suitable for use in other countries. They also noted that laboratories in developing countries may not have the capacity to culture bacteria, so many need to use culture - independent tests. Office of Global Affairs officials told us that a big chall enge is developing accessible tests for use internationally. Their ideal test would be inexpensive, rapid, and capable of point - of-care use. They noted that cost and usability are the barriers to test use, not technology, and that use of existing tests rem ains limited, including within the United States. Source: GAO summary of interviews with HHS and international organizations | GAO -20-341 Letter Page 43 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance studies. Those studies, in turn, could help demonstrate t he value of diagnostic tests for antibiotic resistance, potentially increasing their use, improving patient care, and enhancing stewardship efforts. CMS and FDA Have Taken Steps to Advance the Use of Tests, but Experts Have Identified Challenges with Payme nts CMS and FDA have taken some steps to advance the use of tests, including those to identify antibiotic -resistant bacteria. For example, FDA established a Payor Communication Task Force, which helps facilitate communication between test manufacturers and payors.68Such communication is important because payors decide whether tests will be covered by insurance, among other things. According to an FDA web page, by communicating with payors, test manufacturers could, for example, learn what data payors need t o approve a test for coverage and then use this information to design clinical trials to provide that information. This process could reduce the time between when a test is cleared or approved by FDA and when it is covered.69 A similar step FDA and CMS took to advance the use of tests was to extend the Parallel Review program indefinitely, a move they announced in 2016. This program established a mechanism for FDA and CMS to simultaneously review clinical data, with the aim of reducing the time between FDA 's approval and CMS 's decision on whether to pay for the test.70 Experts told us challenges remain with test payments that may result in lower test use. For example, a PACCARB report states that \"currently, [payment] for many diagnostic tests is not aligned w ith the value of the test,\" and noted that supplementing payments for tests could drive test 68According to an FDA web page, payors include public payors such as CMS, private health plans, health technology assessment groups, and others who provide input into coverage, procurement, and reimbursement decisions. See Food and Drug Administration, \"Payor Communication Task Force,\" accessed September 26, 2019, https://www.fda.gov/about -fda/cdrh -innovation/payor -communication -task-force . FDA told us this task force was established approximately 5 years ago. 69CMS officials told us they prefer the term \"payment\" to describe what documents such as the Natio nal Action Plan and PACCARB report call \"reimbursement.\" 70This mechanism would pertain to tests receiving marketing authorization as de novo devices, but not to tests cleared under the 510(k) process based on a determination of substantial equivalence to a n already legally marketed test. Letter Page 44 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance development and use. BARDA officials also told us that a major factor affecting adoption of new tests is the cost of the test relative to reimbursement. Additional ly, experts, including those at our meeting, told us that test payments remain insufficient to encourage broad test use.71 For example, two experts from our meeting said that there is not always a clear link between the medical value of a test and the payme nt level for that test. One of these experts added that their laboratory decided not to adopt a test because low payment levels relative to costs made doing so a money -losing proposition. Three other experts we interviewed agreed that disparities between c ost and payment can discourage test adoption. Regarding federal payments for tests involving CMS and their payments through Medicaid and Medicare, there are limits to CMS 's ability to address any disparities. For example, CMS officials told us the payments for some tests are based on a weighted, median, private -payor rates pursuant to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, so CMS cannot specify the methodology used to set those rates.72Further, for inpatient tests, Medicare pays hospitals a single, bundled payment per patient stay, which is based on multiple factors, including the patient 's diagnosis and treatment strategy, rather than on a specific service. As such, a separate payment for individual tests is not made under Medicare. 71We did not independently verify expert claims regarding payments for test use. 72Pub. L. No. 113 -93, \u00a7 216, 128 Stat. 1040, 1053 (codified in pertinent part at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395m -1(b)). Letter Page 45 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance FDA Efforts to Advance the Development of New T ests FDA Has Taken Steps to Speed the Development of Tests for Newly Approved Antibiotics FDA has taken steps toward the development of FDA -authorized tests for resistance for newly approved antibiotics \u2014a process that curre ntly can take months to years, according to experts and agency officials.73The delay stems in part from the need for a critical testing threshold known as a breakpoint \u2014the threshold that is used to help a clinician decide whether or not a pathogen is resis tant to the antibiotic (see text box).74The breakpoint of a new antibiotic is generally finalized only when FDA has approved the antibiotic. This means that breakpoints may often not be available for test manufacturers until after a new antibiotic is FDA - approved.75As a result, test manufacturers generally may not be able to complete developing FDA -authorized culture -based tests for resistance to a specific antibiotic until after the antibiotic is commercially available. The result is that the development o f such culture -based tests may be generally delayed even after the new antibiotic is approved by FDA. This delay could affect the ability of clinicians to treat patients. For example, according to an expert, such a delay could lead to underuse of a newly available antibiotic, among other things, because a clinician may not be willing to prescribe the antibiotic without test results to guide treatment. 73According to FDA, different types of tests generally have different times for development after FDA approval of a new antibiotic. For example, some automated tests are the most delayed in being submitted for FDA clearance because of the sophistication of such tests. FDA officials told us one exception is for a type of test called \"disk diffusion tests\" that are evaluated as part of the drug approval process for new antibiotics. Such tests are often cleared within weeks of drug approval. 74Culture -based tests examine how well bacteria grow in th e presence of an antibiotic. Another type of resistance test is a genotypic test, which directly detects genes that can make bacteria resistant. We focus on culture -based tests. 75One test manufacturer stated that there is a risk that the new antibiotic wil l ultimately not be approved by FDA. Thus, test manufacturers may wait for more certainty regarding the approval of a new antibiotic before committing resources to developing a test for it. Letter Page 46 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance How Breakpoints Are Used to Interpret Tests According to officials from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA), breakpoints, also referred to as \"susceptibility test interpretive criteria, \" are used to define susceptibility and resistance to antibiotics to help guide patient care. Culture -based tests rely on breakpoints to provide a determination of resistance to clinicians. In the United States, breakpoints (based on clinical or microbiological data) are established by standards - development organizations such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and FDA. One example of how breakpoints are used involves the Kirby -Bauer disk diffusion test. This test is conducted by spreading bacteria on a laboratory agar plate containing bacterial nutrients, and then placing paper disks containing a known amount of antibiotics on the \"lawn\" of bacteria. Plat es are observed after overnight incubation to determine the extent of bacterial growth. Closer to the disk, there is a higher concentration of antibiotic, and the concentration declines with distance. Around most disks, there is a \"zone of inhibition, \" where the concentration of antibiotic is too high for bacteria to grow. After allowing the bacteria to grow for a defined period of time, the diameter of the zone of inhibition is measured in millimeters. Procedure for Assessing Antibiotic Resistance Using B reakpoints If the diameter is larger than or equal to the breakpoint, then the strain of bacteria is considered susceptible to the antibiotic, suggesting that the antibiotic can be used to treat infections caused by that strain. If the diameter is smaller than the breakpoint, then the strain is considered resistant, suggesting that the antibiotic should not be used. According to FDA, in most cases, there is a range of \"intermediate \" or \"susceptible dose -dependent \" diameters for which treatment might be effe ctive. Other types of culture -based diagnostic tests for resistance have analogous breakpoints for interpreting the test. For example, the minimum inhibitory concentration \u2014the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that prevents growth of bacteria \u2014can be co mpared to a breakpoint to establish whether the bacteria are considered resistant. Source: GAO summary of interviews and documents from FDA and others. | GAO -20-341 Letter Page 47 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance In addition to antibiotic developers waiting until FDA approves an antibiotic before a bre akpoint is finalized, there are technical hurdles in developing a test for some new antibiotics, according to FDA officials. For example, it may be challenging for certain automated test manufacturers to address unique growth properties of certain bacteria in the presence of specific antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics. According to a test manufacturer, these hurdles include the need for additional studies, and such studies may not be straightforward because of the need to determine what clinical dat a FDA requires.76In addition, in the case of automated tests, a representative from a test manufacturer association told us the software used to run and interpret a new test needs to be revised, which can be time consuming. The delay between approval of an antibiotic and the availability of a test for resistance could result in suboptimal treatment and increase burdens on the health care system. For example, o ne expert stated that during this delay, laboratories need to create or modify tests and then valid ate those tests instead of using a FDA-authorized test, which increases the time required and places demands on facility personnel and budgets. This expert added that to conduct validation studies, the laboratories need a variety of samples for testing, ca lled \"isolates, \" which may not be available. A second expert said that the delay leads to both overuse and underuse of the new antibiotic: in the absence of a test, some clinicians will prescribe the antibiotic when it may be inappropriate, leading to overuse; some other clinicians refrain from prescribing the antibiotic, even if appropriate, leading to underuse. To help address this delay, FDA has created a process known as coordinated development, whereby test manufacturers can submit a coordinated develo pment plan to FDA describing the test manufacturer 's intent to coordinate with the antibiotic manufacturer. The plan is submitted 76FDA officials told us FDA provides guidance documents that can he lp address this issue. These include Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems (Aug. 28, 2009) and Department of Health and Human Serv ices, Food and Drug Administration, Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q -Submission Program, Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff (May 7, 2019). Letter Page 48 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance prior to, or shortly after, submission of an application to market a new drug.77 Under the coordinated development program, FDA shares breakpoint information from the antibiotic manufacturer with a prospective test manufacturer.78It then reviews the test application at the same time as the antibiotic application and takes other steps to facilitate more timely clearance of the test . FDA officials told us this process has significantly reduced the delay between approval of the antibiotic and clearance of the test.79 Another FDA step to help test manufacturers speed development of tests is the establishment, in collaboration with CDC, of a centralized repository of bacterial strains with well -characterized antibiotic resistance profiles. These strains are available to test manufacturers and others to help them design, validate, and evaluate tests by checking that they give the correct results for bacteria whose profile of antibiotic resistance is known.80 Finally, FDA officials also said that they offer pre -submission advice, whereby a test manufacturer can ask for initial guidance on the design of clinical studies for their tests. 77Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Coordinated Development of Antimicrobial Drugs and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Devices: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff; Availability , 84 Fed. Reg. 1152 (Feb. 1, 2019). FDA guidance pertaining to the development of antimicrobial drugs may apply to drugs that inhibit or destroy bacteria or fungi. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(jj); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d -5(k). 78FDA officials told us this information can only be shared if the drug and test manufacturers permit it. 79For s pecific drugs approved since coordinated development was implemented, FDA provided some examples of the time from drug approval to device clearance for those tests that used coordinated development versus those that did not. While we did not independently confirm the times that resulted from the coordinated development process, examples of tests FDA provided us that used coordinated development had shorter times from drug approval until test clearance compared to tests that did not. 80See Food and Drug Admin istration, \"The CDC and FDA Antimicrobial Resistance Isolate Bank,\" accessed January 21, 2020, https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMed icalProcedures/InVitroDiagnostics/u cm454677.htm . CDC stated it is responsible for the collection, maintenance, and restocking of these specimen banks. FDA noted that the day -to-day operation and the vast majority of the financial support is provided by CD C. Letter Page 49 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance FDA Ha s Taken Steps to Improve Breakpoint Recognition In the United States, breakpoints are established and updated by organizations such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).81After CLSI establishes a breakpoint, FDA may review and recogniz e the breakpoint, according to FDA officials. Test manufacturers rely on breakpoints recognized by FDA to support marketing authorization of their tests.82 An expert who works for CLSI identified more than 50 breakpoints that have not been recognized by FDA , and for which CLSI considers FDA recognition important in order to help make FDA -authorized tests available.83Experts, including one from our meeting, cited the following examples of breakpoints needing recognition: 81The 21st Century Cures Act authorized FDA to recognize breakpoints developed by a nationally or internationally recognized standard development organization if the standard development organization meets specified criteria. 21st Century Cures Act, Pub. L. No. 114-255, \u00a73044, 130 Stat. 1115 -16 (Dec. 13, 2016), codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360a -2. According to FDA, CLSI is the only organization for which FDA has made such a determination. Additionally, FDA also recognizes breakpoints that are different from CL SI, due to basic disagreements in scientific rationales for those breakpoints, among other reasons. One expert at our meeting told us that a common reason for FDA not recognizing a breakpoint is that the breakpoint may be associated with an unapproved, or \"off-label,\" use of an antibiotic, such as use of the antibiotic at an unapproved dose. Once FDA approves a drug, clinicians sometimes prescribe the drug for an unapproved use when they judge that it is medically appropriate for their patient. However, our report is not only about unapproved uses. FDA -recognized breakpoints are available online as part of the 21st Century Cures Act requirements. See Food and Drug Administration, \"Antibacterial Susceptibility Test interpretive Criteria,\" 82Genotypic tests do not rely on breakpoints and ca n still be cleared by FDA in the absence of breakpoints. FDA told us when FDA does not recognize a breakpoint, it may still identify a separate breakpoint, or interpretive criteria, appropriate for use by a test manufacturer in the development of its tests , under section 511A(b)(2)(B) , 511A(c)(1) and (c)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 360a -2(b)(2)(B), 360a - 2(c)(1), and FDA has not yet done so. 83While we did not independently verify the claim of im portance, we confirmed that there are over 50 breakpoint discrepancies between a list provided by an expert working with CLSI in October 2018, and the breakpoints listed on the FDA website. See Food and Drug Administration, \"Antibacterial Susceptibility Te st Interpretive Criteria.\" CLSI does not consider all 50 breakpoints to be of the same priority, according to the expert. We did not confirm the list provided by the expert against CLSI documentation. Letter Page 50 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance \u00b7 CDC recommends a dual therapy of antib iotics \u2014azithromycin and ceftriaxone \u2014to be taken together to treat gonorrhea.84However, FDA does not recognize any azithromycin breakpoints for N. gonorrhoeae , which an expert from our meeting told us could be a barrier to developing FDA -authorized culture -based tests for N. gonorrhoeae resistance to the recommended dual therapy.85 \u00b7 Colistin is an antibiotic used in hospitals because of its efficacy against carbapenem -resistant bacteria, according to one manufacturer of a test for colistin resistance. This man ufacturer markets its test in many countries but not in the United States, because FDA does not recognize colistin breakpoints.86 FDA has taken some steps to address unrecognized breakpoints, which are a potential barrier to developing some tests for antibi otic resistance.87 For example, FDA officials told us that the agency conducts regular internal reviews of breakpoints. According to FDA officials, the agency reviewed the 2019 CLSI breakpoint standards and updated FDA 's 84According to CDC officials, CDC is currently in the pr ocess of updating their treatment guidelines for gonorrhea. The earlier recommendation for dual therapy for gonorrhea with azithromycin and ceftriaxone was based on the theoretical benefit of providing a shield (azithromycin) to protect ceftriaxone from in creasing gonorrhea resistance. See K. A. Workowski and G. A. Bolan, \"Sexually Transmitted Treatment Guidelines, 2015,\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Recommendations and Reports, vol. 64, no.3 (2015). Given increasing resistance to azithromycin now found in numerous pathogens and the continued importance of applying antibiotic stewardship principles to treatment decisions that impact the public's health, CDC is currently reviewing optimal gonorrhea treatment options for incorporation into forthcoming sexually -transmitted disease treatment guidelines. 85There are other challenges with making a test for resistant gonorrhea, including challenges in culturing the bacteria. However, without FDA -recognized breakpoints, surmounting those other challenges may not result in an FDA -authorized diagnostic test. FDA officials told us they received a comment requesting recognition of this breakpoint in June 12, 2019. 86According to FDA, it published a notice on June 10, 2019, concluding that the scientific data availa ble do not support recognizing breakpoints for colistin at this time. 87FDA officials told us that the biggest challenge that they see to recognizing breakpoints is the lack of necessary data to support breakpoint changes. FDA also told us it may not identi fy or recognize updated breakpoints unless there are data to support a scientific finding that breakpoints should be changed, under section 511A(a)(3) and (c)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 360a -2(a)(3) and (c)(2). Letter Page 51 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance website with changes to recognized b reakpoints as of June 2019. FDA has been posting such updates since December 13, 2017.88 FDA also accepts public comments requesting the recognition of new breakpoints, according to agency officials.89However, we found there was some confusion between CLSI officials and experts and the FDA involving the number of comments FDA could review each year, which FDA later clarified on its website . One expert at our meeting later told us that CLSI adjusts its process for submitting comments based in part on their un derstanding of FDA 's communication. This expert added that FDA making a public commitment to a specific number of comments they would review would help CLSI improve its planning. FDA officials told us there is no legal requirement for FDA to communicate th e number of comments the agency can review, but that in previously published notices of opportunities for public comments, there was nothing that indicated there would be limits. However, after we informed FDA officials of concerns by experts regarding the number of comments FDA could review, FDA updated their webpage to clarify that they will review all submitted comments.90 88Food and Drug Administration, \"Notice of Updates,\" accessed May 29, 2019, https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development of revised CLSI breakpoints or may reflect other types of changes to FDA's listed breakpoints, such as initial breakpoints identified by FDA at the time that a new drug is approved.

Because bacteria can develop increasing resistance to antibiotics, it is sometimes important to change the breakpoints used for determining whether or not bacteria are resis tant to a given antibiotic. Using tests with out -of-date breakpoints could result in misidentifying a resistant infection as non -resistant, which can lead to treating a patient with an ineffective antibiotic and the further spread of the infection. FDA officials told us the agency has taken limited steps to monitor the status of breakpoint updates, and that out -of-date breakpoints being used in tests should be a rare occurrence.91 In contrast, a CDC official told us that keeping tests updated is a significan t concern. This official cited the example of carbapenem - resistant Enterobacteriaceae infection, which triggers specific procedures to limit the spread of these bacteria. If the test breakpoint is out of date, the infection may not be detected in a timely manner, and the pathogen could spread broadly as a result. A recent study looking at hypothetical scenarios in one U.S. county estimated that a 32 -month delay in updating tests to match CLSI breakpoints for carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae would hav e resulted in an average of almost 2,000 91For example, FDA officials told us of its implementation of \"change protocols\" in 2019 for certain tests that were first implemented in 2019. These protocols permit device manufacturers, under certain conditions, to update test breakpoints frequently for cleared tests without the need to submit a new 510(k) for FDA review. FDA told us it expects this protocol will significantly reduce the time frame for updating device breakpoints when new breakpoints are published, while maintaining test safety and efficacy. FDA officials explained that this protocol will encourage manufacturers to incorporate up -to-date breakpoints in their tests by not requiring a regulatory submission in most, if not al l, instances. However, FDA did not explain how this relates to FDA's monitoring, or addressing of existing out -of-date breakpoints. Letter Page 53 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance additional carriers of these bacteria county -wide.92Additionally, an expert told us that use of out -of-date breakpoints could lead to improper patient care, improper surveillance reporting, and slower detection of e merging resistance.93However, the true impact of this issue is challenging to discern (see text box). The Extent of Any Negative Effects of Out -of-Date Breakpoints on Public Health Is Unclear Experts and agency officials voiced a range of opinions on the p ublic health effects of tests with out -of-date breakpoints. For example, one Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official told us that despite the lack of breakpoint updates, cases of a type of carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae were like ly ultimately caught by hospitals because a second test was used by all but a small number of hospitals. One expert stated that how quickly test breakpoints are updated is less important when deciding what test to adopt than other factors, such as ease of use. However, another expert noted that laboratories addressing emerging threats may feel the need to use non-Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared tests, because they are aware that FDA-cleared tests may not be updated as quickly as needed. Test upda tes may be an issue for smaller laboratories, which do not have dedicated personnel keeping track of breakpoint revisions, Department of Veterans Affairs officials told us. Source: GAO summary of interviews with CDC and others. | GAO -20-341 FDA officials told us that because manufacturers are strongly motivated to keep their tests current, only a few tests have out -of-date breakpoints.94 92S.

The countywide average is the average number of additional carriers among facility types \u2014acute care h ospitals, long -term acute care facilities, and free-standing nursing homes. The reported countywide average from a 2.5 -year delay was 1,821.0 more carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae carriers (95 percent confidence interval: 1,009.6 to 2,632.4). FDA of ficials noted that this publication predated enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act, which provides for a more streamlined process for incorporating up -to-date information into tests. However, FDA did not discuss how the Act might affect the outcomes disc ussed in the study. 93FDA officials told us genomic tests are important for identifying bacteria such as carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae and that some genomic tests are increasingly used. However, they did not address how genomic tests may affect th e use of existing tests with out -of-date breakpoints. 94FDA told us that it considers this to be the case mainly because manufacturers want to make sure their devices are updated. However, FDA did not provide evidence for this assertion, and one test manufa cturer told us they question this assessment. Letter Page 54 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance However, the only confirmation FDA officials offered for this statement was to mention an unofficial internal survey of F DA's database of existing tests, conducted in March 2019, which concluded that all FDA -authorized tests had implemented breakpoint updates made since December 13, 2017.95They said this survey is not conducted regularly. They also stated that it is possible that some tests have not been updated to reflect breakpoint updates made prior to December 13, 2017, but that FDA is unaware of any such tests that also pose a public health threat.96 To assess the extent to which there are FDA -authorized tests using out - of-date breakpoints, we spoke with experts and stakeholders and reviewed studies they identified. We identified several FDA -authorized tests with breakpoints that were changed nearly a decade ago. Some of these tests could be used for diagnosing infection w ith carbapenem - resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which CDC identified as an urgent threat. One manufacturer told us that one of their tests has not been updated with new breakpoints nearly 10 years after a breakpoint revision. FDA officials acknowledged it is possible some FDA -authorized tests might continue to rely on outdated breakpoints.97Further, in 2019, a scientific article listed four different test manufacturers offering tests that have not been fully updated to reflect revised breakpoints, including so me affecting FDA recommends, but does not require, that test manufacturers update their labeling to conform to new, publicly available breakpoints within 90 days.

Reg. 31740 (July 2, 2009). 95FDA restricted its survey t o those breakpoint updates listed on the FDA's breakpoint web site and excluded newly approved drugs, since it does not consider breakpoints for new drugs to be breakpoint changes. 96FDA officials noted that no actual harm has to occur to be considered a pu blic health threat. They told us they assess public health threats using a risk -assessment framework, in which FDA analyzes the frequency or severity of an inaccurate result, among other things. Additional information can be found at Department of Health a nd Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Factors to Consider Regarding Benefit -Risk in Medical Device Product Availability, Compliance, and Enforcement Decisions: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff (Rockville, Md.: Dec. 27 , 2016). FDA told us that some tests using out -of-date breakpoints may not pose a public health concern due to various mitigating factors. FDA noted that identifying cause of concern is complicated and requires deep analysis. 97FDA officials told us that t he tests being asked about provide information for the user to interpret based on criteria other than FDA -recognized breakpoints. However, using this approach typically requires additional studies by the test user. Letter Page 55 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance antibiotics for some types of carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae.98 Finally, CDC officials told us they asked hospital laboratories in a survey for 2017 and 2018 if they had updated their tests to reflect revisions in breakpoints for carba penem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae that were implemented in 2010. According to CDC, nearly 1,000 of over 5,000 responding hospital laboratories had not implemented the revised breakpoints, and, of these, over 85 percent were using FDA -authorized tests.99 One CDC official stated that there is significant concern for patient safety associated with out -of-date breakpoints, and another said that there are few justifications for failing to update the tests after 8 years. FDA officials told us they have not receiv ed reports of suspected device -associated deaths, serious injuries, or malfunctions that are specific to out -of-date carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae breakpoints in FDA -authorized tests using such breakpoints. The officials added that it is possible to detect carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae under certain situations, even if the test had an out -of-date breakpoint for a given antibiotic against these bacteria. However, FDA does not know the actual negative effect, if any, of out -of- date breakpo ints because it does not know how many FDA -authorized tests rely on such breakpoints. Since December 2017, FDA has conducted one unofficial survey of tests to assess breakpoint updates that was limited in scope and is not a regular event. Other than that, FDA is relying on market incentives to drive manufacturers to make sure their devices are updated.100 According to FDA and others, the extent of the problem is not clear. However, PACCARB identified updating test breakpoints as an important 98R. M. Humphries, A. N. Abbott, and J. A Hindler, \"Understanding and Addressing CLSI Breakpoint Revisions -A Primer for Clinical Laboratories,\" Journal of Clinical Microbiology, vol. 57, no. 6 (2019): pp. e00203 -19. 99In some cases, diagnostic test users could choose not to update their test(s). Fo r example, VA officials note that there may be good reasons why test users may not want updated breakpoints, such as different antibiotic resistance patterns in their locale. 100FDA told us they also evaluate risk by review of medical devices reports, atten dance at major scientific meetings, and participation in CLSI activities, among other activities. However, evaluation of risk is not the same as monitoring status. Letter Page 56 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance issue in a 2017 r eport.101Additionally, one of the sub -objectives in the National Action Plan notes that rapid updating of breakpoints is essential to provide accurate information to guide appropriate drug treatment.102 Finally, the Standards for Internal Control in the Feder al Government directs management to establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor its internal control systems and evaluate the results.103In this case, monitoring and evaluation of the status of breakpoint updates in FDA-authorized tests could hel p FDA identify and address the National Action Plan sub -objective, as well as a strategic priority in the mission statement of its Center for Devices and Radiological Health: \"FDA assures that patients and providers have timely and continued access to safe, effective and high -quality medical devices. \"104 FDA officials said they do not believe the issue is a significant problem, but the agency has also not regularly evaluated any effects of using tests for antibiotic resistance with out -of-date breakpoints.105FDA officials stated that there may be resource constraints to their ability to conduct regular monitoring and evaluation. By regularly monitoring and evaluating FDA-authorized tests, FDA would be better positioned to determine the extent of tests relying o n out -of-date breakpoints and may be better positioned to provide assurance that patients and providers have timely access to safe and effective tests. Furthermore, by regular monitoring, FDA would be able to determine whether test manufacturers are updati ng breakpoints as needed, and help ensure that patient care and infection control efforts are effective. 101Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria, Recommendations f or Incentivizing the Development of Vaccines, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics . The relevant report section focused on microbiology laboratories' updating of technologies, in addition to breakpoints, which could fall under CMS actions.

However, they did not discuss how these tools enable FDA to proactively determine whether tests are not being updated in a timely manner. Letter Page 57 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Federal Efforts Have Not Fully Addressed Challenges to Developing New Treatments for Antibiotic \u00adResistant Infections Experts, federal officials, and an tibiotic developers have identified economic and other challenges to developing new antibiotics. Federal agencies, including HHS and DOD, have engaged in efforts to address some of the challenges; however, experts said these efforts are not sufficient and that additional federal incentives are needed to encourage the development of new antibiotics. Economic and Other Challenges to Developing New Treatments Exist Experts are concerned about a void in the discovery of new antibiotic classes and the current pi peline of antibiotics in development. According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit public policy organization that tracks the pipeline of antibiotics, no new classes of antibiotics approved for human use have been discovered since 1984.106In addition , experts are concerned that the number of antibiotics in clinical development is insufficient to meet the threat of antibiotic resistance. For example, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts, only 42 antibiotics were in clinical development globally \u2014meani ng clinical trials were being conducted to test their safety and efficacy in humans \u2014as of June 2019, and only 24 of them targeted bacteria on CDC 's or WHO 's priority lists.107 According to a recently published analysis, the authors found that the pipeline of antibiotics that target gram -negative bacteria is dominated by derivatives of existing classes of antibiotics and \"does not sufficiently 106This discovery void is co ncerning because when bacteria become resistant to one type of antibiotic, it is often resistant to others within the same class. Drugs can be classified according to similarities in chemical structure, among other ways. 107The Pew Charitable Trusts, \"Antibi otics Currently in Global Clinical Development,\" accessed GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance address the problem of extensively drug -resistant gram -negative bacteria \".108 Experts from our meeting, antibiotic devel opers, and federal officials we spoke with identified major economic challenges to developing new antibiotics that commonly result from a poor return on investment. Antibiotics, like other types of pharmaceutical drugs, require substantial investment and m any years to bring a new drug to market. We previously reported that for a new drug, the entire R&D process, including basic research, drug discovery, clinical trials, and FDA review, can take up to 15 years, often accompanied by high costs.109We also previ ously reported that an important incentive for pharmaceutical R&D investment is the potential for high revenue typically associated with a large number of patients or high drug prices.110However, sales revenues for brand - name antibiotics are often low. For example, studies found that median annual sales for brand name antibiotics between 2011 and 2015 ranged from $24 million to $75 million, whereas annual sales for most new, brand -name oncology drugs were more than $500 million during the same period.111Antib iotic developers we interviewed and experts have 108U. Theuretzbacher et al., \"Analysis of the Clinical Antibacterial and Antituberculosis Pipeline,\" The Lancet Infectious Diseases , vol. 19, no. 2 (2019): pp. 40 -50. Specifically, the authors found that the pipeline does not sufficiently address the bacteria A. baumannii , P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae. 109GAO, Drug Industry: Profits, Research and Development Spending, and Merger Acquisition Deals , GAO -18-40(Washington, D.C.: Nov. 17, 2017). For example, one study estimated the average cost per new molecular compound that received FDA approval between 2005 and 2013 to be $1.4 billion. See J. A. DiMasi, H. G. Grabowski, and R. W. Hansen, \"Innovation in the Pharmaceutical Industry: New Estimates of R&D Costs,\" Journal of Health Economics , vol. 47 (2016): pp. 20 -33. Other studies suggest lower development costs. For example, another study estimated a median cost to develop cancer drugs of $0.6 billion. See V. Prasad and S. Mailankody, \"Research and Development Spending to Bring Single Cancer Drug to Market and Revenues After Approval,\" JAMA Internal Medicine , -1,575. 110GAO -18-40. 111Duke Margolis Center for Health Policy, Value -Based Strategies for Encouraging New Development of Antimicrobial Drugs, andIMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, Medicines Use and Spending in the U.S. A Revi ew of 2015 and Outlook to 2020 (Parsippany, N.J.: April 2016). The Duke Margolis Center also reported that only five of the 16 new brand -name antimicrobials approved since 2000 generated annual sales above $100 million. Letter Page 59 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance identified multiple factors that can limit the profitability of new antibiotics when they reach the market, including: \u00b7 Prices for new antibiotics are considered low compared to other life - saving drugs, such as cancer drugs, because they must compete with inexpensive generic antibiotics, which remain effective enough to influence pricing of new antibiotics.112 \u00b7 Antibiotics are typically used for a short duration, unlike drugs for chronic diseases that patients us e for many months or years. \u00b7 Antibiotic stewardship principles encourage the appropriate use of antibiotics to help prevent resistance. According to the Duke University Margolis Center for Health Policy, most novel treatments for antibiotic -resistant infect ions have a narrow set of patients for whom the treatment would be appropriate.113 As a result of the perceived poor return on investment, many large pharmaceutical companies have discontinued their antibiotic development in recent years. In 2018, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts and other published sources, four large pharmaceutical companies worldwide had antibiotics in clinical development globally compared to 1990, when 18 were involved in antibiotic R&D.114Two antibiotic companies declared bankruptc y in 2019; in the case of one, the company filed for bankruptcy only 10 months after its antibiotic, which targets resistant bacteria, received FDA approval.115The majority of antibiotics in the development pipeline are being developed by smaller companies that do not have other drugs on the market to help cover their R&D costs. However, 112Some experts believe the prices o f new antibiotics do not reflect their public health value -that is, the value they provide not just to the patient, but also to society \u2014because effective treatment prevents the antibiotic -resistant bacteria from spreading. See Duke Margolis Center, Value -Based Strategies for Encouraging New Development of Antimicrobial Drugs. 113Duke Margolis Center, Value -Based Strategies for Encouraging New Development of Antimicrobial Drugs. 114The Pew Charitable Trusts, \"Tracking the Global Pipeline of Antibiotics in Devel opment,\" accessed Sharma and A. Towse, Office of Health Economics, New Drugs to Tackle Antimicrobial Resistance: Analysis of EU Policy Options (London, England: April 2011). 115A third company, which gained FDA approval for an antibiotic that treats complicated intra-abdominal infections in 2018, announced in 2019 that it wou ld reduce its workforce and cease research functions to focus its financial resources on commercializing its approved antibiotic. In March 2020, the company announced it would be acquired by another company. Letter Page 60 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance representatives from three small antibiotic developers we spoke with noted that their field is struggling because it is difficult to raise funds from private investors due t o the low return on investment potential. Further complicating these economic challenges , federal officials and antibiotic developers we spoke with also identified challenges in conducting clinical trials for antibiotics, which can make it difficult to meet FDA's regulatory requirements for approval.116This is particularly true for antibiotics that would treat antibiotic -resistant infections. Specifically, they noted the following three challenges: \u00b7 Enrolling patients in clinical trials . Identifying and enrolling patients with bacterial infections into certain clinical trials prior to initiating treatment can be difficult due to a lack of available rapid diagnostic tests to identify the type of infection and the urgent need to begin treatment immediately for acute infections. According to FDA officials, this is problematic for clinical trials bec ause any prior treatment could obscure the true efficacy of the drug under investigation. Recognizing this often unavoidable issue, FDA has issued guidance giving antibiotic developers additional, but limited, flexibility with their clinical trial protocol s in certain cases.117 In addition, certain types of antibiotic -resistant infections are rare and, therefore, antibiotic developers and federal officials told us it can be difficult to find patients to enroll in clinical trials to test antibiotics that targe t resistant bacteria. FDA officials told us that, for some types of bacterial infections, only 5 to 10 percent of patients have an infection caused by a resistant bacterial strain. \u00b7 Demonstrating superiority of a new antibiotic . Two antibiotic developers to ld us that, for most antibiotics, it is difficult to conduct superiority clinical trials and more feasible to conduct non -inferiority 116Before approving a new drug, FDA generally requ ires the developer to conduct clinical trials in humans to assess its safety and effectiveness against a specific disease or illness \u2014called an \"indication.\" 117For example, in its guidance about developing drugs for complicated urinary tract infections, FDA states that up to 25 percent of patients in a clinical trial may have received another type of drug before receiving the drug under investigation. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: Developing Drugs for Treatment: Guidance for Industry (Silver Spring, Md.: June 2018). Overview of Clinical Trials Before approving a new drug, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) generally requires a drug's developer to conduct clinical trials in humans to assess its safety and effectiveness against a specific disease or illness \u2014called an \"indication.\" Two types of trials that may be used are: \u00b7 Superiority trials, which aim to show that the drug being investigated is more effective than an existing drug. \u00b7 Non-inferiority trials, which aim to demons trate that the difference between the effectiveness of the drug being investigated and an existing drug is small enough to show that the drug being studied is also effective. Typically, there are three phases of clinical trials, with the sizes of the trial s increasing with each phase. FDA generally prefers that when conducting clinical trials, developers demonstrate the effectiveness of a new drug by showing its impact on a clinical endpoint \u2014 a direct measure of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. F DA also accepts surrogate endpoints, which are laboratory measures or physical signs used as a substitute for a clinical endpoint that reasonably predict a clinical benefit. Source: GAO and FDA. | GAO -20-341 Letter Page 61 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance trials, because the latter allows for smaller enrollment.118(See side bar for an explanation of clinical trial types.) They told us that the inability to demonstrate their drug 's superiority limits their ability to market the drug, because it can be difficult to convince purchasers (e.g., hospitals) to choose the newly approved antibiotic over existing antibiotics, especially when the new antibiotic is significantly more expensive. \u00b7 Gaining approval for multiple indications . FDA generally approves drugs for a specific indication; therefore, antibiotic developers told us they tend to design their clinical trials around common inf ection types, largely because of the relative ease of enrolling patients. However, some antibiotics can treat infections in multiple parts of the body, which may not have been studied in a clinical trial.119While providers are able to prescribe drugs for \"off-label \" use\u2014that is, for a condition or patient population for which the drug has not been approved \u2014they may lack information on the safety and efficacy of the drug for such use. In addition, such off -label use may not be reimbursed by the patient 's insu rance. 118According to literature we reviewed, ethical clinical trial design for serious and life - threatening infections requires trials to compare the drug being studied to an existing treatment for that infection, if it is known to be safe and efficacious. However, it is unlikely that superiority of a new drug would be observed when the bacteria are susceptible to both drugs. See H. Boucher et al., \"White Paper: Developing Anti microbial Drugs for Resistant Pathogens, Narrow -Spectrum Indications, and Unmet Needs,\" The Journal of Infectious Diseases , vol. 216, no. 2 (2017): pp. 228 -236. 119In 2017 guidance, FDA stated that it would allow antibiotic developers flexibility to include, in certain superiority trials, patients with infections in multiple body sites caused by the same bacteria. However, superiority trials are often difficult to conduct for antibiotics, as described above. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Antibacterial Therapies for Patients with an Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases; Guidance for Industry; Availability , 82 Fed. Reg. 35973 (Aug. 2, 2017). Letter Page 62 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Experts, antibiotic developers, and federal officials also said it is scientifically challenging to develop new antibiotics that can overcome existing mechanisms of resistance. One expert at ou r meeting explained that it is necessary to develop an antibiotic that works differently than existing antibiotics so that bacteria are not resistant to it. In particular, experts and federal officials have noted that it is challenging to develop antibioti cs that can kill certain types of bacteria, called gram -negative bacteria, largely due to their double membrane that makes it difficult for antibiotics to enter the bacterial cell, and to pumps that can remove the drug once it enters. Three antibiotic deve lopers we spoke to explained that as bacteria continue to evolve new ways to resist antibiotics, it is difficult for scientists to keep pace by developing new treatments that can overcome those mechanisms. In addition, experts noted that scientists have al ready discovered most of the antibiotics from known sources, such as soil. As a result, scientists are now exploring new sources of chemicals with antibiotic properties, such as insects.120 As the rate of antibiotic discovery has slowed, scientists have also begun to explore alternatives to traditional antibiotics \u2014which we call \"nontraditional products \" in this report.121Many types of nontraditional products are currently being researched and developed to treat antibiotic - resistant infections, including, among others, live biotherapeutic products, antibodies, and bacteriophages.122For example, one type of nontraditional product in use for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile - associated disease \u2014which causes diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and an estimated 15,000 d eaths in the United States each year, according to CDC \u2014is fecal microbiota for transplantation, more commonly known as fecal transplants.123(See text box.) However, scientists and companies 120For example, scientists have recently discovered t hat chemicals within insects and komodo dragons have antibiotic properties, which could potentially be used as the basis for developing synthetic antibiotics in the future. 121According to NIAID , nontraditional products are antibacterial agents or approache s that differ in mechanism from traditional small -molecule agents that kill bacteria or inhibit their growth. 122Live biotherapeutic products are products that contain live organisms, such as bacteria. Antibodies are proteins naturally produced by the body's immune system to help remove potentially harmful pathogens. Antibodies can be harvested and used as medicines. Bacteriophages are viruses that can kill bacteria. 123CDC considers C. difficile to be an urgent threat. While C. difficile is not usually resista nt to antibiotics, it is caused by the same factors that drive antibiotic resistance \u2014 antibiotic use and the spread of germs. Nontraditional Products in Development According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, there were 29 nontraditional antibacterial products in clinical development for the U.S. market in June 2019. Among the 29 products in the pipeline, nine were antibodies, seven were vaccines, seven were live biotherapeutic products, and six were other types of products. No bacteriophages were in clinical development. More than half of these products are for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile or Staphylococcus aureus infections. Source: The Pew Charitable Trusts. | GAO -20-341 Letter Page 63 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance researching and developing certain types of nontraditional products face development challenges. For example, according to a paper written by BARDA officials and others, certain types of nontraditional products target only one or a few types of bacteria, which makes enrollment of patients in clinical trials difficult and potentially cost -prohibitive.124The authors also stated that additional research is needed to evaluate side effects and measure the efficacy of some types of nontraditional products. According to another published paper, more than half of the nontraditional products in development are intended to be used concurrently with a traditional antibiotic, and it can be difficult to demonstrate the additional clinical benefit of adjunctive therapies in clinical trials.125The authors also noted that additional clinical trial endpoints still need to be developed and validated for such nontraditional products. 124B.

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), multiple research studies have indicated that these transplants are effective , but their long -term safety has not been established. Questions remain about the Food and Drug Administration 's (FDA) policy regarding stool banks that collect, prepare, and distribute fecal transplant products. FDA issued guidance in 2013 indicating its intention to exercise enforcement discretion regarding Investigational New Drug requirements for the use of fecal transplants to treat Clostridioides difficile infections, provided that the treating physician obtained adequate consent from the patient or his or her legally authorized representative. In other words, FDA 's guidance indicated it would not require fecal transplant products to satis fy the Investigational New Drug requirements \u2014 which refer to the requirements for FDA 's approval before beginning clinical trials to test a product on humans.

According to FDA, the agency received many comments from patients and industry groups in response to the 2016 draft guidance expressing concern about the effect that the requirement for clinical trials would have on access to these products. In March 2019, FDA officials told us they were still reviewing comments to the 2016 draft guidance and were unable to say whether or not it would be finalize d. In November 2019, FDA held a public hearing to obtain further input on the use of fecal transplants to treat C. difficile infection not responsive to standard therapies and to better understand the effect of FDA 's enforcement policy on product developme nt.

BARDA created public -private partnerships with four antibiotic development companies that are developing a total of seven antibiotic candidates among them, investing a total of nearly $403 million since 2013, according to BARDA o fficials. BARDA led the creation of the Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB -X) in 2016, an international public -private partnership that provides funds to support preclinical research (i.e., research prior to begi nning testing in humans) and phase 1 clinical trials. BARDA has committed to provide up to $250 million of funding to CARB -X.b According to its 2019 annual report, CARB -X had funded 47 projects, totaling up to $133.5 million.c Department of Health and Hum an Services (HHS) National Institutes of Health (NIH) NIH officials estimated that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) awarded $158 million in fiscal year 2017 and $148 million in fiscal year 2018 in grants, contracts, and othe r funding mechanisms for the study of treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections.

Issued guidance to support clinical trials . FDA has implemented programs and issued guidance that help address some regulatory challenges and encourage antibiotic developme nt. In 2012, through the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Congress created the Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation.126Drugs that FDA designates as QIDPs, which include antibiotics and antifungals, may qualify for 5 years of additional exclusivity and fast -track or priority review designation during the FDA review process.127The additional exclusivity conferred to QIDP designees is a type of \"pull incentive, \" beca use it offers the potential for enhanced financial gain after a drug receives FDA approval and reaches the market. According to FDA officials, as of September 2019, FDA had granted 192 QIDP designations, 24 of which it has approved for marketing.128 Also in response to the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, FDA released final guidance in August 2017 to streamline clinical development of antibiotics for patients with an unmet medical need \u2014that is, those with a serious bacterial disease that has few or n o treatment options.129FDA explains in this guidance that it may consider drugs for these patients that have higher risks than would be acceptable for a broad patient population 126Pub.

The 21st Century Cures Act required FDA to establish a Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD).130In June 2018, FDA issued draft LPAD guidance, as required by the Act.131 Under LPAD, eligible products \u2014which are drugs and biologics intended to treat a serious or life -threatening infection in a limited populati on of patients with unmet needs \u2014may follow a streamlined development program, similar to the a pproaches described in its earlier unmet medical need guidance.132A biotechnology association noted in its public comments to the draft LPAD guidance the need for FDA to issue additional guidance to clarify its expectations for acceptable types of efficacy data when clinical trials are small and to clarify its interpretation of a \"limited population of patients \" for the purpose of the LPAD pathway.133An expert who attended our meeting later told us there is a great need to address how to develop narrow -spectr um antibiotics \u2014those designed to treat a single or small number of bacterial pathogens \u2014using LPAD. FDA held a public meeting in July 2019 to solicit stakeholder comments on the draft LPAD pathway guidance, and FDA officials told us they expect to finalize the guidance by Februa ry 2020. However, as of March 17 , 2020, FDA had not yet issued final guidance. 130Pub. L. No.114 -255, \u00a7 3042, 130 Stat. 1112 -14 13, 2016) (codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 356). LPAD applies to eligible drugs and biological products regulated by Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, respectively. 131Depa rtment of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (Draft Guidance for Industry) (Silver Spring, Md.: June 2018) . 132Drug developers seeking approval under the LPAD pathway may also seek QIDP designation and approval under other applicable provisions, such as accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy, or priority review. As of August 2019, FDA had approved two drugs under the LPAD pathway: Arikayce for the treatment of lung di sease caused by a group of bacteria in a limited population of patients who do not respond to conventional treatment, and Pretomanid for the treatment of a specific type of highly treatment -resistant tuberculosis of the lungs. 133In the draft LPAD guidance, FDA states its interpretation of \"limited population\" to mean \"a group of patients that is limited in such a way that is clinically relevant to health care providers.\" Food and Drug Administration, Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifunga l Drugs (Draft Guidance for Industry) : p.3. Letter Page 68 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance In addition to issuing guidance, and to help inform future guidance, FDA engages with industry stakeholders to discuss and identify possible solutions to c hallenges related to the clinical development of antibiotics and nontraditional products. For example, FDA has held multiple public workshops, including one in November 2019 with experts from NIH 's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Infectious Disease Society of America, and The Pew Charitable Trusts to better understand the current state of antibiotic clinical trials in the United States , and how to enhance enrollment and research in these trials. FDA officials told us they believe it is too early to issue guidance that would be broadly applicable and useful to nontraditional product developers. They explained that for certain types of nontraditional products, the approaches and specifics of product development are varied and evolvin g quickly. Instead, FDA 's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has a program in place that allows developers to meet with FDA prior to beginning clinical trials to obtain advice on a wide range of development -related topics.134 Implemented Medicare p ayment mechanisms . CMS uses Medicare payment mechanisms to help increase reimbursement to hospitals for certain antibiotics. For qualifying antibiotics, these payments are a form of indirect pull incentive because they have the potential to increase the demand for the new antibiotics after they reach the market, which could in turn improve their financial performance. Beginning in fiscal year 2020, CMS updated how it will pay hospitals for treating Medicare patients who have an antibiotic -resistant infectio n.135Specifically, CMS changed the eligibility criteria and payment amount for antibiotics that qualify for \"new technology add -on payments \" and how it pays hospitals for treating Medicare patients with antibiotic -resistant infections. These payment changes are: 134This program is called INTERACT \u2014INitial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on CBER producTs. 135Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long -Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Policy Changes and Fiscal Year 2020 Rates; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers; Medicare and Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Programs Requirements for Eligible Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals , 84 Fed. Reg. 42044 (Aug. 16, 2019). Letter Page 69 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance \u00b7 Revised eligibility criteria for and amount of add -on payments . New technology add -on payments provide hospitals with additional compensation for a period of 2 or 3 years when they use qualifying new technologies or drugs that offer substantially imp roved clinical treatment, and when regular Medicare payments for the hospital stay are inadequate to cover the cost of the new technology or drug.136 Generally, medical services and technologies must be new and must demonstrate a substantial clinical improve ment over existing services or technologies to receive the additional payment.137However, CMS has acknowledged the difficulty antibiotic developers face in demonstrating such substantial clinical improvement due to manufacturers seeking FDA approval for mos t antibiotics on the basis of noninferiority clinical trials, as described above. To make it easier for antibiotics to qualify for the additional payments, under the revisions to the CMS payment policy beginning in fiscal year 2021, CMS will consider all a ntibiotics with a QIDP designation from FDA to be \"new\" for purposes of the add -on payment, and these antibiotics will not have to meet the substantial clinical improvement criteria.138 In addition, CMS has increased the amount of the temporary add -on paymen t for qualifying antibiotics. Prior to this change, the add -on payments for qualifying antibiotics were limited to 50 percent of the cost of the drug. Under the new policy, the payment percentage increased to a maximum of 75 percent of the cost of the drug .139CMS has specified that two antibiotics are eligible for new technology add - on payments in fiscal year 2020.140 136The new technology add -on payments are made on top of the payment made under the inpatient prospective payment system. Under t he inpatient prospective payment system, Medicare pays hospitals a single bundled payment per patient stay, which is based on multiple factors. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.87 (2018). 137In addition, the diagnosis related group rate otherwise applicable to discharges involving the medical service or technology must also be determined inadequate. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.87(b) (2018). 13884 Fed.

Letter Page 70 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance \u00b7 Increased payment for hospital stays . CMS changed the severity level designation for certain antibiotic resistance -related diagnosis codes, in r ecognition of the added clinical complexity and cost of treating patients with antibiotic resistance.141This change in severity level can result in higher payments to hospitals when treating patients diagnosed with antibiotic resistance, which, according to the Administrator of CMS in an August 2019 blog post, will create \"financial flexibility for physicians to prescribe the appropriate new antibiotics. \"142The Administrator also noted that CMS made this policy change because it recognized that n ew technology add-on payments are temporary and \"further action was needed to realign financial incentives for antibiotics for the long -term. \" See appendix III for additional examples of efforts to support antibiotic R&D by these and other federal agencies. Federal Eff orts Have Not Fully Incentivized Antibiotic Development, and HHS Lacks a Strategy to Develop New Incentives Experts and antibiotic developers told us that the economic challenges have remained despite the available federal push and pull incentives for antibiotic R&D. Current ly available premarket push incentives include grants and awards from NIH and BARDA that fund antibiotic R&D; currently available postmarket pull incentives include the additional market exclusivity available through QIDP designation and Medicare add - on payments for antibiotics. (See fig. 3.) Both of the antibiotic companies that declared bankruptcy in 2019 had received push incentives from BARDA and pull incentives through Medicare New Technology Add -on Payments and the QIDP 5 -year exten sion of market exclusivity.143 14184 Fed. Reg. 42044, 42150 (Aug. 16, 2019). CMS changed the severity designation for these diagnosis codes from \"non -CC\" to \"CC,\" which recognizes the presence of a complication or comorbidity that requires the hospital to dedicate more resources for the care of that patient than typically needed for the specific diagnosis. 142S.

While experts at our meeting and antibiotic developers told us that push incentives have been helpful, the y also said push incentives alone are not sufficient to sustain antibiotic development. For example, two antibiotic developers we spoke with explained that push incentives have provided needed funding for conducting R&D, but said that push incentives will not Letter Page 72 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance help cover the costs they will incur after their drug reaches the market \u2014 for example, to manufacture and market their product.144 Experts and antibiotic developers have indicated that the effects of the existing pull incentives, QIDP market exclusivity, and Medicare add -on payments on stimulating development of new antibiotics have been limited for the following reasons: \u00b7 QIDP and market exclusivity . As we previously reported, several pharmaceutical companies told us that the market exclusivity incentive m ay not stimulate the development of new antibiotics, because the extension is unlikely to extend past the typical patent life of a new drug.145In addition, a representative from The Pew Charitable Trusts said that, while the passage of the Generating Antibi otic Incentives Now Act initially bolstered private investments in antibiotics, it did not ultimately stabilize the pipeline of antibiotics in development, noting that since then, several large pharmaceutical companies have discontinued their antibiotics R &D programs. \u00b7 Medicare updates to hospital payments . While CMS recently increased new technology add -on payments for certain antibiotics beginning in fiscal year 2020 to help improve access to antibiotics, these payments are limited to antibiotics used to t reat Medicare patients.146In addition, although Medicare increased the add -on 144One expe rt at our meeting noted that antibiotic companies face a \"second wave\" of costs after a drug reaches the market \u2014costs to manufacture the drug and to conduct additional clinical studies for populations and indications beyond the original FDA approval. 145Mark et exclusivity and patent life generally run concurrently. While market exclusivity can range from about 3 to 7 years from drug approval, according to FDA, a drug patent generally expires 20 years from the date the patent holder filed its application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. See GAO, Antibiotics: FDA Has Encouraged Development, but Needs to Clarify the Role of Draft Guidance and Develop Qualified Infectious Disease Product Guidance , GAO -17-189(Washington, D.C.: Jan. 31, 2017). HHS stated in a 2017 report to Congress that it was still too early to assess whether the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act was addressing the need for new antibiotics because all 12 of the ap proved QIDP drugs were already in development before the incentives were created. Department of Health and Human Services, Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now: Required by Section 805 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.

Furthermore, representatives from an antibiotic company and a biotechnology trade association told us the add -on payments do not directly incentivize hospital pharmacies to purchase the drug, because the add-on payment may not flow back to the pharmacy department 's budget. For these reasons, it remains to be seen whether the Medicare new technology add -on payments to hospitals for inpatient antibiotics will help improve the return on investment for antibi otic developers and further stimulate the antibiotic development pipeline. Similarly, it remains to be seen how CMS 's policy change that provides increased payments for hospital stays when Medicare patients have been diagnosed with certain types of antibio tic-resistant infections will affect hospitals ' use of new antibiotics. In light of the limitation of existing incentives for antibiotic development, experts, federal officials, and antibiotics developers have called for additional postmarket pull incentiv es to reinvigorate the pipeline of antibiotics under development. For example, PACCARB issued recommendations to the Secretary of HHS in September 2017 and July 2019 for the adoption of pull incentives, calling for the development of market entry rewards a nd options for plausible business models.147In addition TATFAR \u2014of which officials from BARDA, CDC, FDA, and NIH are members \u2014reported that it is critical to develop a pull incentive strategy now to ensure that enough antibiotics are available in the future.148Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb also stated in 2018 that he was \"deeply concerned that without stronger pull incentives that encourage more R&D, we 'll see a far less robust pipeline of products Providers; Medicare and Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Programs Requirements for Eligible Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals , 84 Fed.

TATFAR was created in 2009 with the goal to improve international coordination of efforts to fight antibiotic resistance. It includes representatives from the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Norway. CDC currently serves as the secretariat for TATFAR. Letter Page 74 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance than we need to address antimicrobial resistance. \"149Eight of the antibiotic developers we interviewed told us they think additional financial incentives are needed.150For example, one developer said that sales revenues from antibiotics will never be sufficient to justify R&D investments, and another noted that financial incentives are needed during the first few years after a new antibiotic reaches the market to cover not only these costs, but also to conduct additional clinical trials to help expand the drug 's possible market. Finally, several experts at o ur expert meeting noted that, without pull incentives, most of the small companies currently developing antibiotics are unlikely to survive, and large pharmaceutical companies will likely continue to exit the antibiotic market. Advisory groups and others h ave identified multiple options for how postmarket pull incentives could be designed, including market entry rewards \u2014either i n the form of lump sum payments or transferable vouchers that could be sold to confer additional market exclusivity to other pharma ceutical drugs \u2014or reimbursement reform, such as licensing arrangements or add -on payments for hospital -administered antibiotics. (See fig. 4.) The four advisory groups whose papers we reviewed each recommended market entry rewards as effective pull incenti ve options. While Commissioner of the FDA, Dr. Scott Gottlieb proposed an antibiotics licensing arrangement, which he called a subscription model, in a 2018 speech. 149See S. Gottlieb, \"FDA's Strategic Approach for Combating Antimicrobial Resistance\" (speech), September 14, 2018, remarks as \"what other incentives, if any, could be offered by U.S. federal agencies or other entities to promote the development of new antibiotics and nontradition al products?\" Of the remaining three developers we interviewed, one did not respond to this question, one discussed changes they would like FDA to make regarding clinical trials, and one said they could not think of any additional incentives.

For example, representatives from The Pew Charitable Trusts stated their view that, while CMS 's recent changes to Medicare payment for antibiotics will likely be helpful to some degree, no reimbursement policy on its own would be able to increase antib iotic sales revenues sufficiently to transform the business model for antibiotics. An antibiotic developer we spoke to also told us that reimbursement policies would not be sufficient to support their business model because of low sales volumes for new ant ibiotics. The developer explained that it can take 2 or 3 years of antibiotic sales to recoup their R&D costs and finance their ongoing business operations, and that while larger pharmaceutical companies can rely on other profitable drugs to offset those c osts, they could not because they did not have other drugs on the market. However, a representative from a biotechnology trade association told us that increasing reimbursement could help alleviate some of the economic challenges faced by developers of ant ibiotics that are already on or about to reach the market while policy makers explore longer -term pull incentive strategies. TATFAR cautioned that simply increasing reimbursement for antibiotics could potentially limit patient access, particularly for pati ents without health insurance \u2014including those in low -and middle -income countries \u2014and it could incentivize only antibiotics for common types of infections with a large market potential, rather than for rare, yet dangerous, types of pathogens. Advisory group s and others have evaluated potential market entry reward models, taking into consideration factors such as format, value, funding sources, and eligibility criteria. Some have proposed that receipt of a market entry reward should be delinked, fully or part ially, from sales revenues \u2014that is, the developer would have to forgo some or all sales revenue as a condition of receiving the reward. Proponents of delinkage believe that separating revenues from antibiotics sales volumes would discourage aggressive sale s that could lead to overuse. An expert who attended our meeting later told us that policies to incentivize use of new antibiotics must be balanced with policies to monitor prescribing of new drugs to prevent inappropriate use. Generally, advisory groups s tipulate that to maximize the public health benefit, only antibiotics that treat what Letter Page 77 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance are deemed to be high priority bacteria should be eligible for a reward.151 Specific recommendations and conclusions included the following: \u00b7 TATFAR concluded in 2017 that a partially delinked market entry reward of approximately $500 million would be the least disruptive option but noted that additional assessment would be necessary to select the most appropriate model and determine governance and other design elements.152 \u00b7 PACCARB expressed support for a delinked model, in which a company accepting a market entry reward would be required to forgo marketing activities and profits based on sales volume. In addition, they suggested the establishment of an antibiotic incentive fund supported by an antibiotic usage fee or the sale or auction of transferable exclusivity vouchers as plausible options for financing pull incentives. \u00b7 The Duke University Margolis Center for Health Policy recommended in 2017 a delinked, public -private marke t entry reward model. This model was comprised of publicly funded market entry rewards for qualifying antibiotics for the first 5 or 6 years, followed by privately funded \"value -based \" contracts between antibiotic developers and health care payors, in whic h the payor could agree, for example, to pay a predetermined amount for full access to the antibiotics for a given population.153The Duke -Margolis Center proposal did not specify a funding source, but it noted multiple options for consideration, including g eneral government funds, antibiotic use taxes, or the sale of transferable exclusivity vouchers. \u00b7 The European DRIVE -AB project recommended in 2018 an internationally funded, partially delinked market entry reward valued at approximately $1 billion per anti biotic, paid over the course of 5 or 151C.

S1 (2018). 152C. Ardal Incentives for Antibacterial Drug Devel opment.\" TATFAR also published a literature review in 2016 that summarized twelve reports by researchers and advisory groups who analyzed possible antibiotic pull incentive strategies. See K. Sciaretta et al., \"Economic Incentives for Antibacterial Drug De velopment: Literature Review and Considerations from the Transatlantic Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance,\" Clinical Infectious Diseases , vol. 63, no. 11 (2016). 153Duke Margolis Center, Value -Based Strategies for Encouraging New Development of Antimicro bial Drugs . Letter Page 78 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance more years.154Recipients of a market entry reward would be allowed to sell their drug on the private market, but they would agree to certain marketing restrictions to discourage inappropriate use. HHS may need to request authority and appropriations to create and implement certain types of market entry rewards. For example, HHS does not currently have authority to offer transferable exclusivity vouchers to antibiotic developers, since that would require a change in statut e. Advisory groups also noted that the various pull incentive approaches would require additional public or private expenditures and offered possible sources of funding. For example, in addition to general fund revenues, PACCARB suggested that pull incenti ves could be funded through antibiotic usage fees, the auctioning of transferable exclusivity vouchers, or by allowing developers of new antibiotics to earn a transferable exclusivity voucher. The Duke -Margolis Center suggestions included funding market en try rewards through a yearly per -member fee for all health insurance plans. Transferable exclusivity vouchers may not require an independent funding source, because the value of the reward is based on the sale of the voucher to another drug developer. Howe ver, vouchers would still increase public and private health care expenditures, because expenditures would likely increase for drugs for which the extra period of exclusivity was purchased due to the delayed entry of lower - priced generics. Finally, reimbur sement reform could increase health care expenditures for health care payo rs, including Medicare and private health insurance carriers. Although PACCARB, TATFAR, and other experts have called for additional postmarket pull incentives to increase the antibi otic pipeline, as of January 2020 HHS has not developed a strategy for creating these incentives. HHS officials told us that the department created an interagency workgroup within HHS in spring 2019 to identify possible pull incentive options, among other things.155The recently convened HHS interagency workgroup is a step in the right direction toward exploring options for new antibiotic development incentives. Through this workgroup, HHS has an opportunity to determine which types of 154The DRIVE -AB project, which is the short name for the \"Driving Re -investment in R&D and Respon sible Antibiotic Use,\" was funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, which received financial contributions from the European Union and the Eu ropean Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. 155In addition, to further assess the market economics for antibiotics, the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation funded a study in 2018 to assess whether there are market failures that lead to suboptimal investment in antimicrobial drugs. The study is due to be completed in 2021. Letter Page 79 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance postmarket incentives i t believes would most effectively incentivize the development of new treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections. However, it is unclear whether the HHS interagency workgroup 's efforts will include consideration of such incentives because, according to HHS officials in January 2020, the interagency workgroup was still considering possible recommendations for HHS leadership and had not produced any specific documents to share with us. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 , which significantly enhanced agencies' responsibilities under GPRA , include principles for federal agencies to consider related to developing strategies for achieving results, among other principles.156We have previously reported that these principles can serve as leading practices for planning at lower levels within agencies, such as individual programs or initiatives.157Our past work has shown that strategic frameworks can serve as a basis for guiding policy makers, including cong ressional decision makers and agency officials, when making decisions about resources, programs and activities, particularly in relation to issues that are national in scope, such as antibiotic development.158Developing a strategic framework that outlines n ew postmarket pull incentives and their key design elements \u2014such as monetary value, eligibility criteria, and guidelines to prevent overuse \u2014 would be a first step toward identifying potential authorities and resources that may be needed to create the incent ives, and toward determining agency roles for implementation and oversight of the incentives. Until such incentives are developed, more drug companies may exit the antibiotic development sector, and the pipeline of new treatments for antibiotic -resistant i nfections may continue to decrease. Furthermore, the current significant federal investment in push incentives to support antibiotic R&D will remain a high -risk enterprise, if companies receiving large R&D grants are unable to sustain their business once t heir treatment reaches the market. 156Pub.

Letter Page 80 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Federal Agencies Have Undertaken Several Efforts to Promote the Appropriate Use of Antibiotics, but Key Challenges Remain Federal agencies have undertaken several efforts to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics thro ugh stewardship programs and activities. However, four key challenges remain that have limited this progress. Federal Agencies Have Undertaken Several Efforts to Promote the Appropriate Use of Antibiotics through Stewardship Programs To promote the appropr iate use of antibiotics across health care settings through antibiotic stewardship programs and activities, federal agencies have undertaken several efforts that aim to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce health care costs, improve patient outcomes , and combat antibiotic resistance. Selected examples of these efforts are discussed below. (For more detailed information on agencies ' efforts to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics, see app. IV.) Published Requirements for Hospitals, Long -Term Car e, and DOD and VA Facilities to Implement Antibiotic Stewardship Programs Federal agencies require certain types of health care facilities to implement antibiotic stewardship programs, as follows: \u00b7 CMS. In September 2019, CMS finalized new health and safety requirements for hospitals and critical access hospitals to implement antibiotic stewardship programs by March 30, 2020, as a condition of their participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.159Under 159Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Regulatory Provisions to Promote Program Efficiency, Transparency, and Burden Reduction; Fire Safety Requirements for Certain Dialysis Facilities; Hospital and Critical Access Hospital (CAH) Changes to Promote Innovation, Flexibility, and Improvement in Patient Care , 84 Fed. Reg. 51732 (Sept. 30, 2019) (pertinent provisions to be codified at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 482.42 (d), 485.640). Letter Page 81 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance these requirements, hospitals and critical access hospitals are required, among other things, to implement these programs facility - wide (which includes emergency departments) and to adhere to nationally recognized antibiotic prescribing guidelines.160Nearly 3 years prior, CMS published similar requirements for nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities \u2014collectively known as long -term care facilities \u2014to establish antibiotic stewardship programs by December 4, 2017.161Experts, including those at our meeting and the PACCARB, credit these requirements with bei ng a powerful lever for promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics; Medicare comprises a significant portion of the nation 's health care expenditures \u2014$741 billion in 2018, covering 59.9 million beneficiaries.162 \u00b7 DOD. DOD published a policy, effective Octob er 2017, requiring the establishment of antibiotic stewardship programs within its military The final h ealth and safety (also known as Conditions of Participation) requirements for antibiotic stewardship programs in hospitals also apply to inpatient rehabilitation facilities (which are considered post -acute care facilities) and long -term acute care hospital s. 84 Fed. Reg. 51732, 51780 (Sept. 30, 2019). \"Critical access hospital\" is a designation given to eligible rural hospitals by states and certified by CMS. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395i -4(c)(2)(B), 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 485.606(b). Congress created the critical access hospital designation through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 in response to a string of rural hospital closures in the 1980s and early 1990s. Among other criteria, eligible hospitals must have 25 or fewer acute -care inpatient beds and be located more than 35 miles from another hospital, although exceptions may apply. See Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105 -33, \u00a7 4201, 111 Stat. 251, 369 -71 (codified 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395f(l), 1395i -4, 1395m(g), (l)(8)). As of October 2019, there were 1,349 critical access hospitals in the United States. 160Professional medical societies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, publish nationally recognized antibiotic prescribing guidelines for their specialties. In addition, the Infectious Diseases Societ y of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America have jointly published evidence -based guidelines for implementing an antibiotic stewardship program in acute inpatient, long -term care, and emergency department care settings. See, for exa mple, T. F. Barlam et al., \"Implementing an Antibiotic Stewardship Program: Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America,\" Clinical Infectious Diseases, vol. 62, no. 10 (2016): pp. e51 -e77. 161Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Reform of Requirements for Long -Term Care Facilities , 81 Fed. Reg. 68688, 68697 (Oct. 4, 2016) (pertinent provision codified at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.80(a)(3) (2018)). 162Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, \"Trustees Report & Trust Funds,\" accessed -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance medical treatment facilities and, one year later, issued guidance for implementation.163Among other things, the policy specified that these facilities ' antibiotic st ewardship programs include components such as (1) leadership commitment by each facility; (2) accountability; (3) pharmacy expertise, including antibiotic prescribing and use evaluation; (4) implementation of action for change that would demonstrate commit ment to the program; and (5) training for clinicians regarding antibiotic resistance and prescribing practices. DOD officials told us that all of these facilities (both inpatient and outpatient) were in different stages of implementing the antibiotic stewa rdship policy. \u00b7 VA. In January 2019, VA updated its 2014 policy directive for the implementation and maintenance of antibiotic stewardship programs in its health care facilities, which provide both inpatient and outpatient services to veterans.164This policy directive includes requirements for its facilities to develop a written policy, conduct an annual evaluation of stewardship activities, ensure that adequate staff and resources are in place, and identify medical and pharmacy personnel as stewardship \"cham pions. \" According to department officials, VA has successfully implemented antibiotic stewardship programs in all of its health care facilities. Developed Incentives for Clinicians to Implement Antibiotic Stewardship Activities CMS has developed incentives for eligible clinicians in any type of health care facility to improve antibiotic use and stewardship, as part of the 163Department of Defense, DOD Instruction 6025.26, \"DOD Program for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (CARB)\" (Oct. 31, 2017) and Defense He alth Agency Procedural Instruction Number 6025.09, \"DOD Program for Combating Antibiotic - Resistant Bacteria (CARB)\" (Oct. 2, 2018). DOD's military medical treatment facilities include hospitals and medical centers located at military installations across t he United States and abroad, plus ambulatory care clinics and dental clinics, and provide health care for active -duty service members, their dependents, and other eligible beneficiaries. 164Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration Direc tive 1031, \"Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASP)\" (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 30, 2019). Letter Page 83 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance agency 's broader efforts to improve care for Medicare patients.165 Through the Merit -based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) launched in 2017 , CMS offers hundreds of quality measures and nearly 100 \"improvement activities \" on a wide range of topics \u2014including the appropriate use of antibiotics \u2014on which eligible clinicians can choose to report their performance to the agency.166CMS then adjusts pa yments higher for clinicians who report data and achieve a performance -based, final score above a certain threshold \u2014and penalizes clinicians who do not achieve that threshold with lower payments. Published Guidance on Implementing Antibiotic Stewardship Programs Federal agencies have published guidance for health care facilities on how to implement antibiotic stewardship, as follows: \u00b7 AHRQ. Through a 5 -year nationwide project, the AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Antibiotic Use has provided technical assist ance and CDC 's guidance to hospitals, long -term care settings, and physicians ' offices to promote implementation of antibiotic stewardship activities and help clinicians select optimal antibiotic treatment regimens. In December 2018, AHRQ completed impleme ntation of this guidance in more than 400 hospitals, which 165The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 required CMS to implement an incentive program for clinicians participating in Medicare to receive higher payments based on their performance. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114 -10, 129 Stat. 87, 92 (Apr. 16, 2015), codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w -4. 166MIPS -eligible clinician types include physicians (doctors of medicine, which includes many specialties; doctors of dental surgery or dental medicine; and doctors of osteopathy), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and others. In addition, to be eligible for MIPS in 2019, the clinician must (1) bill $90,000 or more in allowed charges for professional services covered under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule; (2) provide more than 200 covered professional services; and (3) furnish covered professional services to more than 200 Medicare beneficiaries. Eligible clinicians may participate in MIPS as individuals or as part of a group that includes one or more of the eligible clinician types. For more information on MIPS, see GAO, Health Care Quality: HHS Should Set Priorities and Comprehensively Plan Its Efforts to Better A lign Health Quality Measures , GAO -17-5 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 13, 2016) and Medicare: Small and Rural Practices' Experiences in Previous Programs and Expected Performance in the Merit -based Incentiv e Payment System , GAO -18-428 (Washington, D.C.: May 31, 2018). Letter Page 84 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance included six DOD facilities and 79 critical access hospitals, according to AHRQ officials. \u00b7 CDC. Since 2014, CDC has published a series of guidance documents \u2014called the Core Elements of Antibiotic S tewardship (Core Elements) \u2014to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics in health care.167The Core Elements are tailored to hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient settings, small and critical access hospitals, and low - and middle -income countries with limite d resources. Common elements in these guidance documents include (1) leadership commitment, (2) implementation of policies and interventions to improve antibiotic use, (3) tracking and reporting antibiotic use, and (4) education to providers on appropriate antibiotic use. Expanded the Collection of Antibiotic Use Data Since we reported on antibiotic use data gaps in 2011, CDC has expanded its collection of such data regarding both inpatient and outpatient settings through its own surveillance systems, as we ll as from other sources.168In particular, CDC has focused its efforts to expand antibiotic use data collection from hospitals, where an estimated one in two patients receives an antibiotic for at least one day during an average hospital stay.169CDC launched its AU Option in 2011 as a voluntary, electronic reporting tool added on to the pre -existing NHSN.170The AU 167Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, The Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Steward ship Programs (Atlanta, Ga.: 2014) and The Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs: 2019 (Atlanta, Ga.: 2019), The Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship for Nursing Homes (Atlanta, Ga.: 2015), The Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship (Atlanta, Ga.: 2016), Implementation of Antibiotic Stewardship Core Elements at Small and Critical Access Hospitals (Atlanta, Ga.: 2017), and The Core Elements of Human Antibiotic Stewardship Programs in Resource -Limited Settings: National and Hospital Levels (Atlanta, Ga.: 2018). 168GAO, Antibiotic Resistance: Data Gaps Will Remain Despite HHS Taking Steps , GAO -11-406(Washington, D.C.: June 1, 2011). 169J. Baggs et al., \"Estimating Nation al Trends in Inpatient Antibiotic Use among U.S. Hospitals from 2006 to 2012,\" JAMA Internal Medicine , vol. 176, no. 11 (2016): pp. 1639 - 1648. 170CDC data indicate that, as of January 1, 2020, there were 6,849 hospitals, including 13 DOD hospitals located on military bases outside the United States, that were eligible for reporting data to the AU Option. Although participation in the NHSN AU Option is generally voluntary, DOD and VA require their hospitals to report antibiotic use data to the AU Option. DOD o fficials told us that 44 DOD hospitals were reporting such data, as of September 30, 2019, and VA officials told us that 113 VA hospitals were reporting such data, as of January 1, 2020. Letter Page 85 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Option allows the nation 's 6,849 hospitals that are already reporting to the NHSN to submit their antibiotic use data in a standardized format.171CDC then aggregates such data to calculate national benchmarks and allows hospitals to compare their actual antibiotic use against those benchmarks. In addition, CDC has periodically conducted prevalence surveys through the EIP to gather data on health care -associated infections and antibiotic use in about 200 hospitals and 161 nursing homes in 10 states. With regard to outpatient settings, CDC has acquired, through a proprietary source, 8 years of pharmacy data on antibiotic prescriptions since 2011, which th e agency is using to better characterize patterns in outpatient prescribing and to develop targeted interventions for high-prescribing areas. Developed Antibiotic Stewardship Training for Various Health Care Settings Federal agencies have developed trainin g on antibiotic stewardship, as follows: \u00b7 CDC. In 2018, CDC launched a free, online training course for various types of clinicians \u2014including physicians, dentists, pharmacists, physician assistants, and nurses \u2014to inform them about proper antibiotic prescrib ing and strategies for communicating with patients.172Clinicians can receive credit for partial completion (at least 50 percent) or full completion of this training as improvement activities under MIPS in 2019. \u00b7 CMS. CMS has provided training, technical assi stance, and other learning opportunities to more than 4,000 hospitals, 2,400 nursing homes, and 7,600 outpatient settings on best practices for antibiotic stewardship and guidance on C. difficile prevention. In addition, CMS and CDC have developed and laun ched free, online training to help nursing homes implement antibiotic stewardship and prevent and manage C. difficile infections. 171As previously noted, hospital types that report data to NHSN include general acute care hospitals, critical access hospitals, children's hospitals, oncology hospitals, long -term acute care hospitals, and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. The AU Option is part of a reporting module called the AUR Module that also tracks antibiotic resistance through the AR Option. 172As of late July 2019, nearly 16,000 individuals had registered for this training, according to CDC officials. Letter Page 86 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance \u00b7 DOD and VA. These departments have also offered antibiotic stewardship training to their health care facilities through webina rs, workshops, or briefings. Funded Research Federal agencies have funded research on antibiotic stewardship, as follows: \u00b7 AHRQ. Since 2015, AHRQ has increased its support for research to develop improved methods to combat antibiotic resistance and promote antibiotic stewardship, including through grants for research that will total more than $57 million, according to AHRQ officials. This research includes studies on the role of diagnostic tools in improving antibiotic use and reducing antibiotic resistance . AHRQ has also published numerous research studies on antibiotic or antimicrobial stewardship that the agency funded or authored. \u00b7 CDC. CDC supports research to identify, develop, and implement practices to stop the spread of resistance and to promote appr opriate use of antibiotics in health care. CDC also supports research to fill gaps in knowledge related to aspects of antibiotic use and resistance that have public health impact. According to agency officials, CDC has provided approximately $110 million s ince 2016 to support this research through cooperative agreements and contracts. Continued National Public Awareness Campaign In 2017, CDC revised a national campaign to promote public awareness about appropriate antibiotic use. The campaign, called \"Be A ntibiotics Aware: Smart Use, Best Care, \" is aimed at both health care providers and the general public and refines the message from CDC 's earlier campaign (\"Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work \"). Collaborated Internationally HHS 's Office of Global Affair s has collaborated with other countries, including those participating in the TATFAR program, to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics internationally. In addition, CDC and the Office of Global Affairs launched the Antimicrobial Resistance Challenge at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2018 to catalyze global action against antibiotic resistance. A year later, CDC announced Letter Page 87 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance this challenge had resulted in nearly 350 commitments from government health officials, pharmaceutical and health i nsurance companies, and others from 33 countries to make formal commitments that further the progress against antimicrobial resistance, such as by improving appropriate antibiotic use. Four Key Challenges Have Limited Federal Efforts to Promote the Appropr iate Use of Antibiotics We identified four key challenges that have limited progress in federal efforts to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics, based on our analysis of documents, interviews with agency officials and experts, and other information. First, federal requirements for antibiotic stewardship programs apply only to certain types of health care facilities, and federal incentives for clinicians to adopt antibiotic stewardship activities are optional, limiting implementation of antibiotic stew ardship across the health care spectrum. Second, CDC faces challenges in collecting complete antibiotic use data, limiting the agency 's ability to monitor and improve antibiotic use. Third, the CARB Task Force has not identified and reported on agencies ' plans to address the challenges related to expanding antibiotic stewardship programs and antibiotic use data collection across health care settings, so these plans are not publicly known. Fourth, antibiotic stewardship training for health care providers may have limited success in improving antibiotic prescribing behavior, and federal agencies indicate that it is challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of such training. Federal Requirements and Incentives Are Limited Federal requirements for antibiotic ste wardship programs are limited to certain types of health care facilities, and federal incentives for antibiotic stewardship activities are optional and limited to eligible Medicare clinicians, such as physicians. \u00b7 Federal requirements for antibiotic steward ship programs are limited to certain types of health care facilities. As previously noted, federal requirements for antibiotic stewardship programs are currently limited to hospitals and critical access hospitals, long -term care facilities such as nursing homes, and DOD and VA health care facilities. However, CMS has not yet developed requirements for ambulatory surgery centers or dialysis centers to implement antibiotic stewardship programs, which the National Action Plan called for being Letter Page 88 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance implemented by Ma rch 2018. CMS officials told us that the agency would develop those requirements once the rule for hospitals and critical access hospitals \u2014which was delayed \u2014was finalized. In addition, CMS 's health and safety requirements do not extend to other types of ou tpatient settings \u2014such as physicians ' offices, retail clinics, and urgent care centers173\u2014where inappropriate antibiotic use has been found to be high.174 In the absence of regulatory levers, CDC and AHRQ encourage those types of facilities to establish antibi otic stewardship programs on a voluntary basis. Experts, including those at our meeting, indicate that expansion of antibiotic stewardship across the health care spectrum is likely to remain limited without additional federal requirements or other meaningf ul incentives \u2014thus hindering the nation from fully achieving the benefits of appropriate antibiotic use. Such benefits include better patient outcomes, lower health care costs, and slower growth of antibiotic resistance. \u00b7 CMS incentives for clinicians to im prove antibiotic use are optional, and implementation has been limited. The MIPS program 's effect on incentivizing appropriate use of antibiotics is limited, in part, because the incentives are available only to clinicians who meet MIPS eligibility criteri a and because eligible clinicians can choose not to report data to CMS. In addition, participating clinicians have a wide range and number of quality measures and improvement activities, beyond those related to antibiotics, from which the clinicians can ch oose to report data to CMS to meet program requirements; thus, the likelihood that clinicians will choose to report on antibiotics - related measures or activities may remain low. For example, in 2017, MIPS -eligible clinicians were generally required to sele ct and submit 173CMS conditions payments for Medicare services to inpatient facilities, such as hospitals and long -term care facilities, and certain outpatient facilities, such as ambulatory surgical centers and dialysis centers, on compliance with CMS's health and safety standards (i.e., CMS's Conditions of Participation or Conditions for Coverage requirements). In ad dition, CMS generally pays clinicians separately for their Medicare services, regardless of whether the treatment takes place in health care facilities for which CMS has established health and safety standards, or in facilities that are not subject to CMS' s health and safety standards, such as physician offices, retail clinics, and urgent care centers. 174As previously noted, CDC has reported that at least 30 percent, and as much as 50 percent, of antibiotic use in outpatient settings is inappropriate in the United States. See also D. L. Palms et al., \"Comparison of Antibiotic Prescribing in Retail Clinics, Urgent Care Centers, Emergency Departments, and Traditional Ambulatory Care Settings in the United States, \" JAMA Internal Medicine , vol. 178, no. 9 (2018) : pp. 1267 -1269; and D. L. Palms et al., \"First-Line Antibiotic Selection in Outpatient Settings, \" Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy , vol. 63, no. 11 (2019) : pp. e01060 -19. Letter Page 89 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance data to CMS on six out of 271 available quality measures; we identified nine of those measures as being related to antibiotics. MIPS -eligible clinicians were also generally required to select and submit data that year for up to four out of 93 available improvement activities; we identified one such activity as being related to antibiotics. Our analysis of CMS data on MIPS participation in 2017, the program 's first performance year and the most recently available data, indicates that implementa tion of the antibiotics -related quality measures and improvement activities was limited. According to a CMS report, a total of 1,057,824 clinicians were eligible for MIPS in 2017, of which 1,006,319 clinicians, or 95 percent, reported data.175 Based on our a nalysis of data contained in the CMS report 's appendix, the number of 2017 MIPS -participating clinicians who reported to CMS on the nine antibiotics -related quality measures ranged from 844 clinicians to 33,631 clinicians; the measure on appropriate treatm ent for children with an upper respiratory infection was the most reported antibiotics -related measure.176By contrast, the most frequently reported quality measures overall in 2017 were controlling high blood pressure (510,723 clinicians), preventive care and screening for tobacco use (492,357), and breast cancer screening (473,819). CMS 's data also show that for the 2017 MIPS improvement activities, 47,645 of the 1,006,319 participating clinicians reported on the one improvement activity related to antibiot ics that year: implementation of 175Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Servic es, 2017 Quality Payment Program Reporting Experience (Baltimore, Md.: March 2019). CMS officials told us that for the first year of MIPS (the 2017 performance period), the agency estimates there were approximately 538,000 clinicians who were not eligible to participate in MIPS. 176We recognize that not all types of MIPS -eligible clinicians prescribe antibiotics or treat patient populations that relate to specific MIPS antibiotics -related quality measures; thus, such measures would only be appropriate for so me providers to select and report on. For example, pediatricians and other clinicians who treat children would be more likely to choose and report on measures related to the appropriate use of antibiotics in children. In addition, it is possible that some MIPS -eligible clinicians implemented antibiotics -related quality measures but chose not to report them to CMS. However, the extent of these circumstances is unknown because CMS's data did not capture this information. Letter Page 90 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance an antibiotic stewardship program.177Specifically, this activity referred to implementation of an antibiotic stewardship program that measured the appropriate use of antibiotics for several different conditions (upper respir atory infections in children, pharyngitis, and bronchitis in adults), according to clinical guidelines for diagnostics and therapeutics.178 CDC Faces Challenges in Collecting Complete Antibiotic Use Data, Limiting the Agency 's Ability to Monitor and Improve Appropriate Use CDC 's ability to monitor and improve appropriate antibiotic use is limited by challenges it faces in collecting complete antibiotic use data across health care settings. According to CDC, experts we interviewed, and documents we reviewed, m ore data are needed to identify the extent of antibiotic use, including inappropriate use. In turn, CDC and experts say that more antibiotic use data would enable health care providers, federal agencies, and others to identify and target areas for improvem ent, track results over time, and adjust antibiotic stewardship activities as needed.179We have also previously reported that monitoring antibiotic use over time in both inpatient and outpatient settings is important for understanding patterns in antibiotic resistance and for targeting 177We recognize that not all types of MI PS-eligible clinicians prescribe antibiotics; thus, MIPS antibiotics -related improvement activities would only be appropriate for some providers to select and report on. For example, clinicians who do not prescribe antibiotics would be unable to choose and report on an improvement activity to implement antibiotic stewardship programs. In addition, it is possible that some MIPS -eligible providers implemented antibiotic stewardship programs but chose not to report that to CMS as a MIPS improvement activity. H owever, the extent of these circumstances is unknown because CMS's data did not capture this information. 178In contrast, the most frequently reported improvement activities overall in 2017 were providing 24/7 access to eligible clinicians or groups that ha ve real -time access to a patient's medical record (190,510 clinicians), use of decision support and standardized treatment protocols (118,450), and patient -centered medical home attestation (110,057). 179For example, recent studies show that antibiotics are frequently inappropriately selected for common outpatient infections and that fluoroquinolones are frequently used inappropriately in adults, pointing to key areas where antibiotic stewardship could be targeted. See A. L. Hersh et al., \"Frequency of First -line Antibiotic Selection among U.S. Ambulatory Care Visits for Otitis Media, Sinusitis, and Pharyngitis,\" Improve Fluoroquinolone Prescribing in the U nited States for Adult Ambulatory Care Visits,\" Clinical Infectious Diseases , vol. 67, no. 1 (2018): pp. 134 -136. Letter Page 91 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance stewardship activities.180In addition, WHO notes that data on global antibiotic use is essential for obtaining a comprehensive picture of antibiotic resistance and for identifying areas where actions are needed.181 Despite progre ss in collecting antibiotic use data (as previously discussed), CDC faces several challenges in its efforts to collect complete antibiotic use data. For example, health care providers across various inpatient and outpatient settings do not record such data in one centralized, electronic database. In addition, CDC officials told us that there are no uniform requirements at the federal level (with the exception of DOD and VA hospitals) for providers to report their antibiotic use data to a centralized databas e such as the NHSN AU Option, and, according to CDC officials and experts we interviewed, data collection can be costly for CDC and health care providers. Because of these and other challenges, CDC relies on data voluntarily reported by hospitals through the AU Option, and the agency collects its own data or purchases proprietary pharmacy data to estimate antibiotic use \u2014and, to some degree, to assess appropriateness of use \u2014across health care settings. However, these data are incomplete owing to several limi tations, as described by type of setting below. \u00b7 Hospitals. Our analysis of CDC data shows that although the number of hospitals participating in the AU Option has gradually risen since its launch in 2011, participation remains limited, with 1,561, or 23 percent, of the 6,849 eligible hospitals reporting at least one month of antibiotic use data as of January 1, 2020.182(See fig. 5 for a map showing the percentage of U.S. hospitals reporting antibiotic use data to the AU Option, by state , plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, as of August 2019.) While CDC officials told us they considered this level of participation to be an accomplishment given that participation is voluntary, the National Action Plan set 95 percent participation in the AU Option by 2020 as a significant outcome to 180GAO -11-406. 181World Health Organization, WHO Report on Surveillance of Antibiotic Cons umption: 2016 -2018 Early Implementation (Geneva, Switzerland: 2018). 182CDC data indicate that, as of January 1, 2020, there were 6,849 hospitals, including 13 DOD hospitals located on military bases outside the United States, that were eligible for reportin g data to the AU Option. Letter Page 92 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance support the plan 's goal to strengthen national surveillance efforts to combat resistance.183 Figure 5: Percentage of U.S. Hospitals Reporting Antibiotic Use Data to CDC 's National Healthcare Safety Network, by State , plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico , as of August 2019 Note: U.S. hospitals can choose to report their antibiotic use data, on a voluntary basis, to CDC through the National Healthcare Safety Network 's Antimicrobial Use Option. The percentages of hospi tals shown in this figure had electronically submitted at least one month of antibiotic use data to this database as of August 2019, according to CDC. Experts, including those at our meeting, cite multiple challenges that CDC faces in collecting hospitals ' antibiotic use data through the AU Option. For example, The Pew Charitable Trusts has stated that current, 183As previously noted, the National Action Plan contains five goals that are supported by numerous objectives, sub -objectives, agency -specific milestones, and significant outcomes. Letter Page 93 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance voluntary data are limited and that mandatory reporting would provide the data needed to establish a more accurate baseline of antibiotic use, ident ify stewardship interventions that would be most effective, and measure progress toward reducing inappropriate prescribing.184An expert who attended our meeting later suggested that CMS could implement a pay-for-reporting program to incentivize hospitals to report data to the AU Option, and that the program could transition to a pay -for-performance program over time.185In addition, experts we interviewed told us that a participating hospital must be willing to spend as much as tens of thousands of dollars for a vendor to customize software for their electronic health record systems to use the AU Option, in addition to investing time training staff on how to use it. CDC officials also told us that the agency lacks the authority to require hospitals to report th eir antibiotic use data, and that there is currently no federal funding available to assist hospitals with the investment needed to participate in the AU Option. Furthermore, hospitals ' voluntary participation in the AU Option may remain limited until CDC 's benchmark measures are adequately risk - adjusted for different locations and patient populations.186For example, one expert we interviewed said that because the AU Option currently aggregates data on the volume of antibiotics used without adequate risk adjustment, a hospital with a patient population that might warrant higher use of antibiotics may be reluctant to report its antibiotic use data to avoid 184The Pew Charitable Trusts, Trends in Antibiotic U se, 2018 (Aug. 29, 2018). 185Since the early 2000s, CMS has offered financial incentives to Medicare providers who report their performance on specified quality measures. Under a pay -for-reporting program, such as the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting pro gram, a hospital may receive higher payments for reporting data on the quality measures used in the program. Under a pay-for-performance program, a hospital may receive higher payments based on its level of performance on the measures. 186In 2016, CMS invit ed public comment on the possibility of CDC's benchmark measures' future inclusion in CMS's Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting program, which would allow the public to access antibiotic use information on individual hospitals.

Reg. 25197 (Apr. 27, 2016). However, CDC officials told us that it would likely be a few years before the benchmark measures would be adequately risk -adjusted and therefore ready to become a required reporting measure. Letter Page 94 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance looking like an unnecessarily high prescriber.187Regarding another data source for antibiotic use in hospi tals, CDC 's EIP provides more granular data at the patient level that allows CDC to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic use. However, CDC officials told us that the agency has been unable to repeat its hospital prevalence survey since 2015 due to insufficient resources (the next survey is expected in 2020) and that the survey encompasses a limited number of hospitals, patients, and states. \u00b7 Nursing homes. According to CDC, nursing homes may be the most challenging health care setting from which the agen cy collects antibiotic use data; CDC officials stated that this is because electronic health record systems, from which data could be easily accessed, are less common in nursing homes.188In addition, CDC officials stated that the agency 's collection of anti biotic use data through the EIP nursing homes prevalence survey has been limited in scope and frequency due to insufficient resources. \u00b7 Outpatient settings. Collecting data for outpatient settings, such as retail pharmacies, is also challenging. For exampl e, CDC officials stated that one proprietary source from which CDC purchases data reflects the volume of pharmacy antibiotic prescriptions, but the data do not contain diagnostic information, preventing the agency from evaluating the appropriateness of tho se prescriptions. Other CDC or proprietary data sources from which the agency collects or purchases antibiotic use data are limited by the frequency with which those sources release such data, the age range of patients included in the data (i.e., whether t hey are over or under 65 years), or other characteristics. As previously noted, approximately 85 to 95 percent of 187The AU Option's ben chmark measures allow a participating hospital to compare its \"observed\" antibiotic use with nationally aggregated (\"predicted\") use for specific antibacterial agents administered to adult and pediatric patients in specific ward and intensive care unit loc ations. CDC notes that the measures are designed to serve as high - value targets or high -level indicators for hospitals' antibiotic stewardship programs. Thus, a given hospital's results are intended to prompt analysis of possible overuse, underuse, or inap propriate use of antibiotics; identify opportunities for improvement; and gauge the impact of stewardship efforts. CDC also notes that higher -than-average antibiotic use might be justified, while lower -than-average use might harm patients, and that additio nal analyses to determine the appropriateness of antibiotic use in individual instances are likely to require access to detailed, patient -level data that is beyond the scope of data collection and analysis using the AU Option. 188However, CDC officials stat ed that the agency has partnered with electronic health record vendors and pharmacies to obtain access to and analyze nursing home antibiotic use data to inform stewardship efforts. Letter Page 95 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance the nation 's antibiotic use, by volume, occurred in outpatient settings from 2010 through 2015. The CARB Task Force Has Not Identified Plans to Address Challenges Related to Expanding Stewardship Programs and Antibiotic Use Data Collection The National Action Plan calls for strengthening antibiotic stewardship and for the timely reporting of antibiotic use data across health care settings. Exec utive Order No. 13676, as previously noted, directs the CARB Task Force to provide annual updates to the President on federal government actions to combat antibiotic resistance, including progress made in implementing the National Action Plan and plans for addressing any barriers preventing its full implementation.189These annual updates are to include specific goals, milestones, and metrics for proposed actions and recommendations, taking into consideration federal resources. However, in its progress report s covering the first four years of the National Action Plan 's implementation \u2014which were provided to the President and the public \u2014the CARB Task Force has not identified plans to address barriers that agencies face in expanding antibiotic stewardship program s across health care settings.190For example, the task force did not include in the progress reports CMS 's plans to address barriers to expanding its requirements for antibiotic stewardship programs in 189Exec. Order No. 13676, \u00a7 3(c)(ii) (Sept. 23, 2014). The National Action Plan contains a sub-objective on strengthening antibiotic stewardship in inpatient, outpatient, and long - term care settings by expanding existing programs, developing new ones, and monitoring progress and efficacy. In addition, the National Action Plan con tains a 3 -year milestone, which CMS missed, for the agency to require hospitals and certain other health care settings (long -term acute care hospitals, other post -acute facilities, ambulatory surgery centers, and dialysis centers) to implement antibiotic s tewardship programs through the agency's Conditions of Participation. For the purposes of this report, we consider the terms challenges and barriers to be synonymous. 190CARB Task Force, National Action Plan: Progress Report for Years 1 and 2 , National Actio n Plan: Progress Report: Year 3 , and National Action Plan: Progress Report: Year 4 . Letter Page 96 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance hospitals, which w ere delayed, or in certain other type s of health care facilities.191 In addition, in its progress reports to date, the CARB Task Force has not identified plans to address the barriers to expanding the collection of antibiotic use data across health care settings.192For example, the task force di d not include in the progress reports CDC 's plans to address barriers to achieving the significant outcome of 95 percent of eligible hospitals participating in the AU Option by 2020, although participation was only 23 percent as of January 1, 2020. The CAR B Task Force coordinators said, in response to our inquiries during this review, that the task force intends to identify agencies ' plans for addressing barriers in the Year 5 progress report to be published in fall 2020. However, the coordinators also stat ed that the progress reports to date have not identified plans to address barriers largely because the task force focused on reporting the agencies ' accomplishments in implementing the National Action Plan. Until the CARB Task Force identifies and reports on agencies ' plans to address barriers related to the expansion of antibiotic stewardship programs and the collection of antibiotic use data across health care settings to the extent feasible, the federal government will not have reasonable assurance that it is fully implementing the National Action Plan and addressing antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic Stewardship Training May Have Limited Success in Improving Prescribing Behavior While training is recognized as one component of an antibiotic stewardship pr ogram, such training may have limited success in improving antibiotic prescribing behavior, and federal agencies indicate 191CMS's notice explained that the extension of the timeline for final rule publication was due to the complexity of the rule and its substantive nature.

Reg. 27069 (June 11, 2019). See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395hh(a)(3)(B). 192One of the National Action Plan's objectives is to expand and strengthen the national infrastructure for public health surveillance and data reporting and to provide in centives for timely reporting of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic use in all health care settings. In addition, to measure progress toward the goal to slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant infections, the National Action Plan set a significant outcome of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use by 50 percent in outpatient settings and by 20 percent in inpatient settings by 2020 \u2014a performance target that requires the collection, analysis, and reporting of antibiotic us e data. Letter Page 97 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance that it is challenging to evaluate the training 's effectiveness. CDC officials and experts say that inappropriate antibiotic use could be improved through stewardship training, but it is challenging because antibiotic prescribing behavior is driven by multiple factors and can be difficult to change. For example, a PACCARB report stated that prescribers often feel pressure to prescribe an tibiotics \u2014even when antibiotics may not be warranted \u2014because of their perception that a patient is demanding such a prescription, or a patient 's actual demand.193In addition, CDC notes that antibiotics are frequently prescribed for respiratory conditions mo st commonly caused by viruses such as the common cold, against which antibiotics are ineffective. Other factors that drive antibiotic prescribing behavior, as cited by experts, include habit, which may stem from what physicians and other prescribers learn during their residencies or observe in the workplace; the time it takes to explain to a patient why an antibiotic is inappropriate; and \"decision fatigue \" caused by tiredness or hunger. (See table 4 for examples of factors that drive or deter antibiotic prescribing behavior.) Table 4: Examples of Factors That Drive or Deter Antibiotic Prescribing Behavior Factors that drive antibiotic prescribing Factors that deter antibiotic prescribing \u00b7 Perception that patients want antibiotics \u00b7 Fear that patients will not be satisfied with their care without a prescription, leading patients to give the provider poor ratings or reviews \u00b7 Perception that it is easier and quicker to prescribe antibiotics than to explain to patients why they are unnecessary \u00b7 No billing code or reimbursement for \"stewardship \" \u00b7 Habit \u00b7 Decision fatigue caused by tiredness or hunger \u00b7 Worry about serious complications (without antibiotics) and a \"just to be safe \" mentality \u00b7 Lack of financial incentives to use diagnostic tests (e.g., to determine if an i nfection is bacterial vs. viral) \u00b7 Reluctance to wait to see if a patient 's symptoms continue before prescribing \u00b7 Risks of adverse reactions \u00b7 Risks of drug interactions \u00b7 Recognition of the need for antibiotic stewardship \u00b7 Desire to deter low -value carea \u00b7 Desire t o decrease unnecessary health care spending \u00b7 Preference to follow prescribing guidelines \u00b7 Comparison with peers of antibiotic prescriptions data \u00b7 Use of a \"pre-commitment \" poster/letter to patients that the medical practice is dedicated to appropriate use of antibiotics \u00b7 \"Accountable justification \"\u2014a pop -up window that appears on electronic health record systems, alerting providers that antibiotics are not generally indicated for the diagnosis and asking the provider to enter a reason to justify the prescriptio n Source: GAO summary of information from A.

Lette r Page 98 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance aIn health care, low -value care refers to treatments, tests, and procedures that are either wasteful or ineffective, such as an antibiotic prescription for a viral infection. Nevertheless, federal agencies plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their antibiotic stewardship training programs to some extent, although the National Action Plan does not require the agencies to do so. For example, CDC officials told us that their online training course for various types of clinicians allows participant s to fill out an evaluation that includes questions about whether the participant will be able to apply knowledge gained from the course, which the agency will use to refine and update the course.194In addition, for the antibiotic stewardship training for n ursing homes that CDC and CMS jointly developed, CDC officials told us that participants will be asked 6 months after the training whether participants implemented stewardship practices \u2014and whether there have been reductions in antibiotic use \u2014as a result o f the training. However, CMS, DOD, and VA officials noted that it is difficult to isolate and measure the effectiveness of antibiotic stewardship training specifically on antibiotic prescribing behavior \u2014compared to other, concurrent federal efforts, such as requirements and guidance to promote appropriate antibiotic use. For example, DOD officials told us that their department has looked at antibiotic use data from DOD health care facilities as a \"surrogate \" to evaluate whether antibiotic stewardship in gen eral has been effective \u2014 but noted that is an imperfect measure since there are many factors that affect antibiotic prescribing behavior, and training is only one of several interventions aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use. Conclusions Antibioti c resistance has been characterized as one of the greatest public health threats the world faces. A concerted effort involving coordination of multiple stakeholders and countries and across health fields is critical to helping ensure that bacterial infecti ons remain treatable. Steps by federal agencies to expand surveillance, facilitate the development and use of new diagnostic tests, fund R&D for the development of new treatments, and issue requirements and guidance for antibiotic stewardship programs are important efforts toward addressing the problem of antibiotic resistance and implementing the National Action Plan. Significant challenges to conducting surveillance remain. For example, CDC has not determined the participation rates or appropriate distrib ution 194CDC officials also told us that the agency piloted the online training course with target audiences prior to its release in order to improve the course. Letter Page 99 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance of participating hospitals needed by the voluntary antibiotic -resistance reporting option to achieve CDC 's goal of conducting regional and national assessments of resistance. By taking steps to determine the participation rates and distribution neede d for this option, CDC would have more reasonable assurance that it can achieve its goal. CDC classified gonorrhea as one of the most urgent resistant threats in the nation, but collects limited specimens \u2014representing an estimated 1 to 2 percent of the rep orted cases in the United States \u2014for GISP, its primary surveillance system for resistant gonorrhea. However, CDC has not fully evaluated the representativeness of the trends identified by this surveillance system. By evaluating GISP to ensure that it inclu des measures of its representativeness, such as comparing the trends in the sample population with those in the overall U.S. population, using specially designed studies if needed, CDC would have better assurance that the trends detected in GISP accurately reflect the characteristics of the health -related outcome the system is designed to monitor. Further, neither the 2013 nor the 2019 Threats Reports provided quantitative measures of uncertainty for CDC 's estimates of morbidity and mortality resulting from antibiotic -resistant infections. Providing such measures, such as standard errors or confidence intervals, as appropriate, in its Threats Reports would help CDC and others compare information within and across reporting efforts, and draw appropriate concl usions about the characteristics of antibiotic resistance in the United States, including limitations associated with reported findings and conclusions. Finally, there has been a 6 -year interval between CDC 's reports on antibiotic resistance threats. By de veloping a plan for more frequent dissemination of consolidated reporting on priority pathogens at regular intervals, CDC would have more timely trend data and other information necessary for users of the data, including policymakers, to prioritize, plan, implement, and evaluate public health actions to address antibiotic resistance. HHS has funded some studies to assess whether certain tests for antibiotic resistance lead to improved clinical outcomes, including more effective treatment for patients or mor e judicious use of antibiotics. However, HHS agencies that are in a position to conduct or fund such studies have not identified leadership, roles, and responsibilities to help further such efforts. By taking steps to identify leadership, roles, and respon sibilities, agencies could more effectively address the need for clinical outcomes studies, potentially increasing test use, improving patient care, and enhancing stewardship efforts. In addition, for its part, FDA has not regularly monitored tests for ant ibiotic resistance to assess breakpoint updates or evaluated any effects of using tests for antibiotic resistance with out -of-date breakpoints. By regularly monitoring and Letter Page 100 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance evaluating FDA -authorized tests that rely on breakpoints, FDA would be able to deter mine whether test manufacturers are updating breakpoints as needed and help ensure that patient care and infection control efforts are effective. While government push incentives to support antibiotic R&D have been helpful, experts and antibiotic developer s have indicated that push incentives alone are not sufficient to sustain antibiotic development. PACCARB, TATFAR, and other experts have called for additional postmarket pull incentives to increase the antibiotic pipeline, but HHS does not have a strategy for doing so. Developing a strategic framework that outlines key design elements of new incentives would be a first step toward identifying potential authorities and resources that may be needed and determining agency roles for implementation and oversigh t of the incentives. Until such incentives are developed, more drug companies may exit the antibiotic development sector, and the pipeline of new treatments may continue to decrease. Finally, in its progress reports covering the first four years of the Nat ional Action Plan 's implementation, the CARB Task Force did not identify plans, as required by the Executive Order, to address barriers that agencies face in fully implementing the National Action Plan, such as expanding (1) a CDC program designed to stren gthen the U.S. response to resistant gonorrhea ; (2) antibiotic stewardship programs across health care settings ; and (3) antibiotic use data collection, to the extent feasible. Without identifying plans to address these and other challenges, the federal go vernment cannot assure that the country is prepared to overcome the urgent health consequences of antibiotic resistance. Until the CARB Task Force, which is coordinated by HHS officials, identifies and reports on agencies ' plans to address barriers prevent ing full implementation of the National Action Plan, the federal government will not have reasonable assurance that it is fully implementing the National Action Plan and addressing antibiotic resistance. Recommendations for Executive Action We are making a total of eight recommendations, including four to CDC, three to HHS, and one to FDA. Specifically: The Director of CDC should take steps to determine participation rates and distribution needed in the AR Option of the National Healthcare Letter Page 101 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Safety Network fo r conducting regional and national assessments of antibiotic resistance of public health importance. (Recommendation 1) The Director of CDC should ensure that CDC 's evaluation of its surveillance system for antibiotic -resistant gonorrhea include s measures of its representativeness, such as comparison of the trends in the sample population with those in the overall U.S. population, using specially designed studies if needed. (Recommendation 2) The Director of CDC should provide information on uncertainties f or antibiotic resistance estimates in its consolidated Threats Reports, including standard errors or confidence intervals, as appropriate. (Recommendation 3) The Director of CDC should develop a plan for timely, consolidated reports of antibiotic resistanc e in priority pathogens at regular intervals. (Recommendation 4) The Secretary of HHS should identify leadership and clarify roles and responsibilities among HHS agencies to assess the clinical outcomes of diagnostic testing for identifying antibiotic -resistant bacteria. (Recommendation 5) The Commissioner of FDA should direct the Center for Devices and Radiological Health to conduct additional monitoring and evaluation of the status of FDA -authorized tests that rely on breakpoints, on a regular basis, to d etermine whether test manufacturers are updating breakpoints, seeking additional resources as needed. (Recommendation 6) The Secretary of HHS should develop a strategic framework to further incentivize the development of new treatments for antibiotic -resis tant infections, including through the use of postmarket financial incentives, and, if appropriate, make recommendations to Congress for necessary authority. (Recommendation 7) The Secretary of HHS should direct the CARB Task Force to include in its annual updates to the President plans for addressing any barriers preventing full implementation of the National Action Plan and, as appropriate, make recommendations for new or modified actions. Specifically, the CARB Task Force should identify plans to address barriers, such as those related to expanding (1) a CDC program designed to strengthen the U.S. response to resistant gonorrhea; (2) antibiotic stewardship programs across health care settings ; and (3) antibiotic use Letter Page 102 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance data collection across health care sett ings, to the extent feasible. (Recommendation 8) Agency Comments and Our Evaluation We provided a draft of this report to DOD, VA, and HHS for review and comment. DOD and VA did not provide formal comments but generally agreed with our report. In its comme nts, reproduced in appendix V, HHS generally concurred with our findings and seven of our recommendations, and did not concur with one of our recommendations, as discussed below. HHS identified several actions it intends to take to address our recommendati ons. DOD and HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. In response to our first recommendation, HHS concurred and CDC stated it is working with public health partners to promote the voluntary use of the AR Option, providin g technical support to states that may be considering a state or local mandate to require AR and AU reporting, and developing pilot programs to assess AR Option data and other data sources for certain types of antibiotic resistance. While these actions are helpful, we believe taking additional steps, such as determining goals for participation rates and distribution for AR Option reporting, would give CDC more reasonable assurance that hit can conduct regional and national assessments of resistance. In resp onse to our second recommendation, HHS concurred and CDC stated it is taking additional efforts to examine the representativeness of data collected through its primary surveillance system for resistant gonorrhea, including working to develop laboratory met hods to reduce dependence on cultured isolates. CDC stated that steps to refine and improve collection of resistant gonorrhea data require additional resources. We believe that CDC requesting such resources would help ensure that such data are representati ve of the overall U.S. population. HHS generally concurred with our third recommendation. CDC stated it feels that it is critical to publish the data after peer review and then plans to link the publications back to online resources of the 2019 Threats Report. We believe that peer -reviewed publication is important, but it is also important for CDC to take additional steps to establish and report uncertainties for the national estimates or summary data that would help Letter Page 103 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance CDC and others draw appropriate conclusi ons about the characteristics of antibiotic resistance in the United States. In response to our fourth recommendation, HHS concurred and CDC stated it has plans to update its enterprise -wide AR Threats Report every three years, and that it also issues regu lar reports on specific groups of pathogens. In response to our fifth recommendation, HHS concurred and stated that the CARB Task Force leadership will work with relevant HHS agencies to clarify roles and responsibilities and identif y leadership, if approp riate, for supporting research on clinical outcomes delated to diagnostic tests. HHS concurred with our sixth recommendation, and FDA concurred with conducting additional monitoring and evaluation of tests relying on breakpoints when FDA identifies or reco gnizes new breakpoints. FDA stated that it has taken major steps to help address challenges associated with updating such tests to reflect the most current breakpoints. We believe that in addition to these steps, monitoring and evaluation of current FDA -authorized tests that may still be using out -of- date breakpoints will enhance FDA 's ability to provide assurance that patient care and infection control efforts are effective. HHS did not concur with our seventh recommendation that HHS should develop a strat egic framework to further incentivize the development of new treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections, including through the use of postmarket financial incentives. HHS noted that, while it agrees that additional incentives are needed to address the limited pipeline for novel and innovative treatments to combat antibiotic resistance, it is still conducting analyses to understand whether postmarket incentives should be included as a component of its forthcoming strategic framework to further incentiviz e the development of new treatments. However, HHS did not specify when its framework would be released. We support HHS 's efforts to develop such a framework, as this is a complex issue with multiple factors to consider. However, we believe our recommendati on is still warranted. Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest global public health threats, and experts, including the WHO, have warned that the pipeline of new antibiotics in development is insufficient to combat the threat. Without an adequate arse nal of treatments, we are likely to see increasing mortality caused by these deadly infections. As we reported, experts, advisory groups, federal officials, and antibiotic developers have all called for additional postmarket incentives to reinvigorate the pipeline of antibiotics under development. The current significant federal Letter Page 104 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance investment in push incentives to support antibiotic R&D is helpful but will ultimately be ineffective if companies receiving this investment are unable to sustain their business onc e their treatment reaches the market. Therefore, we maintain that it is important that HHS not delay the development of a strategic framework that includes postmarket incentives , which is just an initial step toward the creation of these incentives. Until additional postmarket incentives are developed, more drug companies may exit the antibiotic development sector, and the pipeline of new treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections may continue to decrease. In response to our eighth recommendation, HHS c oncurred and stated that beginning in 2020 and continuing annually thereafter, the CARB Task Force 's progress reports will include discussion of any barriers preventing full implementation of the National Action Plan, including, as appropriate, barriers th at GAO has identified. We emphasize that the CARB Task Force should also identify plans to address such barriers \u2014and, as appropriate, make recommendations for new or modified actions \u2014in future progress reports, in accordance with Executive Order No. 13676. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date.

We focused our review primarily on agency actions since 2015, when the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (National Action Plan) was published.1 We also focused our review on human health, as we have reported on federal efforts to address the use of antibiotics in food animals and recommended actions to improve these efforts for more than 20 years.2 Additionally, we focused our review on antibiotic -resistant bacteria. We generally excluded federal efforts related to infection prevention and control in human health care, on which we have previously reported.3 To address all four objectives, we reviewed relevant agency reports and documents, such as CDC 's report, Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 (2013 Threats Report); conducted interviews with 1The White House, National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (Washington, D.C.: March 2015). 2GAO, Antibiotic Resistance: More Information Needed to Oversee Use of Medically Important Drugs in Food Animals , GAO -17-192(Washington, D.C.: Mar. 2, 2017); Antibiotic Resistance: Agencie s Have Made Limited Progress Addressing Antibiotic Use in Animals , GAO -11-801 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 7, 2011); Antibiotic Resistance: Federal Agencies Need to Better Focus Efforts to Address Risk to Humans from Antibiotic Use in Animals , GAO -04-490 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 22, 2004); and Food Safety: The Agricultural Use of Antibiotics and Its Implications for Human Health , GAO/RCED -99-74 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 28, 1999). 3GAO, Health -Care -Associated Infections in Hospitals: Leadership Needed from HHS to Prioritize Prevention Practices and Improve Data on These Infections , GAO -08-283 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 31, 2008). Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 107 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance officials from federal agencies, experts, and st akeholder organizations; and we reviewed relevant literature, policy papers, and GAO reports.4 We interviewed officials from federal agencies responsible for implementing the aspects of the National Action Plan related to our research objectives: the Depar tment of Health and Human Services ' (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) , CDC , the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) , the Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA) , the National Institutes of Health (NIH) , and the Office of Global Affairs ; as well as the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs. We also interviewed experts and representatives from organizations involved in publi c health and epidemiology, infectious diseases and microbiology, antibiotic research and development (R&D), antibiotic stewardship, and other issues relating to antibiotic resistance. Because antibiotic resistance is a global problem, we also interviewed o fficials from the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the European Medicines Agency, the Wellcome Trust, Public Health England, and the Surveillance and Epidemiology of Drug -Resistant Infections Consorti um about various aspects of our review; and we reviewed relevant documents from these entities. We identified experts and organizations through literature and other documents we reviewed and through referrals from agency officials and other experts we inte rviewed.5 In addition, we attended several meetings and reviewed summaries of meetings held by the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB). Furthermore, we attended two conferences related to antibiotic resistance : the World Anti -Microbial Resistance Congress and the Gordon Research Conference on chemical and biological threat defense, the latter of which had a session devoted to antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. For each of our objectives, we identified and reported on actions taken by federal agencies and key challenges that the agencies face in addressing antibiotic resistance. We evaluated the actions taken by federal agencies against relevant criteria, as applicable. In addition, in September 2018, we conv ened a meeting of experts in antibiotic resistance epidemiology, diagnostic testing, antibiotic development, and antibiotic stewardship. This meeting of experts was 4Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 (Atlanta, G a.: Apr. 23, 2013). 5We assessed the studies we cite in this report for their methodological limitations and determined that they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 108 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance planned and convened with the assistance of the National Academy of Sciences to better ensu re that a breadth of expertise was brought to bear in its preparation; however, all final decisions regarding meeting substance and expert participation are the responsibility of GAO. Any conclusions and recommendations in GAO reports are solely those of t he GAO. The Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice within the National Academy of Sciences solicited expert nominations from academia, public health laboratories, industry, and other organizations working in topics relating to antibiotic res istance. From their list of 51 nominees, and additional nominees we independently identified, we convened a meeting of 18 experts selected for their knowledge and expertise related to antibiotic resistance epidemiology, diagnostic testing, antibiotic devel opment, and antibiotic stewardship. Eleven of the 18 experts who participated in our meeting also reviewed and provided comments on a draft of our report. We refer to such experts in this report as \"experts at our meeting; \" appendix II contains a list of t he expert participants. To examine CDC 's efforts to address surveillance for antibiotic resistance and any challenges to these efforts, we reviewed documentation and conducted interviews with agency officials and other key stakeholders on each of the surve illance systems across CDC that track antibiotic resistance and reviewed CDC 's 2013 Threats Report and CDC 's Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 data.6 We further focused our review on the 17 priority disease -causing bacteria listed in CDC 's 2013 Threats Report. The CDC surveillance systems included: \u00b7 Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network \u00b7 Emerging Infections Program (EIP) \u00b7 Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Program (GISP) \u00b7 National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) \u00b7 Nationa l Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) \u00b7 National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System \u00b7 National Tuberculosis Surveillance System For NHSN, we also assessed health care facility participation data by state and territory. We assessed the reliability of these da ta by reviewing 6Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion, Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 (Atlanta, Ga.: Nov. 13, 2019). Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 109 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance them for any outliers or anomalies and by inquiring with agency officials about their source and any known reliability issues. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for assessing facility participation rates by U.S. state and territory. Stakeholder organizations we interviewed represented state and territorial epidemiologists and other public health officials (the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials ) and an international consortium to address challenges in surveillance of antibiotic resistance (the Surveillance and Epidemiology of Drug -resistant Infections Consortium). We also reviewed reports on antibiotic resistance surveillance challenges from the Public Health Informatics Task Force and the Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Task Force. We also reviewed documents from WHO 's global surveillance system and interviewed WHO and CDC officials to identify challenges that limit CDC 's ability to assess threats from abroad. We evaluated challenges and steps CDC has taken against CDC 's \"Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems; \" Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government ; prior GAO work; the Government Performance an d Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010; the Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A -11 and Standards and Guidelines for Statistical Surveys ; relevant National Action Plan objectives, aims, and milestones; and Executive O rder No. 13676, September 2014.7 To examine federal efforts to advance the development and use of diagnostic tests, we also interviewed representatives from a nongeneralizable selection of six diagnostic test manufacturers to identify challenges they face in developing tests for antibiotic resistance and challenges in increasing user adoption of their tests. We further focused our review on the 17 priority disease -causing bacteria listed in CDC 's 2013 Threats Report.

We identified these manufacturers by compiling a list based on previous work we conducted, interviews with select experts, and in ternet search. We selected six manufacturers that were identified by more than one source while encompassing different types of tests (culture and genotypic). We limited our scope to FDA -authorized tests \u2014that is, tests that have been reviewed and cleared b y FDA for marketing in the United States \u2014that can identify resistance in at least one type of bacteria categorized as priority bacteria in CDC 's 2013 Threats Report.8 Some of these tests are called antibiotic susceptibility tests, but we refer to the entir e class of such tests as \"tests. \" We included in our scope tests that can differentiate between viral and bacterial infection because these types of tests are included in the National Action Plan. We evaluated the actions taken by federal agencies against the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , relevant National Action Plan objectives, aims, and milestones under Goal 3, and relevant sections in the PACCARB Recommendations for Incentivizing the Development of Vaccines, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics to Combat Antibiotic Resistance . We also evaluated federal agency actions against the \"leadership \" and \"clarity of roles and responsibilities \" leading practices from GAO 's Managing for Results: Key Considerations for Implementing Interagency C ollaborative Mechanisms .9 We focused on these key practices when there was a lack of specifically assigned roles in either the National Action Plan or the PACCARB report for key activities. To identify challenges to developing new treatments for antibiotic - resistant infections and examine federal efforts to address these challenges, we also interviewed 11 randomly selected companies that conduct research and development on new treatments for bacterial 8FDA officials told us that the tests under GAO review are Cl ass II devices and thus reviewed as 510(k) or de novo applications and are appropriately referred to as cleared when granted marketing authorization. Other types of diagnostic tests, such as laboratory - developed tests, are not within the scope of this repo rt. FDA describes laboratory - developed tests as tests designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. 9GAO -14-704G ; National Action Plan , Goal 3: Advance Development and Use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria; Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria, Recommendations for Incentivizing the Development of Vaccines, Diagnostics, and Therape utics to Combat Antibiotic Resistance (Washington, D.C.: September 2017); and GAO, Managing for Results: Key Considerations for Implementing Interagency Collaborative Mechanisms, GAO -12-1022 (Wash ington, D.C.: Sept. 27, 2012). Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 111 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance infections.10 We included companies that are researching or developing both traditional antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotics \u2014which we call \"nontraditional products \" in this report \u2014and we included companies that had and had not received funding from the Combating Antibiotic - Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceut ical Accelerator (CARB -X) and companies that do and do not have existing FDA -approved drugs on the market. We asked company representatives about challenges in developing new antibiotics they have identified, support they may have received from federal age ncies, how effective the support has been to them, and their views on additional incentives that would promote the development of new antibiotics. We also interviewed experts on the topic of antibiotic development and industry stakeholders, specifically Th e Pew Charitable Trusts and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. We interviewed federal officials from BARDA, CMS, DOD, FDA, and NIH to learn about their programs and actions to support the development of treatments for antibiotic -resistant infection s and requested information about funding for antibiotic R&D from BARDA, DOD, and NIH. We included relevant agency actions that began before the National Action Plan was issued in 2015 if they continued after 2015. Finally, we reviewed literature related t o antibiotic development and reports about antibiotic pull incentives written by health policy advisory groups, including the PACCARB, the Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Res istance (TATFAR), the DRIVE -AB project , and the Duke Margolis Center for Health Policy.11 We evaluated the actions taken by federal agencies to help address the challenges to developing new treatments against experts ' and advisory groups ' views on additional actions needed and against the principles related to developing strateg ies outlined in GPRA and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010.12 We did not assess challenges to developing products designed to prevent infections, such as vaccines, nor federal actions rela ted to these types of products. To examine federal agency efforts to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics and any challenges that remain, we also analyzed CMS data and related documentation on the quality measures and improvement activities related to antibiotics as part of CMS 's Merit -based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) in 2017. Specifically, we identified CMS 's 10We initially selected 12 companies to interview, but one company declined. 11DRIVE -AB is the short name for the \"Driving Re -investment in R&D and Respon sible Antibiotic Use.\" 12Pub. L. No. 103 -62, 107 Stat. 285 and Pub. L. No. 111 -352, 124 Stat. 3866. Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 112 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance antibiotics -related quality measures and improvement activities by conducting a search for the words \"antibiotic, \" \"antimicrobial, \" \"bacteria, \" \"resistance, \" and \"resistant \" on CMS 's MIPS website.13 We then reviewed CMS 's data on the number of MIPS -eligible clinicians who selected and reported on these measures and activities in 2017, the most recently available data. In 2017, there were nine MIPS quality measures related to antibiotics, as follows: (1) acute otitis externa: systemic antimicrobial therapy - avoidance of inappropriate use; (2) adult sinusitis: antibiotic prescribed for acute sinusitis (overuse); (3) adult sinusitis: appropriate choice of antibiotic: amoxicillin with or without Clavulanate presc ribed for patients with acute bacterial sinusitis (appropriate use); (4) appropriate testing for children with pharyngitis; (5) appropriate treatment for children with upper respiratory infection; (6) appropriate treatment of Methicillin -sensitive Staphylo coccus aureus bacteremia; (7) avoidance of antibiotic treatment in adults with acute bronchitis; (8) perioperative care: selection of prophylactic antibiotic - first- Cephalosporin; and (9) knee replacement: preoperative antibiot ic infusion with proximal tourniquet. In addition, there was one MIPS improvement activity related to antibiotics in 2017: implementation of antibiotic stewardship program. We reviewed the MIPS data for any obvious outliers or anomalies, and we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for reporting the number of clinicians who reported implementing these quality measures and improvement activities. In addition, we reviewed aggregated data from CDC on the total number of eligible U.S. hospitals voluntarily 13Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, \"Quality Payment Program: Explore Measures & Activities,\" accessed November 6, 2019, https://qpp.cms.gov/mips/ explore - measures . Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Page 113 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance reporting their antibiotic use data to a CDC system (the NHSN 's Antimicrobial Use Option); we then calculated the percentage of eligible hospitals reporting such data as of January 1, 2020. We assessed the reliability of the aggregated data by reviewing them for any obvious errors or missing data totals and inquiring with CDC officials about their source and any known reliability issues. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for reporting hospital participation rates in the sy stem. We also reviewed selected articles on antibiotic use and stewardship \u2014 compiled from a variety of sources, including CDC documents and experts we interviewed \u2014published in literature. In addition, we interviewed experts on antibiotic use and stewardship , including representatives from PACCARB, Emory University 's School of Medicine, the University of Minnesota 's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, The Joint Commission, the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, The Pew Charitable Trust s, and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. We evaluated federal efforts and challenges against relevant National Action Plan objectives and milestones and Executive Order No. 13676. We focused on antibiotic use in the U nited States, rather than global antibiotic use. We conducted this performance audit from February 2018 to March 2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Appendix II: Expert Meeting Participant List Page 114 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Appendix II: Expert Meeting Participant List We collaborated with the National Academy of Sciences to convene a two-day meeting of experts to inform our work on federal efforts to address antibiotic resistance; the meeting was held on September 17 and 18, 2018. The experts who participated in this meeting are listed below. Many of these experts gave us additional assistance throughout our work, including by providing additional technical expertise and answering questions, and 10 of these experts reviewed and provided comments on our draft report for technical accuracy.

These examples do not comprise the full extent of agencies ' efforts. Table 5: Additional Examples of Federal Efforts to Support Antibiotic Research and Development Agency Efforts Department of Health and Human Services Nationa l Institutes of Health (NIH) The NIH 's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) offers three distinct mechanisms to support research and development of treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections: 1. Grants for basic and applied resear ch: for example, research to better understand how bacteria develop resistance and the interactions between human microbial communities and drug -resistant bacteria 2. Product development contracts: up to 5 -year contracts to support the development of new treatments, vaccines, or diagnostic products. Contracts provide companies with funding and access to NIAID experts to decrease product development risk. 3. Pre-clinical and clinical services: research services provided free -of-charge to external researchers; for example, in -vitro assessment of therapeutic candidates ' antimicrobial activity and services to support clinical trials for new drugs. NIAID 's Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group provides extramural researchers with funding for clinical research stu dies focused on: infections caused by gram -positive and gram - negative bacteria, and diagnostics development. As of June 2019, the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group has initiated more than 40 studies at 130 clinical trial sites. Through its Cente rs of Excellence for Translational Research, NIAID funds research centers throughout the United States to research and develop new or improved medical countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases. Five of the 14 awarded centers are engaged in researchi ng treatments for antibiotic resistance. For example, one center at Harvard University Medical School is researching how best to target the bacterial cell envelope for several types of antibiotic -resistant pathogens and aims to develop at least one new vac cine and three to five antibacterial compounds that demonstrate efficacy in animal models Appendix III: Additional Examples of Federal Efforts to Support Antibiotic Research and Development Page 118 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Agency Efforts NIH officials told us NIAID convenes scientific workshops \u201410 since 2015 \u2014to facilitate the development of approaches to challenging scientific questions and promote collaboration among federal agencies and academic and industry researchers. NIAID collaborates with other countries to advance antibiotic -resistance research worldwide. For example, as a member of the Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance (TATFAR), NIAID coordinates and aligns international research activities and organizes international workshops. A result of the TATFAR collaboration is the launch of a partnership between U.S. and European entities to align clinical trial networks to incre ase access to patients for clinical trials. NIAID has also partnered with the Chinese government to advance antibiotic resistance research activities and clinical trials. The National Center for Biotechnology Information maintains the National Database o f Antibiotic -Resistant Organisms in partnership with several other federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the World Health Organization, and others. The center 's efforts include collecting, curating, and disseminating genomic data on bacterial resistance, which can help provide researchers with key data to support the development of promising antibiotic candidates. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) FDA conducts and funds regulatory science research to advance scientific knowledge related to antibiotic development.a For example, in February 2018, FDA solicited input from industry stakeholders on research ideas related to antibiotic clinical trial desig n, evaluating endpoints for use in antibiotic clinical trials, and other topics. In addition, according to FDA officials, FDA awarded a contract in fiscal year 2018 to develop animal models for use in preclinical research on infections caused by two types of resistant bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and FDA is internally developing animal models for bacteriophage research. FDA hosts workshops related to the development of treatments for antibiotic resistance. According to F DA officials, FDA coordinates regularly with drug regulators in Europe, Canada, and Japan to discuss regulatory science issues about antibiotics that all three agencies face and strive to harmonize clinical trial requirements across jurisdictions where pos sible. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and FDA With input from FDA, CDC manages and operates the Antimicrobial Resistance Isolate Bank, which scientists can use when conducting antibiotic research and development. The bank contains isolat es\u2014pure samples of a bacteria \u2014that can be used, for example, to study bacterial mechanisms of resistance or to test a drug 's effectiveness. As of January 2018, the isolate bank shipped more than 2,000 isolate panels to researchers, including drug developer s, diagnostic test developers, and other scientists. The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research also maintains a collection of antimicrobial resistance isolates collected from military hospitals. Department of Defense (DOD) Defense Threat Reduction Agen cy According to DOD officials, the agency has awarded 21 projects to study treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections, totaling approximately $178 million since 2012. In addition, the agency has funded 12 projects totaling nearly $50 million for other antibiotic resistance -related matters. Grantees include universities, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute, and a national laboratory. U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Commandb According to DOD officials, the command has funded 50 projects to study treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections since 2012, totaling $66.2 million. Funded projects study a range of product types, including traditional antibiotics, bacteriophages, peptides, and others. The command also funds 13 projects that study vaccines and other preventive products related to antibiotic -resistant infections. Appendix III: Additional Examples of Federal Efforts to Support Antibiotic Research and Development Page 119 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Agency Efforts Walter Reed Army Institute of Research According to DOD officials, the institute supports 16 projects \u2014five intramural and 11 extramural \u2014totaling nearly $10 million since 20 16. All of the projects are studying traditional antibiotic drug candidates, and all but one target gram negative bacteria. Two of the projects are conducted jointly, through an interagency agreement, with NIH institutes. In addition, the institute runs se veral other internal projects, including one to develop monoclonal antibodies, one to develop animal models to test potential antibiotic treatments, and one to conduct basic research on gram negative bacteria. The institute also conducts a bacteriophage pr oject in partnership with a private company, which, as of January 2019, had completed phase 1 clinical trials. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Through its Pathogen Predators program, the agency studied living bacteria that prey upon pathogenic g ram-negative bacteria. According to DOD officials, the agency awarded a total of $17.1 million in fiscal years 2014 through 2019 to four grantees. Navy Medical Research Center According to DOD officials, Navy researchers are investigating several types of nontraditional products, such as bacteriophages and probiotics, in collaboration with DOD partners, academic researchers, and industry partners. The bacteriophage research, which aims to develop treatments for A. baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus bacter ial infections, is conducted jointly with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and a private company. Department of Energy National Laboratories According to Department of Energy officials, scientists conduct intramural research to understand the m echanisms bacteria develop to become resistant to antibiotics and how to overcome those mechanisms. For example, scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have studied the mechanism by which microbes make compounds to become resistant to antibio tics and how enzymes in bacteria can be manipulated to allow antibiotics to pass through the bacterial cell wall. Scientists at the Sandia National Laboratory and a university have used computer models to understand how efflux pumps \u2014which can remove antibi otics from the bacterial cell \u2014work, and how to overcome them.

We previously reported that FDA lacked measurable goals to assess its progress in advancing regulatory science and recommended FDA develop and docu ment measurable goals, including targets and time frames, and systematically track funding across its regulatory science priority areas. As of January 2020, FDA has not yet implemented these recommendations. See GAO , Medical Product Oversight: FDA Needs Mo re Strategic Planning to Guide Its Scientific Initiatives , GAO -16-432 (Washington, D.C.: May 16, 2016). bAccording to DOD officials, The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command was redesign ated as the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command in June 2019. Appendix IV: Additional Information on Federal Efforts to Promote Appropriate Antibiotic Use Page 120 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Appendix IV: Additional Information on Federal Efforts to Promote Appropriate Antibiotic Use This appendix contains more detailed information on federal efforts to promote the ap propriate use of antibiotics in health care through antibiotic stewardship programs and activities, organized by agency. These examples do not comprise the full extent of agencies ' efforts. Table 6: Examples of Federal Efforts to Promote the Appropriate Us e of Antibiotics Agency Efforts Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CDC published a series of guidance documents to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics in health care\u2014called the Core Elem ents of Antibiotic Stewardship (Core Elements) \u2014from 2014 to 2018.a CDC tailored the Core Elements to hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient settings, small and critical access hospitals,b and low - and middle -income countries with limited resources. Common el ements in these guidance documents include (1) leadership commitment, (2) implementation of policies and interventions to improve antibiotic use, (3) tracking and reporting antibiotic use, and (4) education to providers on appropriate antibiotic use. While health care facilities and clinicians are not required to implement the Core Elements, experts we interviewed told us these guidance documents provided an important foundation for establishing antibiotic stewardship programs and conducting related activit ies. Examples of antibiotic stewardship policies and interventions that health care providers can implement, depending on the setting, to support optimal antibiotic prescribing are: \u00b7 writing formal statements in support of improving antibiotic use; \u00b7 identify ing individual leaders to be accountable for antibiotic stewardship activities; \u00b7 documenting antibiotic dose, duration, and indication in patients ' medical records; \u00b7 developing and implementing facility -specific treatment recommendations, based on national guidelines and local susceptibilities; \u00b7 requiring prior authorization of certain antibiotics by an expert in antibiotic use, or working with a consultant pharmacist, before therapy is initiated; \u00b7 using delayed prescribing practices or watchful waiting, when a ppropriate; \u00b7 giving antibiotic \"time-outs\" 48 hours after initial treatment to assess the continuing need and choice of antibiotics after obtaining diagnostic information; \u00b7 automatically switching from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy in appropriate si tuations, which improves patient safety by reducing intravenous access; and \u00b7 providing prospective audit and feedback, conducted by an expert in antibiotic use. Appendix I V: Additional Information on Federal Efforts to Promote Appropriate Antibiotic Use Page 121 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Agency Efforts CDC has expanded its collection of antibiotic use data across health care settings. Since we r eported on antibiotic use data gaps in 2011,c CDC has obtained additional data regarding both inpatient and outpatient settings through its own surveillance systems as well as from other sources. In particular, CDC has focused its efforts to expand antibio tic use data collection from hospitals, where an estimated one in two patients receives an antibiotic for at least 1 day during an average hospital stay. CDC launched its Antimicrobial Use (AU) Option in 2011 as a voluntary, electronic reporting tool added on to the pre - existing National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). The AU Option allows the nation 's 6,849 hospitals (as of January 1, 2020), including 13 Department of Defense (DOD ) hospitals located on military bases outside the United States, that are a lready reporting to the NHSN to submit their antibiotic use data in a standardized format. CDC then aggregates such data to calculate national benchmarks and allows hospitals to compare their actual ( \"observed \") antibiotic use against those benchmarks ( \"predicted \" use). In addition, CDC has periodically conducted prevalence surveys through its Emerging Infections Program to gather data on health care -associated infections and antibiotic use in about 200 hospitals and 161 nursing homes in 10 states. With reg ard to outpatient settings, CDC has acquired, through a proprietary source, 8 years of pharmacy data on antibiotic prescriptions since 2011, which the agency is using to better characterize patterns in outpatient prescribing and to develop targeted interve ntions for high - prescribing areas. Through partnerships with other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and others, CDC has supported these efforts and published several analyses of antibiotic use \u2014including state -level prescribing rates, t he conditions for which antibiotics were prescribed, and the appropriateness of their use. For example, CDC has reported on geographic variations in antibiotic prescriptions in outpatient settings, by state, across the United States. To gauge progress to ward one of the \"significant outcomes \" included in the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistance (National Action Plan) \u2014for all U.S. acute care hospitals to establish antibiotic stewardship programs by 2020 \u2014CDC tracks whether such hospitals have implemented antibiotic stewardship programs meeting each of the Core Elements. According to CDC, 85 percent of the nation 's acute care hospitals reported having antibiotic stewardship programs in 2018 that met all seven of the Core Elements, compared with 41 percent in 2014. In 2018, CDC launched a free, online training course for various types of clinicians \u2014including physicians, dentists, pharmacists, physician assistants, and nurses \u2014to inform them about appropriate antibiotic prescribing, how to ov ercome barriers, and strategies for communicating with patients. Clinicians can receive credit for partial completion (50 percent or more), or full completion, of this training as improvement activities under the Merit -based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) in 2019. In addition, clinicians who prescribe antibiotics, as well as other types of health care professionals, are eligible to receive up to 8 hours of continuing education credit for completing this training. As of late July 2019, nearly 16,000 individ uals had registered for this training, according to CDC officials. Agency officials also told us that CDC has collaborated with medical schools, professional health care organizations, and others to develop and promote antibiotic stewardship training. For example, CDC collaborated with Wake Forest University 's School of Medicine and the Association of American Medical Colleges to develop a model curriculum on antibiotic stewardship for medical students.d CDC supports research to identify, develop, and imp lement practices to stop the spread of resistance and to promote appropriate use of antibiotics in health care. CDC also supports research to fill gaps in knowledge related to aspects of antibiotic use and resistance that have public health impact. Accordi ng to agency officials, CDC has provided approximately $110 million since 2016 to support this research through cooperative agreements and contracts. Appendix IV: Additional Information on Federal Efforts t o Promote Appropriate Antibiotic Use Page 122 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Agency Efforts In 2017, CDC revised a national campaign to promote public awareness about appropriate antibiotic use. The campaign, called \"Be Antibiotics Aware: Smart Use, Best Care, \" is aimed at both health care providers and the general public. This campaign refines the message from CDC 's earlier campaign ( \"Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work \") and has expanded to new target audiences, such as adult patients, physicians who work in hospitals, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. To support the campaign, CDC has produced a number of materials and resources, including posters, brochures, and fact sheets for use and display in physicians ' offices, pharmacies, and other health care and public settings. In addition, CDC has embedded stewardship messaging into other activities, including its \"Get Ahead of Sepsis \" campaign, which emphasizes the importance of early re cognition and timely treatment of sepsis, reassessment of antibiotic therapy, and preventing infections that can lead to sepsis. CDC views these two campaigns as promoting the integration of antibiotic stewardship into sepsis management. CDC works with c ountries around the world to combat antibiotic resistance. For example, in conjunction with HHS 's Office of Global Affairs, CDC launched the Antimicrobial Resistance Challenge at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2018 to catalyze global acti on against antibiotic resistance. A year later, CDC announced this challenge had resulted in nearly 350 commitments from government health officials, pharmaceutical and health insurance companies, and others from 33 countries to make formal commitments tha t further the progress against antimicrobial resistance, such as by improving appropriate antibiotic use. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) In September 2019, CMS finalized new health and safety requirements for the nation 's hospitals and critical access hospitals to implement antibiotic stewardship programs, as a condition of their participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, by March 30, 2020.e Under these requirements, hospitals and critical access hospitals are required, among oth er things, to implement these programs facility -wide (which includes emergency departments) and to adhere to nationally recognized guidelines for prescribing antibiotics. These requirements also apply to inpatient rehabilitation facilities (which are consi dered post - acute care facilities) and long -term acute care hospitals. In October 2016, CMS published a rule that established similar requirements for nursing homes as well as skilled nursing facilities \u2014collectively known as long -term care facilities \u2014to imp lement antibiotic stewardship programs.f Under this rule, long -term care facilities were required, in part, to have an antibiotic stewardship program in place by December 4, 2017. To complement the new requirements, CMS published new interpretive guidance on how to implement and survey for antibiotic stewardship in long -term care facilities, citing CDC 's Core Elements.g CMS also updated its training webinars for surveyors \u2014who monitor compliance with CMS 's health and safety standards using on -site surveys \u2014to include information on antibiotic use in nursing homes. CMS has developed incentives for eligible clinicians in any type of health care facility to improve antibiotic use and stewardship, as part of the agency 's broader efforts to improve care for Medic are patients.h Through MIPS, launched in 2017, CMS offers hundreds of quality measures and nearly 100 \"improvement activities \" on a wide range of topics, including the appropriate use of antibiotics, that eligible clinicians can choose from and report thei r performance on to the agency. CMS then adjusts payments higher for clinicians who report data and achieve a performance -based, final score above a certain threshold \u2014and penalizes clinicians who do not achieve that threshold with lower payments. In 2014 , CMS added antibiotic stewardship to its efforts to provide better care at lower cost for Medicare beneficiaries in outpatient settings. Specifically, CMS tasked its networks of health quality experts, clinicians, and others (called Quality Improvement Ne tworks) with helping 7,629 outpatient facilities \u2014 including physician practices, emergency departments, and urgent care centers \u2014implement CDC 's Core Elements. Under this 5 -year project, CMS is providing outreach, training, and technical assistance to provid ers and patients to encourage the expansion of antibiotic stewardship. CMS has provided training, technical assistance, and other learning opportunities to more than 4,000 hospitals, 2,400 nursing homes, and 7,600 outpatient settings on best practices fo r antibiotic stewardship and guidance on C. difficile prevention. In addition, CMS and CDC have developed and launched free, online training to help nursing homes implement antibiotic stewardship and prevent and manage C. difficile infections. Appendix IV: Additional Information on Federal Efforts to Promote Appropriate Antibiotic Use Page 123 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Agency Efforts Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) AHRQ has increased its support since 2015 for research to develop improved methods to combat antibiotic resistance and promote antibiotic stewardship, including through grants for research that will total more than $5 7 million, according to AHRQ officials. This research includes studies on the role of diagnostic tools, such as blood cultures, in improving antibiotic use and reducing antibiotic resistance. AHRQ has also published numerous research studies on antibiotic or antimicrobial stewardship that the agency funded or authored. Through a 5 -year nationwide project, the AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Antibiotic Use has provided technical assistance and CDC 's guidance to hospitals, long -term care facilities, and p hysicians ' offices to promote implementation of antibiotic stewardship activities and to help clinicians select optimal antibiotic treatment regimens. In December 2018, AHRQ completed implementation of this guidance in more than 400 hospitals, which includ ed six DOD facilities and 79 critical access hospitals, according to AHRQ officials. AHRQ officials also told us that preliminary data suggest that antibiotic use was reduced in this cohort, and an educational toolkit based on this cohort 's activities will be released in fiscal year 2020. The project has also recruited more than 450 nursing homes for a 1 -year cohort planned to be completed in November 2019, and AHRQ planned to expand to an additional 250 to 500 ambulatory care settings in December 2019. AHR Q also plans to compile tools, resources, and lessons learned to promote implementation of antibiotic stewardship in these health care settings. AHRQ has increased dissemination of its Nursing Home Antimicrobial Stewardship Guide , which provides toolkits to help nursing home staff create an antibiotic stewardship program, determine whether to treat with antibiotics, choose the right antibiotic, and engage residents and families.i Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) In November 2017, HRSA 's Federal Office of Rural Health Policy added a requirement for critical access hospitals participating in the Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project to implement antibiotic stewardship programs by the end of fiscal year 2021 in order to be eligib le for the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility grant program.j According to HRSA officials, this requirement will apply to 99 percent of the nation 's more than 1,300 critical access hospitals. Office of Global Affairs To promote the appropriate use of a ntibiotics internationally, the Office of Global Affairs has collaborated with other countries and co -chairs the Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance (TATFAR) program. With respect to antibiotic stewardship, TATFAR working groups have (1) de veloped a common structure and indicators for antibiotic stewardship programs; (2) reviewed antibiotic use reduction goals; (3) published a resource for other countries seeking to improve their antibiotic use; (4) aligned campaigns promoting appropriate an tibiotic use by collaborating with partners such as the World Health Organization in supporting World Antibiotic Awareness Week; (5) compiled resources for how to assess appropriate outpatient use in TATFAR countries; and (6) published studies on health care-associated infections and antibiotic use across health care facilities. Department of Defense (DOD) Defense Health Agency DOD published a policy, effective October 2017, requiring the establishment of antibiotic stewardship programs within its milita ry medical treatment facilities and issued guidance for implementation in October 2018. These facilities include hospitals located at military installations across the United States and abroad, plus ambulatory care clinics and dental clinics, and provide h ealth care for active -duty service members, their dependents, and other eligible beneficiaries. The policy calls for these facilities to establish antibiotic stewardship programs including the following components, at a minimum: (1) leadership commitment b y each facility; (2) accountability; (3) pharmacy expertise, including antibiotic prescribing and use evaluation; (4) the creation of antibiograms \u2014an aggregate profile of antibiotic susceptibility for a given facility, locality, region, or nation; (5) the identification and implementation of at least one action for change that would demonstrate commitment to the program; (6) training for clinicians regarding antibiotic resistance and prescribing practices; and (7) facility -specific treatment recommendations in accordance with local antibiograms. DOD officials told us that all of these facilities (both inpatient and outpatient) were in different stages of implementing the antibiotic stewardship policy, as of August 2019. In addition, as part of these requirem ents, DOD hospitals are to report their antibiotic use data to CDC through the NHSN AU Option. DOD officials told us that 44 of DOD 's 48 hospitals have reported their antibiotic use data to CDC, as of September 30, 2019. Appendix IV: Additional Information on Federal Efforts to Promote Appropriate Antibiotic Use Page 124 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Agency Efforts According to department officials, DOD offers antibiotic stewardship training to its health care facilities through webinars, workshops, and briefings. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration VA's efforts to implement antibiotic stewardship programs in its healt h care facilities, which provide both inpatient and outpatient services to veterans, pre -date the National Action Plan and CDC 's Core Elements. In January 2019, VA updated its 2014 policy directive for the implementation and maintenance of antibiotic stewa rdship programs that, in part, requires each of its health care facilities to (1) develop a written policy, (2) perform an annual evaluation of stewardship activities, (3) ensure that adequate staff and resources are in place, and (4) identify medical and pharmacy personnel as stewardship \"champions. \" The updated policy directive also requires all VA facilities with 30 or more acute care beds to report their antibiotic use data to CDC 's NHSN AU Option by January 30, 2020. According to department officials, VA has successfully implemented antibiotic stewardship programs in all of its health care facilities, and 113, or more than 97 percent of, 116 eligible VA hospitals with 30 or more acute care beds were reporting their antibiotic use data to CDC, as of Janu ary 1, 2020. VA offers antibiotic stewardship training to its health care facilities through webinars on an ongoing basis.

The Department appreciates the opportunity to review this report prior to publication. Sincerely, Sarah Arbes Acting Assistant S ecretary for Legislation Page 2 GENERAL COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES ON THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE'S DRAFT REPORT ENTITLED -- ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE: ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ACTIONS NEEDED TO BETTER DETERMINE MAGNITUDE AND R EDUCE IMPACT (GAO -20-341) The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) appreciates the opportunity from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review and comment on this draft report. National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant B acteria (CARB) (NAP) Not Fully Addressed Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services Page 136 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Antibiotic resistance is a large scale and complex topic for which the United States Government has developed the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria (CARB)(NAP) to address. HHS notes th at the depth and breadth of current activities of agencies and departments under this comprehensive national plan are not fully reflected in this report, and actions to address these recommendations and other priorities would be necessary to fully achieve CARB goals. There are two fundamental and important topics included in the USG CARB NAP that are not included in the GAO report that HHS finds important to highlight. Infection prevention and control is one of the foundational activities described under Goal 1 of the CARB NAP, and it is fundamentally needed to address the emergence of the spread of resistant pathogens in healthcare, food and the community. GAO's report provides limited information to highlight the importance of this topic, and HHS notes the importance of including the need for proper infection prevention and control in addressing the spread of antibiotic resistant infections. As highlighted in CDC's recent 2019 Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report, prevention efforts such as these have reduc ed deaths from antibiotic -resistant infections by 18 percent overall and by nearly 30 percent in hospitals since 2012. HHS views the discussion of infection prevention and control as on par with the other elements mentioned in the report (such as surveilla nce, stewardship, diagnostics, and drug development), and as essential to give a complete picture of the challenges, needs, and progress to date in this critically important area. In addition, while HHS understands that the GAO's scope for this report was limited to antibacterial resistance, we note that the report excludes resistant fungal infections from its discussion and analysis. The pathogens covered under the US CARB National Action Plan are those identified by CDC as threats in its AR Threats Report . This includes bacterial and fungal pathogens, and importantly CDC's most recent Threats Report identified Candida auris as an urgent threat - the highest threat category - in the United States. The needs and actions to be taken to address fungal resistan ce are largely the same as those needed to address bacterial resistance and acknowledging the threat of fungal resistance is vital to fully reflecting the scope of the public health challenges that we face domestically and globally. . When individuals beco me sick with bacterial or fungal infections, they want to be confident that an effective treatment exists or better yet to have effective prevention measures that ensure they do not get an infection in the first place. The development of the CARB National Strategy and the CARB NAP brought together departments and agencies spanning the U.S. government to comprehensively articulate national goals, activities, and milestones and report on their progress regularly and transparently. This collaboration has built and continues to build programs and national infrastructure that now lead Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services Page 137 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Page 3 the world on many fronts and has transformed how the country responds to the threats of antibiotic resistance in every key area. While these activities are far from complete and in fact many efforts need to be scaled up considerably, CARB work has placed the U.S. government in a position where we have the potential -- through ongoing activities and resources -- to get ahead of one of the world's most challenging public health threats. The forthcoming update to the CARB NAP will build on the success of the first Action Plan and push the U.S. to make further progress domestically and globally. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Devices HHS recognizes that this report accurately di scusses many of the historical challenges associated with updating antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) devices to reflect the most current susceptibility test interpretive criteria (STIC), also known as \"breakpoints,\" for systemic antibacterial or a ntifungal drugs. HHS commends the efforts of Congress to address these challenges through Section 511A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360a -2), as added by section 3044 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) (Pub. L . 114 -255), signed into law on December 13, 2016. This provision clarifies FDA's authority to identify and efficiently update susceptibility test interpretive criteria, including through the recognition by FDA of standards established by standard developme nt organizations (SDOs). It also clarifies that manufacturers of AST devices may rely upon FDA -recognized breakpoints to support premarket authorization of their devices, provided they meet certain conditions, which provides for a more streamlined process for incorporating up -to-date information into such devices. Since passage of the Cures Act, FDA has worked to implement section 511A of FD&C Act, and engaged in other efforts to promote the availability and updating of AST devices. In accordance with secti on 511A, FDA established in December 2017, within 1 year of enactment of the Cures Act, an Interpretative Criteria Website1 (STIC website) that contains a list of FDA -recognized susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards (also referred to as break points or STIC), as well as other susceptibility test interpretive criteria identified by FDA. This website identifies when FDA does or does not recognize breakpoints established by an SDO and lists breakpoints identified by FDA outside the SDO process. To ensure that the most up -to-date STIC information is available, holders of approved drug applications were required to remove STIC and related information from the labeling of approved systemic 1 See https: ///www.fda.gov/STIC. Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services Page 138 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance antibacterial and antifungal drugs and replace it with a refer ence to the STIC website.2 AST device developers may rely upon the breakpoints listed on the FDA STIC website to support premarket submission of their devices. Further, in accordance with section 511A(c)(1) of the FD&C Act, at least every 6 months, FDA pub lishes on the website a notice recognizing new or updated susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards, or parts of standards; withdrawing recognition of susceptibility test interpretive criteria standards, or parts of standards; and making any othe r necessary updates to the lists published on the website. This makes up -to-date information about antimicrobial Page 4 susceptibility easily accessible by device manufacturers that are considering any changes to their devices and labeling. In further effo rts to promote the availability of up -to-date AST devices, FDA published draft guidance in early 2016 and, ultimately, finalized that guidance in February 2019, on use of a coordinated development process for new antimicrobial drugs and new or existing AST devices. Implementation of the final guidance, Coordinated Development of Antimicrobial Drugs and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Devices,3 has drastically improved the time for AST device availability following new drug approval, with devices becoming available within weeks of drug approval in most cases. Additionally, FDA has worked closely with AST device manufacturers and other stakeholders to understand the challenges associated with incorporating breakpoint updates applicable to their devices in a timely fashion. Through these discussions, FDA identified the opportunity to encourage the development of breakpoint change protocols for new and existing AST devices. AST device manufacturers can submit a breakpoint change protocol in their premarket subm issions, outlining how they will validate breakpoint updates incorporated into their device when such updates are recognized by FDA and posted to the STIC website. Following change protocol submission and concurrence by FDA, AST device manufacturers may im plement breakpoint changes to their devices and labeling to reflect the most current information without the need for a 510(k) submission, if certain conditions are met. This may be done when the inclusion and 2 https://www.fda.gov/media/109839/download. See section 511A(d) of the from the Department of Health and Human Services Page 139 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance performance criteria outlined in the breakpoin t change protocol are confirmed by the manufacturer. FDA reviewed and concurred with the first breakpoint change protocol in 2018, and FDA has continued to encourage manufacturers to use this approach. FDA expects that this approach will expedite updating of devices and assist in monitoring the status of these devices following FDA recognition of new or updated breakpoints. Further, FDA intends to continue regular engagement with AST device manufacturers and related stakeholders to continue to improve these processes. While stakeholders can sign up for email updates when the STIC website is updated, FDA also intends to individually reach out to AST device manufacturers when breakpoint updates are made that could potentially affect their cleared devices. FDA hopes this additional outreach and coordination will lead to more rapid updates of AST devices. While there is still much to be done, HHS is proud of how far we have come as a country and continues to look forward to how we can further address the ongoing threats of antibiotic resistance. Page 5 Recommendation 1 The Director of CDC should take steps to determine participation rates and distribution needed in the AR Option of the National Healthcare Safety Network for conducting regional and national assessm ents of antibiotic resistance of public health importance. HHS Response HHS concurs with GAO's recommendation. CDC recognizes the concerns of GAO and the Joint Public Health Informatics Task Force regarding the breadth of data currently available in the Na tional Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Antimicrobial Use and Resistance (AUR) Module's AR Option. NHSN's AUR module helps healthcare facilities to track antimicrobial resistance patterns for more than 20 different organisms. As there is currently no natio nal requirement for facilities to report in the AR option, CDC is actively working with public health partners, including other federal agencies, health departments, health information technology vendors, and healthcare systems to promote the voluntary use of the AR option. Appendix V: Com ments from the Department of Health and Human Services Page 140 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance While NHSN has experienced vast expansion over time, appropriated resources have stayed largely stable with only modest increases. Since its creation in 2005, NHSN has grown from 300 hospitals reporting to more than 22,000 in 2020, an increase of approximately 7,300 percent. Over this same time, appropriated resources for NHSN have only increased by 40 percent. CDC also provides technical support to states that may be considering a state or local mandate to require AR/ AU reporting. To da te, two states have implemented a local mandate that requires AR/AU reporting, and one state is considering implementation of a mandate. With the current level of reporting, CDC is developing pilot programs to assess AR option data and other data sources f or determining the landscape for regional and national extended - spectrum beta -lactamases (ESBLs). The goal of this analysis will be to improve our understanding of community transmission and amplification in healthcare settings in order to have greater im pact on preventing ESBLs. This work is still in the early development phase; however, CDC believes it will be a valuable initial analysis of the use of AR option data beyond the hospital facility -level. Recommendation 2 The Director of CDC should ensure th at CDC's evaluation of its surveillance system for antibiotic -resistant gonorrhea include measures of its representativeness, such as comparison of the trends in the sample population with those in the overall U.S. population, using specially designed stud ies if needed. Page 6 HHS Response HHS concurs with this recommendation. CDC concurs with the recommendation to assess the representativeness of GISP. It should be noted, however, that GISP, as a sentinel surveillance system, was not designed to be represe ntative of the U.S. population with gonorrhea (GC) but, rather to identify new trends in resistance before they become generalized across the entire population with GC. Historically, CDC has successfully used this approach to anticipate emerging trends and inform changes in the CDC's STD Treatment Guidelines to ensure patients are treated with the most effective antibiotic available. Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services Page 141 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Through eGISP and SURRG, CDC has taken steps to examine the representativeness of GISP as mentioned in the report. By testing women with gonorrhea, extragenital sites of men with gonorrhea, and men and women from non - sexually transmitted disease clinic sites, results can be compared with those from GISP. It is currently necessary to obtain cultured isolates for these laboratory analyses. This is more difficult in women, and from extra -genital sites in men in whom infections are usually asymptomatic, than it is in symptomatic men included in GISP. To overcome this, CDC is currently working to develop laboratory methods to examine genetic markers for GC resistance in swab specimens and urine without the need for cultured isolates. Although this would not replace culture -based surveillance, this would allow CDC to obtain a larger number of samples from non - GISP populations and to com pare the genetic markers in those populations with ones from GISP patients. Since culture is now rarely used outside of CDC sponsored projects, this approach could provide samples that are more representative of the overall U.S. population infected with GC . However, additional resources are needed for developing and validating these methods and applying them to different populations. In FY 2016, CDC requested $264 million annually to support full implementation of all of its activities under the CARB Action Plan including the expansion of GC testing nationwide. Ultimately, Congress supported funding for the overall CARB budget initiative of $160 million in FY 16 and has provided small increases since then. With available resources, CDC has supported an expan sion of GC testing under the ARLN compared to pre -CARB levels, however, additional work to further refine and improve on the collection of AR data for GC cannot be completed with existing resources. Recommendation 3 The Director of CDC should provide infor mation on uncertainties for antibiotic resistance estimates in its consolidated Threats Reports, including standard errors or confidence intervals, as appropriate. Page 7 HHS Response HHS generally concurs with GAO's recommendation. CDC believes that infor mation on uncertainties including standard errors or confidence intervals should be accessible within the public domain and is committed to doing so. Given that many of the new estimates provided in the 2019 AR Threats Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services Page 142 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Report were based on new methodologie s that aggregated data across three electronic health databases, CDC felt that it was critical to have the analysis peer reviewed by external experts and published in the scientific literature for wider reference and dissemination. CDC feels that publishin g these data in a way that it is most helpful for the scientific community is critical, and multiple publications are pending. Once published in the scientific literature, CDC will link these publications back to online resources of the 2019 AR Threats Rep ort for awareness and understanding of the connection between the report and the contributing peer reviewed material. Recommendation 4 The Director of CDC should develop a plan for timely, consolidated reports of antibiotic resistance in priority pathogens at regular intervals. HHS Response HHS concurs with GAO's recommendation. The GAO report appears to imply that the AR Threats Report is the only report released by the agency that provides information on priority pathogens at regular intervals. To clarify , CDC already provides timely, consolidated updates of antibiotic resistance in priority pathogens at regular intervals through the following: \u00b7 NARMS Now (Updated Daily): CDC updates the latest approved resistance data for enteric pathogens nightly. \u00b7 AR & Pa tient Safety Portal (Updated Bi -annually): CDC updates resistance data for healthcare infections twice annually in the spring and fall. \u00b7 Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABC) Bact Facts interactive (Updated annually): CDC includes resistance data for Str eptococcus in annual updates. \u00b7 STD Surveillance Report & GISP (Updated Annually): Antibiotic resistant data for gonorrhea is released annually in the STD Surveillance Report and GISP Profiles with site - specific data. \u00b7 Reported Tuberculosis in the United Sta tes (annual surveillance report): Includes data on drug -resistant TB. For all of these pathogens, other publications highlighting antibiotic resistance (MMWR, peer review publications) are issued ad hoc depending on new findings. Finally, CDC has plans to update its enterprise -wide AR Threats Report every three years. Appendix V: Comments from the Depar tment of Health and Human Services Page 143 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Recommendation 5 The Secretary of HHS should identify leadership and clarify roles and responsibilities among HHS agencies to assess the clinical outcomes of diagnostic testing for identifying antibiotic - resistant bacteria. Page 8 HHS Response HHS concurs with GAO's recommendation. As part of the development of the next National Action Plan for CARB (2020 -2025), CARB Task Force leadership will work with relevant HHS agencies to clarify roles and responsibilities for supporting research on clinical outcomes related to diagnostic tests. These discussions will include identifying leadership for this work, if such a strategy would be appropriate. The next Plan will maintain the goal of advancing th e development and use of diagnostic tests (Goal 3). Recommendation 6 The Commissioner of FDA should direct the Center for Devices and Radiological Health to conduct additional monitoring and evaluation of the status of commercial tests that rely on breakpo ints, on a regular basis, to determine whether test manufacturers are updating breakpoints, seeking additional resources as needed. HHS Response HHS concurs with GAO's recommendation. FDA concurs with GAO's recommendation to conduct additional monitoring a nd evaluation of AST devices to determine whether device manufacturers are making updates, where appropriate, when FDA identifies or recognizes new breakpoints. FDA agrees with GAO that it is important that AST devices reflect the most current information as one aspect in improving patient care and antimicrobial stewardship, and combating antimicrobial resistance. Although FDA agrees that in the past there have been significant challenges associated with updating AST devices to reflect the most current brea kpoints, FDA believes it is important to understand that many of the concerns raised in the report have been resolved by recent FDA actions and the passage and implementation of section 511A of the FD&C Act. As described above, FDA has taken major steps in the implementation of the new statutory provision, and Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services Page 144 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance has engaged in other activities to promote the availability and updating of AST devices. Recommendation 7 The Secretary of HHS should develop a strategic framework to further incentivize the developme nt of new treatments for antibiotic -resistant infections, including through the use of postmark financial incentives, and, if appropriate, make recommendations to Congress for necessary authority. HHS Response HHS non -concurs with GAO's recommendation beca use it is still unclear whether post-market financial incentives should necessarily be part of HHS's forthcoming strategic framework to further incentivize the development of new treatments to combat antibiotic resistance. Page 9 HHS agrees with GAO that a dditional incentives are needed to address the limited pipeline for novel and innovative treatments to combat antibiotic resistance. As noted by GAO, HHS convened a workgroup in March 2019 to analyze existing incentives, proposals for new incentives as rai sed by non -governmental, industry, and international groups, and other options to address this need. This analysis has included consideration of the current and future burden of AMR on both public health and the economy, the dynamics of drug development th at specifically impact relevant antibacterial and related products, and the statutory, regulatory, and budgetary feasibility of any incentive strategy. Based on this work, the group is developing a strategic framework that includes specific proposals to address a variety of scientific and market challenges facing antibiotic product developers. ASPE and HHS are still conducting analyses to understand whether post-market financial incentives should be included in this framework as a solution among a range of potential solutions. Recommendation 8 The Secretary of HHS should direct the CARB Task Force to include in its annual updates to the President plans for addressing any barriers preventing full implementation of the National Action Plan and, as appropriate, make recommendations for new or modified actions. Specifically, the CARB Task Force should identify plans to address barriers, such as those related to expanding Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services Page 145 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance (1) a CDC program designed to strengthen the U.S. response to resistant gonorrhea, (2) antibi otic stewardship programs across health care settings, and (3) antibiotic use data collection across health care settings, to the extent feasible HHS Response HHS concurs with GAO's recommendation. Beginning in 2020 with the Annual Report for Year 5 of the first CARB National Action Plan, and continuing thereafter in the annual reports for the next iteration of the plan, HHS will include discussion of any barriers preventing full implementation of these activities, including any barriers that GAO has includ ed in the recommendation where appropriate. Beginning in 2020 with the Annual Report for Year 5 of the first CARB National Action Plan, and continuing thereafter in the annual reports for the next iteration of the plan, the CARB Task Force will include dis cussion of any barriers preventing full implementation of these activities, including the barriers that GAO has included in this recommendation where appropriate Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments Page 146 GAO -20-341 Federal Efforts to Address Anti biotic Resistance Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments GAO contacts Timothy M.
