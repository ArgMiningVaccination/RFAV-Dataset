LATUDA is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies. These studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in patients over age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressant use in patients aged 65 and older [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)]. In patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy, monitor closely for worsening, and for emergence of suicidal th oughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observatio n and communication with the prescriber [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)]. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Schizophrenia LATUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. The efficacy of LATUDA in schizophrenia was esta blished in five 6-week controlled studies of adult patients with schizophrenia [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1)]. The effectiveness of LATUDA for l onger-term use, that is, for more than 6 weeks, has not been established in controlled studi es. Therefore, the physician w ho elects to use LATUDA for extended periods should pe riodically re-evaluate the long-t erm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2)]. 1.2 Depressive Episodes Associ ated with Bipolar I Disorder Monotherapy: LATUDA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disord er (bipolar depression). The efficacy of LATUDA was established in a 6-week monotherapy study in adult pati ents with bipolar depression [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )]. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate: LATUDA is indicated as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate for the treatme nt of patients with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipol ar depression). The e fficacy of LATUDA was established in a 6-week study in adult patients with bipolar depression who were treated adjunctively with lithium or valproate [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2)]. The effectiveness of LATUDA for l onger-term use, that is, for more than 6 weeks, has not been established in controlled studi es. Therefore, the physician w ho elects to use LATUDA for extended periods should pe riodically re-evaluate the long-t erm usefulness of the drug for the individual patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2)]. The efficacy of LATUDA in the treatment of mani a associated with bipolar disorder has not been established. 3 Reference ID: 3333342 2 DOSAGE AND AD MINISTRATION 2.1 Schizophrenia The recommended starting dose of LATUDA is 40 mg once daily. Initial dose titration is not required. LATUDA has been shown to be effectiv e in a dose range of 40 mg per day to 160 mg per day [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1)] . The maximum recommended dose is 160 mg per day. 2.2 Depressive Episodes Associ ated with Bipolar I Disorder The recommended starting dose of LATUDA is 20 mg given once daily as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. In itial dose titration is not required. LATUDA has been shown to be effective in a dose range of 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2)]. The maximum recommended dose, as monotherapy or as adjunc tive therapy with lithiu m or valproate, is 120 mg per day. In the monotherapy study, the higher dose range (80 mg to 120 mg per day) did not provide additional efficacy on average, compared to the lower dose range (20 to 60 mg per day) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2). 2.3 Administration Instructions LATUDA should be taken with food (at least 350 calories). Administration with food substantially increases the absorption of LATUDA. Administration with food increases the AUC approximately 2-fold and increases the Cmax a pproximately 3-fold. In the clinical studies, LATUDA was administered with food [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 2.4 Dose Modifications in Special Populations Renal Impairment Dose adjustment is recommended in moderate (creatinine clearance: 30 to <50 mL/min) and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) patients. The recommended starting dose is 20 mg per day. The dose in these patients should not exceed 80 mg per day [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)]. Hepatic Impairment Dose adjustment is recommended in moderate (C hild-Pugh Score = 7 to 9) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score = 10 to 15) pa tients. The recommended starting dose is 20 mg per day. The dose in moderate hepatic impairme nt patients should not exceed 80 mg per day and the dose in severe hepatic impairment patients should not exceed 40 mg/day [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)]. 2.5 Dose Modifications Due to Drug Interactions Concomitant Use with CYP3A4 Inhibitors LATUDA should not be used concomitantly with a CYP3A4 diltiazem, atazanavir, added to the ther apy, the LATUDA dose should be reduced to half of the original dose level. Sim ilarly, if a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor is being 4 Reference ID: 3333342 prescribed and LATUDA is added to the therapy, the recommended starting dose of LATUDA is 20 mg per day, and the maximum recommended dose of LATUDA is 80 mg per day [see Contraindications ( 4); Drug Interactions ( 7.1)] . Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided in patients taking LATUDA [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]. Concomitant Use with CYP3A4 Inducers LATUDA should not be used concomitantly with a inducer (e.g., used concomitantly with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, it may be necessary to increase the LATUDA dose after chronic treatment (7 days or more) with the CYP3A4 inducer. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS LATUDA tablets are available in the following shape and color ( Table 1 ) with respective one- sided debossing: Table 1: LATUDA Tablet Presentations Tablet Strength Tablet Color/Shape Tablet Markings 20 mg white to off-white round L20 40 mg white to off-white round L40 80 mg pale green oval L80 120 mg white to off-white oval L120 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to lu rasidone HCl or any compone nts in the formulation. Angioedema has been observed with lurasidone [see Adverse [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled tria ls (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6- to 1.7-times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course 5 Reference ID: 3333342 of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the pl acebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., hear t failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observa tional studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mort ality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some ch aracteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. LATUDA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ]. 5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD ), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and thes e disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing c oncern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depr ession and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients duri ng the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-contro lled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and be havior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18- 24) with major depressi ve disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in ad ults beyond age 24; ther e was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placeb o in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled tria ls in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (O CD), or other psychiatric disord ers included a to tal of 24 short- term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in ove r 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo- controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short- term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the di fferent indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk of differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2 . 6 Reference ID: 3333342 Table 2 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18-24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer case 65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any c onclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressa nts for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinic al worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during th e initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomot or restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with anti depressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other in dications, both psychiat ric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of su ch symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose de pression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if thes e symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being trea ted with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiat ric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritabilit y, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described ab ove, as well as the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for LATUDA should be writte n for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. 7 Reference ID: 3333342 5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazo le, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebr ovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), incl uding fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects. LATUDA is not approved for the treatm ent of patients with de mentia-related psychosis [see also Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]. 5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes re ferred to as Neurolep tic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including LATUDA. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pre ssure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of pa tients with this syndrome is co mplicated. It is important to exclude cases where the clinic al presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat st roke, drug fever, and primary cen tral nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include: 1) imme diate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent th erapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsycho tic drug treatment after recove ry from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. If re introduced, the patient should be carefully monitored, since recurr ences of NMS have been reported. 5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements that can develop in patients tr eated with antipsycho tic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, espe cially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the ince ption of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to deve lop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. Ho wever, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brie f treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsy chotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the 8 Reference ID: 3333342 syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underl ying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term c ourse of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, LATU DA should be prescribed in a ma nner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Ch ronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who su ffer from a chronic illness th at (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of trea tment producing a satisfact ory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued tr eatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskine sia appear in a patient on LATUDA, drug discontinuation should be consid ered. However, some patients may require treatment with LATUDA despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.6 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabo lic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and asso ciated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic us e and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes me llitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-eme rgent hyperglycemia-related advers e events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Because LAT UDA was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if LATUDA is associated with this increased risk. Patients with an established diagnosis of di abetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for wors ening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting bl ood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. A ny patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglyce mia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who deve lop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood gluc ose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment desp ite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

Weight Gain Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsy chotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended. Schizophrenia Pooled data from short-term, placebo-controll ed schizophrenia studies are presented in Table 9 . The mean weight gain was 0.43 kg for LAT UDA-treated patients compared to -0.02 kg for placebo-treated patients. Change in weight fr om baseline for olanzapine was +4.15 kg and for quetiapine extended-release was +2.09 kg in Studies 3 and 5 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1)], respectively. The proporti on of patients with a 7% increase in body weight (at Endpoint) was 4.8% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 3.3% for placebo-treated patients. Table 9: Mean Change in Weight (kg) fr om Baseline in Schizophrenia Studies LATUDA Placebo (primarily open-label extension studies), LATUDA was associated with a mean change in weight of -0.69 kg at week 24 (n=755), -0.59 kg at week 36 (n=443) and -0.73 kg at week 52 (n=377). Bipolar Depression Monotherapy Data from the short-term, flexible-dosed, pl acebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study are presented in Table 10.

The proportion of patients with a 7% increase in body weight (at Endpoint) was 2.4% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 0.7% for placebo-treated patients. 13 Reference ID: 3333342 Table 10: Mean Change in Weight (kg) fr om Baseline in the Monotherapy Bipolar Depression Study LATUDA Placebo (n=151) 20 to 60 mg/day (n=143) 80 to 120 mg/day (n=147) All Patients +0.02 Patients were randomized flexibly dosed LATUDA 20 to 60 mg/day, LA TUDA 80 to 120 mg/day or placebo In the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipolar depression study, patients who received LATUDA as monotherapy in the short-term and c ontinued in the longer-term study had a mean change in weight of -0.02 kg at week 24 (n=130) . Adjunctive Therapy with or Valproate Data from the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies are presented in Table 11 . The mean weight gain was 0.11 kg for LATUDA- treated patients compared to 0.16 kg for placebo-trea ted patients. The proportion of patients with a 7% increase in body weight (at Endpoint) was 3.1% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 0.3% for placebo-treated patients. Table 11: Mean Change in Weight (kg) fr om Baseline in the Adjunctive Therapy Bipolar Depression Studies LATUDA Placebo (n=334) 20 to 120 mg/day (n=327) All +0.11 Patients were randomized to flexibly dosed LATUDA 20 to 120 mg/day or placebo as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. In the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipol ar depression study, patients who were treated with LATUDA, as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate in the short-term and continued in the longer-term study, had a mean ch ange in weight of +1.28 kg at week 24 (n=86). 5.7 Hyperprolactinemia As with other drugs th at antagonize dopamine D 2 receptors, LATUDA elevates prolactin levels. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalami c GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductiv e function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patient s. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia, when associat ed with hypogonadism, ma y lead to decrease d bone density in both female and male patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6)]. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approx imately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in a LATUDA carcinogenicity study in rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13)]. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association 14 Reference ID: 3333342 between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive. Schizophrenia In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia st udies, the median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels for LATUDA-treat ed patients was +0.4 ng/mL and was -1.9 ng/mL in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +0.5 ng/mL and for females was -0.2 ng/mL. Median changes for prolactin by dose are shown in Table 12 . Table 12: Median Change in Prolactin (ng/mL ) from Baseline in Schizophrenia Studies LATUDA Placebo mg/day 40 mg/day 80 prolactin elevations 5\u00d7 upper limit of no rmal (ULN) was 2.8% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 1.0% for placebo-treated patients. Th e proportion of female patients with prolactin elevations 5x ULN was 5.7% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 2.0% for placebo-treated female patients. The proportion of male patients with prolactin elevations 5x ULN was 1.6% versus 0.6% for placebo-treated male patients. In the uncontrolled longer-term schizophrenia st udies (primarily open-label extension studies), LATUDA was associated with a median change in prolactin of -0.9 ng/mL at week 24 (n=357), -5.3ng/mL at 36 (n=190) and -2.2 ng/mL at week 52 (n=307). Bipolar Depression Monotherapy The median change from baseline to endpoint in in the short-term, ng/mL with LATUDA 20 to 60 mg/day and 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively compared to +0.3 ng/mL with placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +1.5 ng/mL and for females was +3.1 ng/mL. Median changes for prolactin by dose range are shown in Table 13 . 15 Reference ID: 3333342 Table 13: Median Change in Prolactin (n g/mL) from Baseline in the Monotherapy Bipolar Depression Study LATUDA Placebo 20 to 60 mg/day 80 to to 60 mg/day, LA TUDA 80 to 120 mg/day or placebo The proportion of patients w ith prolactin elevations 5x upper limit of normal (ULN) was 0.4% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 0.0% for placebo-treated patients. Th e proportion of female patients with prolactin elevations 5x ULN was 0.6% for LATUDA-tr eated patients versus 0% for placebo-treated female patients. The proportion of male patients with prolactin elevations 5x ULN was 0% versus 0% for placebo-treated male patients. In the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipolar depression study, patients who were treated with LATUDA in the short-term and continued in the longer-term study, had a median change in prolactin of -1.15 ng/mL at week 24 (n=130). Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate The median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels, in the short-term, flexible- dosed, polar depression +2.8 ng/mL with LATUDA 20 to 120 mg/day compared to 0.0 ng/mL with placebo-treated patients.

Th e proportion of female patients with prolactin elevations 5x ULN was 0% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 0% for placebo-treated female patients. The proportion of male patients with prolactin elevations 5x ULN was 0% versus 0% In the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipol ar depression study, patients who were treated with LATUDA, as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate, in the short-term and continued in the longer-term study, had a median change in prolactin of -2.9 ng/mL at week 24 (n=88). 5.8 Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Leukopenia/neutropenia has been reported during treatment w ith antipsycho tic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other ag ents in the class. Possible risk factors for leukopeni a/neutropenia include pre-exis ting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/ne utropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induc ed leukopenia/neutropenia shoul d have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the fi rst few months of therapy and LATUDA should be discontinued at the first sign of decline in WBC, in the abse nce of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3) should discontinue LATU DA and have their WBC followed until recovery. 5.9 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope LATUDA may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, perhaps due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reacti ons can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. Ge nerally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, histor y of cardiovascular dis ease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conducti on abnormalities), history of cerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic -na\u00efve. In such patients , consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, an d monitor orthostatic vital signs. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital si gn measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: 20 mm Hg decrease in syst olic blood pressure and 10 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing position. Schizophrenia The incidence of orthostatic hypo tension and syncope reported as adverse events from short- term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was sion, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.8% with LATUDA 40 mg, 2.1% with LATUDA 80 mg, 1.7% with LATUDA 120 mg and 0.8% with LATUDA 160 mg compared to 0.7% with placebo. 17 Reference ID: 3333342 Bipolar Depression Monotherapy In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-cont rolled monotherapy bipolar depression study, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.6% with LATUDA 20 to 60 mg and 0.6% with LATUDA 80 to 120 mg compared to 0% with placebo. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-contro lled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression therapy studies, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 1.1% with LATUDA 20 to 120 mg compared to 0.9% with placebo. 5.10 Seizures As with other antipsychotic drugs, LATUDA should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower th e seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer's dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure th reshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older. Schizophrenia In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, seizures/convulsi ons occurred in 0.1% (2/1508) patients treated with LATUDA compar ed to 0.1% (1/708) pl In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-cont rolled monotherapy bipolar depression study, no patient experienced seizures/convulsions. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, no patient experienced seizures/convulsions. 5.11 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment LATUDA, like other antipsychotics, has the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills. Caution patients about operating hazard ous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy w ith LATUDA does not affect them adversely. In clinical studies with LATUDA, somnolence somnolence was reported by of patients treated with LATU DA (15.5% m g, 160 mg/day) compared 7.1% (50/708) of placebo patients. 18 Reference 3333342 Monotherapy In the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-cont bipolar 7.3% (12/164) and 13.8% (23/167) with LATUDA 20 to 60 mg and 80 to120 mg, respectively compared to 6.5% (11/168) of placebo patients. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate In the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, somnolence was reported by 11.4% (41/ 360) of patients treated with LATUDA 20-120 mg compared to 5.1% (17/334) of placebo patients. 5.12 Body Temperature Dysregulation Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropria te care is advised when pres cribing LATUDA for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribut e to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or be ing subject to dehydration [see Patient Counseling Information (17.9)]. 5.13 Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illness and close supervision of high- risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Pr escriptions for LATUDA should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Schizophrenia In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was 0.4 % (6/1508) for LATUDA-tre ated patients compared to 0.8% (6/708) on placebo. No suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in these studies. Bipolar Depression Monotherapy In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipo lar depression suicidal id eation was 0.0% (0/331) with LATUDA-treated patients compared to 0.0% (0/168) with place bo-treated patients. No suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in this study. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression ergent suicidal ideation was 1.1% (4/360) for LATUDA-treated patients compared to 0.3% (1/334) on placebo. No suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in these studies. 5.14 Activation of Mania/Hypomania Antidepressant treatment can increase the risk of developing a manic or hypomanic episode, particularly in patients with bipolar disorder. Monitor patie nts for the emergence of such episodes. 19 Reference ID: 3333342 In the bipolar depression monotherapy and adjunctive therapy (w ith lithium or valproate) studies, less than 1% of subjects in the LATUDA a nd placebo groups developed manic or hypomanic episodes. 5.15 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morb idity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. LATUDA and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. 5.16 Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity include confusion, obtundation, pos tural instability with frequent falls, extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinical features consistent with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in ot her sections of the labeling: Increased Mortality in Elderly Patient s with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Includ ing Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-related Psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] Diabetes Mellitus, Warnings Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10 )] Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11)] Body Temperature Dysregulation [see Warnings and Precautions ( [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15)] Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16)] 20 Reference ID: 3333342 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under wi dely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the ra tes observed in clinical practice. The information below is derived from an inte grated clinical study database for LATUDA consisting of 3799 patients exposed to one or more doses of LATUDA for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression in place bo-controlled studies. This experience corresponds to with a total experience of 1250.9 patient-yea rs. A total of 1106 LATU DA-treated patients had at least 24 weeks and 371 LATUDA-treated patients had at least 52 weeks of exposure . Adverse events during exposur e to study treatment were obt ained by genera l inquiry and voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results from physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, weights and laborat ory investigations. Adverse ex periences were recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology. In order to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, events were grouped in standardized categories using MedDRA terminology. Schizophrenia The following findings are based on the short-te rm, placebo-controlled premarketing studies for schizophrenia in which LATUDA wa s administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 160 mg (n=1508). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (incidence 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with LATUDA were somnolence, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and nausea. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment: A total of 9.5% (143/1508) LATUDA-treated patients and 9.3% (66/708) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with LATUDA that were at least 2% and at least twic e the placebo rate. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in LATUDA-Treated Patients: Adverse reactions associated w ith the use of LATUDA (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and LATUDA incidence great er than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with schizophrenia) are shown in Table 15. 21 Reference ID: 3333342 Table 15: Adverse Reactions in 2% or More of LATUDA-Treated Patients and That Occurred at Greater Incidence than in the Placebo-Treated Patients in Short-term Schizophrenia Studies Percentage of Patients Reporting Reaction LATUDA Body System or Placebo 20 40 80 120 160 All Organ Class (%) (%) (%) (%) Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 5 11 10 9 13 7 10 Vomiting 6 7 6 9 9 7 8 Dyspepsia 5 11 6 5 8 6 6 Salivary <1 1 1 2 4 2 2 Hypersecretion Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Back Pain 2 0 4 3 4 0 3 Nervous System Disorders Akathisia 3 6 11 12 22 7 13 Extrapyramidal 6 6 11 12 22 13 14 Disorder* Dizziness 2 6 4 4 5 6 4 Somnolence** 7 15 16 15 26 8 17 Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 8 8 10 11 9 7 10 Agitation 4 10 7 3 6 5 5 Anxiety 4 3 6 4 7 3 5 Restlessness 1 1 3 1 3 2 2 Note: Figures rounded to the nearest integer *Extrapyramidal symptoms includes adverse event terms: bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, Reference Reactions in the Schizophrenia Studies Akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms were do se-related. The frequency of akathisia increased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for LATU DA 20 mg, 10.7% for LATUDA 40 mg, 12.3% for LATUDA 80 mg, and 22.0% for LATUDA 120 mg). Akathisia was reporte d by 7.4% (9/121) of patients receiving 160 mg/day. Akathisia occurred in 3.0% of subjects receiving placebo. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms incr eased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for LATUDA 20 mg, 11.5% for LA TUDA 40 mg, 11.9% for LA TUDA 80 mg, and 22.0% for LATUDA 120 mg). Bipolar Depression (Monotherapy) The following findings are based on the short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing study for bipolar depression in which LATUDA was admini stered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg (n=331). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (incidence 5%, in either dose group, and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with LATUDA were akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anxiety. Adverse Reactions Associated wi th Discontinuation of Treatment: A total of 6.0% (20/331) LATUDA-treated patients and 5.4% (9/168) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with disc ontinuation in subjects treated with LATUDA that were at least 2% and at least twic e the placebo rate. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in LATUDA-Treated Patients: Adverse reactions associated with the use of LATUDA (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and LATUDA incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients wi th bipolar depression) are shown in Table 16 . 23 Reference ID: 3333342 Table 16: Adverse Reactions in 2% or More of LATUDA-Treated Patients and That Occurred at Greater Incidence than in the Placebo-Treated Patients in a Short-term Monotherapy Bipolar Depression Study Percentage of Patients Reporting Reaction Body System or Organ Class Placebo LATUDA LATUDA (%) Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 8 10 17 14 Dry Mouth 4 6 4 5 Vomiting 2 2 6 4 Diarrhea 2 5 3 4 Infections and infestations Nasopharyngitis 1 4 4 4 Influenza 1 <1 2 2 Urinary Tract Infection <1 2 2 2 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Back Pain <1 3 <1 2 Nervous System Disorders Extrapyramidal Symptoms* 2 5 9 7 Somnolence** 7 7 14 11 Akathisia 2 8 11 9 Psychiatric Disorders Anxiety 1 4 5 4 Note: Figures rounded to the nearest integer *Extrapyramidal symptoms includes adverse event terms: bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, drooling, extrapyramidal Study: In short-term, placebo-controlled study (i nvolving lower and higher LATUDA dose ranges) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] the a dverse reactions that occurred with a greater than 5% incidence in the patients treated with LA TUDA in any dose group and greater than placebo in both groups were to 60 mg/day and LATUDA 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively. Bipolar Depression Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate The following findings are based on two short-te rm, placebo-controlled premarketing studies for bipolar depression in which LATUDA was admini stered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate (n=360). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (incidence 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in subjects treated with LATUDA were akathisia and somnolence. Adverse Reactions Associated wi th Discontinuation of Treatment: A total of 5.8% (21/360) LATUDA-treated patients and 4.8% (16/334) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions.

Other Adverse Reactions Observed Duri ng the Premarketing Evaluation of LATUDA Following is a list of adverse reactions report ed by patients treated with LATUDA at multiple doses of 20 mg once daily within the premar keting database of 2905 patients with schizophrenia. The reactions listed are those that coul d be of clinical importance, as well as reactions that are plausibly drug-related on pha rmacologic or other grounds. Reactions listed in Table 15 or those that appear elsewhere in the LATUDA label are not included. Although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with LATUDA, they were not necessarily caused by it. Reactions are further categorized by organ cla ss and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: those occu rring in at least 1/100 pa tients (frequent) (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled st udies appear in this occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patien ts (infrequent); and those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients (rare). Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Infrequent: anemia Disorders: Conditions: Rare: sudden death Investigations: Frequent: CPK increased Metabolism dysarthria Psychiatric Disorders: Infrequent: abnormal dreams, sleep disorder Renal and Urinary Disorders: Infrequent: dysuria; Rare: Rare: : In short-term, placebo-controlled trials , the Baseline in creatinine was mg/dL mg/dL for placebo-treated patients. A creatinine shift from normal to high occurred in 3.0% (43/1453) of LATUDA-treated patients and 1.6% (11/681) on place bo. The threshold for high creatinine value varied from > 0.79 to > 1.3 mg/dL based on the cen tralized laboratory definition for each study (Table 21 ).

LATUDA should not be used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, The LATUDA dose should be reduced to half of the original level when us ed concomitantly with m oderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., diltiazem, atazanavir, erythromyci n, fluconazole, verapamil, etc.). If is used concomitantly with a moderate CYP3A4 i nducer, it may be necessary to increase the LATUDA dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5)]. Lithium: It is not necessary to adjust the LATUDA dose when used concomitantly with lithium (Figure 1 ). Valproate: It is not necessary to adjust the LATU DA dose when used concomitantly with valproate. A dedicated drug-dr ug interaction study has not been conducted with valproate and LATUDA. Based on pharmacokinetic data from the bipolar depression studies valproate levels were not affected by lurasidone, an d lurasidone concentrations were not affected by valproate. Grapefruit: Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided in patients taking LATUDA [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5)]. 32 Reference ID: 3333342 Figure 1: Impact of Other Drug s on LATUDA Pharmacokinetics 7.2 Potential for LATUDA to Affect Other Drugs No adjustment is needed on the dose of lithium, valproate, or substrates of P-gp or CYP3A4 when 2 33 Reference ID: 3333342 Figure 2: Impact of LATUDA on Other Drugs 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Risk Summary There are no adequate and well controlled studies of LATUDA use in pregnant women. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, trem or, somnolence, respiratory dist ress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. LATUDA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit ju stifies the potential risk to the fetus. 34 Reference ID: 3333342 Human Data Safe use of LATUDA during pregnanc y or lactation has not been es tablished; therefore, use of LATUDA in pregnancy, in nursing mothers, or in women of chil dbearing potential requires that the benefits of treatment be weighed agai nst the possible risks to mother and child. Animal Data No adverse developmental effects were observed in a study in which pregnant rats were given lurasidone during the period of organogenesis and continuing through weaning at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day, which is approximately half of th e maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 160 mg/day, based on mg/m2 body surface area. No teratogenic effects were seen in studies in which pregnant rats and rabbits were given lurasidone during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 a nd 50 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are 1.5- and 6-times, in rats a nd rabbits, respectively, the MRHD of 160 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. 8.3 Nursing Mothers LATUDA was excreted in milk of rats during lactation . It is not known whether LATUDA or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, considering the risk of drug discontinuation to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatri c patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies with LATUDA did not include su fficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether or not they respond differe ntly from younger patients . In elderly patients with psychosis (65 to 85), LA TUDA concentrations (20 mg/day) were similar to those in young subjects. It is unknown whether dose adjustment is necessary on the basis of age alone. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with LATUDA are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. LATUDA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ]. 8.6 Other Patient Factors The effect of intrinsic patient factors on th e pharmacokinetics of LATUDA is presented in Figure 3. 35 Reference ID: 3333342 Figure 3: Impact of Other Patient Factors on LATUDA Pharmacokinetics 9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance LATUDA is not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse LATUDA has not been systematical ly studied in humans for its po tential for abuse or physical dependence or its ability to indu ce tolerance. While clinical stud ies with LATUDA did not reveal any tendency for drug-seeking beha vior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict the extent to which a CNS- active drug will be misused, diverted and/or abused once it is marketed. Patients should be ev aluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed carefully for signs of LATUDA misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, drug-seek ing behavior, increases in dose). 36 Reference ID: 3333342 10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience In premarketing clinical studies, accidental or intentional over dosage of LATUDA was identified in one patient who ingested an estimated 560 mg of LATUDA. This patient recovered without sequelae. This patient resumed LATUDA treatment for an additional two months . 10.2 Management of Overdosage Consult a Certified Poison Control Center fo r up-to-date guidance and advice. There is no specific antidote to LATUDA, therefore, approp riate supportive measures should be instituted and close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. Consider the possibility of multiple-drug overdose. Cardiovascular monitoring should comm ence immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for possible a rrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide, and qui nidine carry a theoretical hazard of additive QT-prolonging effects when administered in pa tients with an acute overdose of LATUDA. Similarly, the alpha-blocking prope rties of bretylium might be a dditive to those of LATUDA, resulting in problematic hypotension. Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures. Epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, or other symp athomimetics with beta-agonist activity, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of LATUDA-induced alpha blockade. In case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. Gastric lavage (after intubation if patient is unconscious) a nd administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizures, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. 11 DESCRIPTION LATUDA is an atypical antipsychotic belongi ng to the chemical class of is C 28H36N4O2S\u00b7HCl and its molecular weight is 529.14. The chemical structure is: HCl H N N N S H N O O H H H H 37 Reference ID: 3333342 Lurasidone hydrochloride is a white to off-white pow der. It is very slightly soluble in water, practically insoluble or insoluble in 0.1 N HCl, s lightly soluble in ethanol, sparingly soluble in methanol, practically insoluble or insoluble in toluene and very slight ly soluble in acetone. LATUDA tablets are intended for oral administra tion only. Each tablet contains 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, or 120 mg of lurasidone hydrochloride. Inactive ingredients magnesium stearate, Opadry\u00ae and carnauba wax. Additionally, th e 80 mg tablet co ntains yellow ferric oxide and FD&C Blue No. 2 Aluminum Lake. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of LATUDA in the treatme nt of schizophrenia and bipolar depression is unknown. However, its efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar depression could be mediated through a combination of cen tral dopamine Type 2 (D 2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT 2A) receptor antagonism. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics LATUDA is an antagonist with high affinity binding at the dopamine D 2 receptors (Ki=1 nM) nM) receptors. It also binds w ith moderate affinity to the human 2C adrenergic receptors (Ki=11 nM), is receptors (Ki= 41 nM). LATUDA exhibits li ttle or no affinity for histamine H 1 and muscarinic M 1 receptors (IC 50 > 1,000 nM) . ECG Changes The effects of LATUDA on the QTc interval were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-dedicate d thorough QT study in 43 patien ts with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, who were treated with LATUDA doses of 120 mg daily, 600 mg daily and completed the study. The maximum mean (upper 1-sided, 95% CI) increase in baseline- adjusted QTc intervals based on individual co rrection method (QTcI) was 7.5 (11.7) ms and 4.6 (9.5) ms, for the 120 mg and 600 mg dose groups respectively, observed at 2 to 4 hours after dosing. In this study, there was no appare nt dose (exposure)-res ponse relationship. In short-term, placebo-controlled studies in schizophrenia and bipol ar depression, no post- baseline QT prolongations exceeding 500 msec were reported in patients treated with LATUDA or placebo. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of LATUDA is prim arily due to the parent drug. The pharmacokinetics of LATUDA is dose-proportional within a total daily dose range of 20 mg to 160 mg. Steady-state concentrations of LATUDA are reached within 7 days of starting LATUDA. Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) elimination half-life was 18 (7) hours. Absorption and Distribution: LATUDA is absorbed and reaches peak serum concentrations in approximately 1-3 hours. It is estimated that 9-19% of an administered dose is absorbed. 38 Reference ID: 3333342 Following administration of 40 mg of LAT UDA, the mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution was 6173 (17.2) L. LATUDA is highly bound (~99%) to serum proteins. In a food effect st udy, LATUDA mean C max and AUC were about 3-times and 2-times, respectively, when administered with food compared to the levels observed under fasting conditions. LATUDA exposure was not affected as meal size was increased from 350 to 1000 calories and was independent of meal fat content [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)] . In clinical studies, establishing the safety and efficacy of LATUDA, patients were instructed to take their daily dose with food [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)]. Metabolism and Elimination: LATUDA is metabolized major non-active (ID-20219 and ID-20220). Based on in vitro studies, LATUDA is not a is not a substrate for CYP1A2, smoking is not expected to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of LATUDA. Total excretion of radioactivity in urine and f eces combined was approximately 89%, with about 80% recovered in feces and 9% recovere d in urine, after a single dose of [14C]-labeled LATUDA. Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) apparent clearance was 3902 (18.0) mL/min. gland adenomas in female mice ora lly dosed with 30, 100, 300, or 650 mg/kg/day. The lowest dose produced plasma levels (AUC) appr oximately equal to those in humans receiving the MRHD of 160 mg/day. No increases in tumors were seen in male mice up to the highest dose tested, which produced plasma levels (AUC) 14-times those in humans receiving the MRHD. LATUDA increased the incidence of mammary gland carcinomas in females rats orally dosed at 12 and 36 mg/kg/day: the lowest dose; 3 mg/kg/day is the no-effect dose which produced plasma levels (AUC) 0.4-times those in humans receiving the MRHD. No increases in tumors were seen in male rats up to the highest dose tested, which produced plasma levels (AUC) 6\u00adtimes those in humans receiving the MRHD. Proliferative and/or neoplastic changes in the mammary and pituitary glands of rodents have been observed following chronic ad ministration of antipsychotic dr ugs and are considered to be prolactin-mediated. The relevance of this increased incidence of prolactin-mediated pituitary or mammary gland tumors in rodents to humans unknown [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)]. Mutagenesis: LATUDA did not cause mutation or chromosomal aberration when tested in vitro and in vivo . LATUDA was negative in the Ames gene mutation test, the Chinese Hamster Lung (CHL) cells, and in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test up to 2000 mg/kg (61 times the MRHD of 160 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area). Impairment of Fertility: Estrus cycle irregularities were seen in rats orally administered LATUDA at 1.5, 15 and 150 mg/kg/day for 15 c onsecutive days prior to mating, during the 39 Reference ID: 3333342 mating period, and through day 7 of gestation. The no-effect dose is 0.1 mg/kg which is approximately 0.006-times the MRHD of 160 mg/day based on body surface area. Fertility was reduced only at the highest dose, which was reve rsible after a 14-day drug-free period. The no- effect dose for reduced fertility was 15 mg/kg, wh ich is approximately e qual to the MRHD based on body surface area. LATUDA had no effect on fertility in male rats treated orally with LATUDA for 64 consecutive days prior to mating and during the mating peri od at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day (9-times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area). 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Schizophrenia The efficacy of LATUDA for the treatment of schi zophrenia was established in five short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled studies in adult pati ents (mean age of 38.4 years, range 18-72) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. An active-control arm (olanzapine or quetiapine extended-release) was incl uded in two studies to a ssess assay sensitivity. Several instruments were used for assessing psyc hiatric signs and symptoms in these studies: 1. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) , is a multi-item inventory of general psychopathology used to evaluate the effects of drug treatmen t in schizophrenia. PANSS total scores may range from 30 to 210. 2. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale derived (BPRSd ), derived from the PANSS, is a multi-item inventory primarily focusing on positive symp toms of schizophrenia, whereas the PANSS includes a wider range of positive, negative and other symptoms of schizophrenia. The BPRSd consists of 18 items rated on a scale of 1 (not present) to 7 (severe). BPRSd scores may range from 18 to 126. 3. The Clinical Global Impression severity scal e (CGI-S) is a clinician-rated scale that measures the subject's current illness state on a 1- to 7-point scale. The endpoint associated with each instrument is ch ange from baseline in the total score to the end of week 6. These changes are then compared to placebo changes for the drug and control groups. The results of the studies follow: 1. Study 1: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled tr ial (N=145) involving two fixed doses of LATUDA (40 or 120 mg/day), both doses of LATUDA at Endpoint were superior to placebo on the BPRSd total score, and the CGI-S. 2. Study 2: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N=180) involving a fixed dose of LATUDA (80 mg/day), LATUDA at Endpoint was superior to placebo on the BPRSd total score, and the CGI-S. 3. Study 3: In a 6-week, placebo- and active-controlled trial (N=473) involving two fixed doses of LATUDA (40 or 120 mg/day) and an active control (olanzapine), both LATUDA doses and the active control at Endpoint were superior to place bo on the PANSS total score, and the CGI-S. 40 Reference ID: 3333342 4. Study 4: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled tr ial (N=489) involving three fixed doses of LATUDA (40, 80 or 120 mg/day), only the 80 mg/day dose of LATUDA at Endpoint was superior to placebo on the PANSS total score, and the CGI-S. 5. Study 5: In a 6-week, placebo- and active-controlled trial (N=482) involving two fixed doses of LATUDA (80 or 160 mg/day) and an ac tive control (quetiapin e extended-release), both LATUDA doses and the active control at Endpoint were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score, and the CGI-S. Thus, the efficacy of LATUDA at doses of 40, 80, 120 and 160 mg/day has been established (Table 24 ).

Examination of population subgroups based on age (t here were few patients over 65), gender and race did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness. 41 Reference ID: 3333342 14.2 Depressive Episodes Associat ed with Bipolar I Disorder Monotherapy The efficacy of LATUDA, as monotherapy, wa s established in a 6-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adult patients (mean age of 41.5 years, range 18 to 74) who met DSM-IV -TR criteria for major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, with or without rapid cy cling, and without psycho tic features (N=485). Patients were randomized to one of two flexible -dose ranges of LATUDA (20 to 60 mg/day, or 80 to 120 mg/day) or placebo. The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms in this study was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Ra ting Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-rated scale with total scores ranging from 0 (no depressive f eatures) to 60 (maximum score). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in MADRS score at Week 6. The key secondary instrument was the Clinical Global Impression- Bipolar-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-BP-S), a clinician-rated scale that measures the subject's current illness state on a 7-point scale, where a higher score is associated with greater illness severity. For both dose groups, LATUDA was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS and CGI-BP-S scores at Week 6. The primary efficacy results are provided in Table 25 . The high dose range (80 to 120 mg per day) did not provide additional efficacy on average, compared to the low dose range (20 to 60 mg per day). Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate The efficacy of LATUDA, as an ad junctive therapy with lithium or valproate, was established in a 6-week, multicenter, randomize d, double-blind, placebo-controll ed study of adult patients (mean age of 41.7 years, range 18 to 72) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, with or without rapi d cycling, and without psychotic features (N=340). Patients who remained symptomatic after treatment with lithium or valproate were randomized to flexibly dosed LATUDA 20 to 120 mg/day or placebo. The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms in this study was the MADRS. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in MADRS score at Week 6. The key secondary instrument was the CGI-BP-S scale. LATUDA was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS and CGI-BP-S scores at Week 6, as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate ( Table 25 ). Table 25: Primary Efficacy Results for Studies in Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder (MADRS Scores) Study Treatment Group Primary Efficacy Measure MADRS Mean Baseline Score LS Mean Change Placebo-subtracted (SD) from Baseline (SE) (20-120 (5.3) -1.1) Placebo least-squares mean; CI: unadjusted confidence interval. a Difference (drug minus placebo) in least- squares mean change from baseline. * Doses statistically signifi cantly superior to placebo. 42 Reference ID: 3333342 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING LATUDA tablets are white to off-white, round ( 20 mg or 40 mg), pale green, oval (80 mg) or white to off-white, oval (120 mg) and identified with strength-specific one-sided debossing, \"L20\" (20 mg), \"L40\" (40 mg), \"L80\" (80 mg) or \"L120\" (120 mg).

LATUDA is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ; Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]. 17.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors; and Activation of Mania or Hypomania Educate patients, families, and ca regivers about the risk of suic idal thoughts and behaviors with antidepressant treatment, as well as the risk of mania and hypomania. Advise them about monitoring for the emergence of suicidal thoughts and beha vior, manic/hypomanic symptoms, irritability, agitation, or unusual cha nges in behavior. Instruct patients, families, and caregivers to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 and 5.14 )]. 17.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Advise patients and caregivers that a potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as NMS has been reported in association with ad ministration of antipsychotic drugs. Signs and symptoms of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigi dity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia) [see Warnings and Precautions cemia and Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, and Weight Gain) Educate patients and caregivers about the risk of metabolic changes and the need for specific monitoring. The risks include hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular reactions. Educate patien ts and caregivers about the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus (e.g., polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness). Monitor all patients for these symptoms. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes (obesi ty, family history of diabetes) should have their fasting blood glucose monitored before beginni ng treatment and periodically during treatment. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia should have assessments of fasting glucose. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)] . 17.5 Orthostatic Hypotension Educate patients about the risk of orthostatic hypotension, particularly at the time of initiating treatment, re-initiating treat ment, or increasing the dose [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9)]. 44 Reference ID: 3333342 17.6 Leukopenia/Neutropenia Advise patients with a pre-existing lo w WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia that they should ha ve their CBC monitored while taking LATUDA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)]. 17.7 Interference with Cognitiv e and Motor Performance Caution patients about performi ng activities requiring mental al ertness, such as operating hazardous machinery or operating a motor vehicl e, until they are reasonably certain that LATUDA therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11)]. 17.8 Pregnancy and Nursing Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with LATUDA [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1)]. 17.9 Concomitant Medication and Alcohol Instruct patients to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, because there is a potentia l for drug interactions . Advise patients to avoid alcohol while taking LATUDA [see Drug Interactions ( 7)]. 17.10 Heat Exposure and Dehydration Educate patients regarding appropriate ca re in avoiding overh eating and dehydration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12)].

There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medi cal condition or treatment. What is the most important informat ion I should know about LATUDA? LATUDA may cause serious si de effects, including: 1. risk of death in the elderly with dementia: Medicines like LATU DA can increase the risk of death in elderly people who have memory loss (dementia). LATUDA is not for treating psychosis in the elderly with dementia. 2. risk of suicidal thoughts or actions (antidepressant medi cines, depression and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions). Talk to your, or your family me mber's, healthcare provider about: all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines all treatment choices for depressi on or other serious mental illness Antidepressant medicines may increase su icidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. Depression and other serious mental illn esses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include people who have (or have a family history of) depression, bipolar illness (also called manic-depr essive illness), or suicidal thoughts or actions. How can I watch for and try to prevent su icidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member? Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feeli ngs. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed. Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with the heal thcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as n eeded, especially if you have concerns about symptoms. 46 Reference ID: 3333342 Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family me mber has any of the following symptoms, especially if th ey are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling very agitated or restless panic attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) new or worse irritability acting aggressive, being angry, or violent acting on dangerous impulses an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) other unusual changes in behavior or mood What else do I need to know ab out antidepressant medicines? Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms. Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of trea ting depression and also the risks of not treating it.
