Vaccine ; 40(48): 6979-6986, 2022 Nov 15. covidwho-2082297 ABSTRACT BACKGROUND:Test-negative of [vaccine effectiveness](VE) for [influenza vaccine]studies. However, [syndrome]-negative controls have been proposed for differentiating [bias]and true estimates in VE evaluations for COVID-19. To understand the use of alternative [control groups], we compared characteristics and VE estimates of [syndrome]-negative and test-negative VE controls. METHODS: [Adults]hospitalized at 21 medical centers in 18 states March 11-August 31, 2021 were eligible for [analysis]. Case [patients]had symptomatic acute respiratory and tested positive but negative [SARS-CoV-2 controls were without ARI and negative [SARS-CoV-2 testing]. Chi square and Wilcoxon [rank sum tests]were used to detect differences in baseline characteristics. VE against COVID-19 [hospitalization]was calculated using [logistic regression]comparing adjusted odds of prior [mRNA] [vaccination]between cases hospitalized and each cases, characteristics including [race]/ [ethnicity], [employment], previous [hospitalizations], medical conditions, and [immunosuppression]. estimates were very [similar]. Among immunocompetent [patients] [aged]18-64 years, VE was 93 % (95 % CI 90-94) using [syndrome]-negative controls and 91 % (95 % CI 88-93) using test-negative controls. CONCLUSIONS:Despite demographic and clinical differences between [control groups], the use either [control group]produced [similar]VE estimates across [age groups]and [immunosuppression]status. These findings support the use of test-negative controls and increase confidence in COVID-19 VE estimates produced by test-negative design studies. Mots ... LILACS LIS "}
