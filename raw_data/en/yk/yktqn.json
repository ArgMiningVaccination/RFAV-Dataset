Today, the same policy was announced for Crystal Serenity, Crystal Symphony and expedition ship Crystal Endeavor. This applies to all crew and age-eligible passengers (currently 12 and older). 'Our guests have overwhelmingly told us that vaccinations are critical for them to feel comfortable traveling and announcing this extension now will give them the information and reassurance they require as they look to plan future voyages with us,' Crystal President Jack Anderson said. Passengers will need to provide documentation of vaccination at check-in before boarding the ship. Children 11 and under who are not currently eligible for vaccination must be pre-approved after initial waitlist, are subject to capacity control and must provide proof of travel insurance. Travelers with unvaccinated children will be subject to unvaccinated protocols with their children. Once vaccines are approved for age-eligible children, Crystal will require they be fully vaccinated, too. The company said it will assess whether a booster shot for all crew and passengers will be required once more information is available.
