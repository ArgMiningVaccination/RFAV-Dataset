A.2 RENDERING OF MEDICAL SERVICES Any medical provider rendering services to a workers compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work related injuries and or illnesses. A.3 POSITIVE PATIENT RESPONSE Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, and endurance , activities of da ily living, cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function should be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation. A.4 RE-EVALUATE TREATMENT If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provide r should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modal ity 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. Reconsideration of diagnosis should also occur in the event of poor response to a rational intervention. E d u ca ti o n A.5 EDUCATION Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the community should be a primary emphasis in the New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 2 treatment of work related injury or illness. Practitioners must develop and implement effective educational strategies and sk ills. An education -based paradigm should always start with communication providing reassuring information to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self -management of symptoms and prevention of future injury. T i m e Fr am es A.6 DIAGNOSTIC TIME FRAMES Diagnostic time frames for conducting diagnostic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.7 TREATMENT TIME FRAMES Treatment time frames for specific interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on th e date of injury. Obviously, duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this docu ment. A.8 SIX-MONTH TIME FRAME Since the prognosis drops precipitously for returning an injured worker to work once he/she has been temporarily totally disabled for more than six months, the emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work within a six -month time frame, whenever possible. A.9 DELAYED RECOVERY For those patients who are failing to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis should be made. Thereafter, consideration of an alternate treatment program should be made. This may include an interdisciplinary rehabilitation program and may also include a psychosocial evaluation. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 3 T r ea tm e nt Ap p r o ac h es A.10 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.11 ACTIVE THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE PROGRAMS Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, coordination, and education . This includes functional application in vocational or community settings. A.12 DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING AND TESTING PROCEDURES Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection and interpretation of imaging procedure results. All diagnostic procedures have variable specificity and sensitivity for various diagnoses. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, a second diagnostic procedure will be redundant if it is performed only for diagnostic purposes . At the same time, a subsequent diagnostic procedure (that may be a repeat of the same procedure, when the rehabilitation physician, radiologist or surgeon documents the study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis) can be a complementary diagnostic procedure if the f irst or preceding procedures, in conjunction with clinical information, cannot provide an accurate diagnosis. It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and t o follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g. imaging studies ) during the course of care to reassess or stage the pathology when there is progression of symptoms or findin gs, prior to surgical interventions and therapeutic injections when warranted, and post -operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding CT examinations, it must be recognized that repeat pro cedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 4 A.13 SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS Contemplation of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course and imaging and other diagnostic tests . A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat severe pain, there should be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause A.14 PRE-AUTHORIZATION All diagnostic imaging , testing procedures, non -surgical and surgical therapeutic procedures within the criteria of the medical treatment guidelines and based on a correct applica tion of the medical treatment guidelines are considered authorized, with the exception of following procedures: Lumbar Fusion, Artificial Disc Replacements, Vertebroplasty, Kyphoplasty, Electrical Transplantation and Knee Arthroplasty (Total or Partial Knee Joint Replacement). These are not included on the list of pre -authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. A.15 PERSONALITY/ PSYCHOLOGICAL/ PSYCHOSOCIAL EVALUATIONS In select patients, diagnostic testing procedures may be useful when there is a discrepancy between diagnosis, signs, symptoms, clinical concern s or functional recovery. Psychological testing should provide differentiation between pre -existing depression versus injury -caused depression, as well as post -traumatic stress disorder, and other psychosocial issues that may include work or non -work rela ted issues. For those patients who fail to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests , re-examination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis shoul d be made. Formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation may be considered. A professional fluent in the primary language of the patient is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a professional language interpreter must b e provided. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 5 Frequency: One time visit for evaluation. If psychometric testing is indicated by findings in the initial evaluation, time for such testing should not exceed an additional two hours of professional time. A.16 PERSONALITY/ PSYCHOLOGICAL/ PSYCH OSOCIAL INTERVENTION Following psychosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, such intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone or in conjunction wit h other treatment modalities. Time to produce effect: 2 to 8 weeks Optimum duration: 6 weeks to 3 months Maximum duration: 3 to 6 months. Counseling is not intended to delay but to enhance functional recovery. For select patients, longer supervision ma y be required, and if further counseling is indicated, documentation of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authorized treating practitioner every 4 to 6 weeks during treatment. R e t ur n t o W or k A.17 FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY EVALUATION (FCE ) Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of function as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work . Areas such as endurance, lifting (dynamic and static), postural tolerance, specific range -of-motion, coordination and strength , worker habits, employability, as well as psychosocial, cognitive, and sensory perceptual aspects of competitive employment may be evaluated. Components of this evaluation may include: (a) musculoskeletal screen; (f) voluntary effort; (g) pain assessment/psychological screening; (h) non -material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In most cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 6 A.18 RETURN TO WORK For purposes of these guidelines, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of medical care , should be included in the treatment and rehabilitation plan, and normall y addressed at every outpatient visit. A description of patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan and should provide the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted . Early return to work should be a prime goal in treat ing occupational injuries given the poor return to work prognosis for a patient who has been out of work for more than six months. A.19 JOB SITE EVALUATION The treating physician may communicate with the employer or his designe e, either in person or by telephone, to obtain information regarding the demands of the patient's pre -injury job, including a description of the exertional demands of the job, the need for repetitive activities, load lifting, static or awkward postures, or any other factors that would pose a risk of re -injury or impedance of convalescence. When return to work at the patient's previous job task/setting is not feasible, given the clinically determined restrictions on the patient's acti vities, inquiry should also be made about modified duty work settings, and a similar set of questions should be posed by the physician about work activities/demands in modified duty jobs. Ideally, the physician would gain the most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activities; but it is recognized that this may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the employer, these can contribute valuable information. Frequency: 1 or 2 calls 1st call: Patien t is in a functional state where the patient can perform some work. 2nd call: Patient has advanced to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment The physician shall document the conversation on a form prepared b y the Workers' Compensation Board. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 7 O t he r A.20 GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS AND MEDICAL EVIDENCE The Workers Compensation Board [the Department and its Advisors including medical and other professionals] have not independently evaluated or vetted the scientific medical literature used in support of the guidelines, but have relied on the methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and referenced in these Guidelines. A.21 EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT Medical treatment that is experimental and not approved for any purpose, application or indication by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. A.22 INJURED WORKERS AS PATIENTS In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients recognizing that in certain circumstances there is n o doctor - patient relationship. A.23 SCOPE OF PRACTICE These Guidelines do not address scope of practice or change t he scope of practice. B INTRODUCTION TO KNEE INJURY HISTORY TAKING AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION B.1 History taking and physical examination establish the foundation/basis for and dictate subsequent stages of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. When findings of clinical evaluation s and those of other diagnostic procedures are not consistent with ea ch other, the objective clinical findings should have preference. The medical records should reasonably document the following. B.1.a History of Present I njury B.1.a.i Mechanism of injury : This includes details of symptom onset and progression , and symptoms that may arise from postural or functional accommodation to the knee injury ; New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 8 B.1.a.ii Relationship to work : This includes a statement of the probability that the illness or injury is work -related; B.1.a.iii Prior occupational and non -occupational injuries to the same area including specific prior treatment and any prior bracing devices; B.1.a.iv History of locking, clicking , giving way, acute or chronic swelling, crepitating , pain while ascending or descending stairs, or popping; B.1.a.v Ability to perform job duties and activities of daily living ; and B.1.a.vi Exacerbating and alleviating factors for symptoms ; not limited to the knee. B.1.b Past History B.1.b.i Past medical history includes , but is not limited to, neoplasm, gout, arthritis, and diabetes; B.1.b.ii Review of systems includes , but is not limited to , symptoms of B.1.b.iv Vocational and recreational pursuits ; B.1.b.v Prior imaging studies ; and B.1.b.vi Past surgical history. B.1.c Physical Examination Examination of a joint should include the joint above and below the affe cted area. Physical examinations should include accepted tests and exam techniques applicable to the joint or area being examined, including: B.1.c.i Visual New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 9 B.1.c.v Joint stability; B.1.c.vi Examination for a displaced or abnormally displaceable patella; B.1.c.vii If applicable to injury, integrity of distal circulation, sensory, and motor function; and B.1.c.viii If applicable, full neurological exam including muscle atrophy and gait abnormality. B.1.d Red Flags Certain findings , \"Red Flags \", raise suspicion of potentially serious medical conditions . Assessment (history and physical examination) should include evaluation for red flags. In the knee these findings or indicators may include: fracture, dislocations, and ligamentous tears; infection or inflammation; and neurological or vascular compromise including compartment syndrome . Further evaluation/ consultation or urgent/ emergency interve ntion may be indicated , and the Knee Guidelines incorporate changes in clinical management triggered by the presence of \"red flags .\" RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGING (X-ray) B.2 Radiographic imaging should not be routinely performed. The mechanism of injury and specific indications for the radiograph should be listed on the request form to aid the radiologist and x -ray technician. Indications include: B.2.a.i The inability to transfer weight for four steps at the time of the initial visit, regardless of limping; B.2.a.ii History of significant trauma, especially blunt trauma or fall from a height; B.2.a.iii Age over 55 years; B.2.a.iv Unexplained or persistent pain over two weeks. (Occult fractures, espe cially stress fractures, may not be visible on initial x -ray. A follow -up radiograph and/or bone scan may be required to make the diagnosis); New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 10 B.2.a.v History or exam suggestive of intravenous drug abuse or osteomyelitis; and B.2.a.vi Pain with swelling and/or range of motion (ROM) limitation localizing to an area of prior fracture, internal fixation, or joint prosthesis. LABORATORY TEST ING B.3 Laboratory t ests are rarely indicated at the time of initial evaluation , unless there is suspicion of systemic illness, infection, neoplasia, connective tissue disorder, or underlying arthritis or rheumatologic disorder based on history and/or physical examination. Laboratory tests can prov ide useful diagnostic information. Tests include, but are not limited to: B.3.a.i Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential can detect infection, blood dyscrasias, and (HLA ), and C -reactive protein (CRP) , among others, can be used to detect evidence of a rheumatologic, infection, or connective metabolic bone disease; B.3.a.iv Liver and kidney function may be performed for prolonged anti -inflammatory use or other medications requiring monitoring; and B.3.a.v Analysis of joint aspiration for bacteria, white cell count, red cell count, fat globules, crystalline birefringence and chemistry to evaluate joint effusion. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 11 FOLLOW -UP DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING AND TESTING B.4 PROCEDURES One diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as obtained by other procedures . Therefore, prudent choice of procedure(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combinatio n with other procedures(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy; minimize adverse effect to patients and promote cost effectiveness by avoiding duplication or redundancy. All diagnostic imaging proced ures have a significant percentage of specificity and sensitivity for various diagnoses. None is specifically characteristic of a certain diagnosis. Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the ba sis for selection and interpretation of imaging procedure results. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ), myelography , or computed axial tomography (CT) scanning following myelography may provide useful information for many knee disorders. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis , the second diagnostic procedure will be redundant if it is performed only for diagnostic purposes . At the same time, a subsequent diagnostic procedure (that may be a repeat of the same procedure, when the rehabilitation physician, radiologist or surgeo n documents that the study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis) can be a complementary diagnostic procedure if the first or preceding procedures, in conjunction with clinical information, cannot provide an accurate diagnosis. Usually, preference of a procedure over others depends upon availability, a patient's tolerance, and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g. imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the pathology when the re is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and therapeutic injections when warranted, and post -operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding CT examinations, it must be recognized that re peat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. When indicated, the following additional imaging studies can be utilized for further evaluation of the lower extremity , based upon the mechanism of injury, symptoms, and patient history . The studies below are listed in frequency of use, not importance. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 12 C DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES IMAGING STUDIES C.1 C.1.a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a more definitive visualization of soft tissue structures, including ligaments, tendons, joint capsule, menisci and joint cartilage structures, than x-ray or Computed Axial Tomography in the evaluation of traumatic or degenerative injuries. The addition of intravenous or intra -articular contrast can enhance definition of selected pathologies. In general, the high field, conventional, MRI provides better resolution. A lower field scan may be indicated when a patient cannot fit into a high field scanner or is too claustrophobic despite sedation. Inadequate resolution on the first scan may require a second MRI using a different technique. A subsequent diagnostic MRI may be a repeat of the same procedure, when the rehabilitation physician, radiologist or surgeon says the study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. All questions in this regard should be discussed with the MRI center and/or radiologist. Ferrous material/metallic objects present in the tissues is a contraindication for the performance of of bone and is used to further evaluate bony masses and suspected fractures not clearly identified on radiographic window evaluation. Instrument scatter -reduction software provides better resolution when metallic artifact is of concern. When ferrous/metallic mat erials are present in the tissues, CT should be ordered rather than MRI. CT examinations entail exposure to ionizing radiation, with associated radiation -related risks. C.1.c Lineal Tomography Not recommended. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 13 C.1.d Bone Scan (Radioisotope Bone Scanning ) 99MTechnecium diphosphonate uptake reflects osteoblastic activity and may be useful in metastatic/primary bone tumors, stress fractures, osteomyelitis, and inflammatory lesions, but cannot distinguish among these entities. It is useful for the investigation of trauma, infection, stress fracture, occult fracture, Charcot joint, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, and suspected neoplastic conditions of the lower extremity. C.1.e Other Radionuclide Scan ning Indium and gallium scans are procedures usually used to help diagnose lesions seen on other diagnostic imaging studies. 67Gallium citrate scans are used to localize tumor, infection, and abscesses. 111Indium -labeled leukocyte scanning is utilized for localization of infection or inflammation. C.1.f Arthrograms Arthograms may be useful in the evaluation of internal derangement of a joint, only when MRI or other tests are contraindicated or not available. Potential complications of this more invasive technique include pain, infection, and allergic reaction s. C.1.g Diagnostic Arthrosco py Refer to Table 1 . Table 1: Criteria for Diagnostic Arthroscopy IF the diagnosis is supported by AND this has been done (if recommended) The following may be appropriate CLINICAL FINDINGS SUBJECTIVE OBJECTIVE IMAGING CONSERVATIVE CARE PROCEDURE Pain and functional limitations continue despite conservative care Imaging is inconclusive Medications AND/ OR Physical therapy Diagnostic Arthroscopy New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 14 OTHER TESTS C.2 The studies below are listed by frequency of use, not importance. C.2.a Electrodiagnostic Testing Electrodiagnostic testing for the knee includes, but is not limited to, Electromyography (EMG ) and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS ). Evaluation of Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP ) is not recommended for conditions of the knee. Electrodiagnostic studies have limited use with knee disorders. It is recommended and preferred that EDS in the out -patient setting be per formed and interpreted by physicians board -certified in Neurology or Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Doppler is of arterial and venous disease in the lower extremity and should be considered prior to the more invasive venogram or arteriogram study. Doppler is less sensitive in detecting deep -vein thrombosis in the calf muscle area. If the test is initially negative, an ultrasound should be repeated 7 days post initial symptoms to rule out popliteal thrombosis. It is also useful for the diagnosis of popliteal mass when MRI is not available or contraindicated. C.2.c Venogram/Arteriogram Venogram/Arteriogram is useful for investigation of vascular injuries or disease, including deep -venous thrombosis. Potential complications may include pain, allergic reaction, and deep -vein thrombosis. OTHER PROCEDURES C.3 C.3.a Joint Aspiration Joint Aspiration is a procedure used when specifically indicated and performed by individuals properly trained in these techniques. This is true at the initial evaluation when history and/or physical examination are of concern for a septic joint or bursitis . Aspiration should not be performed through a n infected area. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 15 Particularly at the knee, aspiration of a large effusion can h elp to decrease pain and speed functional recovery. Persistent or unexplained effusions may be examined for evidence of infection, rheumatologic, or inflammatory processes. The presence of fat globules in the effusion strongly suggests occult fracture. A large hemorrhagic effusion should prompt suspicion that a fracture or ligament tear may be present. D SPECIFIC KNEE INJURY DIAGNOSE S, TESTING, AND TREATMENT CHONDRAL DEFECTS (Cartilage or Cartilage and Bone D.1 Defect s) D.1.a Description/Definition Cartilage or cartilage and bone defect at the articular or meniscal surface of a joint. D.1.b Mechanism of Injury Usually caused by a traumatic knee injury. D.1.c Specific Physical Findings Knee effusion, pain in joint. D.1.d Diagnostic Testing Procedures MRI may show bone bruising, osteochondral lesion, or possibly articular cartilage injury. Radiogr aphs and CT may also be used. Following an acute injury an MRI usually shows bone bruising. D.1.e Non-Operative Treatment Limited indications. The size and extent of the injury should be determined first. This form of therapy is reserved for non - displaced, stable lesions. Immobilization (for acute injury), active and/or passive therapy. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 16 D.1.f Surgical Indications /Operative Treatment Osteochondral Autograft and Autologous Chrondrocyte Implantation (ACI ) are not included on the list of pre-authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Refer to Table 3 for criteria . If a non -operative treatment appro ach is initially recommended, surgery may be indicated after the failure of conservative management. The patient must continue to exhibit the designated objective findings, subjective symptoms and (where applicable) imaging findings. Refer to Table 3 . D.1.g Auto logous Chondrocyte Implantation ( ACI) Exclusion Criteria ACI is not a covered procedure in any of the following circumstances: Lesion that involves any portion of the patellofemoral articular cartilage , bone, or is due to osteochondritis dissec ans.

D.6.d Diagnostic Testing Procedures Radiographs including standing Posterior/Anterior (PA), lateral, tunnel, and skyline views. MRI is the definitive imaging test MRI is sensitive and specific for meniscal tear. However, meniscal MRI is frequently abnormal in asymptomatic injuries. Clinical correlation with history and physical exam findings specific for meniscus injury is critically important. Providers planning treatment should therefore consider the patient's complaints and presence of arthritis on MRI carefully, knowing that not all meniscus tears in the middle aged and older population are related to the patients' c omplaints of pain. MRI arthrograms may be approved to diagnose recurrent meniscal tears particularly after previous surgery . D.6.e Non-Operative Treatment Active and/or passive therapy, bracing. Trial of Manipulation may be attempted for a locked knee. Clinical response should be seen within 2 -3 treatments.

D.11.f Surgical Indications Bursa excision after failure of conservative therapy. D.11.g Operative Treatment Surgical excision of the bursa. D.11.h Post -Operative Therapy Active and/or passive therapy. E THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES, NON -OPERATIVE Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the injured worker. First, patients undergoing therapeutic procedure(s) should be released or returned to mo dified, restricted, or full duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time. Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subjective or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued. Third, providers should provide and d ocument education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self -management of symptoms. In unusual cases where a pat ient is unable to attend an outpatient center, home therapy may be necessary. Home therapy may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. Home therapy i s usually of short duration . New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 34 The following procedures are listed in alphabetical order. ACUPUNCTURE E.1 Acupuncture is a procedure used for the relief of pain and inflammation and there is some scientific evidence to support its use. The exact mode of action is only partially understood. Western medicine studies suggest that acupuncture stimulates the nervous system at the level of the brain, promotes deep relaxation, and affects the release of neurotransmitters. Acupuncture is commonly used as an alternative or in addition to traditional Western pharmaceuticals. While it is commonly used when pain medication is reduced or not tolerated, it may be used as an adjunct to physical rehabilitation and/or surgical intervention to hasten the return of functional activity. Moxibustion and other complementary integrative medicine techniques are often com bined with acupuncture , but have no demonstrated efficacy. No additional reimbursement should be provided for acupuncture combined with moxibustion or other similar adjunctive procedures. Acupuncture must be performed by a professional who is authorized under the Workers' Compensation Laws and duly certified in New York State to provide acupuncture services. Acupuncture with or without electrical stimulation ) is the insertion and removal of filiform needles to stimulate acupoints ( acupuncture points) , with or without the use of electrical current (micro -amperage or milli - amperage) on the needles at the acupuncture site. Needles may be inserted, manipulated and retained for a period of time. Acupuncture can be used to reduce pain, reduce inflammation, increase blood flow, increase range of motion, decrease the side effect of medication -induced nausea, promote relaxatio n in an anxious patient, and reduce muscle spasm. Indications include joint pain, joint stiffness, soft tissue pain and inflammation, paresthesia, post -surgical pain relief, muscle spasm, and scar tissue pain. Time to produce effect: 3 to 6 treatments Frequency: 1 to 3 times per week Optimum duration: 1 month Maximum d uration: 10 treatments Total Time Frames for Acupuncture and Acupuncture with Electrical Stimulation : Time frames are not meant to be applied to each of the above sections separately. The time frames are to be applied to all acupuncture treatments regardless of the type or combination of therapies being provided. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 35 BIOFEEDBACK E.2 Not rec ommended. INJECTIONS -THERAPEUTIC E.3 Description : Therapeutic injections involve the delivery of anesthetic and/or anti -inflammatory medications to the painful structure. Therapeutic injections have many potential benefits. Ideally, a therapeutic injection will: (a) reduce inflammation in a specific target area; (b) relieve secondary muscle spasm; (c) allow a break from pain; and (d) support therapy directed to functional recovery. Diagnostic and therapeutic injections should be used early and selectively to establish a diagnosis and support rehabilitation. If injections are overused or used outside the context of a monitored rehabilitation pro gram, they may be of significantly less value. Contraindications : General contraindications include local or systemic infection, bleeding disorders, allergy to medications used and patient refusal. Specific contraindications may appl y to individual injections. E.3.a Soft tissue and Joint Injections Soft tissue and joint injections may be performed as analgesic or anti-inflammatory procedures. Injections into the tendon are not recommended . Frequency: Not more than 2 to 3 times annually. Usually 1 or 2 injections adequate. A minimum of 3 weeks interval between injections is recommended. Time to produce effect: Immediate with local anesthe tic, or within 3 days with corticosteroids. Optimum/maximum duration: Limited to 3 injections annually to the same site. E.3.b Trigger Point Injections Not recommended. E.3.c Prolotherapy (also known as sclerotherapy ) Not recommended. E.3.d Protein Rich Plasma (PRP ) Not recommended. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 36 E.3.e Intra -Capsular Acid Salts Intra -Capsular Acid Salts (also known as Viscosupplementation ) is a form of treatment for osteoarthritis or degenerative changes in the knee joint. It is recommended that these injections be considered a therapeutic alternative in patients who have failed non-pharmac ological and analgesic treatment, and particularly, if non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drug treatment is contraindicated or surgery is not an option. The utility of viscosupplementation in severe osteoarthritis and its efficacy beyond 6 months is not well known. Time to produce effect: One series of injections , per product instructions . Frequency: If the first use is associated with decreased symptoms and increased function, repeat us e may be considered after 6 months if symptoms recur. Optimum/maximum duration: Varies. Efficacy beyond 6 months is not well known. MEDICATION S E.4 Medication use in the treatment of knee injuries is appropriate for controlling acute pain and inflammation. Use of medications will vary widely due to the spectrum of injuries . All drugs should be used according to patient needs. A thorough medication history , including use of alternative and over - the- counter medicatio ns should be performed at the time of the initial visit and updated periodically. Treatment for pain control is initially accomplished with Acetaminophen and/or NSAIDS . The patient should be educated regarding the interaction with prescription and over -the-counter medications as well as the contents of over -the-counter herbal products. The following are listed in alphabetical order. E.4.a Acetaminophen Acetaminophen is an effective analgesic with antipyretic but not anti-inflammatory activity. Acetaminophen is generally well tolerated, causes little or no gastrointestinal irritation, and is not associated with ulcer formation. Acetaminophen has been associated with liver toxicity when the recommended daily dose is exceeded or in patients who chronically use alcohol. Patients may not realize that many over -the-counter preparations may contain New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 37 Acetaminophen . The total daily dose of Acetaminophen should not exceed 4 grams per 24 -hour period from all sources, including narcotic -Acetaminophen combination preparations. Patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks per day are at greate r risk for liver toxicity, and consideration should be given to the use of other analgesics or limiting the Acetaminophen dose to 2 grams per 24 -hour period from all sources. Monitoring liver function via blood testing for use beyond 10 days is advisable. Recommendations: Acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs , although evidence suggests it is modestly less efficacious. Acetaminophen is recommended for treatment of knee pain , particularly for those with contraindications for NSAIDs . Optimum Duration: 7 to 10 days. Maximum Duration: Chronic use as indicated on a case - by-case basis. E.4.b Minor Tranquilizer /Muscle Relaxants Not recommended. E.4.c Narcotics Narcotics s hould be primarily reserved for the treatment of severe knee pain. In mild -to-moderate cases of knee pain, narcotic medication should be used cautiously on a case -by-case basis. Adverse effec ts include respiratory depression, the development of physical and psychological dependence, and impaired alertness. This medication has physically addictive properties and withdrawal symptoms may follow abrupt discontinuation. Narcotic medications should be prescribed with strict time, quantity, and duration guidelines, and with definitive cessation parameters. Pain is subjective in nature and should be evaluated using a scale to rate effectiveness of the narcotic prescribed. Any use beyond the maximum should be documented and justified based on the diagnosis and/or invasive procedures. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 38 Optimum Duration: 3 to 7 days. Maximum Duration: 2 weeks. Use beyond two weeks is acceptable in appropriate cases. Any use beyond the maximu m should be documented and justified based on the diagnosis and/or invasive procedures. E.4.d Nonsteroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID s) Nonsteroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are useful for pain and inflammation. In mild cases, they may be the only drugs required for analgesia. There are several classes of NSAIDS, and the response of the individual patient to a specific medication is unpredictable. For this r eason, a range of NSAIDS may be tried in each case with the most effective preparation being continued. Patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. The US Food and Drug Administration advises that many NSAIDS may have an inc reased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, stroke, which can be fatal and increased risk of serious adverse GI events including bleeding, ulceration and perforation of the stomach and intestines. Generally, older gene ration (COX -1, non -selective) NSAIDS are recommended as first -line medications . Second -line medications should generally include one of the other COX -1 medications. While COX -2 selective agents generally have been recommended as either third - or fourth -line medications to use when there is a risk of gastrointestinal complications, misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine 2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are also gastro - protective. COX -2 selective agents may still b e used for those with contraindications to other medications, especially those with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or past history of peptic ulcer disease. Selective COX -2 inhibitors should be used with great caution in patients wi th ischemic heart disease and/or stroke and avoided in patients with risk factors for coronary heart disease. Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. In these patients, it appears to be safest to use Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy. If needed, NSAIDS that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. Even a relati ve lack of COX -2 selectivity does not completely eliminate the risk of cardiovascular events, and in that regard, all drugs in the NSAID spectrum should New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 39 only be prescribed after thorough consideration of risk benefit balance. Patients who receive COX -2 inh ibitors should take the lowest effective dose for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, aspirin should be taken 2 hours before or at least 8 hours after the NSAID. (Antman 07). Recommendations: NSAID s are recommended for the treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, or post -operative knee pain . Over -the counter (OTC) agents may suffice and may be tried first. Frequency/Duration: In most patients with acute knee pain , scheduled dosage, rather than as needed, is generally preferable. As needed (PRN) prescriptions may be reasonable for mild, moderate or chronic knee pain . Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. Those patients at substantially increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, who also have indications for NSAIDs , should be considered for concomitant prescriptions of cytoprotective medications , particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. Individuals considered being at elevated risk include history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. There are four commonly used cytoprotective classes of drugs: lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole). There is not believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. There also are combination products of NSAIDs /misoprostol (e.g., arthrotec). Frequency/Duration: Frequency as recommended. Discontinuation: Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of the NSAID. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 40 E.4.e Topical Drug Delivery Topical drug delivery may b e an alternative treatment of locali zed musculoskeletal disorders. It is necessary that all topical agents be used with strict instructions for application as well as maximum number of applications per day to obtain the desired benefit and avoid potential toxicity. As with all medications , patient selection must be rigorous to select those patients with the high est probability of compliance. E.4.e.i Topical Salicylates and Nonsalicylates Topical Salicylates and Nonsalicylates have been shown to be effective in relieving pain in acute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions. Topical salicylates and nonsalicylates achieve tissue levels that are potentially therapeutic, at least with regard to COX inhibition. Other than local skin reactions, the side effects of therapy are minimal, although not nonexistent, and the usual contraindications to use of these compounds need to be considered. Local skin reactions are rare and systemic effects even less common. Their use in patients receiving warfarin therapy may result in alterations in bleeding time. Overall, the low level of systemic absorption can be advantageous , allowing the topical use of these medications when systemic administration is relatively contraindicated such as is the case in patients with hypertension, cardiac failure, or renal insufficiency. Optimal duration: 1-2 week s to determine effectiveness. Continued use shou ld be evaluated every 3 months. E.4.e.ii Capsaicin Capsaicin is another medication option for topical drug use in lower extremity injury. Capsaicin offers a safe and effective alternative to systemic NSAID therapy. Although it is quite safe, effec tive use of capsaicin is limited by the local stinging or burning sensation that typically dissipates with regular use, usually after the first 7 to 10 days of treatment. Patients should be advised to apply the cream on the affected area with a plastic gl ove or cotton applicator and to avoid inadvertent contact with eyes and mucous membranes. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 41 Optimal duration: 1-2 weeks to determine effectiveness. Continued use should be evaluated every 3 months. individual cases. E.4.f Tramadol Tramadol is us eful in relief of lower extremity pain and has been shown to provide pain relief equivalent to that of commonly prescribed NSAIDS . Although Tramadol may cause impaired alertness, it is generally well tolerated, does not cause gastrointesti nal ulceration, or exacerbate hypertension or congestive heart failure. Tramadol should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or who are taking medication that may lower the seizure threshold, such as MAO inhibit ors, SSRIs, and tricyclic antidepressants. This medication has physically addictive properties and withdrawal may follow abrupt discontinuation and is not recommended for patients with prior opioid addiction. Maximum duration: 2 weeks. Use beyond 2 weeks is acceptable in appropriate cases. ORTHOTICS AND Orthotics would be used when there is need to normalize weight -bearing, facilitate better motion response, stabilize a joint with insufficient muscle or proprioceptive/reflex competencies, to protect subacute conditions as needed during movement, and correct biomechanical problems. Time to produce effect: 1 to 3 sessions (includes wearing schedule evaluation) . Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week . Optimum/maximum duration: 4 sessions of e valuation, casting, fitting, and re -evaluation . New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 42 E.5.b Orthotic/Prost hetic Training Orthotic/Prosthetic Training is the skilled instruction (preferably by qualified providers) in the proper use of orthotic devices and/or prosthetic limbs including stump preparation, donning and doffing limbs, instruction in wearing schedule and orthotic/prosthetic maintenance training. Training can include gait, mobility, transfer and self -care techniques. Time to produce effect: 2 to 6 sessions . Frequency: 3 times per week . Optimum/maximum duration: 2 to 4 months . E.5.c Splints or Adaptive Equipment Design, fabrication and/or modification indications include the need to control neurological and orthopedic injuries for reduced stress during functional activities and modify tasks through instruction in the use of a device or physical modification of a device, which reduces stress on the injury. Equipment should improve safety and reduce risk of re -injury. This includes high and low technology assistive options such a s workplace modifications, computer interface or seating, crutch or walker training, and self -care aids. Time to produce effect: Immediate . Frequency: 1 to 3 sessions or as indicated to establish independent use . Optimum/maximum duration: 1 to 3 sessions . RETURN TO WORK E.6 Communication is essential between the patient, employer and physician to determine appropriate restrictions and return to work dates. It is the responsibility of the physician to provide clear , concise restrictions, and it is the employer's responsibility to determine if temporary duties can be provided within the restrictions. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 43 E.6.a Establishment of Activity Level Restrictions For lower extremity injuries, the following should be addr essed when describing the patient's activity level: Lower body postures such as squatting, kneeling, crawling, stooping, or climbing should include duration and frequency. Ambulatory level for distance, frequency and terrain should be specified. Standing d uration and frequency with regard to balance issues. Use of adaptive devices or equipment for proper ergonomics to enhance capacities can be included. E.6.b Compliance with Activity Restrictions In some cases, compliance with restriction of activity levels may require a complete jobsite evaluation, a functional capacity evaluation (FCE ), or other special testing THERAPY -ACTIVE E.7 Most of the following active therapies have some evidence and are based on the philosophy that therapeutic exercise and/or activity are beneficial for restoring flexibility, strength, endurance, function, range of motion, and can alleviate discomfort. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the individual to complete a specific exercise or ta sk. This form of therapy requires supervision from a therapist or medical provider such as verbal, visual and/or tactile instruction(s). At times, the provider may help stabilize the patient or guide the movement pattern but the energy required to comple te the task is predominately executed by the patient. Patients should be instructed to continue active therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Home exercise can include exercise with or without m echanical assistance or resistance and functional activities with assistive devices. The following active therapies are listed in alphabetical order .

Maximum duration: 2 weeks THERAPY -PASSIVE E.8 Therapy -Passive includes those treatment modalities that do not require energy expenditure on the part of the patient. They are principally effective during the early phases of treatment and are directed at controlling symptoms such as pain, inflammation and swelling . They should be use adjunctively with active therapies to help co ntrol swelling, pain and inflammation during the rehabilitation process. They may be used intermittently as deem ed appropriate or regularly if there are specific goals with objectively measured functional improvements during treatment. While protocols for specific diagnoses and post -surgical conditions may warrant durations of treatment beyond those listed as \"maximum,\" factors such as exacerbation of symptoms, re -injury, interrupted continuity of care, and co -morbidities may extend durations of care. Hav ing specific goals with objectively measured functional improvement during treatment can support extended durations of care. It is recommended that if after 3 to 5 visits no treatment effect is observed, alternative treatment interventions, further diagno stic studies or further consultations should be pursued. The following passive therapies and modalities a re listed in alphabetical order with the exception of kinesiotaping, taping or strapping, which has been placed last to pres erve the original numbering of the other therapies. E.8.a Continuous Passive Movement (CPM ) Continuous Passive Movement ) is a form of passive motion using specialized machinery that acts to move a joint and may also pump blood and edema fluid away from the joint and periarticular tissues.

New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 52 THERAPY: ONGOING MAINTENANCE CARE E.9 A maintenance program of PT or OT may be indicated in certain situations , after the determination of MMI, when tied to maintenance of functional status. Although the current body of scientific evidence as reviewed does not support t he routine use of this intervention, maintenance therapy modalities may be indicated in certain situations in order to maintain functional status, without which an objective deterioration of fun ction has been previ ously observed and documented in the medic al record. Specific objective goals should be identified and measured in order to support the need for ongoing maintenance care. Progressively longer trials of therapeutic withdrawal are to be attempted to ascertain whether therapeutic goals can be maintai ned in the absence of clinical interventions. Within a year and annually thereafter, a trial without maintenance treatment should be instituted. The care of chronic knee symptoms should include an ongoing patient self -management program performed by the p atient regularly and a self -directed pain management program initiated as indicated: o An ongoing clinically appropriate self -management program, typically in dependent, home -based and self -directed, developed jointly by the provider and patient , should be implemented to encourage physical activity and/or work activities despite residual pain, with the goal of preserving function. o In addition to the self -management program, a self -directed pain management plan should be developed which can be initiated by the patient in the event that symptoms worsen and function decreases. If deterioration of ability to maintain function is documented, reinstatement restitution of ongoing maintenance may be acceptable. Frequency: Maximum up to 10 visits/year, after the deter mination MMI, according to objectively documented maintenance of functional status. No variance from the maximum frequency is permitted. New York State Workers' Compensation Board New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines Second Edition, January 14, 2013 53 F THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES, OPERATIVE All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course and diagnostic tests . A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). It is imper ative to rule out non -physiologic modifiers of pain presentation or non -operative conditions mimicking radiculopathy or instability (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, piriformis syndrome, myofascial pain, scleratogenous or sympathetically mediated pain syndrome s, sacroiliac dysfunction, psychological conditions, etc.) prior to consideration of elective surgical intervention. In addition, operative treatment is indicated when the natural history of surgically treated lesions is better than the nat ural history for non -operatively treated lesions. All patients being considered for surgical intervention should first undergo a comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal examination to identify mechanical pain generators that may respond to non -surgical techniq ues or may be refractory to surgical intervention. Structured rehabilitation interventions should be strongly considered post - operative in any patient not making expected functional progress within three weeks post -operative.
