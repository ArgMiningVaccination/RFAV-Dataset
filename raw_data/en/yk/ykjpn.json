They work with patients on preventative health measures. They examine patients, obtain medical histories, prescribe medications, and order, perform, and interpret diagnostic tests. Surgeons are doctors who perform operations to treat injuries, diseases, and deformities. Medical schools are highly competitive. Most applicants have a bachelor's degree when applying. After four years of medical school, almost all medical school graduates enter into a residency program in their specialty of interest. \"My Michigan Tech education prepared me well for the practice of medicine. Rote memorization of fact will only get you so far, but the critical thinking skills built into the MTU curriculum, with its strong engineering background, fostered a problem-solving ability that I continue to use every day in the treatment of patients.\" What's the Difference? Doctor of Medicine/Allopathic Medicine (MD) The branch of medicine in which doctors and other health care professionals treat symptoms and diseases using drugs, radiation, or surgery. Also called conventional medicine or Western medicine. Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) The branch of medicine in which doctors practice a whole-person approach and focus on looking beyond the symptoms to understand how lifestyle and environmental factors may impact a patient's wellbeing. Doctor of Naturopathic (ND) The branch of medicine in which doctors practice prevention, treatment and optimal health through the use of alternative and therapeutic methods. Naturopathic doctors strive to find the cause of disease by understanding the body, mind, and spirit of the patient. How to Apply First, choose from the three different types of degrees a doctor can earn. Your decision will dictate what schools you apply to. The application process also varies. Although you can select any undergraduate major, most medical schools require that you take required classes, or prerequisites, in order to apply. The required courses are different depending on the school. Students are encouraged to use these resources to check on admissions requirements for specific medical schools. But you should also check directly with the school. [MD Programs: Medical School Admissions is a [guide of recommended courses](/pre-health/preparation/pre-medical/courses.html) to take at Michigan Tech in preparation for medical school. Students who wish to apply to Medical School must take the [Medical College Admission Test (MCAT)](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/taking-mcat-exam/register-mcat-exam/). Students need to do well on the MCAT in order to be a competitive applicant. The MCAT is only offered during certain months of the year. [MCAT Essentials Guide](https://students-residents.aamc.org/media/11711/download) [MCAT medical schools may also require the online CASPer test. This is a situational judgment test that can be taken on any computer with internet and a webcam. This test evaluates elements of social intelligence and professionalism, such as empathy and problem solving. [Learn more about CASPer here](https://takealtus.com/). It is important to check program requirements to see if any program you are applying for requires this additional test. In addition to a high MCAT score, students should aim for both a high cumulative GPA and a high BCMP (biology, chemistry, math, and physics). Most medical schools also require a minimum of three letters of recommendation, a written personal statement or essay, and if you are selected, an in-person interview. Many medical schools expect applicants to have had significant exposure to clinical medicine. This can be in the form of job shadowing, volunteering and/or employment. Medical schools also take your extracurricular activities into consideration, such as non-clinical volunteering, research, leadership experiences and other activities that you do outside of schoolwork. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) offers a [premed navigator](https://students-residents.aamc.org/navigator/) featuring important topics, resources, and tips to further assist you in your preparation work. MSU College of Human Medicine has partnered with Michigan Tech to provide early assurance of medical school admission for our selected students! This program is for undergraduate students interested in becoming a physician in an underserved region or students interested in working with the underserved population. Juniors and Seniors are open to apply. Preference for EAP admission will be given to Michigan Tech students who are the first generation in their families to attend college, or graduated from a low-income high school, are eligible for need-based grants, and to those who express interest in a high-need medical specialty area. Students will be selected for interviews in March and can be accepted as early as July. "}
