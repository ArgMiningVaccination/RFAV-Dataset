Naturopathic Licensing In terms licensing, currently, naturopathic physicians are licensed in 14 states, Washington DC and Puerto rico. Licensed naturopathic physicians, trained as primary care providers attend a 4 year doctoral program at an accredited Naturopathic Medical school and take postdoctoral board exams. Dr. Niebrzydowski is a board certified naturopathic physician. There are others who call themselves naturopathic doctors that are lay naturopaths who complete a 6 month on-line course. There are vast differences in the level of education. As Wisconsin and Michigan are not yet licensed for naturopathic medicine, Dr. Niebrzydowski will not act as a primary care doctor, she will not diagnose or treat disease per se. She will work closely with the patient's primary care doctor to provide the best adjunctive care possible. It is important in unlicensed states, to ask when shopping for a naturopath if they have gone to an accredited medical school or not. Dr. Niebrzydowski is maintaining her license in the state of Oregon as a naturopathic physician while she is practicing in Wisconsin. Dr. Niebrzydowski has chosen to practice in Wisconsin because Michigan is not licensed for acupuncture either, She currently holds a license as an acupuncturist in Wisconsin. "}
