Anthropometry: The use of body measurements to assess nutritional status in an individual. Body measurements include: age, sex, weight, height, oed ema (fluid retention) and mid upper arm circumference . Complementary feeding : Giving a child other foods (solid or semi -solid) in addition to breastfeeding or replacement feeding to meet the bab y's nutrient requirements from 6 months of age. Exclusive b reastfeeding : Feeding a child through only breastfeeding, giving no other liquids or solids, not even water, with the exception of prescribed drops or syrups consisting of vitamins and mineral supplements or medicines, and expressed breastmilk . Food secu rity: When all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Household food security: Access by a household to a mounts of food of the right quantity and quality to satisfy the dietary needs of all its members throughout the year. Low birth weight : A birth weight of less than 2500gm, whether pre -term or small for date. Malnutrition: An abnormal physiological cond ition caused by deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in energy, protein and/or other nutrients. Mixed feeding : Feeding both breastmilk and other foods or liquids to a child under 6 months of age. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 7 Department of Health Moderate acute malnutrition: Also known as wasting , is defined by a weight -for-height indicator between -3 and -2 z-scores (standard deviations) of the international standard or by a mid -upper arm circumference (MUAC) between 11.5 cm and 12.5 cm. Nutrition : Study of food and its nutrients; its functions, actions, interactions and balance in relation to health and disease Severe Acute Malnutrition: A weight -for-height measurement of 70% or less below the median or 3 SD or more below the mean international reference values, the presence of bilateral pitti ng oedema, or a mid -upper arm circumference of less than 115 millimetres in children six - 60 months old. Stunting: Past chronic malnutrition, where low weight -for-age has eventually caused low height -for-age, but weight -for-height may be normal. Targete d supplementary feeding: A type of intervention that usually provides nutritional supplements to selected group of children, pregnant and lactating women and other nutritionally vulnerable groups. Therapeutic feeding : The feeding mechanism of children wh o are severely acute malnourished Under -nutrition: When the body contains lower than normal amounts of one or more nutrients, i.e. deficiencies in macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 8 Department of Health Foreword Sound nutrition is a basic human right and a prerequis ite for the attainment of a person's full intellectual and physical potential. Nutrition is also the outcome of development processes in society and not simply a service to be delivered. Improving nutrition is thus an ethical imperative, a sound economic i nvestment and a key element of health care at all levels. The Department of Health plays a key role in developing and implementing nutrition programmes and services . In South Africa, malnutrition is manifested in both under -nutrition and over -nutrition. Th is paradox of over - and under -nutrition, as well as the range of micronutrient deficiencies of public health significance, requires complemen tary strategies and an integrated approach to ensure optimal nutrition for all South Africans. The situation is fur ther complicated by the many causes of malnutrition, which could be direct factors such as inadequate food intake, or underlying factors such as household food insecurity or even basic factors such as a lack of resources. Research published in the Lancet Nutrition Series of 2008 showed that maternal and child malnutrition are responsible , globally, for more than one third of all deaths of children under 5 years old . This shows the importance of early and integrated intervention strateg ies targeted at malnu trition in pregnant women and children under two years old for healthy development. Missing the \"window of opportunity\" - the thousand - day period from conception to two years of age - to improve nutrition can result in long -term permanent damage. There is a clear window of opportunity for addressing nutrition, and after age two, this window closes rapidly and the effects of undernutrition are largely irreversible. It is therefore critical that interventions to prevent undernutrition reach mothers and young children during this period. In addition , it is more effective to prevent child undernutrition than to treat it, and therefore investments aimed at improving nutrition should focus on the thousand -day period. This five -year roadmap for Nutrition for South Africa seeks to direct nutrition -related activities in the health sector to the achievement of the sector's four focus areas , which are : increasing life expectancy; decreasing maternal and child mortality; combating HIV and AIDS and decreasing the burden of disease from Tuberculosis; and strengthening health system effectiveness. The Roadmap draws on the recommendations of recent reviews of the implementation of the Integrated Nutrition Programme1 notably the Landscape Analysis .2 It provides a framework t o reposition nutrition and nutrition -related issues and actions prominently in the health care system with particular reference to the Strategic Plan for Maternal, Neonatal, Child and Women's Health (MNCWH) and Nutrition in South Africa3. Recognizing the m ultisectoral nature of the nutrition challenge, and the many role players in the public and the private sector s, the Roadmap also highlights the role of the health sector in supporting multisectoral actions on nutrition .

Ms M P Matsoso Director -General: Health Date: 11 March 2013 Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 10 Department of Health 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background One of the major goals of the South African government's Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) for 2009 -2014 is to improve the health p rofile of all South Africans. Th e Strategic Plan of the National Department of Health ( NDOH ) provides a framework of the implementation of the 10 Point Plan of the health sector for 2009 -2014, which is aimed at creating a well -functioning health system cap able of producing improved health outcomes. The outcome -based approach adopted by government to accelerate the implementation of the NDOH Strategic plan guides the development of specific strategies in the sector . The four focus areas of the Health Negotia ted Service Delivery Agreement are: increasing life expectancy; decreasing maternal and child mortality ; combating HIV and AIDS and decreasing the burden of disease from Tuberculosis ; and strengthening health system effectiveness. This five -year Roadm ap for Nutrition for South Africa seeks to direct nutrition -related activities in the health sector to achieve the sector's four focus areas. The strategy draws on the recommendations of recent reviews of the implementation of the Integrated Nutrition Prog ramme1 notably the Landscape Analysis .2 It provides a framework to reposition nutrition and nutrition - related issues and actions prominently in the health care system3 with particular reference to the Strategic Plan for Maternal, Neonatal, Child and Women' s Health (MNCWH) and Nutrition in South Africa . Recognizing the multisectoral nature of the nutrition challenge , and the many role players in the public and the private sector, the roadmap also highlights the role of the health sector in supporting multise ctoral action s on nutrition. Malnutrition undermines progress towards the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) in particular those goals related to poverty, maternal health, child mortality and education4, and indirectly to the remaining MDGs . With regard to the four outcome goals of the South African health sector, malnutrition contributes directly and indirectly to lower life expectancy particularly through its impact on child and maternal mortality and its contribution to the burden of chronic diseases . Malnutrition also hastens disease progression among people with HIV and TB, and puts added pressure on health care services. The costs of under -nutrition are pervasive, spans generations and contributes to deepening poverty. Proven cost -effective nutriti on intervention strategies exist, which, if implemented on a large scale , could significantly reduce mortality and morbidity and low er health care costs. The next section provides a brief description of the nutrition situation in South Africa, and highligh ts the need for a multisectoral approach to addressing this key development challenge. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 11 Department of Health 1.2 Current nutrition situation in South Africa South Africa is in a nutrition transition in which under -nutrition , notably stunting and micronutrient deficiencies , co-exist with a rising incidence of overweight and obesity and the associated consequences such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes . Within the context of the HIV and AIDS pandemic and food insecurity, the high prevalence of under -nutriti on, micronutrient deficiencies and emergent over -nutrition presents a complex series of challenges. Undernutrition has stayed roughly constant in South Africa since the early 1990s. Despite our relatively high per capita income, we have rates of child stun ting (18%) comparable to low - income countries in its region, and higher rates of stunting than lower -income countries in other regions. While some indicators show improvement, several conditions seem to have worsened over the past decade.5 In addition; children's nutritional status varies considerably among the nine provinces and possibly within each province. This has bearing on targeting and prioritization for interventions and resource allocation. A similar pattern emerged for the prevalence of underwe ight, with almost one out of ten children being affected national ly. Wasting is less prevalent, affecting one out of twenty children nationally . In line with global trends, there is an alarming increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among all South Africans .6 Overweight affects 4.8% of children and is highest (5.5%) in urban formal areas. About 26.6% of women are overweight (excluding obesity) and 24.9% are obese. The South African National Youth Health Behaviour Survey reported that 20% and 5 % of grades 8 to 11 learners were overweight and obese respectively21. While substantial progress has been recorded with regard to folate and iodine status, findings on other micronutrient deficiencies among women and children from the N ational Food Consum ption Survey (NFCS) indicate that problems persist and nutritional status may be deteriorating. About 63.6% of children between 1 and 9 years were v itamin A deficien t, and the prevalence of vitamin A in women of child bearing age at 27.2%. The prevalence of anaemia in children and women was at 27.9% and 29.4% respectively. About forty five percent ( 45.3% ) of children were found to be zinc deficient. South Africa has essentially achieved the virtual elimination of Iodine Deficiency Disorder s (IDD). At bot h the national and provincial level there has been a consistent increase since 1998 in the percentage of households using and consuming salt with an iodine content of more than 15ppm. However, the Limpopo Province needs special attention given that it had both the lowest mean iodine concentration at 20ppm and the lowest percentage of households with adequately iodized salt (45.3%). 1.3 Global imperatives in scaling up nutrition In January 2008 the Lancet published a series of articles defining the magnit ude and consequences of under nutrition and demonstrat ed the availability and potential benefits of proven interventions. They focus ed on pregnancy and early childhood - from conception to 24 months of age but these findings can also be extended to the chr onically ill. These interventions include : Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 12 Department of Health empowering women so they can pursue optimal nutrition during pregnancy and when children are born (including exclusive breast feeding, ante -natal supplements, appropriate complementary feeds from age six month s and food -related hygiene) ; enabling adequate intake of vitamins and minerals among those most in need through diverse diets, fortified foods and supplements ; and ensuring that those who are at risk of malnutrition can access and benefit from the food and nutrients they need for growth and good health (through special attention to the development of communities at risk of malnutrition, nutritional management of infections and therapeutic feeding of individuals who are malnourished). A Framework for Scaling up Nutrition was developed in 2010 to put nutrition back on the international agenda. A Road Map to Scale Up Nutrition (SUN) was then developed as a key contribution to realizing the Millennium Development Goals. The Road Map proposes a multi - stakeholder global effort to Scale Up Nutrition (SUN). The SUN Road Map is based on a Framework for Action to Scale -Up Nutrition (SUN Framework), released in April 2010 .7 The Copenhagen Consensus of 2012 on hunger and malnutrition also reiterated the scaling u p of cost-effective interventions such as breastfeeding as the best investment in reducing childhood undernutrition22. 1.4 How Nutrition contributes to Health Sector Priorities Increasing life expectancy Worldwide, malnutrition is associated, directly or indirectly , with 60% of all child deaths. Country - specific data for South Africa on the contribution of stunting and wasting to the burden of disease (BOD) are not available, but available studies suggest that malnutrition also plays a n important role in morbidity and mortality in South Africa . A recent Child Healthcare Problem Identification Programme (CHIP) audit of child deaths in participating hospitals found that about 63% of under fives who died were malnourished, with the majority of them being infe cted with HIV.8 Appropriate management of HIV, including nutritional management, can avert the deterioration and eventual death of these patients.9 The Lancet Nutrition Series concluded that known interventions could reduce stunting at 35 months of age by 36%; mortality between birth and 36 months by 25% and disability -adjusted life years ( DALYs ) IUGR ) and micronutrient deficiencies by 25%. If these estimates are applied to South African dat a, the large -scale implementation of key evidence -based nutrition interventions country -wide could save an estimated 18000 deaths among under five children, and contribute significantly to lowering maternal and neonatal mortality . Decreasing Infant and Maternal mortality The prevention of maternal and child undernutrition is a long -term investment that will benefit the present generation and their children .10 Undernutrition begins with the mother which may lead to Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 13 Department of Health health problems for the mother and i ntrauterine growth restrictions .11 Iron deficiency is a risk factor for maternal mortality, responsible for 115, 000 maternal deaths per year globally , which is 20% of maternal mortality .12 The very high mortality and disease burden resulting from these nutrition -related factors make a compelling case for the urgent implementation of proven interventions. The Lancet series identified five key evidence -based interventions, namely breastfeeding promotion , which could save 22% of children from dying if initi ated within the first hour of delivery ; complementary feeding promotion and strategies with or without food supplements; micronutrient interventions which include fortification and supplementation such as Vitamin A supplementation which can reduc e deaths f rom measles and diarrhoea by 50% and 40% respectively, and overall mortality by 25 percent13; interventions for maternal nutrition , especially iron -folate supplementation which can result in a 73% reduction in the risk of anaemia at term ; as well as interv entions for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition .14 Combating HIV and AIDS and decreasing the burden of disease from Tuberculosis Nutritional status affects the progression of the HIV infection and the infection negatively affects the nutritional s tatus of the patient because it depletes the body's nutrient stores. A good nutritional status is related to the delayed progression of the infection to the AIDS stage . Stabilising and maintaining good nutritional status is therefore essential in the manag ement of HIV.15 Malnutrition and TB are mutually reinforcing. Both undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies increase the risk of tuberculosis. TB leads to reduction in appetite, nutrient malabsorption, and altered metabolism , leading to wasting . It has been found that malnourished tuberculosis patients have delayed recovery and higher mortality rates than well -nourished patients.16 Improving health care effectiveness Improving the nutritional status of the population will benefit the health system and reduce the economic burden of medical treatment and care in a number of ways. It can reduc e the demand for curative treatment, and thus the number of patients , shorten the duration of hospital stay s and improve recovery rates.17 1.5 Assessment of curre nt nutrition interventions In 2009, South Africa undertook the Landscape Analysis assessments in order to assess the country's readiness to accelerate action in nutrition. It used a health systems -based conceptual framework to guide a review process that i dentif ied bottlenecks and gaps in policies and programme implementation. The following challenges were ide ntified during the assessments .2 Stakeholders had different views on the major causes and priority nutritional problems facing South Africa. The perce ption was that nutrition action consists of the provision of food parcels and food gardens. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 14 Department of Health Policies were not streamlined to focus on key nutritional problems as identified through national studies and routinely collected data. There is a need to consol idate existing guidelines into a small number of intervention programmes, to avoid continued implementation of ill - defined nutrition activities . Lack of a multisectoral nutrition working group, which would include various departments and partners (e.g. ind ustry, academia, civil society, development partners, etc.) and would play a key role in advocating for greater attention to nutrition focusing on priority interventions, and would promote better coordination among the different role players. Lack of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan and nutrition surveillance system and poor use of information for decision making. While there has been an increase in budgetary allocation to nutrition, it remains less than 0.3% of the health budg et, and the bulk of funding is spent on supplementary feeding . Furthermore, the funds are not always available for nutrition interventions due to reallocation to other priorities. Further analysis is needed to determine what proportion of the allocated nutrition budget is actually spent on priority nutrition interventions. There is a concern that the returns on the nutrition expenditures are not as high as it could be, due to inappropriate interventions, and weak implementation. Major barriers in scaling up nutritional i nterventions in South Africa include : Inadequate implementation of evidence -based nutritional interventions that have high impact on women and children. Lack of community -based nutritional interventions and under -utilization of services offered by commun ity-based organizations . Shortage of human resources and i nequitable distribution especially at the districts and facility level . Very little progress has been made to ensure the availability and equitable distribution of nutrition workers who have skills to work closely with communities within the district health system. There are concerns that reliance on other cadres of health workers to deliver nutrition services will continue to result in low coverage and quality of such interventions. A lack of copie s of guidelines and policies, and essential supplies such as zinc supplements in some health facilities . Important nutrition issues, strategies and interventions are not included in the pre- service training programmes , as well as continuous professional d evelopment of health care personnel, including doctors and nurses. Poor q uality of information systems - review of some of the DHIS nutrition -related indicators suggest that there may be significant under -reporting of malnutrition, making it difficult to identify areas in priority need of intervention . 1.6 A multi -sectoral approach in addressing nutrition problems Within the context of the HIV and AIDS pandemic, widespread poverty and persistent food insecurity ,18 the high prevalence of under -nutrition, m icronutrient deficiencies and over -nutrition presents a complex series of challenges. This situation requires complementary strategies and Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 15 Department of Health an integrated approach to ensure optimal nutrition for all South Africans. Routine o perations of government throug h existing sector -specific actions alone will not successfully and effectively address malnutrition.19 High level political will and sustained commitment to improving the nutrition security for all people of South Africa through a multisectoral approach th at involves several government departments at national, provincial and local level, the private sector and civil society, is needed. Such an approach can improve nutrition in three ways. Firstly, malnutrition can be prevented over time, by intensifying ac tion on the underlying causes of malnutrition, including inadequate income, food insecurity, unsafe water and poor sanitation, as well as gender inequality. Secondly, integrating specific nutrition goals into programmes in relevant sectors, such as educati on, agriculture, rural development and social development, and including at least one nutrition outcome indicator for each of those sectors can also move the nutrition agenda forward. Thirdly, the unintended consequences on nutrition of national and inte rnational economic and social policies must also be monitored, to minimize potential negative consequences and improve policy coherence. The health sector play s a leading role in addressing immediate causes of malnutrition by intensifying the implementati on of targeted nutrition interventions with demonstrated effect as highlighted in the Lancet Series. These types of interventions are usually referred to as \"short routes\" to reducing undernutrition. The health sector can also play a key role in advocatin g and providing technical support for such multisectoral action to achieve the nation's nutrition goals. Addressing malnutrition will contribute directly and indirectly to achieving the MDGs as well as the national development goals, including the four pri ority goals of the health sector. 2 RATIONALE FOR NUTRITI ON ROADMAP The Integrated Nutrition Programme has provided a broad framework for the reorientation of nutrition services in South Africa since 199 4, and significant gains were made in this perio d, particularly in the development of specific policies, and the implementation of micronutrient strategies . 1 There is now a need to focus on priority target groups and interventions that can have the biggest impact, namely in the life -cycle stages before and during pregnancy, and in the first t wo years of life. Optimal nutrition during this period lays the foundation for a long and healthy life and reduces the risk of developing diet -related chronic disease s. The first 1000 days (from gestation to 24 mon ths) is therefore internationally recognized as the 'window of opportunity' for direct nutrition interventions .20 The contribution of nutrition in achiev ing t he Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in particular MDG 1, 4 and 5 , make a strong case for focus ed attention on scaling up evidence -based nutritional interventions. In addition, given the high burden of HIV and Tuberculosis, and the close interconnection between nutrition al status and disease progression of these conditions , a particular focus on str engthening the focus on nutrition in the ir prevention, control and management is appropriate. Non-communicable diseases are amongst the major causes of death in South Africa with the main contributory factors being unhealthy diets and insufficient physical activity. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 16 Department of Health A range of nutrition -related policies and guideline documents already exist to inform the implementation of the priority interventions. The Roadmap must therefore support the r edirect ion of human and financial resources that are currentl y devoted to lower priority actions towards the scaled up implementation of priority interventions and ensur e that nutrition is effectively integrated into core strategies such as BANC, IMCI, and PMTCT . The Roadmap provide s a framework for the implementati on of existing and new policies , using a range of delivery platforms, as part of a reengineered Primary Health Care approach. Within this PHC approach the health sector has an important advocacy and information role in relation to other sectors, notably ag riculture, rural development, social development , trade and industry, economic affairs and education to maximize the nutritional benefit of actions undertaken by those sectors. It identifies specific strategic focus areas and actions to be undertaken to en sure that nutrition - related actions of the health sector contribute significantly to improving the health, longevity and prosperity of all South Africans. 3 VISION Optimal nutrition for all people in South Africa . 4 MISSION To provide high quality and access to evidence -based nutrition services , particularly for women, infants and children, through out all levels of the health care system. 5 GUIDING PRINCIPLES Political support : Nutrition security receives consistent, high level political suppor t and adequate resources. Empowerment: Families and communities are empowered to adopt healthy lifestyles and sound nutritional practices which are culturally and gender sensitive . A rights -based approach : The health sector plays a central role in prote cting, promoting and realizing the right to adequate nutrition, in the context of other social and economic rights. A lifecycle approach : Health sector nutrition services use a lifecycle approach, focusing on the key 'window of opportunity' namely preg nancy and the first two years of life (the first 1000 days) . A Continuum of care : Nutrition services are delivered in an integrated manner, linking community, primary health care and hospital level services. Focused and Targeted : Available resources fo r nutrition are optimally used to implement priority interventions among vulnerable groups and with a particular focus on the most disadvantaged wards, sub -districts, districts and provinces . Clear accountabilities at different levels : Accountabilit y for specific functions are assigned to different cadres of health and nutrition workers at national, provincial, district and community levels. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 17 Department of Health Collaborative : Nutrition security is addressed through collaborative action among multiple sectors. Communica tion: Effective communication on nutrition is fostered with households and communities, and among all cadres and disciplines. 6 WHO IS THIS ROADMAP FOR? Managers and supervisors implementing nutrition and nutrition -related interventions at all levels Government departments and Entities with a role to play in contributing to the implement ation of nutrition related interventions Development partners and Donor agencies Institutions of higher learning and research institutes Health care personnel at diff erent levels of the health care system 7 OVERALL GOALS In line with the four outputs of the NSDA, f or 2010 to 2014 which are: increasing life expectancy; combating HIV and AIDS; decreasing the burden of disease from Tuberculosis and improving health syst ems effectiveness , the goals set out by the Nutrition Roadmap are: To contribute to increased life expectancy of the entire population by improv ing the quality , coverage and intensity of specific nutrition interventions that support reduction in mortality rates, especially maternal, neonatal, infant and child mortality ; To promote optimal growth of children and prevent overweight and obesity later in life, by focusing on optimal infant and young child nutrition ; To contribute to the prevention, control and treatment of HIV and Tuberculosis through targeted nutritional care and support strategies ; To contribute to the effective functioning of the health sector, by reducing the demand for curative services and improving recovery rates from diseases, thus freeing up resources for preventive and promotive services To empower families and communities to ma ke informed nutrition -related decisions , through advocacy regarding household food security, multisectoral collaboration and effective nutrition educati on. To achieve the overall goals of the Roadmap , all nutrition -related actions in the health sectors will be geared towards the implementation of a set of priority nutrition interventions as outlined below. The roadmap proposes making use of a range of d elivery platforms, including population -wide communication and market -based strategies as well as community based action, community outreach, clinic -based services and hospital -based services. The proposed strategic approaches are interrelated, and t he suc cessful delivery of the priority interventions will require high-level attention to advocacy for the integration of nutrition into relevant sector strategies and Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 18 Department of Health programmes , positioning nutrition strategically within the health sector , and s trengthening the human resource base. In all cases, the emphasis is on reaching vulnerable groups with high quality services. The f ive broad strategic approaches are: 1. Advocacy and technical support for the integration of nutrition into relevant secto r strategies and programmes . 2. Positioning nutrition strategically within the health sector at national and provincial levels . 3. Delivering the key nutrition interventions through appropriate action at each of the following levels: 3.1 Population bas ed services, including communication and market -based approaches 3.2 Community based services . 3.3 PHC clinic services . 3.4 Hospital -based services . 4. Strengthening Human Resources to deliver effective nutrition services . 5. Strengthening the informa tion base for effective nutrition services . The proposed nutrition interventions are presented below, followed by a brief discussion on each of the five strategic approaches. Specific implementation strategies, including indicators and targets will be dev eloped at the appropriate level of service. 8 PRIORITY NUTRITION INTERVENTIONS Based on a revi ew of the current situation, the literature on evidence -based interventions , and health sector priorities , the follow ing key nutrition interventions are recom mended as outlined in Table 1 . They need to be implemented as part of comprehensive packages of services at population, community, PHC and hospital levels. 21 Interventions included here are the primary responsibility of the health sector.

The health sector plays a key role in the implementation and scale -up of key direct nutrition interventions. In addition, the sector takes leadership in advocating for attention to the social and economic determinants of malnutrition by other sector s, and ensuring that nutrition -related services are harmonized, technically sound, and reaches the most vulnerable populations Nutrition services should feature prominently in Early Childhood Development programmes. Strategic Objectives Advocate for st rategies to address the impact of social determinants of nutrition, especially improv ing access to basic services such as clean water and adequate sanitation ; safe environments for physical activity and innovations like incentives for healthy eating and exercise. Provide strategic inputs to the agriculture, rural development and social development sectors at all levels (Provincial, District and Local Government) to improve household food security, dietary diversity and women's nutrition and the integra tion of nutrition in ECD services . Advocate for the integrat ion of nutrition education (including education on infant feeding, maternal nutrition, and healthy eating to prevent overweight and obesity) into comprehens ive health education in pre-schools, schools and communities . 9.2 Strategy 2: Position nutrition strategically within the health sector Nutrition interventions should form an integral part of comprehensive primary health care services, including prevention, health promotion, curative and reh abilitative services. Services are provided pr imarily through clinics , (including outreach services ) and through district and hospital services which are organized and managed in geographic areas (districts and provinces ) as part of comprehensive MNCWH and Nutrition services . To support the concept of t he continuum of MNCWH & Nutrition services , it is important to ensure that nutrition services are fully integrated and adequately resource d, supervised and monitored, so that attention to nutrition is maintai ned across programmes and among the various levels of care. Other key health care services which require nutrition input include HI V services , TB and chronic disease programmes. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 22 Department of Health Strategic Objectives Integrate core nutrition interventions into the overar ching framework for the delivery of MNCWH & Nutrition services. Build capacity of Nutrition units at provincial and district with appropriate advocacy skills training and information to ensure that adequate human and financial resources are committed to k ey nutrition interventions. Review current nutrition strategies of HIV &AIDS, TB , MCWH and Chronic Disease units, and provide strategic and technical support to these units to strengthen thei r nutrition - related activities. 9.3 Strategy 3: Strengthen the im plementation of key nutrition interventions at all levels in the health sector 9.3.1 PHC services Primary health care services are the backbone of the health system , and a dedicated effort is needed to ensure that the core set of nutrition interventions are competently delivered at this level . The coverage and intensity of several nutrition interventions (e.g. routine Vitamin A supplementation for children aged 12 to 59 months, effective growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) , infant feeding and maternal nutr ition counselling and supplementation ) are currently not adequate. In addition to coverage and intensity, programme quality also needs attention. Strategic Objectives Advocate for, and support scale -up of new or existing programmes with low coverage. Thes e include: ANC (using BANC approach), clinic -based baby friendly community initiative, post -natal care, IMCI, as well as school health services, and youth -friendly services. Develop and implement models linking maternal and child nutrition assessment at PH C - including anthropometry, rapid dietary assessments, and biochemical measures as needed) - and develop specific messages for counseling on feeding and dietary practices for different age groups and disease conditions. Ensure that the nutrition component s (notably dietary counselling, calcium supplementation, iron and folate supplementation of pregnant women, breast feeding and complementary feeding support, GMP, Vitamin A supplementation, and therapeutic zinc supplementation) of key programme strategies are well defined, and that guidelines and key mess ages, norms and standards are widely available and used. Increase access to appropriate nutritional assessment, support and care for people living with HIV and TB, and provide counselling on diet and exerc ise to prevent and control diet -related chronic diseases. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 23 Department of Health Advocate for, and support regular supportive supervision of PHC facilities and ensure that the nutrition components of PHC program mes receive adequate attention during supervision , by developing appropriate supervision tools, and integrating nutrition supervision tools into already existing tools . Develop and implement strategies referral to health care facilities (particularly for treatment of SAM) and for household level follow up as required. This includes strengthening linkages between PHC nutrition services and community support systems such as community health workers. 9.3.2 Community -based services In the framework for community -based MNCWH&N interventions it is envisaged that most of the core activities would be provided by generalist CHWs (or existing community -based workers) who are part of population -based PHC teams to be established as part of the process of restructuring and revitalizing primary health care. To ensure that the pro posed community -based approach will result in improved nutritional status for mothers and children, appropriate training on nutrition and feeding practices and supportive supervision will be required. The proposed direct nutrition interventions and delive ry modes during pregnancy, the post -natal period and during infancy and childhood are outlined in Table 2. Strategic Objectives Advocate for access to programmes addressing access to clean water, sanitation, food security (including efforts to improve ac cess to social grants) and physical activity by vulnerable groups. Develop guidelines, tools and indicators to support community -based nutrition action. Ensure that key nutrition interventions in community based programmes (HHCC of IMCI, RED Strategy) are incorporated in comprehensive CHW and ECD programmes. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 24 Department of Health Table 2: Community -based Nutrition Interventions and their Delivery Modes Pregnancy Postnatal Infancy/childhood Key nutrition interventions Nutritional assessment of pregnant women Maternal nutrition through BANC - including iron -folate and calcium supplementation and education on maternal diet; Counselling on appropriate infant feeding practices . Counselling on Newborn and child care including appropriate infant and young child feedi ng Nutritional assessment of post -partum mothers and maternal nutritional counselling Counselling and support for early initiation and exclusive breast feeding High-dose Vitamin A supplementation for 6 to 59 months children Appropriate management of breas t conditions Nutritional assessment of infants Counselling on IYCF/EBF, maternal nutrition Ensuring that preventative services are accessed: notably vitamin A, deworming, growth monitoring linked to counselling on IYCF Home Visits by CHW 4 - 6 visits 4 visits: 2 days, 7 days, 14 days and 6 weeks Monthly visits until 6 months of age 9 months and 12 months -3- monthly visits 1- 5 years - 6 monthly visits Outreach services Should be conducted twice a year as a targeted strategy to reach children who do not benefit from routine services and where large coverage gaps in EPI, GMP, vitamin A supplementation and deworming exist Support groups All facilities to have support groups for pregnant women and breast feeding mothers and, care givers of children 0 -24 months All facilities to develop and implement plans for monthly meetings of CHWs and support group leaders Counselling and experience sharing on IYCF/EB F, PMTCT and maternal nutrition, including practical feeding demonstrations. Support to ECD centre s Regular meetings with ECD facilitators and using ECD centres to identify and monitor growth and advise on feeding menus and practices and health in children and to identify vulnerable children. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 25 Department of Health 9.3.3 Hospital based services From a nutrition perspecti ve, priority needs to be given to infant feeding counselling and support to all pregnant women and post partum mothers, Vitamin A supplementation (particularly high -dose supplementation of mothers post partum) and treatment of severe acute malnutrition. Strategic Objectives Improve the quality of hospital -based nutrition services (clinical and food services) through the provision of protocols, training of health care workers in the core package of nutrition interventions Strengthen supportive supervision through an outreach strategy by utilizing the services of dieticians and nutritionists efficiently . Strengthen and scale up the prevention and treatment of severe acute malnutrition and the nutritional management of sick children in district and regional hospitals, using standardized protocols ( WHO 10 Steps on the management of severe and acute malnutrition) . Provide adequate nutritional care and support for people living with HIV & AIDS, and TB 9.3.4 Population based services, including market -based str ategies Greater awareness of the nature of the malnutrition problem in South Africa, and of the contribution of sound nutrition to health, wellbeing and national prosperity will help to develop popular support for the nutrition strategy, and stimulate dema nd for quality nutrition services. It should help to broaden the focus beyond a food -based approach, in which nutrition is equated with hand -outs and gardening, to include a more comprehensive set of proven cost -effective interventions, household practice s and government programs that promote good nutrition throughout the life cycle. Given South Africa's well -developed private sector, and experience gained through the food fortification and salt iodization programme, more consideration should be given to utilizing market -based strategies to support priority nutrition goals. The role of the food sector, with regard to implementation of regulations on food labelling, and responsible marketing to children, should also be highlighted. Strategic Objective s Incorporate messages on core nutrition practices in a range of government communications with households and communities. Develop nutrition messages to reach opinion leaders at all levels with targeted messages regarding the focus of the nutrition strate gy, and its potential contribution to national development and prosperity. Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 26 Department of Health Continue to work with the food industry to strengthen implementation of nutrition related interventions such as food fortification programme , and explore additional ways in which the private sector can participate in reaching the goals of the nutrition strategy , in line with government policies and priorities. Strengthen the monitoring and reporting system for fortification program mes. 9.4 Strategy 4: Strengthen the human resourc e capacity for the delivery of nutrition services Human resource development is central to the success of th e Nutrition strategy. Staffing norms and standards , skills requirements, and plans for training and retraining of health staff must be developed . A multidisciplinary approach to train health personnel in nutrition will help in overcoming barriers to participation in training and implementation of nutrition - related activities in practice. It will be important to ensure that nutrition is represented on the proposed PHC teams which are to be established in support of the PHC system. Their roles and functions should be clearly defined and communicated to other team members and nutrition -related cadres at all levels. Strategic Objectives Develop a comprehensive human resource plan for nutrition in the health sector. Ensure that all categories of health staff receive adequate pre -service and in -service training in nutrition to meet the requirements of the HR plan (curricula of health professionals should be regularly updated to ensure adequate pre -service training in nutrition ). Liaise closely with the Professional Board for Dietetics and Nutrition of the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) as well as higher education institutions to ensure that the academic training of nutrition professionals are in line with the nutrition priorities of the country 9.5 Strategy 5: Strengthen the information base for effective nutrition services Systems for monitoring and evaluation at all levels of the health system need to be strengthened and implemented, and information generated through these activities needs to be used to inform decision making at all levels . Information needs regarding nutrition require particular attention, and the feasibility of implementing a nutrition surveillance system should be investigated. A research agenda responsive to the national nutrition priorities is important in establishing an evidence -based culture for decision -making. Where research funds are derived from nationa l public sources a government -led research agenda should inform the selection of priority research focus areas.69 Roadmap for Nutrition in South Africa 2013 - 2017 27 Department of Health Strategic Objectives Review and agree on key indicators, how and how frequently information should be gathered on each, and how information should be reported and used. Develop a monitoring and evaluation framework for the s trategy. The plan should provide for m onitor ing trends in key nutrition indicators and sharing the information across the system and with key stakeholders . Where necessar y, strengthen the collection, collation , analysis, interpretation and release of data, and the timely dissemination of information . Assess the feasibility of a national nutrition surveillance system for the country and explore implementation of community -based information system s. Develop, in collaboration with research institutions and development partners, a national agenda for research on current and emerging nutrition challenges. Create mecha nisms to systematize and share information generated through research and evaluation activities, and build consensus on evidence, key message and research priorities. 10 IMPLEMENTING THE ROADMAP Overall accountability for the implementation of the nutrition roadmap will be the responsibility of the Nutrition Dire ctorate in the National Department of health. A summarized implementation matrix is presented in Appendix A. The matrix indicates the critical interventions or actions that must be undertaken according to the specified timeframes in order to successfully implement the nutrition strategy. For each intervention and/or action, lead agencies are identified (highlighted in the table in the Appendix) together with the main link agencies. However, detailed work -plans and the accompanying budgets will be prepared by Provinces and the Districts. 11 MONITORING AND EVALUATION A list of core nutrition indicators is attached in Appendix B. a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan will be developed to monitor the implementation of nutritional interventions.
