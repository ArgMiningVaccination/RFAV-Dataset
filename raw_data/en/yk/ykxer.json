Vanidestine, Doctor of Philosophy, 2015 Dissertation Directed by: Michael Reisch, Ph.D., Professor, University of Maryland, Baltimore School of Social Work The conceptualization of race, racism, and Whiteness through language and discourse influences policy agendas to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities. The manner in which these terms are conceptualized within health promotion agendas also influence the ways social welfare/health professionals take action to address them. The definition of terms like \"race,\" \"racism,\" or \"Whiteness\" can potentially reinforce or challenge previously held understandings of these concepts. The meaning assigned to racial concepts also reveals who has the resources to interpret, reproduce, and benefit from the sanctioned knowledge. The purpose of the current qualitative study was to explore how policy agendas and social welfare/health professionals conceptualized race, racism, and Whiteness. Additional considerations included the possible influence of those conceptualizations on their actions to address racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities was examined. The primary sources of data were published policy agendas designed to address racial and ethnic health disparities at the city, state, national, and international levels. Furthermore, social welfare/health professionals working in West Baltimore also participated in qualitative interviews as an additional source of information. Grounded theory theme identification (GT; Charmaz, 2014) and critical discourse analysis (CDA; Fairclough, 2009, 2012) provided the methodologies to analyze both sources of data. The city, state, and national policy agendas to eliminate racial health disparities/inequities focused on two complementary discourses, state-sanctioned racial categorizations and racial differences, as the basis for individual-focused interventions. Similarly, the professionals' discourses included skin color identification/categorization and racial [pre]judgments/discrimination. Finally, the common discourses professionals used to describe actions taken to address racial and ethic health disparities were: a) collaboration, engagement, and outreach; b) health provision and promotion; and c) race training, awareness, and diversity. Conversely, the international policy agendas included discourses of government accountability, political context, and theorizing social power. The language and discourse assigned to racial concepts within the professional context can act as barriers or bridges to the formation of comprehensive policies and practices to address the injustice of racialized health outcomes. In turn, the meanings we assign through language and discourse inform the types of analyses and interventions we implement to eliminate racial and ethnic health outcomes. The Conceptualization of Race and Racism in the Discourse Addressing Racial and Ethnic Health Inequities by Todd J. Vanidestine Dissertation submitted to the Faculty of the Graduate School of the University of Maryland, Baltimore in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2015 iii Acknowledgements First, I want to thank my parents, Doris and Jim Vanidestine, for all their unconditional love and support throughout my life. They stood by me, with love and reassurance, through the good times and challenge times. My deepest gratitude and love to you both. This study relied heavily on the willingness of all the interview participants from the University of Maryland Schools of Social Work, Nursing, and Medicine. Thank you for taking the time to share important insights regarding a challenging issue and doing so with an openness that served to provide informative answers. Funding for this research was generously provided by the University of Maryland School of Social Work Ph.D. Program Grant, which allowed me to extend gift cards to the interview participants and hire Gwen Young to transcribe the interviews (thank you). I gratefully acknowledge my incredibly brilliant and supportive dissertation committee, starting with my dissertation chair and mentor, Dr. Michael Reisch, who offered his keen analysis of policy and key writing suggestions while also continually balancing encouragement with empathy. He is the primary reason I chose to attend the UMB SSW. From the first conversation we shared prior to me attending UMB SSW, I appreciated his activist approach to social work practice and his respect for student perspectives. To Dr. Ed Pecukonis, who mentored me for two years during a MCH fellowship where his guidance supported the process of honing my teaching skills and reinforced my interest in racial and ethnic health inequities. To Associate Dean (Dr.) Megan Meyer, who offered critical feedback regarding connections between my study's methodologies and findings, in addition to modeling a strong commitment to students, iv teaching, and social change. To Dr. Tanya Sharpe, who always took the time to ask important questions about my research that I hadn't considered and encouraged me to remember the importance of self-care during the dissertation process. To Dr. Susana Martinez-Guillem, who supported my use of critical discourse analysis (CDA) by providing invaluable guidance to exploring an unfamiliar methodology and offering a non-social work perspective. Thank you all for the feedback, revisions, and the belief I could complete the dissertation. I couldn't have done it without you all. I owe my family at the People's Institute for Survival and Beyond (PISAB) a lifetime of gratitude for teaching me about anti-racism organizing and analyzing structural racism in order to regain my humanity and fight for racial justice. Most importantly, I thank you for encouraging me to bring love to the discussion of racism with my family. Thank you to my PISAB mentors and fellow organizers including Ron Chisom, the late Dr. Jim Dunn, Dr. Kimberley Richards, Diana Dunn, Dr. Cheryl LaRoche, Onaje Mu'id, Margery Freeman, Reverend David Billings, Maria Dr. Ra\u00fal Qui\u00f1ones Rosado, Mary Flowers, Sandy Bernabei, Maurice Lacey, Monica Walker, Dustin Washington, Martin Friedman, Bay Love, Justin Freitas, Megan Leschak, Eric Jackson and many others who continue to fight for racial and social justice. The idea for my research emerged from reading the inequitable health \"stats\" and outcomes found in West Baltimore neighborhoods. However, previous relationships taught me the importance of thoughtfully interacting with the people and the social context behind the \"numbers\". I'm deeply indebted to my Equity Matters Baltimore family for providing the space to develop relationships with community residents and organizations throughout Baltimore. To Michael Scott for his insights, friendship, and the v discussions about transformational change within our communities, our institutions, and ourselves. To Dr. Adrienne Starks, Dr. Lawrence Brown, Dr. Geri Peak, Dean (Dr.) Kim Dobson-Sydnor, Carol Payne, Tahira Mahdi, Donna Brown, Kelly Little, Shannon Cosgrove, and all the good people at Druid Heights Community Development Corporation for offering vital perspectives regarding health equity in Baltimore. I want to express gratitude to my family at the University of Maryland Baltimore School of Social Work, with special thanks to Dr. Donna Harrington and Dr. Bruce DeForge for their guidance through multiple aspects of the dissertation process. To Dr. Debbie Gioia for sharing her passion regarding qualitative research. To Dr. Kathleen Deal for her commitment to teaching with compassion and humility. To Dr. Wendy Shaia for modeling the strength to navigate the intersections of higher education and community neighborhoods with empathy for those most marginalized. To Jen Canapp, Janice Hicks, Theresa Washington, Linda Stewart, Amanda Azuma, Kristen Hood, Francis Jones and all the other staff who provided essential behind-the-scenes support. To all my doctoral colleagues, including Dr. Liz Aparicio, Dr. Lynn Michalopoulos, Stacey Shipe, and Melissa Bessaha, for always understanding the highs and lows of doing a doctoral degree. To all the students who taught and challenged me to become a better teacher and learner, with special thanks to the student-led Anti-Oppression Work Group (AOWG) and their efforts to strengthen our school's analysis of structural oppression and racism. To the Diversity/Anti-Oppression (DAO) Committee and their commitment to support AOWG's lead. During the last six years of completing this dissertation, I lost two very important people, Mary S. Vanidestine (my dear Nana) and Joseph Petrocelli (a grandfather figure). vi They both provided wisdom, insights, and love, helping me to grow the good qualities and minimize the less-than-desirable ones. I feel their presence with me always, in love and spirit. Finally, gratitude is extended to spiritual principles from many traditions and the collective Oneness that have nurtured me in the struggle for justice, equity, and regaining my humanity. There isn't enough space or words to express my sincerest gratitude to all the people and experiences that supported me through the dissertation process. Although I'm unable to mention everyone by name, I'm grateful to all the people who touched my life. Thank you. vii Table of Contents Chapter 1: Study Overview.................................................................................................1 1.1 Introduction...............................................................................................1 1.2 Problem Statement....................................................................................3 1.3 Context of Study........................................................................................5 1.4 Relevance to Social Work.........................................................................6 1.5 Research Questions...................................................................................9 Chapter 2: Literature Review............................................................................................11 2.1 Introduction.............................................................................................11 2.2 Literature 2.3 Address Racial and Ethnic Health Inequities and Disparities.........................................................................................42 2.5.1 Brief history of racial and ethnic health inequities and disparities. 43 2.5.2 Health promotion and racial and ethnic health inequities and disparities.................................................................................................46 2.5.3 Initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities and disparities.................................................................................................48 Baltimore City Health Department: Healthy Baltimore 2015....48 Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities): Maryland Plan to Eliminate Minority Health Disparities........................................................49 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities.............................51 United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD): Unequal Health Outcomes..................52 World Health Organization: A Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health.........................................54 Chapter 3: Discourse, Critical Theories of Race, Racial Discourse Framework...............................................................................................70 3.3.1 Social theory of discourse...........................................................73 Influence of Foucault...................................................................74 Text dimension.............................................................................78 Discursive practice dimension....................................................80 Critical theories Process of racialization...............................................................94 Racial interests and racial contestation......................................96 3.3.3 Racial ideology and color-blind racism frames...........................99 Legal concept of colorblindness................................................100 Color-blind racism frames........................................................101 Chapter 4: Methodology.................................................................................................105 4.1 Introduction and GT and Instrument for Change...............119 4.3.1 Reflexivity.................................................................................120 4.3.2.

Secretary's Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health (subsequently referred to as the Malone-Heckler Report1) appeared, research on racial and ethnic health disparities has become a focal point at most levels of government (Heckler, 1985). Yet, the conceptualization of race and racism, and its impact on policies designed to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities, continues to lack consensus among policy-makers, researchers, and practitioners uses the term \"disparity\" in the Executive Summary to indicate the differences between Whites and \"minority\"2 populations in the \"burden of death and illness,\" which subsequently became known as racial and ethnic health disparities (p. ix). The terms \"racial\" and \"ethnic\" are often used interchangeably, without any clear definition or contextualization through socio-cultural, political, or ideological lenses. The primary focus is to examine how the conceptualization of race and racism (racial concepts), through language and discourse, influences health promotion policies to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities.3 The manner in which racial 1 This shorthand name of the report refers to Thomas E. Malone, Chairperson of Task Force on Black & Minority Health and Margaret M. Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Reagan Administration. 2 I use quotes around the term \"minority\" to indicate the problematic nature of the term and how using it can reinforce the racial hierarchy found in U.S. society by minimizing its reference to a group's relationship to social power. This will be part of the critical discourse analysis (CDA). 3 I will use both concepts\u2014\"health disparities\" and \"health inequities\"\u2014throughout the study. However, \"health disparities\" will only be used when the literature reflects this term and \"health inequities\" will be used at all other times because it is consistent with the assumption that many unequal racial/ethnic health outcomes are both avoidable and inequitable (Whitehead, 1992). Although \"health inequities\" is often used as a sub-category of \"health disparities,\" current efforts which promote health equity through the use of a social determinants of health framework make \"health inequities\" a focal point for research and community intervention. This approach also effectively aligns with social work's underlying value of social justice and 2 concepts and racism within health policy initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities are conceptualized influences the ways social service/health professionals take action to address them. How we define terms like \"race,\" \"racism,\" or \"Whiteness\" can also potentially reinforce previously held understandings of these concepts or challenge them. Explanations about how \"race\" and \"health\" are connected rely heavily on how \"race\" is conceptualized at a given point in history, for example, as a biological or socio-cultural concept, or social construct (Chae et al., 2011; Krieger, 2003). The eventual meaning assigned to racial concepts or any issue is not only a definition; it can also reveal who has the resources to define, conceptualize, interpret, reproduce, and benefit from the sanctioned knowledge. Furthermore, policies designed to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities, like all other policy, employ that knowledge to represent the particular interests of professions, governments, practitioners, researchers, and community residents. However, each of these entities has different resources to promulgate and prioritize those interests based on their proximity to power (i.e., institutional, professional, systemic, collective). Racial and ethnic health inequities are still a major social issue in the U.S. fifty years after the passage of Civil Rights legislation. Because our society is distinctly racialized in a hierarchical way, non-Hispanic White people are usually on the high end of health outcomes whereas people of color are on the bottom of such health indicators as higher mortality rates and the earlier onset and severity of diseases (Tang & Browne, 2008; D. R. Williams & Mohammed, 2013). Although the U.S. spends more than any country in the world on its health care system, it consistently ranks last overall among recent efforts to move social work beyond an emphasis on cultural competence to a racial equity framework (Social Work Policy Institute, 2014). 3 comparable, developed nations and, most recently, ranked last in equity, healthy lives, and health care system efficiency (Davis, Stremikis, Squires, & Schoen, 2014; Wolf & Aron, 2013). The dissertation attempted to illuminate how race and racism are conceptualized among social welfare/health professionals and within various initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. To do so, actual health promotion policies at the city, state, national, and international levels were analyzed to examine how they reflect ideology and power relations through their language and discourse(s).4 These data were then compared to interview transcriptions collected from social service/health professionals working in West Baltimore, where numerous inequitable health outcomes exist. By comparing these different discourses and contexts, ideologies and linguistic meaning-making power between the micro- and macro-levels of society can become more visible. The goal of the research is to contribute to the field by assessing the influence discourse has on conceptualizing and defining racial concepts, which in turn, impacts the way policy solutions are created. 1.2 Problem Statement Because meanings assigned to racial concepts through discourse are continually contested, prioritized racial knowledge is privileged based on access to resources, media, and state-sanctioned institutions, in other words, relationship to social power (D. T. Goldberg, 1993). The ability to communicate particular messages via spoken and written 4 Throughout this study, the term/concept \"discourse\" is used in multiple ways, which include: (a) meaning-making as an element of the social process; (b) the language associated with a particular social field or practice (e.g. social work discourse, nursing discourse, racial discourse); and (c) a way of construing aspects of the world associated with a particular social perspective (e.g., a neo-liberal discourse of globalization) (Fairclough, 2009, pp. 162-163). Social work scholars Pozzuto, Angell, and Dezendorf (2005) align with Fairclough's description of discourse as a social practice by stating, \"Social practices within the parameters of varying discourses give the world social meaning: distinctions between good and bad, legal and illegal, deserving and undeserving, or us and them\" (p. 31). 4 words is an important aspect of social power, especially as it relates to policy-making and implementation (Fairclough, 2010). On the one hand, conceptualizing race and racism from a critical perspective that includes its structural and sociopolitical implications could provide more effective approaches to addressing the root causes of health inequities; conversely, the process could reproduce racial meanings that hold the prevailing racial hierarchy of outcomes in place and limit policy options (Hofrichter, 2003). The impact of conceptualizing racial concepts on health promotion policy is an arena where this occurs across, and within, professional disciplines. Each perspective occupies a particular position based on such factors as job implications, geographic location, and family socio-economic status (SES). Like members of other professions, social workers disagree over how to define and frame actions to eradicate racism. Due to their differing conceptualizations, effective solutions are often illusive. Using such diverse terms as \"multicultural,\" \"cultural humility,\" \"cultural competence,\" and \"diversity\" to describe racial concepts reinforces a broader understanding of human differences, yet they also contain an inherently narrow focus on the individual and, consequently, often preclude the initiation of meaningful changes at the institutional and systemic levels. This is because each of these terms replicates an understanding of race and racism on an individual level (i.e., understand your cultural, ethnic, or racial heritage in order to avoid racial discrimination or bias), which ultimately leads to focusing primarily on individual-level interventions. While such interventions are necessary, the individually-oriented approach is not sufficient to bring about change at the institutional or systemic level. In addition, D. R. Williams and Mohammed (2013) indicated, \"it is possible for racism to exist in institutional structures and policies without 5 the presence of racial prejudice or negative racial stereotypes at the individual level\" (p. 1153). This point underscores a key issue in conceptualizing race and racism because a vast majority of our education, research, and practice knowledge relies heavily on equating the absence of racial prejudice/stereotypes at the individual level to the absence of racism at the institutional/systemic levels. 1.3 Context of Study The research took place in Baltimore City, whose current racial and ethnic composition is 63.3 % Black or African Native (U.S. Census, 2013a). Because African Americans represent a majority of the city's population, one may assume that Baltimore is an \"integrated\" city. In fact, some neighborhoods are integrated along racial and ethnic lines. However, Baltimore ranks as the 13th most segregated city out of 100 metropolitan areas in the U.S. and contains numerous neighborhoods where 90% of the residents are either African American/Black or White (Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, 2012). This is important because racial segregation, as a social determinant of health, has been correlated with inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes (D. R. Williams & Collins, 2001; D. R. Williams & Sternthal, 2010). In 2010, the Baltimore City Health Department, Office of Epidemiology and Planning released a Health Disparities Report Card, which gave the city an overall grade of \"D.\" Although mortality rates have slowly improved across gender and races since the report was released, there are several indicators of health disparities that have remained the same or, in some cases, have worsened. These include infant mortality, heart disease, and asthma. 6 On a more local level, the West Baltimore neighborhoods, whose racial/ethnic composition is overwhelmingly African American/Black, reflect some of the worse health outcomes in Baltimore City. This area is where the social welfare/health professionals, who participated in the qualitative interviews, have worked for at least 6 months. Although it is within a few miles of the UMB campus with professional schools that include nursing, medicine, social work, and public health, in addition to a world-class hospital, West Baltimore neighborhoods rank near the bottom of 55 Baltimore City neighborhoods on multiple health indicators such as life expectancy, heart disease, prevalence of HIV/AIDS, juvenile arrest rates, and median income (Baltimore City Health Department, 2011). (These factors are discussed further in Chapter 2, Literature Review). 1.4 Relevance to Social Work Health equity, race/racism, and knowledge production are relevant to the social work profession. Social work practice and policy development in health care settings are becoming more prominent options for social workers due to the expanding field of health care resulting from national initiatives such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) and the Affordable Care Act (Kerson, McCoyd, & Associates, 2010; Moniz & Gorin, 2014). Whether social workers practice explicitly within a health care setting or in another practice area, racial and ethnic health inequities are a critical issue for social workers due to the profession's commitment to contextualizing the individual within ecological or person-in-environment models. Gorin, Gehlert, and Washington (2010) consider actions to address health disparities in line with \"social work's historical context and mission, [because] it is critical for our profession to play a leading role in 7 disseminating knowledge to not only improve social work practice, but to also effect change in the systems and structures that perpetuate health inequalities\" [emphasis added] (p. 245). Like most other professions, social work has struggled with how to respond to racism and the social changes such as racial desegregation. Although many other U.S. institutions began to integrate after the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, most social service agencies remained segregated (Reisch & Andrews, 2001). However, by the late 1960s, in response to the civil rights movement and greater public awareness of racial oppression, NASW and the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) called for an end to \"White racism\" (Reisch & Andrews, 2001, p. 163). As social work emerged from the tumultuous decade of the 1960s, social issues like poverty, increased urban populations, diminished social welfare resources, and continued racial strife shaped the field's direction. As the profession recognized the need to improve its ability to work with an increasingly racially diverse population, culturally competent paradigms began to emerge, such as the \"dual perspective\" (Norton, 1978), which emphasized the importance of understanding an individual's perspective within the context of that person's family and surrounding community (Fong, 2001). During the 1980s, ethnic sensitivity and awareness became highlighted aspects of culturally competent practice (Devore & Schlesinger, 1981). Since the 1980s, cultural competence has become an essential part of social work's professional identity. Lum (1999, 2003, 2007) played a key role in identifying the multifaceted areas encompassing cultural competence, including cultural awareness, 8 knowledge acquisition, skill development, and inductive learning. Additionally, he defines cultural competence as \"the set of knowledge and skills that a social worker must develop in order to be effective with multicultural clients\" and includes the need to bring \"together elements from his or her culture of origin and the dominant culture\" [emphasis added] (p. 3). The language used here is critical to observe because it frames the elimination of racism in terms of improving interpersonal communication through the acquisition of \"skills and knowledge\" about a supposedly racially homogenous group (e.g., Asians, Latin@s, African Americans) and refers to an ambiguous \"dominant culture\" (White). Yet, \"White culture\" or \"White people\" are rarely identified or discussed as part of the acquisition of cultural competency. Like other helping professions and academic fields of study, contested discursive and ideological approaches to race and racism still exist in social work. Several social work scholars challenge the efficacy of cultural competence because of its \"equality-of-oppression\" approach that minimizes the impact of racism (Graham & 2010; Schiele, 2007), its \"apolitical or de-political nature\" (Sakamoto, 2007), or because it does not reach \"far enough in addressing systemic and institutionalized oppressions\" (Abrams & Moio, 2009). Consequently, the majority of social work education, research, and practice frames race and racism through the complementary prisms of cultural competence and diversity. In November 2013, the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) and the Social Work Policy Institute (SWPI) held a racial equity \"think tank\" entitled Achieving Racial Equity: Calling the Social Work Profession to Action. The forum brought together racial equity leaders from across the country and from a broad range of disciplines to 9 expand the notion of cultural competency to include an explicit racial equity framework because \"cultural competency is insufficient to achieve racial equity\" (Social Work Policy Institute, 2014). This work builds on NASW's 2007 effort, Institutional Racism & the Social Work Profession: A Call to Action. Although one may assume that all social workers share the same goal of eliminating racism, there are significant differences in how they frame and address the issues related to inequitable racial and ethnic outcomes. Subsequently, the ways we use language to communicate these differences, through discourse, influences how we address a social issue in practice. 1.5 Research Questions The following research questions guided the research process: 1) How does the conceptualization of race, racism, and Whiteness influence the discourse on health disparities/inequities within international, national, state, and local policy initiatives whose expressed purpose is to address disparate or inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? 2) How do social welfare/health professionals conceptualize race, racism, and Whiteness in their discourse, as it relates to disparate or inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? 3) What is the relationship between the discourse conceptualizing race, racism, and Whiteness and the actions taken by professionals to address disparate or inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? The research contributed to understanding policies and interventions related to racial and ethnic health inequities. By focusing on how discourse and language communicate conceptualizations of race and racism, the study also examined the contexts 10 and relationships between social welfare/health professionals and the health promotion policies employed to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. The following sections cover a review of the literature, the guiding theories, and a methodological plan used in the study. 11 Chapter 2: Literature Review 2.1 Introduction This chapter includes the literature review strategy, the terminology describing \"different\" racial and ethnic health outcomes, conceptualizations of racial and ethnic concepts, and analyses of actions taken to address racial and ethnic health inequities through health promotion policy. Section 2.3 focuses on the terms \"health,\" \"disparities,\" \"inequalities,\" and \"inequities\" to highlight th eir varied usages in the literature. It also emphasizes on how they influence the conceptualization of race and racism, while at the same time being influenced by their definitions through an iterative relationship. In addition, the subsections in 2.3 provide a brief overview of racial and ethnic health outcomes at the national, state, city, and community levels. Section 2.4 addresses conceptualizations of key concepts such as race, ethnicity, racism, and Whiteness. Finally, section 2.5 provides an overview of health policy related to racial and ethnic health inequities. This includes a brief discussion of the history of racial and ethnic health inequities and health promotion, and a review of key initiatives (city, state, national, international) that have been introduced to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. 2.2 Literature Search Strategy The criteria for selecting literature were created by reviewing existing bibliographies from key historical works related to the following search categories: (a) health/health promotion/racial (d) discourse/language/communication/critical to each of the sections below. The inclusion 12 criteria included international and U.S-based studies published in English from 1950 until the present. Selected references were related to at least one of the concept clusters identified above or relevant to the research questions. The search terms identified in the categories were entered singularly and in logical combination with other terms (e.g., \"racism\" AND \"health;\" \"health policy\" AND \"discourse\" AND \"racial health disparities\"). Searches were conducted in the following databases up through July, 2014: Academic Search Premier, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Social Work Abstracts, HeinLine, ScienceDirect, HeinOnline, JSTOR Journal Archives, Web of Science, SocINDEX, and Google Scholar. Upwards of 90 references were identified as meeting the search strategy. After reviewing for pertinent information, they were entered into an annotated bibliography and, by using the snow-ball search strategy an additional 50 references emerged from bibliographies of key resources. For every reference identified as relevant to two or more of the categories above, a \"cited by\" search was conducted on Google Scholar to ascertain an additional 20 references. Several key organizational web sites provided important reports such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, HHS Office of Minority Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ), People's Institute for Survival and Beyond, Equity Matters Baltimore, and the Antiracist Alliance NYC. Fourteen relevant reports were identified, which resulted in an additional 20 references from their bibliographies. 13 Dissertations were searched using Google Scholar and ProQuest Digital Dissertations, which cover indexed dissertations since 1980 from the U.S., Canada, Britain, Australia, and other English speaking countries. These searches produced eight dissertations related to the race/racism, racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities, policy, and discourse. As a result, an additional 12 references were identified as relevant to the research. 2.3 Conceptualization of Health Inequities/Disparities/Inequalities Because language meaning and discourse are central components of the study, this section focuses on the different and similar meanings among the concepts health inequities, disparities, and inequalities. Health and health outcomes represent broad concepts on their own but when the adjectives \"racial/ethnic\" are added and combined, another set of historical contexts and political meanings emerge. Once the concepts are combined (e.g., racial and ethnic health disparities, racial and ethnic health inequities), a dialectical relationship occurs where one term, and its context, can influence the meaning of the other (Fairclough, 2009). In this section, the terms \"health,\" \"disparities,\" \"inequities,\" and \"inequalities\" are discussed, along with a brief overview of racial and ethnic health outcomes at the national, state, city, and neighborhood levels. 2.3.1 Definitions. Health. Defining health and the concept of health promotion (discussed later in section 2.5) is critical because of the need to understand what exactly needs improvement and \"promotion.\" The word health evolved from the old English word \"hoelth,\" which indicated a general sense of soundness, specifically related to the body (Awofeso, 2005). Initial definitions of health focused on the absence of ailments or diseases, resulting in a 14 simplified conceptualization of a complex issue and viewing health as either \"good\" or \"bad\" (Moniz & Gorin, 2014). The shift in emphasis to national and global health required a more fully contextualized definition. In 1946, the United Nations created an agenda for the International Health Conference, which included a constitution for a World Health Organization (WHO) which was eventually ratified in 1948 (Grad, 2002). The preamble to the constitution defined health as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,\" which emphasizes the positive aspects of health and not only disease prevention5 (p. 984). Other aspects of defining health in the WHO preamble included defining it as a \"fundamental right of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition;\" extending \"benefits of medical, psychological, and related knowledge is essential to the fullest attainment of health\" for all people; requiring the \"informed opinion and active co-operation\" of the public as critical to its improvement; and declaring that \"governments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples\" (p. 984). Although the WHO's definition of health is one of the most commonly used because of its universality and wide-ranging goals, several challenges have emerged over what is emphasized within its definition (Bircher & Kuruvilla, 2014). For example, approaches focusing on the social and political dimensions of health often compete with approaches focused on disease; this competition influences how the definition of health is operationalized (T. Brown, Cueto, & Fee, 2006). During the 1950s and 1960s, people began challenging the WHO's conceptualization of health because of its perceived 5 This quoted section comes from the Preamble of the Constitution of the World Health Organization, which was reproduced in the Grad (2002) reference. This quote and subsequent quotes from the Constitution will reference the Grad (2002) article. 15 apolitical, disease-focused health agenda; this challenge led to the 1978 Alma-Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care (T. Brown et al., 2006; Solar & Irwin, 2010). This declaration resulted from an uncommon collaboration of governmental and United Nations health officials from around the globe who came together to create a \"health care revolution\" supported by philosophical principles that include equity, community participation, social justice, and \"health for all\" goals (Lawn et al., 2008). Although the WHO's definition of health formed the basis of the Alma-Ata Declaration's definition, the latter also emphasized multiple levels of well-being such as physical, mental, and spiritual (Lawn et al., 2008). Disparities, inequities, inequalities. In conjunction with the word \"health,\" these concepts are used to describe some form of differential, unjust, or avoidable health outcomes. Often, they are used interchangeably and without a clear definition, relying on assumed \"common\" meanings. In the U.S., \"health disparity\" is the most commonly used term whereas \"health inequality\" is primarily used in other nations (Carter-Pokras & Baquet, 2002; Isaac, 2013). \"Disparity\" is often defined in several national, state, and local health policies as connoting differences or differential measurements in health outcomes based on race, ethnicity or some other demographic category (Carter-Pokras & Baquet, 2002; Isaac, 2013). On the other hand, \"inequality\" is used to refer to people with \"different positions in the socioeconomic hierarchy\" and usually implies a higher degree of moral judgment than \"disparity\" (Isaac, 2013, p. 17). The terms \"equity\" and \"equality\" are frequently used synonymously but are different; the former term being value-based while the latter one is not (Braveman, 2006; Braveman & Gruskin, 2003). 16 The concept of \"health inequity\" (and its corresponding term \"health equity\") has been developed to emphasize differential health outcomes that are considered unjust and avoidable. In conjunction with the WHO and within European society, Whitehead (1992) identified seven determinants of health differentials to distinguish between health \"differences\" (dictionary meaning assigned to \"disparity\") and health \"inequities\" to encourage debate and provide some clarification about the conceptualizing process. These seven determinants of health differentials are: 1. Natural, biological variation. 2. Health-damaging behaviour [sic] if freely chosen, such as participation in certain sports and pastimes. 3. The transient health advantage of one group over another when that group is first to adopt a health promoting behaviour [sic] (as long as other groups have the means to catch up fairly soon). 4. Health-damaging behaviour [sic] where the degree of choice of lifestyle is severely restricted. 5. Exposure to unhealthy, stressful living, and working conditions. 6. Inadequate access to essential health and other public services. 7. Natural selection or health-related social mobility involving the tendency for sick people to move down the social scale. (p. 5) According to Whitehead (1992), the consensus in the literature indicated the first three determinants would not be categorized as health inequities whereas the last four could be due to their conceptualization as \"unnecessary,\" \"avoidable,\" \"unfair,\" and \"unjust\" because there was a \"moral\" and \"ethical\" dimension to these types of health outcomes. 17 Only in the last ten years have the terms \"health inequities\" and \"health equity\" been developed and used frequently in the U.S. Even with Whitehead's (1992) early clarification of what constitutes a health inequity, there remain some persistent differences in conceptualizing \"health disparities.\" People may avoid using \"health inequity\" because of the inherent moral judgments associated with the term (Braveman & Ruskin, 2003), which appears similar to using the terms \"diversity\" or \"cultural competence\" rather than \"racism\" or \"anti-racism\" to describe racial concepts. When combining politically charged terms such as \"racial/ethnic\" and \"disparity/inequality/inequity,\" a clear conceptualization is important to provide guidance for subsequent social change efforts and interventions. The following sections highlight some of the racial and ethnic health inequities that exist today at the national, state, city, and neighborhood levels. 2.3.2 National data. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently released its 2014 Health Statistics report, which promotes policies for social well-being and collects data related to social indicators (OECD, 2014). According to the report, the U.S. spends 16.9% of its GDP on health, the highest percentage of all OECD countries, and over 7% higher than the OECD average. Of the 16.9% GDP, less than 50% of U.S health spending came from public financing, which is far below the OECD average of 72%. Although in international comparisons U.S. expenditures on health are the highest, the nation's health outcomes fall short of reaching the top position. According to a comprehensive 2013 U.S. Health in International Perspective report, the U.S. ranked last out of 17 comparable industrialized countries in overall health 18 outcomes (Woolf & Aron, 2013). These poor health outcomes affect people throughout the life span, up until age 75. The report identified nine specific health domains where the U.S ranked \"worse\" than other countries' averages: (a) adverse birth outcomes; (b) injuries and homicides; (c) adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections; (d) HIV/AIDS; (e) drug-related mortality (even when drunk driving deaths are excluded; (f) obesity and diabetes; (g) heart disease; (h) chronic lung disease; and (i) disability. Marginalized groups such as people of color, economically disadvantaged individuals, women, and people with limited education suffer the brunt of poor health outcomes. Even White people with higher incomes and education who possessed health insurance experienced poorer health outcomes than people with similar demographics in the other nations included in the report. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Health Disparities and Inequalities Report\u2014United States, 2011, racial and ethnic disparities/inequities are still a major issue for people of color in the U.S. Babies born to Black women are 1.5 to 3 times as likely to die as compared to women of other races and ethnicities. Coronary heart disease and stroke cause the most deaths in the U.S. as well as accounting for the largest difference in life expectancy between Blacks and Whites (CDC, 2011). The Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ) conducts ongoing health-related research and also provides a yearly National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report (2010). Some highlights of its findings include: (1) Whites receive better care than Blacks on 40% of the core indicators; (2) Less than 20% of the disparities experienced by Blacks, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Hispanics showed any 19 signs of reduction; and (3) There has been almost no decrease in access to care disparities across all but one core measure (AHRQ, 2010). 2.3.3 State data. Maryland's Pacific Islander) comprise over 40% of the state's population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013a). Like many other state governments, Maryland's General Assembly passed legislation in 2004 to create an Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities (MHHD) in the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Chen, Mann, & Hussein, 2012). Because of advocacy and policy efforts to bring more attention to racial and ethnic health disparities, MHHD was charged to compile and distribute health and health disparities data; subsequently, it created the Maryland Chartbook of Minority Health and Minority Health Disparities Data. The three specific purposes of the chartbook were (a) to identify and measure existing disparities; (b) to determine the causes of these disparities and plan interventions; and (c) to track progress toward the elimination of these disparities (Chen, Mann, & Hussein, 2012, p. 1). The racial and ethnic categorizations employed follow the 1997 update of Directive 15 in the Federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB). First, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity status was established then people were classified as racial categories (Black or African American; Asian; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander;7 6 The term \"non-dominant racialized group\" indicates an alternative to terms like \"minority,\" which like many other racial terms is problematic (see fn 3 on p. 1, Chapter 1). Tashiro (2005) suggests using the terms \"racialized groups\" or \"racialized populations\" instead of \"race\" to indicate the imposition of racial characteristics rather than understood as an \"intrinsic quality\" (p. 209). 7 Because the population of Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders is so small (0.1% of the population) in Maryland, it is combined with Asian to create the category of \"Asian and Pacific Islander.\" The malleability of such classifications is apparent when considering this Asian/Pacific Islander categorization Maryland state government used was actually the national (OMB) categorization prior to 1997. 20 American Indian or Alaskan Native; or White).8 As the Chartbook indicates, racial and ethnic health outcomes in Maryland generally approximate national racial and ethnic health outcomes with White people having the best health outcomes relative to other racial groups. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks/African Americans were more likely to experience the following health outcomes: kidney disease (2 times), diabetes (2.3 times), homicide (7.7 times), and HIV/AIDS (10.9 times; Chen, Mann, & Hussein, 2012). Additionally, the infant mortality in the state is 2.8 times higher for Black/African Americans when compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanic/Latino women were 2.1 times more likely than their White counterparts to receive late or no prenatal care. The general Hispanic/Latino population experienced 5.4 times the number of new AIDS cases and 3.6 times the number of HIV cases. The proportion of American Indian or Alaskan Native women who received late or no prenatal care was 8.6% higher than their White peers. Asian or Pacific Islanders were less likely to have health insurance and more likely to have high cholesterol than their White counterparts. 2.3.4 Baltimore City data. Baltimore City data also reveal extensive racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities across multiple health outcome indicators. Non-dominant racialized groups (Black/African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Latino/Hispanic, Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander) represent over 70% of city's population (U.S. Census, 2013b). The Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) created the 2010 Baltimore City Health Disparities Report Card to report on overall improved health outcomes and, specifically, on the disparities between racial and ethnic 8 These are the only racial/ethnic definitions provided in the Chartbook, which thus result in an ipso facto conceptualization of race. 21 groups that still existed. An important component of the report clarified the difference between \"health disparities\" and \"health inequities;\" it defined the latter as a subset of the former and framed health inequities as a \"result of unfair and systematic social, political, economic, and environmental policies and practices\" which \"can be prevented and eliminated with appropriate action\" (p. 2). The Health Disparities Report Card focused solely on comparisons between Black/African Americans and Whites, probably because these two racial groups comprise over 90% of the city's population. In this comparison, Black/African American women have almost twice the infant mortality rates as White women, and Black/African Americans, in general, are more likely to have all types of cancer. The rates of HIV/AIDS are over seven times higher for Black/African Americans than Whites. Because Baltimore's Black/African American residents are doing worse on 21 of 29 indicators, the city received a final grade of \"D\" in the area of improving racial and ethnic health disparities (BCHD, 2010). 2.3.5 West Baltimore data. More specific detail and context surrounding racial and ethnic health disparities/equities are found by analyzing the social determinants of health in specific communities, such as poverty, inequality, the physical environment, and the \"causes of the causes\" (Marmot, 2005; Marmot, Friel, Bell, Houweling, & Taylor, 2008). The BCHD recently released a comprehensive report, Neighborhood Health Profiles, which contained major health outcomes, demographic data, and various social determinants for all 55 Baltimore City neighborhoods (2011). An example of a West Baltimore neighborhood is Upton/Druid Heights, whose population is over 93% African American. This community ranked in the lower third on almost all the report's 22 indicators. It had the lowest health outcome rankings in life expectancy, and in regard to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and prostate cancer. Additionally, when the social determinants of Upton/Druid Heights are compared to a predominantly White neighborhood, Roland Park/Poplar Hill, the comparison becomes starker. Among the most glaring differences are median income ($13k vs. $90k), family poverty rate (48.8% vs. 0.0%), and life expectancy (62.9 years vs. 83.1 years). Although these neighborhoods are less than five miles apart, their health outcomes, social determinants of health, and demographics are on almost completely opposite ends of the spectrum. 2.4 Conceptualizations of Racial and Ethnic Concepts The following section reviews the historical and present-day conceptualizations of race, ethnicity, racism, and Whiteness. Although these concepts are presented individually for organizational purposes, they intersect and overlap in the social milieu as part of the complexity this study attempted to examine. The process of conceptualizing racial concepts is critically important because of the various personal, institutional, and systemic definitions for each term that influence how it is operationalized. If a group of social workers or any other allied profession gathered to write down how each person conceptualized/defined race, ethnicity, racism, and Whiteness, the range of definitions would probably coincide closely with the number of participants in the group. However, there is often an implicit assumption that people from the same profession, race, or geographic area will discuss these, or any other concepts, in a similar way. Furthermore, a lack of clarity in the conceptualization, framing, and defining of such concepts will often create ineffective and incomprehensive solutions to social inequities. Ironically, race, and its attending concepts and outcomes, remains ambiguous although it has been 23 heavily studied. This ambiguity often arises as a result of the ahistorical and apolitical frameworks used to interpret this complex phenomenon. The historical and current spectrum of racial conceptualizations range from seeing race and White supremacy as foundational national pillars of control (Bush, 2007; Bonilla-Silva, 2001; Crenshaw, Gotanda, Peller, & Thomas, 1995), to framing race as a biologically-based concept with immutable and innate (\"natural\") social characteristics (Roberts, 2011; Zuberi, 2001). The ongoing challenges involved in defining racial concepts are accurately summed up by Shipler (1998): \"Discussions of race are imprisoned by words whose meanings we think we know label and circumscribe peoples and ideas, honeycombing the untamed world with an illusion of clarity and order. As if that were not enough, meanings shift constantly\" (p. ix). Identifying a static meaning of words/concepts is intimidating enough without accounting for the shifting interpretations of said words/concepts. The following sections discuss the interconnectedness of race, racism, Whiteness, and ethnicity across the political, scientific, and cultural spheres of society. 2.4.1 Race. The term \"race\" holds powerful political, scientific, legal, cultural, and social meanings, from both a historical and contemporary perspective (Allen, 1994, 1997; Byrd & Clayton, 2000; L\u00f3pez, 2006; A. Smedley, 2007). The current discussion focuses on three conceptions of \"race,\" which include \"race\" as a biological determinant, a social construct, and a color-blind approach to \"race.\" The first two conceptualizations (as a biological determinant and social construct) were created simultaneously and are still contested today. In other words, \"race\" was being socially constructed through its conceptualization as a biological 24 determinant, which produced common meanings associated with \"race.\" However, the conceptualization of \"race\" as a social construct occurred a posteriori to the social construction process. Because there is no clear over-arching consensus regarding \"race\" within or across disciplines, a historical perspective can provide important context to the issue. The biological determinant conceptualization often receives greater attention due to its major influence on how people think, talk, and understand racial concepts today. Although the biological conception of \"race,\" conceived as a hereditary gene or characteristic, has been disproven, its power to influence race-related issues and interventions is undeniable (Duster, 2003; Krieger, 2011; Roberts, 1997, 2011). This section focuses on the historical and present-day conceptions of \"race\" and how these influenced policies regarding health, immigration, and reproduction rights (Chase, 1975). The earliest meanings of \"race\" referred to the presence of common origins of descent or similar features within people, animals, and plants (A. Smedley, 2007). Between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, \"race\" was used as a system to identify, classify, and rank human differences. It evolved from a classification term (e.g., kind, type, variety, stock) to a major (subjective) signification of worth and group differentiation (A. Smedley, 2007). By relying on two justifications, religiosity and the enhancement of civilization through conquest, scientists incorporated social and cultural mores into the production of science (Omi & Winant, 1994; A. Smedley, 2007). While these justifications served their purposes during this particular period, more scientific/naturalistic notions of \"race\" soon replaced them to rationalize the belief in a racial hierarchy. 25 As early as 1619 when the first African indentured servants' arrived in Jamestown, Africans experienced individualized prejudicial treatment by the White colonists, although these behaviors lacked any \"systematic\" aspects. These soon followed, however, with the adoption of a 1639 legislative act permitting all residents of the colony to bear arms except \"Negroes\" (Higginbotham, 1978). During the late 17th century, two simultaneous developments occurred in Europe and North America that furthered the development of such racial distinctions. European biologists and physicians, such as Fran\u00e7ois Bernier, began assigning racial classifications; these classifications, however, did not have the same definitive, naturalistic emphasis as physics and chemistry because of the relative infancy of human classification as well as the inherent complexity of classifying humanity (Gossett, 1963/1997). At around the same time, the English philosopher John Locke espoused the virtue of people participating in their own governance, and promoted the idea of a \"social contract\" between government and the people (A. Smedley, 2007). However, it soon became apparent that this contract applied only to certain \"people\" (White Europeans). This narrow definition of the parties to the social contract is illustrated by the statutes developed in Virginia and Maryland during the 1660s to prohibit interracial relationships (Khanna, 2010). This legislation represents an early example of conceptualizing \"race\" through a combination of phenotypical (biological) characteristics and social influences (construction). During the same period, indentured servitude and enslavement formed key economic focal points for conflict in the American colonies (Allen, 1994). Because racial classifications and socio-cultural meanings still lacked significant development, 26 indentured servants included both Europeans and African Americans9 during the middle- to late-18th century. As a result, considerable labor solidarity existed between the two groups, leading to such protests as Nathaniel Bacon's rebellion in 1676 Virginia (Allen, 1997). Although it started as an anti-Indian campaign, the insurrection brought together the European and African American laboring classes to fight against abusive power dynamics, taxation, and slavery/servitude (Allen, 1997). In response, powerful economic interests in Maryland and Virginia attempted to prevent incoming Africans and Irish bonded servants from joining together (Allen, 1997; A. Smedley, 2007). These economic elites used various means to divide the working classes in the colonies. The tactics they used included bestowing privileges to Europeans such as the right to own guns and participate in slave patrols, and the possibility of becoming a member of the \"planter\" class (Bush, 2007; Du Bois, 1936/1979). Until the early 18th century, most racial differences in humans relied on classifying \"varieties\" (appearance changes due to climate and geography but within the same \"species\") rather than conceptualizing racial differences as fixed, innate characteristics found in dissimilar species (Gossett, 1963/1997). However, this view was contested as a result of European scientists' effort to further clarify racial classifications of human beings and begin the process of creating a racial hierarchy. Pseudoscientific fields that emerged included physiognomy (the study of the relationship of facial/body features to mental ability and inherent personality characteristics). Although it was later debunked, it influenced the development of other specific scientific fields such as phrenology (the study of connecting \"bumps on the skull\" to human characteristics) and 9 The terms \"African American\" and \"European\" are used here because at this point in history, a \"white\" race did not exist. 27 craniometry (which also correlated physical human features and personality/characteristics; Byrd & Clayton, 2000). During the mid-18th century, Carolus Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, created a classification of humans10 based on \"indiscriminately mixed physical features with supposed traits of character, disposition, and behavior\" (A. Smedley, 2007, p. 169). Shortly after the publication of Linnaeus' treatise, the connection between physical appearance and character/behavioral traits as innate, fixed characteristics began to gain influence in the scientific world. The work of George-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, and Johann Blumenbach (co-founders of anthropology) further solidified \"race\" as a legitimate aspect of natural sciences and developed a classification of human varieties (Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian, American, and Malay; A. Smedley, 2007). Blumenbach used his newly developed study of skull sizes (craniology) to demonstrate the superiority of Caucasians based on finding a single, large skull in the Caucus region of Russia and identifying it as the birthplace of Europeans (Gossett, 1963/1997). These various classifications included value descriptions, where White Europeans were described with positive attributes as a model for human superiority and the \"other\" race classifications were placed in inferior positions on the spectrum down to Blacks/African Americans (Byrd & Clayton, 2000). Concurrently, the first political economist, Thomas Malthus, in his 1796 Essay on Population, combined a critique of the English Poor laws 10 Linnaeus's four groups and descriptors included: (a) Americanus nostrils, scanty beard; obstinate, merry, free; paints himself with fine red lines; regulated by customs; (b) Asiaticus (sallow, melancholy, stiff; black hair, dark eyes; severe, haughty, avaricious; covered with loose garments; negligent; anoints himself with grease; sanguine, muscular; hair\u2014long, flowing; eyes\u2014blue; gentle, acute, inventive; covers himself with close vestments; governed by laws (Smedley, 2007, p. 169). As a reader can clearly see, some of the descriptors have definitive value-laden social meanings such as \"obstinate,\" \"avaricious,\" \"negligent,\" \"caprice,\" \"sanguine,\" and \"inventive.\" 28 with an analysis of overpopulation in England. His arguments contributed to the discourse in the U.S. about who deserved state-based support (Byrd & Clayton, 2000). By integrating racial classifications with social issues, \"race\" became further entrenched as a concept. As a result, some scholars have marked this period as the beginning of \"scientific racism\"11 through a biological-determinist lens, which led to further justifications for rank ordering humans by \"race\" (Byrd & Clayton, 2000; Chase, 1975; Washington, 2006). The contested meaning of \"race\" continued to exist throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Reverend Dr. Samuel Stanhope Smith, President of the College of New Jersey (which subsequently became Princeton University), wrote the first scientific studies about racial differences in 1787 (Byrd & Clayton, 2000). His work stimulated a conflict within Northern and Southern biomedical scientific circles throughout the early 19th century. The premise of Smith's article focused on racial differences within Biblical scripture but expressed the hope that Black people would eventually turn white as a result of being in a climate more conducive to \"Caucasian temperaments\" (Byrd & Clayton, 2000; Gould, 1981). Scientists challenged this Scriptural interpretation by using \"scientific\" theories rooted in the inferior nature of Black people and the racial differences in their origins (Byrd & Clayton, 2000). The concept of \"race\" received significantly more attention during the mid-19th century, especially as tensions over the constitutionality of slavery built prior to the Civil War. Books on cranial sizes indicating the racial superiority of White Europeans and the 11 Scientific racism is \"the creation and employment of a body of legitimately scientific, or patently pseudo scientific, data as rationales for preservation of poverty, inequality of opportunity for upward mobility, and related regressive social arrangements\" (Chase, 1975, p. 72; see also Byrd & Clayton, 2000). This will be discussed further in the Racism Section of this study. 29 racial inferiority of African Americans inspired the racial rankings of humans through scientific means or what Washington (2006) refers to as a \"hierarchy of humanity\" (p. 35). Medical, public health, and other helping professionals reflected these sentiments in their journals and in the mainstream media. In the 1850s, a nationally prominent doctor, Samuel Cartwright, was appointed by the Medical Association of Louisiana as the chair of a committee to study the health and physiological dispositions of Black people (Washington, 2006). He wrote extensively in medical journals describing how racial characteristics of \"biological inferiority\" were attributable to Black people. One particularly poignant example occurred, as part of his charge to identify Black \"peculiarities\" and diseases, when Cartwright scientifically described enslaved Africans who ran away from their captors as people suffering from a psychological malady, draptomania (from the Greek words for \"runaway slave\" and \"crazy\"; Roberts, 2011). Cartwright also identified another form of insanity, dyaesthesia aethiopis, to describe a lack of respect for the master or otherwise known as \"rascality.\" During the last half of the 19th century, the biological concept of race became more widely accepted. The emergence of statistical quantification soon provided additional justification for emerging racial classifications. The link between 19th and 20th century conceptualizations of \"race\" can be found in efforts to quantify and racialize hereditary differences. Francis Galton, who is considered the father of modern social statistics, was also the founder of eugenics in the late 19th century (Byrd & Clayton, 2000; Chase, 1975; Krieger, 2011). The central tenets of the eugenics movement consisted of beliefs in the permanency of race, the hereditary nature of all human attributes (social, biological, cultural), and the application of 30 evolutionary principles to biology to justify the idea that some races were superior (Zuberi, 2001). As part of the eugenics enterprise, Galton laid the groundwork for developing social statistical methods like regression analysis to rationalize a pseudo-biological racial hierarchy. Although Galton was British, a eugenics movement was concurrently building in the U. S. Charles Davenport, a Harvard-educated biologist and the leading U.S. eugenicist, organized the first Eugenics Section of the American Breeders' Association (ABA) in 1906 (Chase, 1975). Its members were scientific leaders in biology, sociology, and geology from eminent universities such as Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago, and MIT, who were charged \"to investigate and report on heredity in the human race\" and to \"emphasize the value of superior blood and the menace of inferior blood\" (Chase, 1975, p. 114). Davenport and his colleagues went on to reinforce the idea that physical appearance and personality/behavioral characteristics were connected by equating human genes with a specific \"unit character\" (hereditary information passed through the blood; Chase, 1975). As a result, a person's standing in society (poor, Black/African American, Jewish, epileptic) was directly associated with undesirable hereditary traits or what was referred to as \"bad blood.\" The concept of \"race\" became genetically relevant as a result of statistically measuring morphological traits (physical characteristics) and using them as \"biological predictors of social and cultural quality\" (Zuberi, 2001, p. 53). These biological conceptions of \"race\" reinforced previous racial ideas through the use of such terms as \"good breeding,\" \"inborn superiority,\" and \"inborn inferiority\" (Krieger, 2011), which, in turn, influenced the nature of systems, institutions, and individual social interactions. 31 As these negative characteristics and attributes became attached to Black/African Americans, new European immigrants, and other marginalized classes, they became internalized by the dominant classes12 and those deemed as inferior. Like previous and current conceptualizations of \"race,\" these pseudo-scientific attempts were challenged with hard scientific evidence disproving their veracity (Chase, 1975; Byrd & Clayton, 2002). However, the debunked beliefs of eugenicists and the biological conception of \"race\" continued to influence the social sciences, as well as U.S. politics, the legal system, and the process of policy development (Chase, 1975; Zuberi, 2001). For example, the informal \"one-drop rule,\" which professed that a person determined to have one drop of Black blood in their ancestry was considered Black, became a racial indicator of Blackness with the force of law (Khanna, 2010; Sharfstein, 2007). Depending on the state, an arbitrary percentage of \"Black blood\" (one quarter, one eighth, or one sixteenth) identified a person as Black for legal purposes (Sharfstein, 2007). Evidence of this practice persisting through the 1980s can be found in the case of Suzie Gilroy Phipps, a 43-year-old White woman who discovered that her birth certificate indicated she was \"colored.\" She challenged her racial classification on the basis of having one thirty-second \"Black blood\" but lost her case in the Louisiana Supreme Court (Omi & Winant, 1994). During the 1920s, many states adopted forced (nonconsensual) sterilization laws to limit the reproductive rights of criminals, \"imbeciles,\" and individuals defined as mentally retarded and mentally ill. This trend culminated in a Supreme Court decision validating the legality of forced sterilizations in Virginia, which led to the passage of 12 It is important to note that conceptualization of \"race\" not only dehumanized those identified as inferior but also provided an internalized sense of superiority to those in the dominant white racial group (Chisom & Washington, 1997). This will be discussed further in the section on whiteness. 32 similar laws in 30 additional states (Chase, 1975; Roberts, 1997). This legislative trend reflected the legal and social power of the biological conceptualization of race (a primary principle of the eugenics movement) and state-sanctioned power \"over the reproductive lives of so-called inferior Americans based on unproven genetic and scientific assumptions\" (Byrd & Clayton, 2002, p. 73). The biological conception of \"race\" also rationalized the segregation of the \"normal\" population from those deemed \"unfit,\" which in turn, affected several social domains such as health, housing, and education. During the same decade, the Supreme Court also ruled in United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind that phenotype (skin color) guided their decision rather than the biological components of \"race,\" which signaled a challenge to its dominant framing as a biological attribute (Chae, Nuru-Jeter, Lincolon, & Francis, 2011; L\u00f3pez, 2006). Subsequently, the biological-determinist conceptualization of \"race\" began losing its prominence to be replaced by. Park's (1950) sociologically-based conceptualization of \"race\" as viewed through the discipline of \"race relations.\" This referred to a racial social order upheld by customs and traditions (a \"system of evolving rules\"), which shaped relations between the races (Marks, 2008; Park, 1950). The focus on race relations was closely linked to the idea that ethnic immigrants could be assimilated into the customs, traditions, and rules of the dominant culture to form what became known as the \"melting pot\" (Park, 1950; Steinberg, 2007). In 1944, Gunnar Myrdal conducted a comprehensive study on \"Negroes\" in the U.S. funded by the Carnegie Foundation. Myrdal's An American Dilemma (1944) shed light on the socially constructed nature of race (L\u00f3pez, 2006/2007). Although his influential study convincingly challenged the specious nature of the biologically-33 determinant conceptualization of \"race,\" Myrdal ultimately minimized the manifestations of \"racial subordination\" and emphasized \"individual attitudes\" as the primary cause of racial prejudice (L\u00f3pez, 2006/2007, p. 999). Subsequently, the Supreme Court employed this conception of \"race\" as individualized prejudice, to overturn legalized segregation in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education (L\u00f3pez, 2006/2007). The decision raised questions about the individualized prejudice approach to \"race\" and how the embedded nature of White supremacy in U.S. society could be reconciled with principles of democracy and justice (Bush, 2007). By contrast, the civil rights movement of the 1960s attempted to highlight the structural nature of \"racial\" inequities (i.e., institutional racism), an idea that was met with resistance. Because of this resistance to examining the structural aspects of racial inequity, the conceptualization of \"race\" required revamping. The publication of Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan's history of New York City, Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians, and Irish of New York City (1963) laid the foundation for conceptualizing \"race\" as ethnicity13 (Bush, 2007; L\u00f3pez, 2007; Omi & Winant, 1994; Steinberg, 2007). Basically, Glazer and Moynihan (1963) presented ethnicity as a concept to connect the failures of Black/African Americans and Latin@s with their cultures (L\u00f3pez, 2006/2007). Consequently, this equation of race and ethnicity provided an implicit \"blood\" connection, removed White ethnics from the equation, and avoided an analysis of structural barriers to \"race\" equity (L\u00f3pez, 2006/2007; Steinberg, 2007). In other words, the resulting conceptualization of race, and by proxy racism, once again emphasized individually related characteristics creating a sort of \"blindness\" to the systemic power undergirding racialized outcomes. 13 The ethnic conceptualization of \"race\" will be discussed further in the Ethnicity Section below. 34 One of the more contemporary conceptualizations of \"race,\" and the associated concepts of racism and Whiteness, is \"color blindness.\" The concept first appeared in Justice John Harlan's dissent in the landmark 1896 Plessy v Ferguson Supreme Court case when he referred to the Constitution as being color-blind (Bell, 2004; Carr, 1997). Subsequent interpretations of the concept evolved as a result of several critical theoretical approaches to racial concepts such as critical race theory (Crenshaw et al., 1995), racial formation theory (Omi & Winant, 1994), and racialized social systems (Bonilla-Silva, 1997, 2001). According to several commentators, a color-blind and politically conservative conceptualization of \"race\" has emerged and gained momentum since the Brown decision (Bonilla-Silva, 2010; M. K. Brown, 2010; P. J. Williams, 1997). Wellman (2007) identified three tenets of coded racial language as part of this emerging color-blind approach to race: (a) civil rights legislation in the 1960s ended racial inequities in the U.S. by banning racial segregation and discrimination; (b) the failure by people of color (particularly Black/African Americans and Latin@s) in today's society is due primarily to their inability to take advantage of the \"racial equality\" created by the civil rights movement; and (c) many Whites, and some people of color who support the racial status quo, believe the U.S. is a color-blind society where there is little justification for race-based remedies such as Affirmative Action or the redistribution of economic and social resources (p. 55). These tenets are now employed to cover the re-emergence of justifying \"race\" as a biological category and distinguishing it from \"race\" as a social construct (see Satel, 2004). Roberts (2011) identifies the color-blind approach to \"race\" as inherently supportive of \"the new racial science based on genetics,\" where 35 commentators are able to conceptualize \"genetic race\" a \"Genomic science\" has now created a new acceptability for the explicit use of racial differences as they relate to health (Roberts, 2011). 2.4.2 Ethnicity. Ethnicity is often associated with the existence of a people who possess a collective ancestry and share \"cultural symbols and practices, including language, diet, religion, values, and norms\" (Lee, 2009, p. 1184). However, even when presented as an alternative to race, ethnicity is firmly immersed in the \"social vocabulary\" of racial concepts (L\u00f3pez, 2006/2007). Throughout the early- to mid-20th century, the validity of the biological and Darwinian conceptions of \"race\" was challenged, which resulted in ethnicity being used as an alternative way to explain \"race\" and influence its theoretical conceptualizations (Bush, 2007; Omi & Winant, 1994). Between 1885 and World War I, over 15 million European immigrants (predominantly from Eastern and Southern Europe) arrived in the U.S.; their arrival posed a threat to previously immigrated Europeans who were mostly English, German, Irish, and Scandinavian (Duster, 2003, p. 13). The latter group used their collective political and social power to restrict the immigration of Eastern and Southern Europeans culminating in the Immigration Exclusion Act of 1924, which resembled the earlier Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (Chase, 1975; Takaki, 1993). As a result, racially White Europeans (e.g., Russian Jews, Poles, and Italians) received similar treatment as Black/African Americans, which included prohibition from certain establishments, the inability to obtain certain types of employment, exclusion from leading universities, and being forced to live in unsanitary, crowded housing. 36 Omi and Winant (1994) identify three phases in the development of the \"ethnicity paradigm,\" which informed the predominant sociological approach to \"race\" for most of the 20th century. The first phase appeared prior to the 1930s, when the introduction of the concept of ethnicity challenged the explicitly racist assumptions of the biological-determinist approach to \"race.\" The second phase occurred from the 1930s to 1965, when ethnicity represented a liberal, \"common sense\" approach to race in which the concepts \"assimilation\" and \"cultural pluralism\" became relevant (p. 14). Finally, the post-1965 era ethnicity theory of race defended a position of \"conservative egalitarianism\" in order to combat radicalized identity groups. Currently, \"race\" and ethnicity are often used interchangeably, often with minimal conceptualization or definitional explanations (Drevdahl, Taylor, & Phillips, 2001; Lee, 2009; Williams, 1994). In a recent review examining how \"race\" and ethnicity are conceptualized, Moubarac (2013) identified four persistent and common problems associated with understanding these concepts. These include: (a) a failure of researchers to differentiate between the concepts of race and ethnicity; (b) an inappropriate use of racial categories to ascribe ethnicity; (c) a lack of transparency in the methods used to assess both concepts; and (d) failure to address limits associated with the construction of racial or ethnic taxonomies and their use (p. 104). Although the conflation of \"race\" and ethnicity hinders the conceptualization of either, several scientists and researchers today openly recommend using ethnicity rather than \"race\" as a way to avoid the historical legacy of scientific racism (Lee, 2009; see also JAMA, 2005, and Schwartz, 2001). Ultimately, the numerous racialized and unjust consequences of \"race\" and ethnicity, 37 such as the various forms of racism, often go unexamined as well. The next two sections briefly review the complementary concepts of Whiteness and racism. 2.4.3 Whiteness. The previously mentioned racial concepts (\"race\" and ethnicity) often receive most of the attention when analyzing race-related issues. Current approaches to \"race\"/racism are frequently framed through a \"diversity\" and \"cultural competence\" lens, which focuses on racially non-White populations and avoids naming the dominant \"White culture\" or the concept of \"Whiteness\" which underpins it (Yee, 2005). In one of its earliest conceptualizations, Du Bois (1920/1969) identifies Whiteness as a \"very modern thing,\" and \"an assumption\" characterized as being \"inherently and obviously better than brownness or tan [that] leads to curious acts\" (pp. 29-30). In an influential study conducted with White women, Frankenberg (1993) conceptualizes Whiteness as \"a set of locations that are historically, socially, politically, and culturally\" and, moreover, are intrinsically linked to unfolding relations of domination\" (p. 6). More recently, Yee (2005) defines Whiteness, within the context of social service organizations, \"as a complex social process that perpetuates and maintains dominant and/or majority group's power\" (p. 89). Early in U.S. history, the immigration and naturalization process was one of the many political and social arenas where contested racial interests emerged. In 1790, the first Congress enacted its first piece of legislation, the Naturalization Act, which codified into law that the right of citizenship existed for (and only for) White people (Martinas, 1998). The overt legal use of race as a categorical determinant of naturalization continued (in varying degrees) over the next 160 years when virtually all of our institutions were 38 created, until the Immigration and Nationality (McCarran-Walter) Act of 1952 overhauled the laws of citizenship (Martinas, 1998; R. M. Smith, 1999; Yamane, 2001). Concurrently, the legal concept of a \"White person\" became the standard for determining who could gain citizenship. Although naturalization was available for Black people after 1870, only one individual attempted to gain citizenship as a Black person and most of the legal challenges to entering the U.S. under White citizenship were initiated by immigrants from Asia or the Middle East (L\u00f3pez, 2006/2007). White Europeans, such as Russian Jews, Irish, Italian, and Polish shed their ethnic identity by accepting the mores of the dominant White culture in order to become \"American\" and benefit from White-skin privilege (Brodkin, 1998; Ignatiev, 1995; Roediger, 1991; Steinberg, 2001). Current census data reflect continuing patterns of \"Whitening\" for Asian and Latin@ immigrants (Gans, 2012). Whiteness has taken a prominent position as a racial concept because of its provision of privileges and relationship to social power (Frankenberg, 1993; McIntosh, 1990). While these privileges represent a manifestation of Whiteness, the underlying privileging processes found in the legal and health care systems, for example, offer opportunities to strengthen and reinforce those actual privileges. This racial ordering in the U.S. is sometimes referred to as a \"form [conceptualization]\" of racism vis-\u00e0-vis \"the institutional and cultural practices through which Whites14 strive to maintain their hegemonic position\" (Doane, 2006, p. 258). C. I. Harris (1993), a prominent legal race scholar, wrote a groundbreaking article examining the conceptualization of \"Whiteness as 14 People of color who are able to assimilate, or at least support the dominant cultural norms associated with whiteness, benefit from those privileges. Those benefits/privileges are not experienced in the same way as people identified as white but benefitting in relationship to other people of color who challenge or don't openly support the existing racial hierarchy (see L\u00f3pez, 2006). 39 property.\" She asserts that legal decisions/processes justified the protection of Whiteness as a legitimate concept and implicitly suggested that non-Whites should deny their racial identity to improve their ability to survive. The existence of this racial hierarchy is clear as an examination of almost every social indicator, such as incarceration rates, education, and health outcomes, reveals (Alexander, 2010; B. D. Smedley, Stith, & Nelson, 2003; Vaught, 2011). 2.4.4 Racism. As indicated in the previous section about \"race,\" the assignment of inherently negative/inferior racial characteristics to certain groups of people and inherently positive/superior attributes to a dominant group created inequitable social relations. Based on differential access to social power and resources, these circumstances between dominant and inferior racial groups existed before \"racism\" was applied as a concept (Byrd & Clayton, 2000, 2002; Chase, 1975). The actual term \"racism\" became commonly used in the 1930s to describe the Nazis' tortuous treatment of the Jews but was not used to describe the division between Whites and people of color until the 1960s (Fredrickson, 2002; L\u00f3pez, 2006/2007). A consistent theme in the early conceptualizations of \"race\" and racism often involved a distinction between its individual and more macro level manifestations (e.g., institutional, systemic, structural) of these terms. As early as 1881, Frederick Douglass conceptualized the omnipresent nature of racial prejudice and discrimination as moving from an individualized issue to a societal one, a reflection of the early and frequently contested nature of racism (Doane, 1996; Feagin, 2010). However, many of the mainstream conceptualizations of racism, both past and present, frame racism as \"beliefs 40 about races,\" with the associated concepts of prejudice as \"attitudes toward races\" and discrimination as \"actions against races\" (Bonilla-Silva, 2001, p. 22). Although conceptions of \"race\" and racism focused primarily on individual racial prejudice (individual racism), Ture and Hamilton (1967/1992) challenged this approach by describing the concept of \"institutional racism\" as highlighting the impact of institutional practices and policies, which are supported by \"covert\" individual racism. Additional macro-level conceptualizations include scientific racism (Chase, 1975), cultural racism (Bonilla-Silva, 2001), systemic racism (Feagin, 2006) and linguistic/discursive racism (van Dijk, 1993b). These contributions expanded the conceptualization of racism from a focus on the individual to an approach encompassing the various levels of society where racism can operate almost invisibly. G. C. Gee and Ford (2011) use an iceberg metaphor to illustrate how the various levels of racism operate, where the tip represents more obvious acts of racial and ethnic discrimination, while the most dangerous and least understood structural and policy-level aspects of racism lie beneath the water's surface. The researchers summarize the effects of limiting racial and ethnic analyses to the more obvious manifestations (e.g., individual), or not providing one at all, by stating the \"policies and interventions that change the iceberg's tip may do little to change its base, resulting in structural inequalities that remain intact, though less detectable\" (p. 116). Within the last decade, racism was conceptualized as a social determinant of health (SDH), which highlighted the minimally exposed structural aspects of racial health inequities identified in G. C. Gee and Ford's (2011) example above. The SDH approach emerged from the World Health Organization's (WHO) attempt to address health 41 inequities by expanding the conceptualization of health beyond health care access and treatment to include where people live, work, and grow old. Contextualizing health in this way accounts for various aspects of communities such as built environment, education, employment, and housing. Solar and Irwin (2010) created A Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health under the auspices of the WHO, which identifies structural determinants of health or \"root causes\" (e.g., racism, sexism, power distribution, unequal income distribution) and intermediary determinants of health (e.g., built environment, housing, education, employment, socioeconomic position). Comparatively, the structural determinants of health \"operate at the macro or system level and are embedded in ideology, governance, policies, and institutions,\" which intimately affect the intermediary determinants of health (Patychuk, 2011, p. 26). Conceptualizing racism as a social determinant of health creates opportunities to analyze various systems within a sociopolitical and historical context, thereby potentially increasing the likelihood of comprehensive and socially just interventions (Solar & Irwin, 2010). The final section of the literature review discusses various aspects of health policy related to eliminating racial and ethnic health inequities. First, a brief discussion about the history racial and ethnic health inequities provides a context for how the current work is undertaken. Next, the relationship between health promotion and racial and ethnic health inequities is discussed. Lastly, an overview of current health policy/health promotion agendas to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities, at various levels of society, is presented to review key documents. 42 2.5 Health Policy: Actions to Address Racial and Ethnic Health Inequities and Disparities In general, health policy changes direction over time \"depending on the larger balance of power, the changing interests of international players [or other the national, state, or city levels of players], the intellectual and ideological commitments of key individuals, and the way that all of these factors interact with the health policy making process\" (T. Brown et al., 2006, p. 66). The interactions among institutions, policies, provider/practitioners, and community residents intersect, to varying degrees, by first conceptualizing racial and ethnic health inequities and then creating strategic plans of action (policies) to address them.15 In a preliminary review of the initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities identified in section 2.5.3 below, a pattern emerged which revealed that U.S. policy agendas (on the national, state, and city level) put greater emphasis on the lifestyle theory approach (individually-focused exercise and behavior) when addressing the issue (Stone, 2006; D. M. Williams, 1989). By contrast, international conceptualizations of racial and ethnic health inequities reflected an increased willingness to address social power dynamics and structural-level issues that affected health outcomes for people of color. The following sections explore how policymakers have attempted to reconcile the conceptualizations of racial and ethnic health inequities through individual and institutional/systemic lenses. The first section briefly discusses the history of racial and ethnic health inequities. The next section focuses on health promotion literature and relationship to addressing racial and ethnic health inequities. Finally, the last section 15 I use the terms \"disparities\" and \"inequities\" here to emphasize the current lack of consensus in conceptualizing their meaning, as evidenced in the variations among the five identified initiatives. 43 reviews key initiatives attempting to reduce and eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. 2.5.1 Brief history of racial and ethnic health inequities and disparities. Racialized health care has existed since the founding of the U.S. when Columbus' arrival created a need for free labor in order to seize and secure resource-rich lands (Byrd & Clayton, 2000). Columbus proceeded to capture as many Indians from the Caribbean as possible in an attempt to enslave them, even as the indigenous people he found were \"free with their possessions\" and offered, \"to share with anyone\" (Columbus as quoted in Zinn, 1995, p. 3). Because of their susceptibility to numerous diseases and inability to fulfill the work demands, physicians of the day deemed Indians as inferior, leading to a reliance on African slaves because of reports indicating their physical fortitude (Byrd & Clayton, 2000). The initial health of potential slave labor, which was needed to support the economic needs of the dominant culture, therefore, became a key factor in supporting a fast-growing racialized society. The focus on health also reflected the ethos of an emerging racial hierarchy in the U.S. colonies as early as 1705. Higginbotham (1978) discusses how owners of White, Christian \"servants\" were required by law to provide them with a nourishing diet, a place to live, and clothing while African \"slaves\" held no legal rights to health, which left their fate in the hands of those committed to maintaining the emerging racial inequity and to keep their \"property\" alive for wealth accumulation. As this brief historical example indicates, racial health inequities have existed since the 17th century in what became the U.S. and were compounded by racism in other areas such as law, education, housing, and employment. Although the 1985 Malone-Heckler report is the common starting point for the \"official\" recognition of racial and 44 ethnic health \"disparities\" in the U.S., several earlier debates about race, racism, and health had occurred. During the same year as the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson \"separate but equal\" Supreme Court case (Kahn, 2013), Fredrick L. Hoffman, a statistician in the life insurance industry, made widely accepted statistical claims that Black people were inferior to White people and at greater risk for disease (Dell & Whitman, 2011; Gamble & Stone, 2006). However, W. E. B. Du Bois (1899/1996, 1906) countered with findings, which revealed that disparities between Black/African Americans and Whites were the consequences of a \"social disease\" resulting from racism rather than from supposedly inherent and inferior racial traits (see also Dell & Whitman, 2011). As discussed in the Racial Concepts section, the legal system also influenced the discourse and social understanding of racial and ethnic health inequities. After the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation trial, the plaintiffs in a case in the U.S. Court of Appeals, Simpkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, challenged the \"separate but equal\" clause of the Hill-Burton Act16 of 1946 (Byrd & Clayton, 2002). The court found in favor of the plaintiffs and ruled \"separate but equal\" discriminatory but narrowly tailored its decision to hospitals receiving Hill-Burton funding (Gamble & Stone, 2006). The federally sponsored 1968 Report of the National Advisory on Civil Disorders (Kerner Commission Report, 1968) identified limited or nonexistent health care for people of color as a precipitant of the1960s race riots (Knowles & Prewitt, 1969). These events, and several others, reveal the intersections of race, racism, and health. 16 The Hill-Burton Act was created to improve health care and health care facilities by providing $3.7 billion dollars of government funding between 1946 and 1971. The money often didn't reach the hospitals used by those who were most disadvantaged. Because it lacked an explicit systemic analysis of racial discrimination, the Hill-Burton Act's \"separate-but-equal provision actually \"institutionalized segregation where it had not existed\" for most of its first two decades in existence (Byrd & Clayton, 2002, p. 205). 45 However, most levels of government avoided identifying differential racial health outcomes as racial and ethnic health \"inequities\" or \"disparities.\" The 1985 Malone-Heckler report identified \"racial and ethnic health disparities\" as a state-sanctioned social issue, where improved health awareness/education formed the basis of its policy strategy. The report was criticized, however, for not including a political analysis or strategy to address racial and ethnic health inequities. Additional government agencies such as the HHS Office of Minority Health (OMH) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research on Minority Health were created as a result of the report's recommendations (Gamble & Stone, 2006). Although these offices provided greater visibility for racial health \"disparities,\" the political and legal discourse regarding racial discrimination shifted during the same time from the civil rights language of attaining equitable racial outcomes (affirmative action) to the concept of \"equal opportunity\" (access; Kahn, 2013). Subsequently, the individually-focused equal opportunity to access, rather than a historical examination of structural racialized outcomes, became the dominant discourse in the field of racial and ethnic health \"disparities\" (Kahn, 2013). Over the last fifteen years, racial and ethnic health inequities/disparities became much more prominent due in large part to the Institute of Medicine's groundbreaking study, Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care (B. D. Smedley et al., 2003). The study increased public awareness and visibility of racial and ethnic health \"disparities,\" which led to \"general system and cross-cultural education interventions to reduce [them]\" (Chin, Walters, Cook, & Huang, 2013, p. 761). The report drew attention from the political right, left, and center. Conservatives critiqued the 46 study for providing exaggerated evidence about racial discrimination being a cause of racial and ethnic health \"disparities;\" the political left critiqued it because of a perceived soft analysis of the ongoing racism within the medical field (Bloche, 2007). The historical and contemporary conceptualizations of racial and ethnic concepts play a role in how people interpreted \"disparate\" outcomes between races and ethnicities. 2.5.2 Health promotion and racial and ethnic health inequities and disparities. One of the earliest attempts to define health promotion through a social justice lens occurred in 1978 when the Alma Ata Declaration identified \"Health for all by the year 2000\" as its central theme and vision (Baum, 2008, p. 460). The Ottawa Charter of 1986 was another critical event in the history of health promotion; it brought together over 30 industrialized nations to create a vision for health promotion that expanded its awareness and educational functions to include building empowerment and self-determination with people who are most marginalized by poor health outcomes (Chinn, 2011). These historical events helped shape current conceptualizations of health promotion. The World Health Organization (WHO, n.d.) currently defines health promotion on its web page as \"the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health\" that \"moves beyond a focus on the individual behaviour [sic] towards a wide range of social and environmental interventions.\" However, the interpretations and implementation of this definition have varied across multiple dimensions. For example, a more conservative approach to health promotion may focus on emphasizing people's individual responsibility for their own health to ensure a reduction of health care costs, while a more radical approach sees it as a political vehicle 47 to alter the power dynamics between the state and individuals (Lupton, 1995; Rush, 1997). Although focusing on the empowerment of those most marginalized is a common focus of health promotion, Stephens (2010) identifies a need to examine the role privilege plays in the power differentials between the interests of professionals/policy-makers promoting health and the people in marginalized health contexts. In 1979, the Department of Health and Human Services created the Healthy People Initiative \"as a systematic approach to health improvement\" that \"encompasses the mutually reinforcing tasks of setting goals, identifying baseline data and 10-year targets, monitoring outcomes, and evaluating the collective effects of health-improvement activities nation-wide\" (Koh, 2010, p. 1653). Over the last three decades, the Healthy People Initiative has framed a course of action for health promotion and disease prevention by developing specific goals and recording the progress made toward achieving them (Koh, 2010). The four iterations of Healthy People and their key goals related to health promotion are as follows: 1. Healthy People 1990\u20141) decrease mortality rates and 2) increase independence among older adults 2. Healthy People 2000\u20141) increase life span of healthy life and 2) reduce health disparities 3. Healthy People 2010\u20141) increase quality years of healthy life and 2) eliminate health disparities 4. Healthy People 2020\u2014four major goals with one being to achieve health equity by eliminating health disparities (CDC, 2013, p. 91). 48 2.5.3 Initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities and disparities. Health promotion initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities are a primary policy tool to effect change. They lay the framework for conceptualizing the issue and developing actions steps to address it. Given the specious nature of racial concepts and considering their historical impact on health, analyzing policies that enhance our understanding of how racial concepts are defined can inform future policy creation. Additionally, each initiative provides a connection between individuals creating the policy, the institution and system promoting it, and the effects it has on communities. Because of this, these initiatives served as initial documents to be analyzed using critical discourse analysis (CDA), which are discussed further in the theory and methodology chapters. The following health promotion policies to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities represent city, state, national, and international initiatives. Baltimore City Health Department: Healthy Baltimore 2015. Healthy Baltimore 2015 is framed as a \"comprehensive health policy agenda\" that identifies specific prioritized health indicators in an effort to reduce \"morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life for City residents\" (Spencer, Petteway, Bacetti, & Barbot, 2011, p. 4). The priority areas include: (a) promoting access to quality health care; (b) creating a tobacco free city; (c) redesigning communities to prevent obesity; (d) promoting heart health; (e) stopping the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections; (f) addressing mental health needs; (g) reducing drug and alcohol use/abuse; (h) encouraging early detection of cancer; (i) promoting healthy children and adolescents; and (j) creating health promoting neighborhoods. These priorities were chosen after identifying those groups with the greatest \"health inequities\" as reflected in key social indicators such as 49 race, gender, education, and income. However, it is important to note that the document contains no definition of \"health inequities\" or concepts related to race. An overview of the policy reveals a commitment to \"varied levels of engagement\" and specific strategies to address the priority areas identified above. The levels of engagement include communication (providing health and wellness materials related to the priority areas), facilitation (participating in interventions such as \"wellness at work programs), and integration (considering the health impacts of \"business or policy decisions\" (Spencer et al., 2011, p. 5). Specific strategies to \"advancing indicators within each primary area\" will include policy development (creating and influencing laws, regulations, and policies to improve various aspects of health with a \"Health in All Policy\" philosophy), prevention/quality/access (will emphasize these as they relate to improving health), and community engagement (which involves informing, educating, and engaging Baltimore residents and communities; Spencer et al., 2011, p. 5). Each of the ten priorities are discussed in the document, along with statistics related to each health issue (frequencies/percentages) and various comparisons between demographics such as race (Black/White), gender, income, and education. The last section of the document presents overall goals for reducing/increasing a particular behavior or disease incidence (e.g., decrease smoking 20%). This is followed by the number or percentage of people currently suffering from each indicator and a proposed goal to strive for by 2015 (e.g., currently 28.3% of adults smoke in Baltimore City and the 2015 goal is to reduce it to 22.6%). Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities): Maryland Plan to Eliminate Minority Health Disparities. The 50 2006-2010 document focused on planning aspects such as initiating a dialogue to examine the causes, solutions, and potential barriers to addressing \"minority\" health disparities.17 The justification for a plan to eliminate Maryland health disparities includes: (a) the \"fundamental principle that all of our nation's citizens have a human right to health care\"; (b) the personal and economic benefit to individuals and the state; (c) the belief that improvement is possible in the area of racial and ethnic health \"disparities\"; (d) the assumption that \"the report makes an important contribution to the public discourse on minority health and healthcare delivery\"; and (e) the actions taken by the Maryland legislature which passed bills to carry out this plan [emphasis added] (Hussein et al., 2006, pp. 13-14). The Maryland Plan consists of six sections, which include an Introduction, Overview of Health Disparities, Health Disparities in Maryland, Challenges and Solutions to Eliminating Minority Health Disparities in Maryland, Conclusion/Future Plans, and Appendices. From the plan, four goals emerged, which focus on documenting \"health and health disparities; assisting policy-makers and researchers to identify focus areas; improving data collection on racial and ethnic groups; and establishing a baseline \"to measure\" the initiative's progress toward reducing health disparities (p. 14). Most of the 2006-2010 plan focuses on reporting differential health statuses between racial and ethnic groups. Unlike the Healthy Baltimore 2015 plan, the Maryland Plan includes a definition of \"minority\" health disparities, as they relate to \"burden of care.\" It defines disparities as 17 There are two plans, both are titled Maryland Plan to Eliminate Minority Health Disparities but with different 4-year time frames, the first is 2006-2010 and the second is 2010-2014. The former is more covers a plan to address several aspects of racial/ethnic health disparities while the latter reflects a \"plan of action.\" Please note the 2006-2010 version had \"Preliminary Copy\" printed on the lower left-hand corner of every copy I researched online and will use as part of the research. However, the 2010-2014 plan is a final version that synthesizes and reinforces the plan indicated in the 2006-2010 document. 51 \"differences in the incidence, mortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health conditions that exist among the historic [sic] disenfranchised minority groups in the state\" (Hussein et al., 2006, p. 11). There is also a short section toward the end of the document that discusses the need for cultural competence in the Maryland health care system, which is followed by a discussion of Maryland's demographic \"diversity.\" In addition, it describes current cultural competence efforts in the state include awarding funding for this plan, holding conferences on cultural competence, and identifying individuals to carry out the cultural competence agenda. The 2010-2014 Maryland Plan to Eliminate Minority Health Disparities discusses the state's progress toward these goals and updates the 2006-2010 plan. Additionally, an action plan, along with an implementation plan, is identified which focuses on the following five areas: awareness; leadership; health and health system experience; cultural and linguistic competency; and research and evaluation (Maryland Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities [MHHD], 2010). Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities. As mentioned in Chapter 1, in 1985 HHS released the Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health (Malone-Heckler Report), which presented one of the first acknowledgements by the federal government of the existence of racial and ethnic health disparities in the U.S. (Heckler, 1985). Because of this recognition of \"health inequities\" in communities of color, various government-sponsored initiatives to eliminate them began to appear. The HHS Plan defines \"health disparities\" as \"differences in health outcomes that are closely linked with social, 52 economic, and environmental disadvantage\" (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011, p. 1). The 2011 Action Plan represents one of the most comprehensive national strategic plans to address racial and ethnic health disparities and builds upon other national strategies to improve health such as the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Koh, Graham, & Glied, 2011). The vision of the HHS Action Plan is \"a nation free of disparities in health and health care,\" which complements the following strategic goals: (a) transform health care; (b) strengthen the nations HHS infrastructure and workforce; (c) advance health, safety, and well-being of the American people; (d) advance scientific knowledge and innovation; and (e) increase the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of HHS programs (p. 11). These are accomplished by following four \"Secretarial priorities,\" which include: 1. Assess and heighten the impact of all HHS policies, programs, processes, and resource decisions to reduce health disparities. 2. Increase the availability, quality, and use of data to improve the health of minority populations. 3. Measure and provide incentives for better healthcare quality for minority populations. 4. Monitor and evaluate the Department's success in implementing the HHS Disparities Action Plan. (pp. 12-14) United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD): Unequal Health Outcomes. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) is the U.N. body charged with \"monitoring State compliance\" 53 with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). The ICERD emerged in 1969 as the \"first major human rights treaty to enter into force as part of the international effort to codify the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)\" and it requires periodic updates from signatory states (H. Harris, 2008, p. 62). The U.S. became a signatory to the ICERD in 1966 and ratified it in 1994. By doing so, it agreed to the report's legal authority as the \"supreme law of the land,\" per Article VI of the U.S. Constitution. However, the U.S. used an implementation loophole known as \"RUDs (Reservations, Understandings, and Declarations)\" where it declared \"that the treaty would not be self-executing and would thereby require implementing legislation from Congress,\" thus limiting the binding nature of the treaty (H. Harris, 2008, p. 63). The U.S. government justifies this by claiming that the Constitution and current laws already put the country in compliance, for the most part, with the convention (treaty). In cases where it does not, the U.S. claims the right to defer to its laws rather than the treaty mandates, which actually contradicts the typical change process where domestic law should adapt and \"comply with international norms\" (H. Harris, 2008, p. 63). The Unequal Health Outcomes report (CERD Report) was developed by organizations and scholars because the U.S. government's 2007 periodic report failed \"to adequately discuss how racial discrimination prevents the enjoyment of the right to health and environmental health for people of color in the United States, nor does the [U.S. government's] report accept state responsibility for respecting, protecting, and fulfilling equal access to these rights\" (CERD Working Group, 2008, p. 2). The Unequal Health Outcomes report contains chapters covering an introduction; the extent of racial health 54 disparities in the U.S.; the role of government policies in creating and perpetuating health disparities; the adequacy of government response to racial health disparities; and key U.S. actions needed to address health disparities. The CERD Report conceptualizes race through racial concepts such as ethnicity, color, nationality, and descent. However, what ultimately distinguishes it from all of the U.S. efforts to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities is its broad conceptualization of racial discrimination that moves beyond the narrowly constructed \"discriminatory intent\" to the broader \"discriminatory impact\" (CERD Working Group, 2008). World Health Organization: A Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health. The WHO created the Commission on the Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) in 2005 \"to support countries and global health partners in addressing social factors leading to ill health and health inequities\" (CSDH, n.d.). Subsequently, a Social Determinants of Health Discussion Paper Series was created to follow up on the Commission's \"Health in All Policies\" goal in order to emphasize strategies, governmental processes, resources, and capacity development to work more effectively toward achieving health equity. A Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health emerged from the series because of its relevance to the conceptualizing focus of the study. Three broad policy actions on the social determinants of health inequities are identified as (a) targeted programmes [sic] for disadvantage populations; (b) closing health gaps between worse-off and better-off groups; and (c) addressing the social health gradient across the whole population (Solar & Irwin, 2010, p. 7). Actions that target the social determinants of health inequities reflect \"a political process that engages both the 55 agency of the disadvantaged communities and the responsibility of the state\" (p. 22). These actions are coupled with three complementary \"strategic directions\" that focus on the contextual strategies, intersectoral actions, and social participation and empowerment. An entire chapter is dedicated to defining \"health equity,\" \"human rights,\" and \"distribution of power\" as they relate to health policy. Health equity is defined as \"the absence of unfair and avoidable or remediable differences in health among social groups,\" where the primary onus to achieve health equity is on governments and support the empowerment of marginalized communities to gain as much control of the SDHs as possible (p. 14). Theories of social power are discussed, and race and ethnicity are conceptualized as \"social\" rather than biological factors. Racism is not defined but race and ethnicity are explained as \"one group benefits from dominating other groups, and defines itself and others through this domination and the possession of selective and arbitrary physical characteristics (for example skin colour [sic])\" (Krieger, 2001, p. 696). 56 Chapter 3: Theory 3.1 Introduction There are substantial challenges involved in systematically forming explanatory ideas (theories) and applying them to research around the issue of racial and ethnic health inequities. Consequently, balancing the connection between ideas and actions, theories and practice, is a key element in the development of an effective iterative process (praxis) that critically investigates the context of oppression (Freire, 2003). In our outcome-driven society, the underlying theoretical explanations of social issues such as racial and ethnic health inequities are given less attention than immediate actions to address these issues because of the pressures of time-sensitive funding requirements or other deadlines. Further, theorizing is frequently understood as exclusive to the academic realm; this assumption relegates knowledge production by everyday people to an afterthought. To support the application of a more inclusive definition of theory in the current study, it is defined as \"set of explanatory understandings\" used \"to make sense of the world, communicate that understanding to others, and thereby enable us to take informed action\" (Brookfield, 2005, p. 3). In this framing, ideas and theories that inform (consciously or unconsciously) personal and collective actions require not only a connection to practice but also the establishment of a link between the individual and structural manifestations of theory (hooks, 1994). The process of connecting theory and practice, and linking the individual and structural levels of society, occurs through what Freire (2003) refers to as conscientiza\u00e7\u00e3o (conscientization), which involves \"learning to perceive social, political, and economic contradictions, and to take action against the oppressive elements of 57 reality\" (p. 35). Rather than relying solely on understanding life through preconceived perceptions, often unchallenged or unacknowledged, an individual is better served by questioning long-held beliefs in order to recognize the contradictions between his/her perceptions of social oppression and the complex realities that create it. For people committed to social change, those contradictions offer opportunities to overcome the disconnection between theory and practice. In my experience, theory always felt depersonalized because of its overly academic language, which made it inaccessible. There seemed to be an over-reliance on the intellectual aspect of \"knowing\" instead of a more holistic approach, which would include the mind, heart, spirit, and active manifestations of theory in a lived reality. Intellectually, knowing comes from a book, video, or some other medium whereas the holistic approach includes a fuller context which includes experiential insights, usually interpreted through preconceived ideas. Although both are important, the latter often receives less attention in scholarly research. My ability to reflect critically on previously held individualistic ideas resulted from my increasing awareness of the contradictions between my experiences and those that were different from mine. As a result, my preconceived notions of self and other people as well as my understanding of complex concepts like racial power and oppression were challenged. The need to make sense of these contradictions and my admission to an MSW program (community organizing track) prompted me to engage in a personal theory-building process. My transition from several years in the military to a case management position working with youth suffering from mental health challenges, and later to a job as a community organizer while pursuing a graduate degree in social 58 work, provided me with the opportunities to question \"why\" and \"how\" injustices occurred throughout the world. The critical race-feminist theorist, bell hooks, provided me with an influential introduction that challenged my perceptions of theory and its application to living life. Her book, Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom (1994), was required reading in an MSW community organizing course. One of the chapters, entitled \"Theory as Liberatory Practice,\" both frustrated and encouraged me because, at the time, I was struggling to understand what it meant to organize and challenge structural forms of oppression, specifically racism, as a White male. In Teaching to Transgress hooks makes \"the personal, political\" by sharing her experiences as an African American woman in Kentucky during the 1950s and 1960s and her activist presence in academia. At the same time, she provides critical theoretical insights based on her personal experiences with racism, sexism, and classism, which occurred even before her personal theory was \"officially\" validated by an academic theory. Although our experiences were very different in many ways, my growing unease with the official, geopolitical discourse of war and peace prompted a deeper, more critical personalization that professor hooks identified in her own story. As a White child growing up in a middle- to low-income Maine family, education was continually presented to me as a \"way out\" of personally oppressive circumstances, a way to achieve the \"American Dream.\" My socialization often limited critical reflection about for whom that dream is intended, the context from which the dream (or its negation) emerged, or what forces continue to minimize people's exposure to critical and liberatory practice within their lived experiences. 59 By contrast, a critical and liberatory practice required me to reflect upon and challenge my own beliefs, while also taking collective action to rectify social injustices. Because hooks' life represented a historical perspective, or a lived theoretical practice so different from my own, it compelled me to critically challenge my social identities and power. The collective action was important in doing so because my individualistic approach to life often served to reinforce the persistent inequities occurring on the institutional and systemic levels of society. My purpose evolved into developing a personal theoretical practice, by collectively building relationships and advocating for social justice, which would create spaces to constructively question my social location in the context of particular identity-based ideologies such as racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, ageism, and ableism. While challenging my social identities and understanding my social location, or positionality,18 are necessary to employ a critical approach within the research process, contextual and ideological elements related to a study's topic must be considered as well. Deciding on topics, theories, and methods are political acts when considering the researcher's personal identities and ideas informing those decisions. In comparison with traditional theories, critical theoretical frameworks provide a basis to \"critique ideology\" and power, while also recognizing \"how uncritically accepted and unjust dominant ideologies are embedded in everyday situations and activities\" (Brookfield, 2005, p. 13). From a critical perspective, choosing a topic like racial and ethnic health inequities requires a willingness to interrogate my racial identity and its ideological meanings within a society consistently producing inequitable race-based outcomes. Most of the current discourse on racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities in the U.S. pays 18 The concept of positionality will be discussed further in the Methodology Section. 60 insufficient attention to the power transmitted by the discursive and ideological influences found in health promotion initiatives. Analyzing racial and ethnic concepts as part of efforts to eliminate health inequities adds layers of linguistic and conceptual complexity, which creates divergent definitions of these critical terms. Additionally, the conceptualization of race, racism, and Whiteness is further minimized because of the inconsistent definitions and usage of these terms (Paradies, 2006b). Consequently, the lack of clarity around racial and ethnic concepts further inhibits the ability to formulate critical research, policy, and programmatic solutions to racial and ethnic health inequities (G\u00f3mez & L\u00f3pez, 2013). Like all other theoretical frameworks, critical approaches have their limitations. A primary critique levied on postmodernism, and critical theories in general, is that they are able to deconstruct social phenomena but fail to present specific practices or alternatives to reconstruct what they critiqued (Allan, 2003). In order to avoid the \"critique without action\" shortcoming of some postmodern/critical theories, Collins (2011) emphasizes an explicit \"anti-racist framework\" that also includes ethical and transformative actions in support of social justice and the theoretical flexibility to accommodate the dynamic changes in how racism manifests itself throughout society. The current research relies on critical theoretical frameworks to investigate how the conceptualization of racial concepts is reflected within initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic inequities, and by practicing professionals and community residents. Further discussion in the next section contextualizes the concepts of language, discourse, ideology, and power as they relate to conceptualizing racial concepts in efforts to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. The discussion also includes the important 61 role that critical theories play as investigative tools in the exploration of the linkages between institutions and individuals that contribute to unjust health outcomes. Finally, the specific theoretical frameworks related to discourse, racialized social systems, and racial ideology are discussed, as they served as the guiding theoretical lenses for the current study. 3.2 Grounding Concepts The following discussion is a brief overview of key concepts included in the study. Additional context for each term follows throughout the entire theoretical chapter. Language, discourse, power, and ideology are interconnected theoretically and methodologically as foundational concepts to critical discourse analysis (CDA), racialized social systems (RSS), and racial ideology/color-blind racism frameworks. Each of these theoretical frameworks incorporates aspects of the grounding concepts discussed below because they all manifest in the creation, transmission, and understanding of health policy and communication to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. The institutions and individuals responsible for developing and operationalizing action steps in health promotion rely on multiple communication strategies to share ideas with their colleagues in order to create effective policies (Zoller & Dutta, 2008). Language, discourse, ideology, and power converge as components of policy texts, which are \"the central points of interaction between the politics of policy production and the politics of policy interpretation\" where text and practice intersect (Gale, 1999, p. 394). Additionally, the following chapter on methodology analyzes how language, discourse, ideology, and power operate through interactions among policymakers, professionals, and community residents. 62 While institutions and policymakers are the primary architects of initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities, professionals working in communities are the community-level gatekeepers who translate these policies into programs and practice. Community residents are the recipients of programmatic efforts to reduce health disparities, health promotion initiatives, and other consequences of policies. Yet, they often have limited input in the policy creation process. Furthermore, the research, policy, and health promotion strategies developed in a \"top-down\" manner often fail to conceptualize race, racism, and Whiteness clearly and comprehensively. This failure constrains actions to address inequitable health outcomes by narrowing their scope to individually focused interventions. The following discussion provides an overview of the concepts of language, discourse, ideology, and power in order to orient the reader to their interrelatedness and usage within the current study. 3.2.1 Language. Communication via language plays a key role in (re)producing, (re)interpreting, and (re)presenting racial concepts. Language represents a system of words and their possible combinations or what linguists often refer to as a system of semiotics (system of signs; J. P. Gee, 2011). The concept of semiosis relates to the process of \"meaning-making\" through signs that are formally and informally understood through language, either written or spoken. For example, when we read or hear a description such as \"an electrically produced light filtered through a red lens in the form of a traffic signal,\" there are certain linguistic meanings or \"social conventions\" associated with it such as \"stop,\" \"caution,\" or even \"delay\" (Titscher, Meyer, Wodak, & Vetter, 2000). Thus, language is a major component of understanding, transmitting, and interpreting social phenomena through words. 63 Traditionally, the field of linguistics analyzed language through a scientific approach focused on its internal grammatical structure, the meanings of words, and word sounds (Bourdieu, 1991; Fairclough, 2001). During the 1970s and 1980s, various critical linguistic scholars broadened the conceptualization of language by creating a theory of systemic functional linguistics (Halliday, 1985) and by including an analysis of its function as a form of social control and prejudice (Hodge & Kress, 1993; Tracy, Mart\u00ednez-Guillem, Robles, & Casteline, 2011; van Dijk, 1984, 1993a). For example, medicine, social work, public health, nursing, and other associated helping professions are sometimes characterized as forms of social control. From a social control perspective, the policies and programs administered by the corresponding professionals represent the linguistic and discursive tools intended to \"achieve people's adherence to norms of appropriate behavior,\" often unconsciously and unintentionally (Waitzkin, 1989, p. 225). The transition from a technical understanding of language to a more socio-historical, contextualized critical analysis, through a discursive lens, exposes the important concepts of ideology and power, along with their relationship to the social and political aspects of society. Hall (1997) points to the influence of Foucault's work (1972) in expanding the contextualization of language through discourse. It involves \"a way of representing the knowledge about\u2014a particular topic at a particular historical moment\" and \"the production of knowledge through language\" (p. 44). The next three sections expand on the concept of discourse and its relationship to ideology and power. 3.2.2 Discourse. Fairclough (1995) concisely frames the relationship between language and discourse by defining discourse as \"language used in representing a given social practice from a particular point of view\" (p. 56). As critical linguists expanded the 64 linguistics field from the narrow study of language to include the constitutive/contextualizing nature of language (discourse) and its contributions to supporting or resisting social injustices, critical discourse analysis (CDA) emerged to conceptualize discourse as a Fairclough, 2001; Wodak & Meyer, 2009a). Discourse is a social practice of creating meaning that simultaneously influences and is influenced by dialectical social relations to other concepts or objects where neither one is discrete from each other but is also not identical (Fairclough, 2010; Fairclough & Wodak, 1997). Conceptually, discourse has numerous definitions depending on its usage, field of practice, and methodological approach. The term \"discourse\" can refer to written and spoken language; to a specific type of language usage in a particular social situation (e.g., racial discourse, social work discourse, clinical discourse); or \"to different ways of structuring areas of knowledge and social practice\" (e.g., biomedical discourse is dominant discourse in health care whereas the social determinants of health discourse; Fairclough, 1992, p. 3). The latter example reflects the hierarchical aspect of various discourses, which demonstrates the manifestation of power (ability to reproduce and express) through the ideological aspects of language (Fairclough, 2001). The following comment by Fairclough and Wodak (1997) frames discourse as a theoretical component of critical discourse analysis (CDA) and a social practice: CDA sees discourse\u2014language use in speech and writing\u2014as a form of 'social practice'. Describing discourse as social practice implies a dialectical relationship between a particular discursive event and the situation(s), institution(s), and social structure(s), which frame it. A dialectical relationship is a two-way relationship: 65 the discursive event is shaped by situations, institutions, and social structures, but it also shapes them. To put the same point in a different way, discourse is socially constitutive as well as socially shaped: it constitutes situations, objects of knowledge, and the social identities of and relationships between people and groups of people. It is constitutive both in the sense that it helps to sustain and reproduce the social status quo, and in the sense that it contributes to transforming it. Since discourse is so socially influential, it gives rise to important issues of power. Discursive practices may have major ideological effects: that is, they can help produce and reproduce unequal power relations between (for instance) social classes, women and men, and ethnic/cultural majorities and minorities through the ways in which they represent things and position people. (p. 258) By conceptualizing discourse as a social practice/process, the social theory of discourse \"enables an analyst to build better connections between discourse's microstructures [texts] and the macrostructures of social institutions and society [discursive and social practices]\" (Tracy et al., 2011, p. 246). Prior to expanding on the concepts of ideology and power, the following summary of terms provide the reader with additional clarity related to various aspects of discourse:19 Discourse (abstract noun)\u2014language use as social practice Discourse (count noun)\u2014way of signifying and representing experience from a particular perspective (i.e. diversity/cultural competency versus racialized social system discourses of racism) 19 These definitions relate specifically to Fairclough's (1992) social theory of discourse. Other CDA scholars define these terms, especially \"discourse,\" in slightly different ways based on their theoretical and methodological underpinnings. 66 Order(s) of discourse\u2014totality of discursive practices of an institution [institutions], and relationships between them Discourse (discursive) practice\u2014production, distribution, and consumption of a text Discursive event\u2014instance of language use, analyzed as text, discursive practice, social practice Text\u2014written or spoken language produced in a discursive event Genre\u2014use of language associated with a particular social activity (i.e. going to the emergency room or interacting with child protective services) Interdiscursivity\u2014constitution of a text from diverse discourses and genres (Fairclough, 1993, p. 138). Particularly relevant terms often heard within and about professional disciplines include \"medical discourse,\" \"public health discourse,\" and \"social work represent a \"genre or social domain\" where all discourses associated with social work are grouped or the discourses employed by social workers (van Dijk, 1998). In other words, \"'discourse' is not simply a specific genre (like a parliamentary debate or a propaganda leaflet), but rather a socially constituted set of such genres, associated with a social domain or field\" (van Dijk, 1998, p. 196). Each of these disciplines also produces what some may call dominant ways of approaching research, practice, or education (e.g., evidence-based practice, positivism, bio-medical approach) that can become unquestioned traditions, knowledge, and practices within and across disciplines (Anderson & Grinberg, 1998). 67 3.2.3 Ideology. Ideology, like many other fluid, philosophically based concepts, engenders itself to numerous and varying iterations. The Oxford Companion to Philosophy (Honderich, 1995) defines ideology as \"a collection of beliefs and values held by an individual or group\" functioning \"as stabilization or legitimization of the status quo\" as well as using critique to deflect challenges aimed at explanations about ideological concepts like \"national ideology\" or racial ideology (p. 392). In the early 19th century Napoleon labeled those who resisted and challenged his authority as id\u00e9ologues. During the mid-19th century, through the influence of Marx and Engels (1970), ideology acquired a negative connotation as a mechanism for the dominant classes to retain their power. In their view, ideology was an aspect of \"superstructure,\" a means by which elites transmitted their beliefs, ideas, and cultural mores to the subordinate classes within a capitalistic system (Stoddart, 2007; Tesh, 1988; Thompson, 1990). In the 20th century, Gramsci expanded Marx's conceptualization of ideology to include its connection to the state. Gramsci referred to society's interconnected political, moral, and cultural entities as \"the sphere of the complex superstructures\" that acts as the ideological glue within a society as a whole, not merely in relation to class relations but also to other identity-based issues such as race and gender (Forgacs, 1988, p. 189). Another relevant concept related to ideology introduced by Gramsci is hegemony, where building collective consent, rather than violent coercion, operates as a form of ideological power (Gramsci, 1971). The concepts of hegemony (relations of power) and ideology are discussed further in the social theory of discourse section below. Thus, ideology acts as an important factor among discursive and racial concepts, which form the theoretical and methodological basis of the current study (Bonilla-Silva, 68 2001; Fairclough, 1992; van Dijk, 1998). Although ideology undergirds, and is influenced by, many aspects of society, it often receives limited attention within the study of inequitable health outcomes. The emphasis on ideology as a factor in racial and ethnic health inequities is an attempt \"to link an understanding of social privilege and injustice with an account of the production and circulation of culture and knowledge. Here, the social production and dissemination of knowledge secures our consent to systematic social inequity\" (Stoddart, 2007, p. 192). The next sub-section addresses the relationship of power to language, discourse, and ideology. 3.2.4 Power. A major reason for choosing discourse, racialized social systems, and racial ideology as theoretical frameworks, and critical discourse analysis as a primary methodology, is to examine how institutional power manifests in conceptualizing racial concepts through ideology and discourse found in policy creation and individual interactions. Ideology and power work flexibly together by permeating \"the social structure and to mold the terms in which that structure is experienced and perceived by all the participants\" (Jackman, 1994, p. 69). Although social power is found throughout the social services and the health professions, critiquing disciplinary power as it relates to policy often receives minimal to no attention (Waitzkin, 1989). Thompson (1987) connects ideology to asymmetrical forms of power (\"process of maintaining domination\"), which occurs when \"particular agents or groups are institutionally endowed with power in a way which excludes, and to some significant degree remains inaccessible to, other agents or groups, irrespective of the basis upon which such exclusion is carried out\" (p. 519). This occurs, for example, when a \"community forum\" is organized by a health department about how to address 69 health disparities and less than 10 participants attend because there was limited (if any) outreach to the \"community,\" writ large. Depending on a person's standpoint, this could be framed as a systemic failure to use institutional resources to mobilize a broader group of residents or community residents' apathy toward the process. Power resides in the language, discourse, and ideology chosen to guide how we frame why community residents did not participate and the subsequent actions taken to rectify the situation. Thompson (1984, 1987) conceptualizes power through an analysis of the relationships among action, institutions, and social structure. Action represents the ability to act on goals and interests, especially as the \"power to act\" relates to whether one is able to interrupt and/or change a particular process or string of events. Next, the institutional level increases the capacity of some people to exert more influence in decision-making and create a path with fewer barriers to achieve institutionally identified interests. Finally, social structure acts as a limiting mechanism to the power of an institution by creating social, cultural, political, economic, and identity (race, gender, etc.) limits, whereby individuals in institutions have flexible, yet confined, spectrum of actions and behaviors. Discursive practices, operationalized through disciplinary discourses such as medical, social work, public health, and nursing, exert ideological power within public spheres in the form of social control, whether intentional or not (Margolin, 1997; Waitzkin, 1989). On an individual level, the representative of a particular discipline (professional) communicates with people seeking services from them. Patients, clients, and social service recipients who receive professional knowledge are usually guided, directed, or mandated to carry out specific behaviors in order to address an individually 70 framed issue (e.g., illness, obesity, depression). Within this interaction, social control occurs (unintentionally or not) because the definition of the problem and subsequent solution are framed as individual issues rather than one influenced by institutions and systems (Waitzkin, 1989). This reflects the dominant lifestyle theory approach to health promotion solutions to racial and ethnic health inequities, where these can be solved through individual behaviors/choices to improve health status, without considering the political will and analysis of structural-level factors (policy creation included; Stone, 2006). Communicating these ideological representations repeatedly, and through various media (re)produces social power relations. Professionals generally accept lifestyle (individualized) theory as a key component of achieving racial equity in health (or most other social issues; Stone, 2006; Tesh, 1988). While lifestyle theory is necessary to address inequitable health outcomes, it is not sufficient. Taking language, discourse, ideology, and power into consideration, as part of building a critical theoretical basis, is necessary to examine how the conceptualization of race, racism, and Whiteness affects the health policies, professions, and communities working to eliminate racial health inequities. The next section covers the specific theoretical frameworks chosen to guide the study. 3.3 Social Theory of Discourse, Critical Theories of Race, Racial Discourse Framework Studying how racial concepts are contextualized within racial and ethnic health inequities requires the use of theoretical lenses to examine how communication among the state, institutions, communities, families, and individuals influences those 71 conceptualizations. The current study included together three interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks to connect the structural and individual interplay of discourse, racialized systems, and individual manifestations of racialized discourse. Social theory of discourse,20 critical theories of race (specifically racialized social systems [RSS]), and racial ideology/color-blind racism frameworks guided the analysis of how race/racism is conceptualized in initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. Fairclough's (1992, 1993) social theory of discourse, constructed specifically from a critical perspective (critical discourse analysis or CDA), provides a theoretical and analytical approach to understand the power of language (as discourse) to transmit dominant ideologies within written and spoken texts (Fairclough, 2001). These ideologies operate as unexamined \"common sense\" understandings, which inherently also operate through discourse to replicate dominant/subordinate social power arrangements at the individual and institutional levels of society (Fairclough, 2010; Reisigl & Wodak, 2009). Although Fairclough's theory is usually identified with studies related to capitalistic or market-based discourses, its use here provides a foundational theoretical framework from which to include additional CDA theoretical perspectives. Of particular interest is van Dijk's (1993b) social cognition/representation framework, which focuses on how race/racism is communicated among individuals and institutions, with an emphasis on how the \"elites\" use discourse to reproduce self-benefitting ideas and maintain their position of dominance. The inclusion of both the social theory of discourse 20 The social theory of discourse will lay the groundwork for using critical discourse analysis (CDA) as both a theory and method. 72 and social cognition/representation framework allowed a broader coverage of the less linguistically technical aspects21 of each theoretical framework to guide the research. RSS offered a theoretical framework in the tradition of race critical theories by focusing on racializing ideological processes within social systems and how racial interests develop, thus leading to racial contestation (Bonilla-Silva, 1997, 2001). Subsequently, racial hierarchy and categorization become social ordering mechanisms where the dominant race has the access and resources to interpret, define, (re)produce, and reinforce racialized representations within social systems. A particularly important aspect of RSS is its framing of race, racism, and racial structure. By conceptualizing them as pliable concepts within racializing processes (racialization), their meanings may change across time and social context but the inequitable racial outcomes remain the same. Bonilla-Silva (2001) offers a poignant example by comparing the overt racism carried out during the Jim Crow era and the more indirect racism (racially color-blind policies) of the post-Civil Rights era, which employed more hegemonic (coercion by consent) methods rather coercion by force during Jim Crow. Although different means were employed, the dominant race (White racial identity) assumed the position of privilege while people of color were relegated as subordinate (dominated) races. The final theoretical framework addressed in this section focuses on racial ideology, specifically color-blind racism. Bonilla-Silva (2010) asserts that color-blind racism is the current and dominant ideological framing of race/racism/Whiteness. It ascribes inequitable race-based outcomes to some other cause besides the privileging of Whiteness and the marginalization of people of color within a racial hierarchy. For 21 Because I am not formally trained as a linguist, I will focus more on discourse as a discursive practice and social practice rather than an in-depth theoretical analysis of linguistic and grammatical conventions. 73 example, policymakers, practitioners, and researchers explain the inequitable outcomes experienced by people of color in the areas of health, education, and criminal justice as the consequences of their failure to work hard enough, take sufficient personal responsibility, or in terms of some explanation of inferiority other than race. By identifying the current racial ideology as color-blind racism, Bonilla-Silva (2010) highlights how the manifestations of racial concepts evolve, both through and between the interactions of systems, institutions, and individuals. Additionally, the color-blind racism framework contains four racial frames: abstract liberalism, naturalization, cultural racism, and minimization of racism which provided concrete theoretical references to guide the analyses of both the policies designed to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities and the interviews that were conducted with social welfare/health professionals. The current research specifically explored how social service/health professionals discursively conceptualize within institutional policies to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities and racial concepts also. As stated above, the theoretical frameworks that guided the current research included a social theory of discourse (critical discourse analysis), racialized social systems (RSS), and racial ideology/color-blind racism. These are discussed, at length, in the next section. 3.3.1 Social theory of discourse. The social theory of discourse offered a theoretical approach to underpin a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of health policy initiatives and qualitative interviews as a \"social practices\" (Fairclough, 1992, 1993). Most CDA approaches are considered theory/methods, where the theory (social theory of discourse) complements the method (CDA). Fairclough's (1992) social theory of 74 discourse combines elements of Foucault's approach to discourse and the concept of intertextuality. Prior to discussing the four components that comprise the social theory of discourse (text, discursive practice, social practice, and discursive change), Foucault's influence on Fairclough's theory will be discussed to provide a theoretical context. This also provided an example of intertextuality and interdiscursivity\u2014that is, some discourse from Foucault's approach is incorporated into Fairclough's theory, which results in an overlapping/intersecting of discourses also known as intertextuality and interdiscursivity. (See below for additional discussion.) Influence of Foucault. Michel Foucault was a French philosopher and historian, who focused on the intersecting functions and processes of discourse, power, and knowledge. His emphasis on discourse in earlier works was an attempt to transcend the dominant investigative modes (structuralism and hermeneutics) of the mid-20th century (McHoul & Grace, 1997). By doing so, he focused his research on the structural linguistic system of formal word analysis, grammatical rules, and conventions. That is, he focused on \"how\" language assumed its status as a \"system and structure\" of representation and not through a purely descriptive investigation (McHoul & Grace, 1997, p. 14). Foucault's earlier work is often identified as archeological while his later work is considered genealogical, where truth and power formed the basis for understanding discourse. Truth, in the archeological phase, is to be understood as \"a system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribution...and operation of statements\" whereas the genealogical phase connected truth to a \"circular relation with systems of power which produce and sustain it...\" (Rabinow, 1984, p. 74). Bringing together the 75 meaning-making found in various forms of \"ordered procedures\" with \"systems of power\" formed what Foucault referred to as \"regimes of truth\" and constitute a key concept in his approach to discourse (Rabinow, 1984). Foucault's specific influence on Fairclough's (1992) social theory of discourse ranges across his archeological and genealogical research. From Foucault's major archeological work, The Archeology of Knowledge (1972), Fairclough (1992) highlights his framing of discourse as constitutive of \"'objects' and social subjects\" (p. 55). Intertextuality and interdiscursivity also influence the social theory of discourse by emphasizing the incorporation of previous texts and discursive elements. For example, some of the contemporary literature on health inequities reflects an attempt to move from a narrow focus on health care access and language barriers to an approach that emphasizes the social determinants of health. Although the language and actual principles may change, it is important to understand and acknowledge that other discourses informed the creation of the new approach as a way to better understand how it will frame the issue itself and the possible interventions. Foucault's (1979) genealogical work brought to the fore a transition from analyzing the systemic nature of discourses (with discourse as the focal point) to a focus on \"systems of power,\" specifically \"the discursive nature of power\" found in practices, policies, regulations, etc. (Fairclough, 1992, p. 55). Of particular importance to the current study is his work around the disciplinary power created within institutions through discursive practices (Anderson & Grinberg, 1998; McHoul & Grace, 1993). Foucault (1979) considers discursive practices (the processes of production, distribution, and consumption) as the linkage between knowledge and power, which disciplinary 76 practices and organizational discipline (order) use to support a controlled environment (Andersen & Grinberg, 1998). Control within organizations that represent social work, public health, and medicine often employ both bureaucratic and concertive control, where the former uses supervisory/management and the latter relies on worker consensus to support self-regulating directives (Barker, 1993; also see Andersen & Grinberg, 1998). The disciplinary discourse within these various interactions produces self-replicating and taken-for-granted \"ways of doing things,\" often permitting little discussion which critiques the veiled social power dynamics. The social welfare/health professionals interviewed for this study were exposed to somewhat different forms of discourse related to racial and ethnic health inequities (education, best practices, personal experiences, etc.). Although there are differences in exposure to and understanding of race-related discourses in health, Foucault (1979) would argue there are similar structured ways professionals and service recipients would relate to each other and to various aspects of racial and ethnic health inequities. However, there are also particular \"orders of discourse\" among these disciplines, and society as a whole, where \"an order of discourse of a social domain refers to the totality of discourse type and the relationships between them in this domain\" (Titscher et al., 2000, p. 149). The social domains (i.e., professional disciplines, institutional settings) of social work and nursing have different and similar discursive \"elements\" (parts of orders of discourse such as genres, styles, vocabularies, conventions, etc.) that intersect when producing or interpreting new texts, which is also known as \"interdiscursivity\"22 (Fairclough, 1992, 2010). The interpretation of racial concepts exists within policies, 22 Interdiscursivity and intertextuality will be discussed further in sections below regarding the dimensions of discourse (text, discursive practice, social practice, discursive change). 77 which address racial equity in professional practice in communities, and in the perceptions of residents living in those communities. These orders of discourse then become sites for investigating the interdiscursive meanings between the individual and societal levels, between professions/disciplines, and within the hegemonic struggles that result from competing discourses (Fairclough, 2010). Like other theoretical approaches to CDA, the social theory of discourse frames discourse through a particular lens. As mentioned earlier in this section, Fairclough (1992) identifies discourse as a social practice, which implies an action component. Additionally, discourse operates as a dialectical component (that is, it constitutes aspects of social structure and is constituted by it), where the construction of identities, social relationships, and systemic production of knowledge and beliefs occurs. Most important to the social theory of discourse are the political and ideological practices influenced by discourse that subsequently affect power relations and struggles among policymakers, professionals, and community residents, including the possible intersections between them. In other words, \"discursive practice draws on conventions which naturalize particular power relations and ideologies, and these conventions themselves, and the ways in which they are articulated, are a focus of struggle\" (Fairclough, 1992, p. 67). The social theory of discourse conceptualizes discourse through three dimensions: text, discursive practice, and social practice (the process of connecting discourse to ideology, power, and hegemony; Fairclough, 1992). Each dimension represents a particular phase of the analysis: (a) text\u2014descriptive; (b) discursive/discourse practice\u2014interpretation; (c) discursive change.23 The 23 Although discursive change is not identified on Figure 1, it is an important aspect of the social theory of discourse (CDA). Due to the \"critical\" nature of this particular theory/methodology, researchers/scholars 78 dimensions are not mutually exclusive but complementary. Examining the production and interpretation of texts provides opportunities to analyze discursive and social practices, which is one of the ways the social theory of discourse (CDA) differentiates itself from traditional discourse or linguistic theories (Fairclough, 1992, 2010). Figure 3.1 presents an adapted version (Titscher et al., 2000) of Fairclough's three dimensions of discourse and how they overlap, which are discussed in the following sections. Text dimension. As indicated earlier in this chapter, a text is a written or spoken result of a discursive event, which Fairclough (2010) expanded to include other forms of semiosis (meaning-making) such as visual images and sounds found in \"television language\" (Titscher et al., 2000, p. 148). Language forms the basis of texts; it socially shapes (constitutes) social identities, social relations, and systems of knowledge and belief (Fairclough, 1993). This approach highlights the multidimensional functions of language, where the form and meaning/content of texts are mutually important to understand their descriptive qualities. Whereas scholars of linguistics and communication attempt to keep the \"form\" and \"meaning/content\" of texts mutually exclusive, Fairclough (1992) emphasizes their interrelatedness; he argues that both must be considered in order to understand each one individually. For example, people who organize for racial health equity and advocate for structural change may be labeled as \"rabble-rousers,\" \"socialists,\" \"racists,\" or in extreme cases \"terrorists.\" On the other hand, people benefitting or who agree with their efforts label these same people as \"heroes,\" \"transformational leaders,\" \"change agents,\" and in juxtaposition to \"terrorist,\" \"freedom fighter.\" The social theory of discourse bases its analysis on determining the ascribe to explicitly addressing social inequities and contributing to socially changing root causes are important components of discursive change (Fairclough, 1992, 2010; van Dijk, 1993b; Wodak & Meyer, 2009b). 79 social motivation behind the use of these terms; this requires attention to both the form and meaning/content of text. Text \"form\" is basically the expression of previous discursive practices (through texts), which are solidified as \"conventions\" (linguistic/discursive rules) and then are embodied with \"meaning potential\" (Fairclough, 1992, p. 75). Texts usually consist of four ascending features: (a) vocabulary (individual words); (b) grammar (words Figure 3.1. Dimensions of discourse and discourse analysis (adapted from Fairclough, 1992, and Titsch et al., 2006). 80 combined into sentences and clauses); (c) cohesion (how the sentences and clauses are connected; and (d) text structure (large scale organizing properties of texts; Fairclough, 1992). Because texts often contain multiple, complex \"forms\" and \"meanings,\" people interpreting the texts frequently assign a particular meaning based on familiarity with the text form and its previously understood meanings. Subsequently, texts form reflects the discursive and social practices found in society-at-large, which creates a spin-cycle inertia among these three dimensions. For example, when racial concepts are discussed in journal articles, newspapers, in television interviews, etc., an actual term like \"racial bias\" within a text contains various meanings when formed by the author. Furthermore, the reader or watcher also interprets \"racial bias\" in context by assigning (consciously or not) particular meanings to the term. Often the analysis concludes at what meaning is assigned to \"racial bias.\" By contrast, what the social theory of discourse attempts to do is interrogate the underlying ways texts are produced (discursive practices) while revealing the ideological/social power elements inherent within texts (discourse as a social/sociocultural practice). Discourse as a discursive practice is the second dimension of the theory and is covered in the next section. Discursive practice dimension. As illustrated in Figure 3.1, discursive practice is a connector between the text and social practice dimensions (Titscher et al., 2006). Theoretically, Fairclough (1992) emphasizes the complementary relationship between the text dimension and the discursive practice (interpretation) dimension. Here, the text is the product of a text creation process (policy, speaking engagement, research interview, etc.) and a resource for text interpretation (Fairclough, 2001). Discourse as a discursive 81 practice \"involves processes of text production, distribution, and consumption, and the nature of these processes varies between types of discourse according to social factors,\" whereby the context of these processes can shift the eventual text product (Fairclough, 1992, p. 78). Analyzing discursive practices supports an examination of how these various perspectives and identities manifest in discourse through the socio-cognitive realm, as reflected within their vocabulary, grammar, cohesion, and text structure (Blommaert & Bulcaen, 2000; Fairclough, 1992; van Dijk, 2000). The socio-cognitive influences of text production and interpretation (discursive practice) focus on the internalized resources of individual text producers and the actual text, which includes \"traces\" of the production process and \"cues\" for the interpretation process (Fairclough, 1992). As a result, social cognitions provide a connecting point between the individual and institutional/systemic levels of society, in addition to providing a linkage between discourse and the utilization of social power (unintentionally or not) in the maintenance of social inequity (dominance; van Dijk, 1984, 1993c). Examining the cognitive \"cues\" and \"traces\" represents the necessary micro-analysis (explaining the \"how\" of producing and interpreting texts), which is then combined with a complementary macro-analysis (investigating the discursive resources, i.e., the orders of discourse), to form the theoretical basis for analyzing discursive practices (Fairclough, 1992). Beyond the \"traces\" and \"cues\" found in the text production and interpretation, the concepts of intertextuality and interdiscursivity are critical for understanding discourse as a discursive practice, in relation to text creation and establishing connections to the third dimension of discourse as a social practice (see next section). Foucault 82 (1972/2010) best described intertextuality and interdiscursivity by stating, \"There can be no statement that in one way or another does not reactualize others (ritual elements in a narrative; previously accepted propositions in a demonstration; conventional sentences in a conversation)\" (p. 98). Fairclough (1992) similarly identifies intertextuality and interdiscursivity as concepts representing the \"reactualization\" process of carrying forward previous aspects of discourse (parts of previous texts, discursive practices, ideological components, social power) into subsequent texts and discourses. Specifically, intertextuality refers to the explicit transposing or merging of portions (quotations, using specific phrases) of preceding text(s) into the creation of another text(s), which establishes an important historical linkage between and among them (Fairclough, 1992; Reisigl & Expanding on intertextuality, interdiscursivity emphasizes \"the normal heterogeneity of texts in being constituted by combinations of diverse genres and discourses\" and, like intertextuality, revealing \"a historical view of texts as transforming the past\u2014existing conventions, or prior texts\u2014into the present\" (Fairclough, 1993, p. 137). A hypothetical announcement to recruit people to the MSW program, \"Make a Difference in Baltimore Communities by Earning a MSW,\" reflects an example of Fairclough's (2010) application of the concept of interdiscursivity. Because this headline is an attempt to encourage individuals to take certain actions (apply to an educational program and contribute to Baltimore communities), there are intersecting promotional and social work genres (elements of orders of discourse; elements being the \"genres\" and orders of discourse being \"promotional\" and \"social work\"). The promotional genres include the eye-catching headline and personalization (implicitly referring to \"you\" and 83 your potential interest in supporting Baltimore communities); the personalization also draws from a \"conversational genre\" and adds to the \"interdiscursive mix\" (p. 102). Both intertextuality and interdiscursivity represent key theoretical and analytical components of discourse as a discursive practice because of their inherent historical connection to the previous texts, in addition to the connection between micro- and macro-levels of society (Fairclough, 1993). As a result, discourse as a discursive practice is a mediating dimension between discourse as text, and the next dimension, discourse as a socio-cultural/social practice. To illustrate, consider the various components of the process involved in submitting a journal article: coordinating with co-authors (if not authored alone), complying with page number limitations, and including theories recognizable to the editorial board. All these contextual components (and more) affect the eventual text production process and product. These aspects are magnified further when considering large, interagency policymaking efforts, such as those found in initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. Both the people (producers) and social context are primary components of discursive practices through which production, distribution, and consumption occurs. The various producers of texts, especially those in high profile organizations such as the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, and the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities) employ strategic communication plans to distribute policies and reports by considering the various consumers of the knowledge presented. Fairclough (1992) identifies \"addressees\" (the 84 primary focus of a text), \"hearers\" (secondary audiences), and \"overhearers\" (not \"official\" audience members but those considered \"de facto consumers\") as the three types of consumers of larger type policies (pp. 79-80). Professionals and community residents obviously have different perspectives about where they are in relationship to the consumption of policies, reports, and interventions, depending on their socio-cognitive understanding of the texts content and numerous personal factors such as their lived experiences, social position, race, gender, class, etc. Sociocultural and social practice (ideology and hegemony) dimension. Discourse as a social practice is the third dimension of the social theory of discourse, which further expands language use from text creation and discursive practices to the socio-cultural dimension of society. Social practice, as a concept, indicates fluid movement between the perspectives of social structure and social action/agency (Fairclough, 2010). Discourse operates broadly within social practices in several ways: (a) through the production of cultural, political, and economic aspects of social life; (b) through individual discursive practices manifest within a network, and in relationship with, other practices \"where these 'external' relationships determine its 'internal' constitution,\" a recontextualization of discourse; and (c) through reflexive discursive practices, as \"people always generate representations of what they do as part of what they do,\" i.e., by creating identities such as race, gender, and class (Chouliaraki & Fairclough, 1999, p. 22; see also Fairclough, 2010). Expanding the theoretical basis of discourse to a social practice allows the researcher to investigate two commonly avoided concepts, ideology and power,24 and connect them to the language, texts, and discursive practices. 24 The concepts, and their relationship to each other, were discussed earlier in the key concepts section. 85 The social theory of discourse frames ideology as intimately connected to the socio-historical context of discourse, specifically where discursive meaning-creation is linked to maintaining and reproducing domination (Fairclough, 1992; Thompson, 1984, 1990). Ideology is theorized and analyzed through discursive formations and is conceptualized here in relation to three concepts: (a) \"meaning\" production; (b) conceptualization of domination; and (c) how meaning serves to create and reinforce social relations of domination (Thompson, 1984, 1990). Ideologies are produced and conceptualized through language as meaning, which leads to knowledge production through discourse(s), so that discourse is not only a linguistic phenomenon but also a social practice (Fairclough, 1992). Consequently, not only do ideologies reproduce imbalances of power and domination, liberatory or resistance ideologies can often counteract and shift dominant ideologies. In sum, ideologies are \"significations/constructions of reality (the physical world, social relations, social identities), which are built into various dimensions of the forms/meanings of discursive practices, and which contribute to the production, reproduction or transformation of relations of domination\" (Fairclough, 1992, p. 87). Within these ideological significations lies inherent power to influence subsequent actions, secure resources, and maintain inequitable power relations. In addition to ideology, power (in the form of hegemony) is a key theoretical concept to understanding discourse as a socio-cultural/social practice. Gramsci (1971) defined hegemony as the process of the economically dominant classes (or those whose dominance is based on other identities, such as gender and race) seeking to expand their influence beyond economics, with a particular focus on the cultural realm, by building 86 cross-class (or cross-racial, cross-gender) consent via ideological and discursive vehicles such as policies, laws, and moral imperatives (Forgacs, 1988). Creating consent, rather than coercion through state-sanctioned force and violence, requires a wide array of communicative tools to convince people to accept socially accepted (\"common sense\") values while voluntarily participating in an oppressive system (Stoddart, 2007). Conceptualizing discourse as a social practice highlights how those mechanisms of discursive power \"manufacture consent\" (Fairclough, 2001). Hegemonic power lies in its ability to produce a \"common sense\" understanding of taken-for-granted actions and relationships. This process is different from conceptualizing ideology as a cohesive collection of thoughts (Stoddart, 2007). Critical to understanding the influence of hegemony, in the context of ideology, is the distinction between coercion and consent as forms of social power, where coercion represents state-sanctioned force and consent occurs by convincing people to accept socially accepted values while voluntarily participating in an oppressive system (Stoddart, 2007). Hegemonic power serves, therefore, as a mechanism through which the cultural and moral \"common sense\" ideology manifests itself (Forgacs, 1988). The result is a leadership of consent, where the population willingly accepts oppressive dictates that benefit those people and institutions who produce them, leading to persistent dominant relations (Forgacs, 1988; Stoddart, 2007). These common sense messages produce a collective understanding, which after discursive repetition and continual usage, become accepted and normalized knowledge. Discursive change. Another important of quality of CDA, in general, and a social theory of discourse specifically, is its commitment to framing discourse as a site for 87 social change. Fairclough (1993) identifies the hegemonic struggles between orders of discourse as a site for discursive, thus socio-cultural, change. The social theory of discourse focuses not only on discourse as a theoretical concept but also as an arena to promote social changes in conditions that reflect inequities and domination. Efforts that challenge social injustice often rely on various oppositional ideologies and theories as alternatives to what have become hegemonic ways of understanding social phenomena. The meanings assigned to race and racism are partially maintained by uncritical acceptance of these concepts, which often rely on common (mis)perceptions. Critical approaches to race and racism, therefore, are necessary to explore change-producing ideologies and actions. 3.3.2 Critical theories of race. Overview. Collins (2011) identifies two meanings of \"critical\" in \"critical racial theory,\" the first being a set of recognizable characteristics identifying a theory as \"critical.\" These include reflexive accountability, awareness of the social positioning of theorists, interdisciplinarity, and the presence of an ethical/antiracist framework to achieve goals. The second meaning of critical \"refers to something that is important, worth doing, and/or necessary for survival,\" especially for people of color and those marginalized by racism (p. 173). RSS incorporates these and other aspects of critical theories of race. Prior to a detailed discussion about RSS, a brief overview of traditional critical theory and the emergence of critical theories of race are provided to further contextualize the importance of race critical theories within research on racial and ethnic health inequities. 88 The founding of \"critical thought\" is often attributed to the Frankfurt School's critical theorists and to postmodern French philosophers. While their contributions that challenged preconceived notions of \"knowledge\" and \"power\" are undeniable, a closer examination reveals that similar critical analyses had been conducted by scholars of color prior to the \"official\" founding of the critical theory/method movement between the 1920s and 1960s. For example, around the turn of the 20th century, W.E.B. Du Bois and Carter Woodson, two preeminent African American scholars of this period, actively critiqued the racial inequities in U.S. society's educational, health, and social service systems, but their contributions were not recognized within the canons of critical theory at the time (Ladson-Billings, 2003). Race critical theorists/scholars (and often feminist) were leaders in the creation of a theoretical discourse that focused on racial structure and power in the U.S. Critical race theory (CRT) is considered an influential theoretical discourse that emerged from race critical, and often feminist, legal scholars (See Crenshaw et al., 1995; Delgado & Stefanic, 2001). CRT emphasized a racial power analysis of institutional and systemic processes that challenged the fundamental liberal ideology found in race-related legal concepts such as color-blindness, discriminatory intent rule, and integration, while at the same time institutionalizing a structural analysis of \"the intellectual assumptions of white supremacy in law\"25 (Zuberi, 2011, p. 1575; Bell, 1992; Crenshaw et al., CRT 25 \"White supremacy\" is used here \"to inflate rhetoric\" but to \"consciously situate ourselves in reality\" and it specifically refers to \"a political, economic, and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings\" (Ansley, 1988/1989, p. 1024). This definition will complement the legal concept of \"whiteness.\" Through numerous court cases challenging the meaning of \"whiteness\" (these will be discussed further below), \"whiteness\" transitioned from an \"aspect of privileged identity\" to \"an external object of property\" with \"a vested interest\" (Harris, 1993, p. 1725). Furthermore, Harris (1993) states, \"The law's construction of whiteness defined and affirmed critical aspects of identity 89 encouraged and supported several other iterations of its basic principles to challenge societal inequities; these included Black feminist thought, Latino/a critical race studies, Asian American critical race studies, Queer Crit, Feminist Crit, and critical White of education (Ladson-Billings, 1998; Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995; Tate, 1997), public health (healthcrits; Ford & Airhihenbuwa, 2010a, and social 2012; Ortiz & Jani, 2010) adapted CRT principles to their fields of practice. Due to the prominence of racial discourse and government-sanctioned initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities, D. T. Goldberg's (1993, 2002) work contributes to race critical theories by highlighting race and racism as malleable concepts irreducible to a static definition but ones that are continually morphing, yet normalized, through culture, discourse, and knowledge. Additionally, D. T. Goldberg (2002) identifies how the liberal discourse of \"freedom,\" couched as a discourse of \"racelessness,\" informs a color-blind political approach to presenting facially race-neutral policy across a myriad of social determinants such as housing, education, cultural, economics, and health. Omi and Winant (1994) also made important contributions to race critical knowledge with their theory of racial formation, which refers to \"the socio-historical process by which racial categories are created, inhabited, transformed, and destroyed\" through historically contextualized (who of privilege (what benefits accrue to that status); and, of property (what legal entitlements arise from that status)\" [emphasis in original] (p. 1725). Taken together, \"white supremacy\" and \"whiteness\" form important conceptual considerations regarding race, racism, and racial/ethnic health inequities. 90 Racial projects offer divergent discursive and ideological racial perspectives such as \"culturally competent,\" \"biomedical,\" or \"liberal\" orientations regarding racial aspects of society. Often, these projects vary extensively in breadth and impact across various levels of society (Omi & Winant, 1994). Particularly relevant to the current study and RSS is racial formation theory's framing of a racial project, like \"color-blind racism,\" as a connector between \"what race means in a particular discursive practice and the ways in which both social structures and everyday experiences are racially organized, based on meaning\" [emphasis in original] (Omi & Winant, 1994, p. 56). The complementary racial projects of asserting a color-blind approach to race, and concurrently strengthening the status of Whiteness, appear logically opposed to each other. Yet, the marriage of these two concepts evolved when Supreme Court Justice Harlan dissented in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson (\"separate but equal\") case, where he pointedly declared that the Constitution is \"color-blind\" (Carr, 1997; L\u00f3pez, 2006/2007). While many proponents of a color-blind approach to racial issues in the U.S. reiterate Justice Harlan's dissent, most fail to acknowledge his ironic acknowledgement of White superiority in the sentences preceding his declaration of Constitutional colorblindness: \"The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country. And so it is, in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth and in power. So, I doubt not, it will continue to be for all time, if it remains true to its great heritage and holds fast to the principles of constitutional liberties\" [emphasis added] (Harlan as quoted in Bell, 2004, p. 26). Such a proximate juxtaposition between proclaimed colorblindness and identifying a dominant race reveals an underlying message that White domination will prevail by constituting law (\"principles of constitutional liberties\") through a color-blind lens, 91 leading to calls for eliminating race without acknowledging the structural inequities created by a hierarchy of racial power and privilege (Carr, 1997; Gotanda, 1991; Haney-Lop\u00e9z, 2006/2007; (1997, 2001) racialized social systems (RSS) framework builds on the strengths of race critical theories by synthesizing the structural, ideological, power dynamics, and individual aspects of a racialized society in its analysis. The concept of racialized social systems (RSS) refers to \"societies in which economic, political, social, and ideological levels are partially26 structured by the placement of actors in racial categories or races\" (Bonilla-Silva, 1997, p. 469). Racial ideology, in the form of color-blind racism, is a central component of RSS. Racialized social systems (RSS). Bonilla-Silva (1997, 2001) created the RSS framework to counteract this individually-focused, psychologically-based conceptualization of racism, which frames it as a systematic ideology or worldview that produces negative beliefs and attitudes (prejudice) toward the racialized \"Other\" and subsequently produces discriminatory actions. These characteristics are still common in most conceptualizations of race and racism within the broad field of racial and ethnic health inequities (Paradies, 2006a, 2006b). RSS provides a multi-faceted approach to investigate the complex manifestations of racial power and inequity within U.S. society. The RSS framework consists of five basic components: (a) racialized social systems; (b) processes of racialization; (c) racial contestation; (d) racialized interests; and (e) racial ideology (Bonilla-Silva, 1997, 2001). A theoretical strength of the RSS framework is its 26 The use of the word \"partially,\" along with more explicit discussion within Bonilla-Silva's work (2001), highlights a both/and approach to the complex manifestations of racial power and its intersection with other forms of gendered or class-based power imbalances which result in gender and class hierarchies. See Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw (1991), Gloria Anzald\u00faa (1987), Angela Y. Davis (1983), and Patricia Hill Collins (2000) for further discussion about intersectionality. 92 compatibility with multi-level manifestations of racism (racial ideology), which are grounded in the institutional and structural levels of society as well individual interactions. By centering the individual within a systemic context and acknowledging the racial formation processes connecting the intersections between the two, there is a greater likelihood to avoid an \"either/or approach\" to the individual/structure dichotomy and engage in a \"both/and\" analysis (Omi & Winant, 1994). Many research studies conceptualize race as a fixed concept disconnected from history, culture, or social context, which is evident by the limited discussion in racial and ethnic health disparities literature (Paradies, 2006b). The limited discussion given to conceptualizing racial concepts can result in treating race \"as a function of fixed differences between 'populations'\" or as inherently a biological phenomenon (James, 2008, p. 42). Racial features then become seen as a causal factor assigned to entire groups of people regarding a multitude of social issues (Zuberi, 2000). In the case of racial and ethnic health disparities research, the danger resides in devolving down a slippery slope toward \"blaming the victim\" rather than considering systemic contributions to the racially different health outcomes. RSS considers those systemic factors by conceptualizing race, racism, and Whiteness as perpetually shifting social phenomena. RSS conceptualizes race as a socially malleable construct that produces a social reality, where racializing processes produce racial categories (Bonilla-Silva, 2001). Social, political, cultural, and economic meanings are developed and attached to various racial groups by the dominant race, where collective ideas about race (racial ideology) emerge. Racial ideology operates on the basis of replicating common understandings related to symbolic representations of race in order to maintain racial dominance for a 93 particular group and racial subordination for all others (Bonilla-Silva, 2001). Racism results when the dominant race receives relatively more material benefits, along with access to greater sources of power, and uses these resources to further marginalize (intentionally or not) subordinate groups. Those who are referred to as \"White,\" or who can effectively assume a White racial identity,27 maintain relative racial dominance over people defined as \"non-White.\" Bonilla-Silva (2001) frames Whiteness through a lens of White supremacy and dominance where White people hold relatively dominant positions, usually occupy the top of most social indicators (e.g., better health outcomes, increased employment opportunities, higher levels of wealth), and have increased access to various forms of power (access, resources, opportunities, self-determination), when compared to people of color. In turn, collective meanings emerge about the reasons behind the current racial hierarchy in the U.S. RSS implores analysts to examine the \"racial orders\" in society by studying \"the practices, institutions, and ideologies that help sustain white privilege\" (Bonilla-Silva, 2001, p. 12). By emphasizing the inequitable social positioning of individuals by race within intersecting systems, RSS exposes the political, economic, cultural, social, and psychological forces that shape opportunities throughout life (Bonilla-Silva, 1997). This racialization process, which \"races\" and socially positions people, is another component of the RSS framework (Bonilla-Silva, 2001). 27 Whiteness, and the definitional characteristics it represents, allows for continentally assumed non-whites (Blacks from Africa, Asians from Asia, etc.) to identify as the dominant race (some commentators have indicated the Irish and Jews both became white by accepting and following norms of the dominant racial ideology and hierarchy; See Brodkin (1998) and Ignatiev (1996)). Recently, the U.S. is moving from a \"bio-racial to a socio-racial system, one in which ever more [racial] minorities function in society as if they were effectively white\" (Haney L\u00f3pez, 2006). This is particularly visible when new immigrants from Africa, Latin America, and Asia immigrate to the U.S. The process of \"becoming white\" often begins by distancing themselves from people most racially marginalized in this country and supporting the dominant racial ideology. 94 Process of racialization. The process of racialization forms an inherent component of racialized social systems, which serve to reproduce power differences within a racial hierarchy. Defining, interpreting, formulating, and assigning racial meanings form the key underpinnings of racialization, whereby a dominant group has the cultural, political, and social power to replicate this process across multiple levels of society (Bonilla-Silva, 1997, 2001; Omi & Winant, 1994; Tang & Browne, 2009). Through assigning and ascribing racial differences, judgments are often levied upon the racialized \"other\" (Fassin, 2011). The ascription process usually includes a combination of assigning individual physical characteristics, such as hair, body types, and facial features, a value-based social meaning, characteristics which are then assigned to cultural aspects of an entire racial group to establish their relative position in a racial hierarchy (Porter, 1994; A. Smedley, 2007; Stanfield, 1991). In turn, these became racialized descriptors serving to reify racial categorizations and their associated cultural messages. Daniels and Schulz (2006) offer a historical timeline that reveals how this arbitrary categorizing of races has been imposed and how it reflects a prime example of racialization. From 1790 until 2000, the U.S. Census continually redefined the \"official\" racial categories it used for collecting data. Initially, the language of the 1790 census reflected a person's status as a free person or slave, and identified indigenous people as \"Indians,\" rather than through a race-specific identification. By the 19th century, the racial categorization of people became more overt through the use of terms like \"white\" and \"black\" and labels that indicated various degrees of Black ancestry (mulatto, quadroon, and octoroon; Daniels & Schulz, 2006). At the turn of the 20th century, White, Black, and mulatto were the new terms, which quickly shifted to include the interracial nature of 95 racial categories by deeming people with mixed \"white and American Indian ancestry as 'Indian'\" and people with \"African and American Indian ancestry as 'Negroes'\" (Daniels & Schulz, 2006, p. 91). The arbitrary nature of this racial categorization is quite clear and requires a specific type of discursive approach to replicate its existence in a given period. Because overt, negative racial expressions have recently become less acceptable, non-racialized language (frequently presented as race neutral) is often employed to carry particular racialized messages. Collins (2000) identifies what appears to be non-racial language as a vehicle to objectify women of color through political and policy discourse by using Reaganesque terms with inherent moral judgments such as \"welfare mother\" and \"welfare queen.\" The former \"draws on the moral capital attached to American motherhood\" whereas the latter creates the image of a single, benefit-chasing, opinionated African American woman who is unwilling to work (Collins, 2000, p. 80). The welfare queen image itself reflects an attempt to exploit the plight of marginalized Black women as evidence of their deteriorating state (Collins, 2000). The racialized message behind this example reflects how a social service/health professional may be influenced on an individual level (seeing the person as a \"welfare mother\" or \"welfare queen\" can potentially influence the direction of a treatment regime), which then influences how initiatives, policies, and practices are developed and operationalized. By establishing \"welfare\" and \"queen\" as racialized terms for Black women, their use becomes influential racial code for communicating particular messages and influencing policy decisions. In line with the RSS approach, the term \"structural racialization\" has emerged to explain the complexity of racializing processes within intersecting structures and systems 96 in society (powell, 2009). Structurally-based racialization operates within a context of \"societal organization and cultural understandings\" (Calmore, 1998, p. 1068), in which a \"structural model helps us analyze how housing, education, employment, transportation, health care, and other systems interact to produce racialized outcomes\" (powell, 2009, p. 793). Racial interests and racial contestation. As a result of these racializing processes and the impact of ideology within a racialized social system, conflicting interests emerge which often result in challenges to the existing racial hierarchy. Because of their complementary nature, racial interests and racial contestation are covered simultaneously as part of the RSS framework. Racial interests reflect three key characteristics: (a) they are predominantly collective, rather than individual; (b) they focus on relations between races instead of the needs within the racial collective; and (c) the interests they reflect are practical in the sense they form the basis of real struggles, which represent racial contestation (Bonilla-Silva, 2001). In this sense, racial contestation refers to \"the struggle of racial groups for systemic changes regarding their position at one or more levels\" of society such as social, political, economic, or ideological (Bonilla-Silva, 2001, p. 43). Early in U.S. history, the immigration and naturalization process formed one of the many political and social arenas where contested racial interests emerged. In 1790, Congress enacted its first piece of legislation, the Naturalization Act, which codified the right of citizenship for (and only for) White people. The overt legal use of race as a categorical determinant of naturalization continued (in varying degrees) over the next 160 years when virtually all of our institutions were created, until the Immigration and Nationality (McCarran-Walter) Act of 1952 overhauled the laws of citizenship (Martinas, 97 1998; R. M. Smith, 1999; Yamane, 2001). Concurrently, the legal concept of a \"white person\" became the standard for determining who could gain citizenship. Although naturalization was available for African Americans after 1870, only one individual attempted to gain citizenship as a Black person (L\u00f3pez, 2006). From the first racial prerequisite case in 1878 (In re Ah Yup) until 1952 when the naturalization process no longer required racial restrictions, 50 out of 51 cases attempted to gain White racial identity status through state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court (L\u00f3pez, 2006). Numerous cases took place between 1878 and 1923, where each revolved around who could be naturalized as a White person. The courts at all levels struggled with determining who and what constituted a \"white person,\" fluctuating between science (physical features) and common knowledge (social beliefs). The naturalization cases diminished in significance after 1952 when race was mostly removed as a determining factor. However, \"with race, unlike, for example, with gender, there is nothing on the nature side: there is no underlying reality to be interpreted in admittedly socially embedded ways; there are no essential differences measurable through the problematized techniques of science. Rather, there is only social belief. Race is purely a social construction, and the science of race is purely the science of social myth\" [emphasis in original] (L\u00f3pez, 2006, p. 68). Unfortunately, the inequitable racial outcomes are real and still exist as they manifest in multiple ways to produce further resistance to oppressive conditions. There are several other cases in the development of \"the legal concept of race\" but the key point here is that race was, and continues to be, a contested concept. Depending on our ideological positioning within the racial understanding continuum, we will express various racial interests. 98 Racial contestation can happen as a result of differential racial interests from various groups, which can produce collective racial positions as a result of how the issue is defined by those involved. Coerced (at times, forced) sterilization of welfare mothers in the U.S. is one of the numerous examples that illustrates the intersection of racial ideology, interests, and contestation. As the era of eugenics was \"officially\" coming to an end in the 1960s, supposed intellectual differences between the races and governmental support of single mothers justified policy to limit reproductive rights (Roberts, 1997). The politics and medical science of the times felt empowered to dictate a form of population control (sterilization) because of the assigned inferiority to poor, single women of color. Additionally, powerful gatekeepers in the scientific and political fields identified an informal \"quid pro quo\" where the government's financial support of existing babies was given in return for the restriction of women's reproductive rights. Numerous medical schools from the North and South regularly performed unnecessary sterilizations on poor, Black, and Puerto Rican women under the guise of \"health care.\" Using government funding from the U.S., Puerto Rico instituted an aggressive sterilization program for women of childbearing ages; Native Americans also felt the effects of coerced sterilizations on reservations (Roberts, 1997). Women of color felt a collective injustice based on their treatment by health and social welfare professionals, which resulted in activists forming a Committee to End Sterilization Abuse to challenge policies and practices contributing to their abuse. Conversely, and \"ironically ... white middle-class women found it nearly impossible to find a doctor who would sterilize them,\" which created a vast schism between racial interests regarding sterilization (Roberts, 1997, p. 95). 99 In opposition to women of color attempting to end sterilization, predominantly White women built a pro-sterilization coalition to pressure hospitals into performing elective sterilizations that included the Association for Voluntary Sterilization, Zero Population Growth, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU; Roberts, 1997). Each side has valid points from their particular perspectives; however, the White middle-class women fighting for their right to voluntary sterilization ignored the historical and political implications of race, especially their own. On the other hand, women of color are forced to consider the various aspects of race based on those same historical and political implications because their survival depends on understanding the inherent opposition (of their position) to the dominant racial ideology. The previous discussion about racialized social systems provides a framework where racial ideology acts as an interconnecting component among the process of racialization, racial interests, and racial contestation (components of RSS). Because racial concepts, and racism specifically, inherently contain individually and collectively understood ideological characteristics related to power relations and domination, theorizing racial ideology as color-blind racism offered specific frames to understand various manifestations in spoken and written texts. The next section expands on the color-blind racism framework, which evolved from the racial ideology component of the RSS framework (Bonilla-Silva, 1997, 2001, 2010). 3.3.3 Racial ideology and color-blind racism frames. The ideology embedded within the current discourse on health disparities (particularly racial ideology) reflects \"a refusal to recognize its systemic origins, roots, or logic, and therefore attempts to explore the relationship of political power to health inequities appear fruitless.\" This often 100 translates into a collectivized (mis)understanding about racial health disparities (Hofrichter, 2003, pp. 26-27). Racial ideology acts as a mediating force among the individual, institutional, structural, and cultural aspects of society; it operates as both an explanatory rationalization for the prevailing racial hierarchy and a point of resistance for subordinate racial and ethnic categorizations (Bonilla-Silva, 2010; Malat, Clark-Hitt, Burges, Friedemann-Sanchez, & Van Ryn, 2010). Bonilla-Silva (2001, 2010) contends that racial ideology, in the form of color-blind racism, represents a major component of the RSS framework. He uses a racial ideology (color-blind racism) framework to analyze individual racial views from both the dominant and dominated group's perspectives Bonilla-Silva (1997, 2001). In other words, the RSS approach to racial ideology moves beyond analyzing individual racial attitudes through the lens of prejudice toward a group-level, shared racial ideological framework. Combined with the theories of discourse and racialized social systems, the color-blind racism framework further grounds the research in connecting individuals, groups, and institutions to the reproduction of racial meaning through language and discourse. Prior to defining the four frames of color-blind racism (abstract liberalism, naturalization, cultural racism, minimization), a brief discussion follows to situate the legal concept of colorblindness in its historical context. Legal concept of colorblindness. As previously mentioned, the ideological concept of racial colorblindness evolved from the legal field via Supreme Court Justice Harlan's dissent in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson (\"separate but equal\") case, where \"Constitutional colorblindness\" first emerged (Carr, 1997; L\u00f3pez, 2007). As discussed above, while many proponents of a color-blind approach to racial issues in the U.S. reiterate Justice Harlan's dissent, most fail to acknowledge his ironic acknowledgement 101 of White superiority in the sentences preceding his declaration of Constitutional colorblindness. Color-blind racism frames. The social theory of discourse and the concept of racialized social systems address the systemic and institutional levels. Racial ideology, in the form of color-blind racism, creates a framework to investigate the individuals' and groups' discursive approaches to conceptualizing racial concepts. The color-blind racism framework evolved as a lens to conceptualize the \"new racism,\" which represents the maintenance of racial order with apparently non-racial practices and language (Bonilla-Silva, 2010). Recently, various social work professional organizations, including the National Association of Social Workers and the Social Work Policy Institute, convened a symposium to build a racial equity analysis based on the tenets of Bonilla-Silva's (2010) color-blind racism framework (Social Work Policy Institute, 2014). The significance of color-blind racism as a framework lies in its utility to provide identifying racial frames (abstract liberalism, naturalization, cultural racism, minimization; Bonilla-Silva, 2010). These frames offer a theoretical basis to explicitly name what is often referred to as \"race-neutral\" (color-blind) language, which historically operated as a tactic to achieve racial unity or make \"race talk\" obsolete (Bonilla-Silva, 2010). Consequently, when dealing with social issues, the structural aspect that is so often missing, or seen as too abstract, is connected to the often invisible group and individual collectivized racial ideologies operating in everyday interactions. By theoretically combining structural and discursive components (social theory of discourse and racialized social systems) with the group and individual perspective (racial ideology/color-blind racism), the complexity of how racial concepts are conceptualized at 102 the systemic/institutional level (initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities) and through people on the ground (community residents and professionals) becomes clearer. As stated above, Bonilla-Silva's (2010) color-blind racism framework consists of four frames (a) abstract liberalism; (b) naturalization; (c) cultural racism; and (d) minimization. These were used as a theoretical basis and as sensitizing concepts for the grounded theory analysis of participant interviews to explore the possible manifestations of racial ideology. Each frame represents a mechanism for people to convey a racialized perspective by using non-racial language. Bonilla-Silva (2010) asks questions related to each frame and qualitatively documents what respondents say in order to analyze racial ideology (color-blind racism). Abstract liberalism combines various aspects of political and economic liberalism such as individualism, freedom of choice, and the myth of meritocracy (the harder you work, the more you succeed), which people use to ignore racial inequities across every social indicator. For example, Rigby et al. (2009) conducted a study where they asked respondents their level of support for government actions to address health disparities depending on whether the disparities were defined as a result of economics, education, or race. A majority of respondents agreed to government intervention when health disparities were a result of economics, and supported government intervention to a lesser extent when the disparities were the product of education. The same study also revealed, after controlling for all three types of disparity perceptions, that respondents expressed lower support for government intervention when health disparities were framed as racial. As previous studies have determined, \"these findings echo a large body of research 103 indicating that Americans generally tend to minimize the importance of race-based inequalities, and tend to view African Americans as less deserving of government assistance\" (Rigby et al., 2009, p. 1337; see also Gilens, 1999; Hochschild, 2001). However, a vast majority of these same respondents would likely indicate support for the general principle of an equal opportunity to health. The incongruent juxtaposition of deeming African Americans as \"undeserving\" and supporting equal opportunity to health is a prime example of abstract liberalism. The second frame in the color-blind racism framework is naturalization, which allows people to justify race-based inequitable outcomes as a phenomenon that naturally occurs through an individual's \"choices\" (Bonilla-Silva, 2010). Community residents, especially people of color, who live in a neighborhood with limited access to healthy food, high crime rates, and an over-abundance of liquor/tobacco stores are seen as \"choosing\" to eat unhealthy foods and accepting challenging environmental conditions. People will say, \"Everyone has an equal opportunity to buy good food by traveling to a better store or moving to a different neighborhood\" as a way to \"naturalize\" racialized conditions. This frame also complements abstract liberalism by emphasizing the individualistic nature of the decision and avoiding any institutional or systemic accountability. The third frame is cultural racism, which refers to the assignment of cultural characteristics to people as the reason for their status in society, such as \"African Americans don't have jobs because they're lazy\" or \"Latinas have high rates of teen pregnancy and want to receive government welfare.\" During the 1960s, there were strong structural critiques of racism, especially the Kerner Report, the government's 104 investigation of race riots which found \"white racism\" as a major cause of racial upheaval (see Haney L\u00f3pez, 2006/2007, and Knowles & Prewitt, 1969, for further discussion of the Kerner Report). Some liberal academics, however, attempted to refocus the analysis on racial and ethnic groups rather than structural and systemic factors. Haney L\u00f3pez (2006/2007) identifies Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan's (1963) history of New York City, Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians, and Irish of New York City, as a foundational work that implied a causal connection between a racial and ethnic group's low standing in society and their supposed lack of mainstream cultural mores. Many of the participants in Bonilla-Silva's (2010) research expressed implicit agreement by indicating a connection between people's lack of success and their racial and ethnic identity. Finally, minimization of racism rounds out the four frames of the color-blind racism framework. The basis for the minimization of racism comes from a belief that we live in a post-racial America, especially with an African American president. Statements like \"people are not enslaved anymore\" and \"why can't we just move beyond race?\" represent indications of minimizing race. 105 Chapter 4: Methodology 4.1 Introduction and Research Questions Qualitative methods guided the study's overall approach to gathering information for the purpose of examining how racism is conceptualized on a discursive or social practice level in efforts to eliminate or reduce racial and ethnic health inequities. The discursive interactions among policies to eliminate inequitable racial health outcomes and the social welfare/health professionals attempting to implement these policies provide a complex social space. The resulting \"field\" or space of practice represents both a relational sphere and a location for conflict/competition, where structural meaning and actions are created to produce individualized collective tendencies or \"habitus\" (Bourdieu, 1977; Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992). Discourse operates as a critical habitus-making apparatus within policies and practices to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. The current study collected data to address the following research questions: 1) How does the conceptualization of race, racism, and Whiteness influence the discourse on health disparities/inequities within international, national, state, and local policy initiatives whose expressed purpose is to address disparate or inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? 2) How do social welfare/health professionals conceptualize race, racism, and Whiteness in their discourse, as it relates to disparate or inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? 106 3) What is the relationship between the discourse conceptualizing race, racism, and Whiteness and the actions taken by professionals to address disparate or inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? I emphasized how my personal perspectives and relationships to power influence the application of both constructivist grounded theory (GT; Charmaz, 2006, 2011; Johnson, 2013; Mills, Bonner, & Francis, 2006) and critical discourse analysis (CDA; Fairclough, 1992, 2001, 2009, 2012) through a race critical lens. This chapter describes those methods and provides an overview of the study design. 4.2 Overview of Methodology The current study employed complementary, qualitative methods in the spirit of critical inquiry. Through the use of GT, CDA, analytical memo writing, and field notes, the inherent power of language served as the focal point of analysis to answer the above research questions. Grounded theory provided a preliminary view of codes, categories, themes, and emerging discourses in both the written texts and the interview transcripts, which served to reveal the \"surface-level\" meaning of the data, identify possible gaps in the data, and allowed for comparisons among the data (i.e., between participant interviews, and between participant interviews and policies to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities; Charmaz, 2006; Fyke & Buzzanell, 2013; Johnson, 2013). CDA moved the analysis of language and discourse from codes, categories, and themes to a more explicitly critical investigation of discourse as a social practice, which included an examination of power relations and ideological components (Fairclough, 2010; van Dijk, 2000; Wodak & Meyer, 2009b). Finally, researcher journaling and memo taking documented reflections of the research process (post-interviews, transcribing 107 interviews, social power relations as a researcher, etc.) and provided additional context about the researcher's positionality as it related to producing knowledge. These are discussed further in the Bricolage section (4.2.2) below. By incorporating interdisciplinary methodologies with the capacity to investigate discursive aspects of how racial concepts and racism are conceptualized within initiatives to eliminate health inequities, the location of inquiry expands to investigate the connections among social service/health institutions and systems, along with the professionals responsible for implementing their policies and programs. 4.2.1 Qualitative research. Qualitative research focuses on \"naturalistic inquiry\" where the researcher is positioned within natural settings, rather than laboratories, to employ research practices that illuminate and interpret the larger context of the world, at various societal levels, and along the spectrum of human identities (Denzin & Lincoln, 2008). In its most basic form, qualitative research methodologies provide researchers with ways to communicate their findings with other people through observation and participation in social settings and interactions. Consequently, qualitative researchers often \"make their observations within a mediated framework, that is, a framework of symbols and cultural meanings given to them by those aspects their life histories that they bring to the observational setting\" (Vidich & Lyman, 2003, p. 58). Approaches to qualitative research range from positivist to critical, from constructionist to feminist, and continue to vary across historical points in time. The researcher's choices among these various approaches have political, social, and economic implications regarding how s/he frames a particular issue and the choice of methods employed to investigate it. Understanding the power of methodological decisions through the eyes of 108 the dominant culture and the interconnecting systems provided an important perspective to avoid reproducing the inequity I attempted to transform through my research. One example of how empirical research can produce the inequities it is attempting to address is Linda Tuhiwai Smith's (2012) ground-breaking work, Decolonizing Methodologies. In presenting a powerful history of research from the perspective of indigenous peoples, she identified three specific points that represent how \"scientific research is implicated in the worst excesses of colonialism...and offends our deepest sense of humanity\": (a) assuming a comprehensive understanding of peoples' lives based on short-term involvement; (b) co-opting and taking indigenous ways of understanding and knowing [or also groups of people who are most marginalized and oppressed in society], while also rejecting their humanness as individuals; and (c) currently using historically oppressive scientific research practices to deny basic rights of existence, self-determination, culture, and access to lands (p. 1). As a White, male researcher who attempted to challenge conventional methodologies, I used hook's (1990) poignant question as a mechanism of accountability to people most marginalized by racial health inequities: \"Within complex and ever shifting realms of power relations, do we position ourselves on the side of colonizing mentality...or do we continue to stand in political resistance with the oppressed...?\" (p. 145). In exploring the meaning of race, racism, and Whiteness within the study, I posed another question regarding the research process to support critical self-reflection: Do I approach the selection and application of research methods as racially neutral knowledge production tools or do I identify race critical methods from an anti-racism perspective? 109 Addressing these questions was important for the study because qualitative and quantitative research methods28 are often presented from a race neutral or colorblind perspective, where their Eurocentric roots are hidden (Stanfield, 1985). Historically, qualitative approaches such as ethnography \"were born out of concern to understand the 'other,'\" where the \"other\" represented people of color being \"observed\" by White, often male, researchers collecting data (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003, p. 2). hooks (1990) critically analyzed this through an image on the cover of Writing Culture (Clifford & Marcus, 1986) by identifying two important contributions to a \"racist imagination:\" the White male as \"writer/authority\" and the passivity of \"brown/black men [people]\" within the research process (p. 127). However, in the 1960s, when racially marginalized groups began entering academia in greater numbers and creating race-based methodologies such as storytelling/narratives as part of critical race theory (CRT), those who ascribed to the dominant approach of \"collecting data\" attempted to discredit the relevance of these critical perspectives (Pillow, 2003). This critique occurred through the application of terms with negative connotations like \"proliferation,\" \"counterstances,\" \"identity politics,\" and \"post-modernism\" (Pillow, 2003, pp. 190-194). Critical methodologists continued to expand the use of qualitative methods from various marginalized groups' perspectives and the White spaces from which their racial oppression emerged. Critical race theorists such as Derrick Bell, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, and Patricia Williams used the United States' legal system as the context to challenge structural racism and emphasized the importance of storytelling to ensure that research methods matched the culture of people being \"researched.\" Similarly, Linda Tuhiwai 28 I will focus this discussion on qualitative research methods but for further discussion about race and racism within quantitative methods see Zuberi (2001) and Zuberi and Bonilla Silva (2008). 110 Smith (2012), an indigenous activist/scholar, approached theory and method as a means of \"indigenous inquiry\" (Kaupapa M\u00e3ori research) from a \"local theoretical position that is the modality through which the emancipatory goal of critical theory, in a specific historical, political, and social context is practised [sic]\" (p. 186). Additional critical epistemologists include Gloria Anzald\u00faa (Chicana feminism, 1987), Patricia Hill Collins (Black feminism, 2000), and Ruth Frankenberg (critical Whiteness studies, 1993). These researchers and others used qualitative approaches to challenge structural power dynamics by including oppressed voices and people's stories (or, in Frankenberg's case, privileged voices) to critically contextualize the systemic factors contributing to oppressive circumstances. Official interpretations regarding critical theory is an example of how contributions by marginalized groups to academic discourse are sometimes ignored. The founding of \"critical thought\" is often attributed to the Frankfurt School's critical theorists and to postmodern French philosophers. While their contributions that challenged preconceived notions of \"knowledge\" and \"power\" are undeniable, a closer examination reveals that similar critical analyses had been conducted by scholars of color prior to the \"official\" founding of the critical theory/method movement between the 1920s and 1960s. For example, around the turn of the 20th century, W.E.B. Du Bois and Carter Woodson, two preeminent African American scholars around the turn of the 20th century, actively critiqued the racial inequity in U.S. society's educational, health, and social service systems in society but their contributions were not recognized within the canons of critical theory (Ladson-Billings, 2003). Because the current study focused on the racial aspects of health inequities and used a methodology (CDA), which emerged 111 from European critical thought, it is important that I understand the racialized aspects of how the origins of critical thought have been documented. By including critical qualitative methods, I avoided some of the shortcomings found in health promotion and health equity efforts which often frame health and well-being from an almost exclusively individualistic perspective, based on lifestyle changes or what is referred to as \"methodological individualism\" (D. S. Goldberg, 2012). Obviously, individuals can do certain things to improve their health but when this emphasis dominates the agenda in the field of health disparities/health inequities research, to the exclusion of structural factors which contribute to persistent racial health inequities, any solution that emerges from this research will also suffer from a limited understanding of the issue. An answer to this problem can be found in employing flexible, critical methodologies to analyze language and its associated discursive power. By operationalizing the complementary methodologies of GT and CDA, important insights regarding the research process and outcome emerge (Johnson, 2013). The following section cover the methodologies used in the study and their integration through a bricolage approach (Kincheloe, 2001, 2005). 4.2.2 Bricolage approach: GT and CDA. I conducted research that explores the structural interconnections among systems, institutions, and individuals using critical qualitative methodologies (Carspecken, 1996; Kincheloe & McLaren, 2003; Ladson-Billings, 2003). I applied GT and CDA, through a bricolage lens, to international, national, state, and city initiatives which attempt to eliminate or reduce racial and ethnic health inequities. Grounded theory (constructivist perspective) provided a qualitative 112 coding methodology \"to separate, sort, and synthesize\" the data, in addition to thematically categorizing its segments (Charmaz, 2006, p. 3). CDA required a more in-depth investigation as to how dominant social practices, language, texts, and ideologies are constituted and reproduced to perpetuate unequal power dynamics that result in structural oppression (Fairclough & Wodak, 1997; Tracy et al., 2011; Meyer, 2009b). By and CDA, the analysis attempted to \"uncover surface-level and deeper meanings (i.e., best practices and tensions, respectively),\" to expose how surface meanings can often veil the structural tensions impeding social transformation (Fyke & Buzzanell, 2013, p. 1626, emphasis in original; see also Mumby, 1997). The elimination of racial and ethnic health inequities requires, as a first step, the application of multi-methodological and multi-disciplinary research approaches to understand more effectively the manner in which racism in conceptualized. The research used GT and CDA to interpret discourse from policy initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities and social welfare/health professionals' interviews. As theory-methodology, CDA reveals how systems/institutions operationalize discourse as a mediating practice between its power to shape reality and the individuals who play various roles in supporting or resisting it (Fairclough, 2010; Wodak & Meyer, 2009b). Furthermore, GT illuminated the different ways social welfare/health professionals conceptualize racism. Together, CDA and GT offered a complementary and flexible approach to analyzing the policy texts and interview transcripts. Bricolage is a multi-disciplinary approach to qualitative research, which emphasizes the use of multiple methodologies and theories flexible enough to critically 113 interpret and take action on the contextual complexities found in the study of racial and ethnic health inequities (Kincheloe, 2001, 2005). Traditional, rationalistic research methodologies often operate from a \"monological\" perspective, where the focus is on the \"objectifiable dimensions\" of individuals' human existence (Kincheloe, 2005, p. 325). Through partitioning various parts of social phenomena in order to produce an acceptable way of knowing, the scientific order of knowledge production ultimately results in fragmented analyses and disconnected solutions to social issues (Kincheloe & Berry, 2004). By contrast, as an \"interpretive bricoleur,\" the researcher remains vigilant to the potential oppressive consequences of our racial, gendered, and classed identities within society's structural processes (Denzin & Lincoln, 2000). Bricoleurs rely \"on a series of methodological tactics rather than a single, consistent strategy\" so as to remain open to the complexities of issues such as colonialism, sexism, or racism (Kaomea, 2000, p. 321). Because racial concepts are continually morphing and re-manifesting in social interactions constantly, working from a bricolage approach allows for a broader use of additional theories and methodological tools, which is an attribute of both GT and CDA (Charmaz, 2006, 2011; Wodak & Meyer, 2009b). The use of GT also served to identify initial codes, meanings, and emerging discursive themes, which added additional context to the analysis (Charmaz, 2006, 2011; Johnson, 2013; Mills et al., 2006). This approach is in line with CDA's flexibility around shifting aspects of the research process such as the questions guiding the study, incorporating relevant factors not identified a priori, or adding theories/methods to respond more effectively to what is revealed throughout the research process (Reisigl & 114 Wodak, 2009). Recently, the benefits of using a more flexible methodological design, such as combining GT and CDA, are becoming more frequent in the literature (Fyke & Buzzanell, 2013; Johnson, 2013). During the last fifteen years, GT analysis has expanded to include three distinct epistemological approaches: objectivist, post-positivist, and constructivist. Objectivist grounded theory evolved from the positivist tradition where gathering data is the focal point of the analysis rather than the processes by which it is collected. As a result, the social context, the researcher's perspective, and the researcher's interactions with participants are limited in comparison to the other two approaches to GT (Charmaz, 2006). Grounded theory from a post-positivist perspective occupies a middle-ground between the objectivist and constructivist approaches. While retaining positivist moorings related to a priori analytical codes and frameworks applicable to collected data, post-positivist grounded theory adds openness to the evolving nature of reality (Charmaz, 2011). The constructivist approach to grounded theory goes beyond the themes and categories produced through the interpretation of research participants to include the researcher's influence on the coding/research process (Charmaz, 2006). Through a constructivist lens, the study of social phenomena examines how experiences are \"embedded in larger and, often, hidden positions, networks, situations, and relationships,\" which lead to the exposure of \"differences and distinctions between people\" and \"the hierarchies of power, communication, and opportunity...\" (Charmaz, 2006, p. 130). Although grounded theory has continued to evolve, most grounded theorists employ the following actions, to varying degrees, in their analyses: 115 1. Conduct data collection and analysis simultaneously in an iterative process 2. Analyze actions and processes rather than themes and structure 3. Use comparative methods 4. Draw on data (e.g., narratives and descriptions) in service of developing new conceptual categories 5. Develop inductive categories [themes] through systematic data analysis 6. Emphasize theory construction rather than description or application of current theories 7. Engage in theoretical sampling 8. Search for variation in the studied categories or process 9. Pursue developing a category rather than covering a specific empirical topic (Charmaz, 2011, p. 364) This study employed a constructivist approach to GT analysis and thematic identification29 on health promotion initiatives and social welfare/health professionals' interviews, which is discussed further in the Data Analysis section (4.5) below. Because of the study's focus on critical methodologies, the constructivist GT approach used in this study reflected critical and social justice principles (Charmaz, 2011; MacDonald, 2001). There are six grounded theory strengths that support a social justice inquiry related to how racism is conceptualized within racial and ethnic health inequities: (a) defining relevant processes; (b) demonstrating their contexts; (c) specifying the conditions in which these processes occur; (d) conceptualizing their phases; (e) explicating what contributes to their stability and/or change; and (f) outlining their 29 The current study will implement the first five steps of grounded theory in order to identify categories and themes, without establishing the basis for a theoretical model. 116 consequences (Charmaz, 2011, p. 361). By employing these social justice characteristics to the constructivist GT coding process, the resulting themes reflected a more critical approach to interpreting the data and pay increased attention to the data's connection to broader, structural issues regarding the conceptualization of racial concepts and racism. Grounded theory provided a complementary methodology to CDA and the overall bricolage approach by tying the systemic- and institutional-level discourses regarding racism and health inequities to thematic conceptualizations at the individual level. Grounded theory best served the study's purpose and complemented the dialectical-relational approach to CDA through the identification of codes, categories, and themes (Fyke & Buzzanell, 2013). Once initial codes, categories, and themes were identified and compared across texts and transcripts, the analysis moved to a critical discourse analysis (CDA). A more extensive discussion about GT and CDA is provided below in the Data Analysis section 4.5. CDA is a fluid methodology, which involves continual movement by the researcher between theory and method and an ongoing adjustment of the approach to the study based on the findings of the research process. Within the field of CDA, methodological approaches vary in tandem with their philosophical underpinnings. At one end of the spectrum, there is a relatively inductive/detailed approach to CDA, which includes discourse-historical approach (DHA, which focuses on political discourses through a historical context), corpus linguistics approach (a quantitative approach to linguistics through a CDA lens), and social actors approach (the analysis of discourse through individual actors and their reproduction of social structure; Wodak & Meyer, 2009a). Moving further away from the inductive/detailed end of the spectrum, there are 117 more deductive/general approaches to CDA such as dispositive analysis (which focuses on social actors' connective presence between discourse and reality), socio-cognitive approach (in which social representations operate through discourse involving individual experiences and collective perceptions), and the dialectical-relational approach (which focuses on how discourse is a form of social practice where the focus is both the structure and action; Wodak & Meyer, 2009b). However, most CDA methodologies share most, if not all, of the following qualities depending on their philosophical particularities: Addresses social problems\u2014CDA takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring the linguistic and discursive aspects of social and cultural analyses. Power relations are discursive\u2014frames power within the social and cultural use of language mediating various iterative relationships (e.g., policy and practice; politics and media). Discourse constitutes society and culture\u2014discourse constitutes (creates), and also is constituted by, social and cultural relations. Discourse does ideological work\u2014to analyze ideological aspects of discourse, CDA extends text analysis to include how texts are interpreted/received, their social effects, and power relationships. Discourse is historical\u2014current discourses rely on previous discourses as part of their formation (intertextuality) to create a historically contextualized understanding of discourse. Link between text and society is mediated\u2014indirect \"connections between social and cultural structures and processes on the one hand, and properties of text on the other\" (p. 277). 118 Discourse analysis is interpretive and explanatory\u2014audience and context play major roles in interpreting discourse. Discourse is a form of social action\u2014CDA can expose social power relations as a form of political/social action to change policies and practices undergirding issues identified in #1 of this list. (Fairclough & Wodak, 1997, pp. 271-279) The philosophical moorings of CDA, which also act as a theoretical complement to its use as a research method, are grounded in the critical linguistic tradition of the Frankfurt School. They include core components related to critical theory such as critiquing aspects of society with a focus on socially changing those aspects and an enhancement of our collective understanding of society through interdisciplinary research across the social sciences (Wodak & Meyer, 2009b). CDA is considered a critical methodology that is guided by critical theory; thus, it operates as a bridge between the two, or what is referred to as a theory/method (Chouliaraki & Fairclough, 1999; Tracy et al., 2011). CDA's commitment to acknowledging the iterative influence between theory and methodology preemptively addresses each of their potential limitations, theoreticism and methodologism, as individually compartmentalized concepts. Theoreticism prioritizes a theoretician's authority to produce knowledge at the expense of people with less (or no) institutional power, which subsequently increases the discursive power of institutions and their representatives (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992; Kuhn & Wolpe, 1978). Conversely, methodologism refers to research methodology as a theory-free endeavor (Chouliaraki & Fairclough, 1999). Critical methodologies attempt to address these shortcomings by 119 highlighting the interacting power dynamics operating among the researcher, participants, institutions, and systems. Charmaz's (2006, 2014) constructivist approach to GT and Fairclough's (2009) dialectical-relational approach are used as complementary methodologies in the study. Prior to explaining the details of the constructivist GT and dialectical-relational approach to CDA analyses, the next section covers aspects of conducting research as a critical qualitative researcher, which includes reflexivity/positionality and using research for social change. 4.3 Critical Qualitative Researcher as an Instrument for Change The earlier discussion about reflexivity and positionality laid the groundwork for operationalizing a \"critical\" gaze on my role as researcher. Employing critical qualitative methodologies like CDA allowed me to declare my position and socio-political stance explicitly toward racial and ethnic health inequities, in addition to using the research process to expose social inequities by attempting to share a perspective of those most marginalized (van Dijk, 1993c). However, these declarations are not meant to privilege the \"critical\" approach above what people consider more traditional methodologies but to expose the social, political, and economic motivations behind my work, which often go under-acknowledged in academic research (Wodak & Meyer, 2009b). As a critical researcher, I strive to acknowledge the power of interpretation required in the research process. Part of my responsibility was to implement a research process that challenges traditional ways of knowing and to engage study participants as holders of important knowledge by the application of a critical interpretative (hermeneutical) approach to perform \"a nuanced analysis of the impact of hegemonic and 120 ideological forces that connect the micro-dynamics of everyday life with the macro-dynamics of structures such as white supremacy...\" (Kincheloe & McLaren, 2003, p. 447). By using semi-structured qualitative interviews and CDA, I attempted to bridge the \"micro-dynamics\" of conceptualizing racism from a personal perspective with the \"macro-dynamics of structures\" of how racism is conceptualized within initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. 4.3.1 Reflexivity. Researchers often emphasizing critical methodologies reflect on one's actions and social power within the research process, a process that is often referred to as reflexivity. Macbeth (2001) defines reflexivity as \"a deconstructive exercise for locating the intersections of author, other, text, and world, and for penetrating the representational exercise itself\" (p. 35). Because I navigated the varying identities, experiences, and cultures of both the professionals and community residents during the interviews, I remained vigilant to the potential \"representation vulnerability\" between the participants' stories and my interpretive (re)presentations of their expressions (Krumer-Nevo & Sidi, 2012). Reflexivity must go beyond individual self-reflection regarding the research process by questioning object research and the unavoidable power dynamics that exist between the researcher and the researched (Pillow, 2003). Otherwise, the process of reflexivity can become a passive, self-reflecting exercise that unquestioningly documents the research process instead of constructively engaging in critical reflexive analysis of self and \"other\" within the individual, institutional, and systemic contexts of research (Chiseri-Strater, 1996). Working the space (hyphen) between self and the \"other\" requires a commitment to interrogate whose story is told, how stories are (re)presented/ 121 (re)interpreted, and how space for ongoing interactions between researcher and participant can be created (Fine, 1994). 4.3.2. Positionality. Identifying and sharing my positionality, \"the social location of racial theorists within the societal power relations\" (Collins, 2011, p. 163), with people both inside and outside the academy, was an important step in building authentic relationships with people involved with the research process (or academic culture). My identities as a White, heterosexual, able-bodied, lower middle-class, veteran, nondenominational, spiritual, male hold various levels of status based on my relative proximity to social and state-sanctioned power sources, such as institutions, systems, policies, laws, and structural processes. The resulting interactions between my identities and societal sources of power produced experiences that shaped, and continue to shape, the way I see the world through reciprocal, discursive practices. Thus, my relationship to power affects the way I (re)present social interactions within the context of research, particularly as it relates to my Whiteness and its authority within academia to produce \"acceptable\" knowledge (Twine, 2000). Identifying the relative power each of my various positions supported a shift away from adopting a traditional view of the researcher as a neutral, objective, and detached observer to one who regards himself as a participant with intersecting identities and varied access to various forms of power (Bonilla-Silva & Zuberi, 2008; Lawrence-Lightfoot & Davis, 1997; Sangtin Writers & Nagar, 2006; L. T. Smith, 2012). CDA offered a methodological instrument with critical theoretical roots to unearth the inherent power relations present in the discourse employed to conceptualize racism within initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. Although \"critical\" is 122 attached to the methodological instrument, I cannot rely on the name itself or even its history to assume a position that allows me to remain \"neutral\" or \"objective\" towards the health inequities incurred on people of color. The next section discusses the study design and data collection plan. 4.4 Study Design and Data Collection Plan Although the data collection and data analysis are presented here as distinct sections for organizational purposes, GT and CDA allow the researcher to begin analyzing the information as soon as it is collected (Wodak & Meyer, 2009b). Each data source (policies to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities and social welfare/health professionals) was analyzed based on their thematic (identified with GT) and discursive (identified with CDA) properties that specifically indicate how racial concepts and racism are conceptualized. Due to the study's focus on the (re)production of racial concepts through discourse, GT and CDA was applied to the texts and interviews to ensure a comprehensive and multifaceted understanding of the themes, language, discourse, ideologies, power relations found in texts and transcribed interviews. I received IRB approval in December of 2014 to conduct the research. During February and March of 2015 I conducted the participant interviews while concurrently commencing the GT and CDA analysis of publicly accessible documents discussed above. I analyzed the interview transcripts throughout the summer and into the fall of 2015. The next section presents the application of each methodology. 4.4.1 Text as data (1): Initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities. Assumptions relating to the study's topic serve as a foundation for any research study, which then require operationalization through the decisions made about 123 the methodological procedures to be used based on critical theory. Researchers begin constructing and organizing their views regarding a particular issue, which in the current study is the discursive social power found in conceptualizing racism. As the data were collected and analyzed, I began synthesizing the various texts and selecting information relevant to the research questions. The interpretation and explanation phase examined the raw data retrieved from the texts, which allowed for categorizing and comparing results with other texts or transcripts identified during the process as well as their relationship to my original assumptions (Titscher et al., 2000; Wodak & Meyer, 2009b). The interaction between theory and method was represented as a dialectical model to reinforce the need to repeat the process multiple times throughout a study. At the same time, each aspect of the process was informed by, and also iteratively informs, the complementary aspects of the dialectical characteristics. These insights are then fed back into the decision-making process and adjustments are made, if necessary (Titscher et al., 2000; Wodak & Meyer, 2009b). Determining specific texts to include begins with what is known as \"corpus-building,\" which is the process of identifying texts for analysis (Mautner, 2008). I focused on initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities at the city, state, national, and international levels. I identified five documents: a) Healthy Baltimore 2015 (city); b) Maryland Plan to Eliminate Minority Health Disparities 2006-2010 and 2010-2014 (state); c) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2011; national); d) Unequal Health Outcomes in the United States (2008; international); and e) A Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health (2010; international). The first-level review focused on 124 how the primary concepts of race/racism are conceptualized or defined. The second-level review examined concepts to achieve racial health equity including specific health promotion actions as a way to explore their discursive relationship with the conceptualization of racism. All documents are publicly available through the Internet and/or the Health Sciences and Human Services Library (HSHSL). Each of the identified texts was initially reviewed to ensure each related to eliminating racial and ethnic health inequities. I documented specific passages that defined and conceptualized racism explicitly as a concept or implicitly through the use of surrogate concepts like \"cultural competency,\" \"diversity,\" and \"health disparities\" (see Appendix A for excerpts). Appendix A was also employed during the participant interview in order to allow interviewees to identify which excerpt best described racial and ethnic health disparities and the connection between race/racism and inequitable health outcomes (questions 10A-10B of interview guide, see Appendix B for the interview guide). 4.4.2 Participant interviews as data (2): Semistructured life-world qualitative interviews with social welfare and health professionals. There are several types of qualitative interviews depending on the epistemological conceptualization underlying the interview process. Because of the project's focus on critical theories and methodologies, the qualitative interviews were conducted from a critical ethnographic perspective. I used semi-structured life-world qualitative interviews as the broad approach to the participant interviews. Kvale (2007) defines semi-structured life-world interviews as \"a planned and flexible interview with the purpose of obtaining descriptions of the life world of the interviewee with respect to interpreting the meaning of the 125 described phenomena,\" which is a compromise between a casual conversation and an inflexible survey (p. 149). The semi-structured interview questions were thematically focused to address the \"what\" of the theoretical concepts and dynamically created to establish positive rapport in addition to communicative flow (Kvale, 2007). I engaged the interviewing process so that participant's autonomy was emphasized and the researcher viewed the process as participatory rather than solely \"collecting data\" from a subject. When trying to engage and acknowledge each participant's lived experiences, active listening was probably one of the most effective ways to co-create an accurate (re)presentation of what is discussed. Combining a genuine interest in creating an effective rapport and actively listening increased the likelihood that the interactions between researcher and participants were experienced as opportunities for collaboration in knowledge production (Al\u00e9x & Hammarstr\u00f6m, 2008). 4.4.3 Recruitment. I conducted 15 individual interviews with social service health/health professionals affiliated with the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Social Work. Participants included tenure-track professors, adjunct professors, practitioners, and researchers. Each of the participants had worked a minimum of six-months in West Baltimore, an area whose residents had some of the lowest life expectancy rates in Baltimore (Ames, Evans, Fox, Milam, Petteway, & Rutledge, 2011). I relied on prior relationships with individuals from the UMB administration and various professional schools to recruit potential participants who were working in West Baltimore neighborhoods. Because of my involvement with student government at multiple levels of the campus including the Graduate School Association (GSA), the 126 University Student Government Association (USGA) level, and organizing interschool events on campus, I was able to contact key people from the above UMB schools to use various tactics to build awareness among potential participants. I met with Dr. Jane Lipscomb (PhD, RN, MS), Director of UMB's Center for Community Engagement (CCE), whose office provides a key connection between the UMB campus and the surrounding West Baltimore communities. Additional outreach methods included the distribution of an e-mail to faculty and staff from each identified school and the identification of specific organizations or projects within the community with which professionals from the corresponding UMB professional schools were associated. Upon securing initial contacts from each school, I reviewed the faculty listings for each school and proceeded to send IRB-approved e-mails to potential participants (see Appendix C). Approximately 156 e-mails were sent to faculty members from each of the three schools; 33 responded. If participants responded, my response included an attempt to inquire about people in their network who might be interested in participating. A handful of respondents offered names of colleagues. However, all of those identified had already received an e-mail from me. Eighteen of the 33 were unable to participate for various reasons including not enough work time in community, student status, or because they were not available due to medical leave, maternity leave, or vacation. The 15 study participants included five people each from the Schools of Social Work, Nursing, and Medicine. The participants included 13 females and two males; their ages ranged between 30-69 (30-39 3; 50-59 = 60-69 = 2). Participants racially identified as biracial (1), White (6), White/Caucasian (1), African American (3), Black (1), and Caucasian (3). Ethnically, participants identified as German 127 (3), Polish (1), Armenian (1), Hispanic (2), Non-Hispanic (6), and none or N/A (4). The educational level of participants included bachelor's degree (1), master's degree (4), Ph.D. (6), and MD (4). All participants worked and/or supervised students in West Baltimore for at least six months. Each interview lasted approximately 30-45 minutes. The participant reviewed two consent forms (one each for the participant and researcher) to read and sign. At this time, participants were notified of the study's focus and their right to terminate their participation in the interview or project at any time during the process. I confirmed the study's eligibility criteria was met by each participant, which included six months of work in West Baltimore and a non-student professional connected to UMB Schools of Social Work, Nursing, and Medicine. I also informed the participants that a UMB-affiliated and IRB-approved transcriptionist (Ms. Gwen Young) would be transcribing each interview. Each digital recording was sent via the secured UMB Accellion e-mail for large audio/video e-mail attachments. Further discussion about protecting participants and data is found in Section 4.6, Ethical Considerations, below. 4.4.4 Methods to enhance rigor. Padgett (2008) conceptualizes methodological rigor in qualitative research as maintaining \"trustworthiness\" through the process by creating accountability to participants, the dissertation committee, and the research process. Additionally, the researcher's actions must be ethically sound and fairly exercised in order to ensure the findings most accurately (re)present the participants' perspectives. Although the actual research process remains in the researcher's control, participants should have an active role \"in negotiating findings with researchers and shaping emerging analyses\" (Cook, 2005, p. 134). By having an active role, the 128 participants had an opportunity to include their voices and potentially challenge aspects of the interview process, which can ultimately enhance methodological rigor (Carspecken, 1996). I received consent from participants to contact them after the interview to clarify any responses or get additional information about a particular question, if necessary. Additionally, I thoroughly reviewed all the recorded interviews and compared them to the transcriptions to ensure accuracy. I also met at least bi-monthly with Dr. Michael Reisch, my dissertation chair, to discuss my interview experiences and address any questions or concerns that arose. There are specific strategies to strengthen methodological rigor in qualitative studies. The complementary use of GT and CDA offered additional opportunities to compare initial codes, categories, and themes with the various dimensions of discourse in the dialectical-relational approach to CDA. Because CDA is considered a theory/methodology and GT loosely relies on previously established theoretical premises, there are opportunities for theoretical and methodological triangulation (Padgett, 2008). It is important, however, to avoid the use of triangulation to identify a homogeneous, singular \"reality.\" To enhance rigor in the research process it is preferable to allow the possible (and likely) heterogeneity of data to reveal itself without attempting to fit it into a methodological \"box\" (Padgett, 2008). GT provided an accountability process to support the steps taken to identify the preliminary concepts emphasized in the texts and transcripts by sifting through the raw text for initial codes, categories, and ultimately, themes. It supported a methodological approach to determine what the text represented rather than forcing the discourse into preconceived themes. 129 Part of the reflexivity mentioned above also played an important role in producing credible findings by accounting for my biases, beliefs, values, and overall approach to producing knowledge (Al\u00e9x & Hammarstr\u00f6m, 2008). Specific steps were taken immediately following each interview to further ensure I am critically reflecting on the interview process. Shortly after completing each interview, I listened to the entire session and added notes to my research journal in order to gain further insights into researcher/participant power dynamics (racial, social status, gender, etc.) and to maintain a record of the interview process (Al\u00e9x & Hammarstr\u00f6m, 2008). Given the subjective power I had in choosing the texts for the CDA, it was imperative that I included strategies to avoid an overreliance on documents that agree with my personal views while completely ignoring others that are not in line with them. I documented my process of including additional documents in my research journal to counterbalance the potential biased aspects of subjectivity as Mautner (2008) suggests. This informed discussions with my dissertation committee. I used my research journal to inform our discussions and strengthen my accountability to the research process. Finally, I consulted with my chair, Dr. Reisch, and committee members on a regular basis to support a research process where the data guided me and not vice versa. 4.5 Data Analysis 4.5.1 Grounded theory. For the current study, I used a constructivist approach to grounded theory by focusing the analysis through a social justice lens. Charmaz's (2006) constructivist grounded theory used in the current research consists of three different coding stages: initial, focused, and axial coding. Initial coding requires the researcher to read the data thoroughly, paying attention to the \"action\" of the data by 130 using gerunds (\"receiving support,\" \"confronting discrimination,\") as descriptors (Charmaz, 2011). The subsequent phases of axial and thematic coding produced categories and themes, respectively. After thoroughly verifying the accuracy of each transcript by comparing them to their respective recording, every transcription and policy text received a line-by-line coding by hand using Microsoft Word for Macs comment box feature to identify initial codes. The comment box annotated the page number and initial codes from each transcript. Upon completing the initial phase of coding, tables were created for each transition from one coding phase to another (e.g., initial to focused coding, focused coding to axial coding) in order to visually represent the process. The codes were copied and pasted to the corresponding interview questions for the individual participants within a coding table. The coding tables included formatting that grouped responses according to professional affiliation (social work, nursing, or medicine) or by policy text title so the eventual categories and themes represented the aggregated responses from each social welfare/health profession and policy text, respectively. Focused codes emerged by determining the adequacy and the conceptual strength of initial codes as a result of answering what the codes imply and what do they reveal (Charmaz, 2014). Subsequently, the focused codes formed the basis for building categories through the axial coding process, which aims to identify properties of a category and restore the fractured data revealed in the focused coding (Charmaz, 2014). The second stage of constructivist GT is focused coding, where the initial codes are analyzed as a way to better understand possible grouping of codes, check frequency of codes, and annotate gaps in the data (Charmaz, 2006; Johnson, 2013). During the focused 131 coding phase, codes were grouped according to the corresponding question for each participant and labeled under a specific transcription page number in order to clearly review and reflect on the subsequent coding phases. Additionally, I aggregated all focused codes from the five participants in each profession to better understand inter- and intra-professional conceptualizations of race, racism, and Whiteness. For the policy texts, I aggregated codes according to each document. As the coding process transitioned from focused to axial coding, categories emerged. Axial coding was the third stage of coding, which entailed organizing categories around central descriptors (or axes) and thus, exploring the dimensions of, and relations between, categories and sub-categories of the data (Johnson, 2013; Salda\u00f1a, 2012). During the transition from focused to axial coding, I identified particular question/code groupings to more accurately reflect relevant codes related to how social welfare/health professionals understand health and community context (questions 2B30 and 3); health disparities and inequities (questions 5A-5B); race, racism, and Whiteness (questions 6A-6C); and how racial concepts influence health outcomes (question 7). It is important to note that not only did respondents hear question 7 but I also presented a chart (see Appendix D) to interview participants as a way to visually represent the differential outcomes between Upton/Druid Heights and Roland Park/Poplar Hill. Codes from questions 2A, 4, and 8 formed the basis for exploring research question 3, what is the relationship between the discourse and conceptualization of racial concepts and the actions taken by professionals to address inequitable health outcomes? As categories were identified in the policy texts, thematic groupings began to form. 30 Although the wording for question 2B read, what factors beyond access to health care contribute to health and wellness, most of the participants responded with challenges that they perceived to hinder residents in West Baltimore from attaining health and wellness. 132 After identifying categories from each grouping of interview questions, I aggregated the categories across interview questions in order to form a more holistic view of themes based on the questions' common focus. Each corresponding grouping of questions for each profession includes: a) an overview of the coding phases for each profession (initial, focused, and axial); b) a section dedicated to aggregating categories of each grouping of questions in order to identify overall themes to the corresponding professions; and c) a concluding discussion comparing the three professions' themes. These discursive themes, in addition to the themes from initiatives to address racial and ethnic disparities, created a connecting point between GT and CDA. By identifying themes through a grounded theory analysis, I thematically condensed the language and meaning as a manageable way to transition to an analysis of the discourse. Throughout the coding process, it was important for me to write and review memos (as part of the researcher journaling) as a way to annotate the comparative insights and highlight key ideas emerging from the both the data and the various stages of coding. Grounded theory and thematic identification allowed me to analyze the data as an initial methodology to gain increased perspective of what the data are saying. Although the focus of using grounded theory here was not to create a new theory, its process of coding and theme identification further informed the analysis by revealing the discursive themes. The discursive themes from GT served as focal point for the CDA and supported my need to deepen my understanding of the texts. Subsequently, CDA provided a deeper level of analysis where the text and transcriptions are connected to socio-cultural aspects of society such as power relations (hegemony), ideology, and social change. 133 4.5.2 Critical discourse analysis. Fairclough's (1992, 2009, 2010) dialectical-relational approach to CDA guided the analysis of texts and interviews. It reflects an inductive process of CDA, where the reasoning evolves from several specific different perspectives into broader generalizations. Discourse within the dialectical-relational approach is \"used in various senses including (a) meaning-making as an element of the social process; (b) the language associated with a particular social field or practice (e.g., 'political discourse'); and (c) a way of construing aspects of the world with a particular social perspective (e.g., 'neo-liberal discourse of globalisation' [sic])\" (Fairclough, 2010, p. 230). As previously discussed in the theory chapter, Fairclough's (1992) dialectical-relational approach to CDA follows a three-dimensional analysis of discourse as text, discursive (discourse) practice, and social practice in addition to analyzing their dialectical-relational interconnectivity. In other words, \"relations between elements are dialectical in the sense of being different but not 'discrete,' i.e., not fully separate\" (Fairclough, 2010, pp. 230-231). The dialectical-relational approach consists of four stages, which include (a) identifying a social issue through a semiotic31 relationship; (b) determining barriers to addressing the social issue; (c) considering whether the \"social order\" requires the social issue; and (d) identifying possible solutions to the social issue (Fairclough, 2009). Within each stage, there are corresponding steps. Fairclough's (2009) first stage requires the researcher to identify a \"social wrong,\" in this case, the injustice inherently related to racial and ethnic health inequities. The social issue must be trans-disciplinary in terms of 31 Semiotic (or semiosis) refers to the theory and use of signs, which encompasses three sub-disciplines: semantics (for relationships between signs an objects), pragmatics (for the relationship of sign and interpreter to the subject of investigation), and syntax (the formal relation of signs to each other) (Titscher et al., 2000, p. 243). 134 its dialectical-relational relationship between signs/symbols (semiotics) and other meaning-making events. Inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes present a major, persistent social issue currently and where racism often goes undefined or conceptualized through an individualistic theoretical lens (Paradies, 2006a, 2006b). Although the unjust and possible avoidable nature of racial and ethnic health outcomes is sometimes in question within academic and research settings, most people suffering the consequences of marginally effective strategies to eliminate inequitable health outcomes are fairly clear about the \"wrongness\" of the unhealthy circumstances they find themselves. The discursive (or semiotic) entry point becomes the initiatives (texts) to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities, which often limit the conceptualization or investigation of concepts like power, ideology, and racism. Stage two, identifying challenges to addressing the \"social wrong,\" comprises two preliminary steps and constitutes a primary analytical component of the dialectical-relational approach. The first step is a preliminary analysis of the relationships between the discourse and other elements such as orders of discourse and elements of social practices, texts, and elements of events (Fairclough, 2009). For example, orders of discourse (or how discourse is ordered) related to the social domain of racial and ethnic health inequities include health promotion, initiatives to eliminate inequitable health outcomes, and health disparities research. These are analyzed in relation to professional practice/procedures. Step two includes identifying texts and categories for applying the analysis to various aspects of discourse (Fairclough, 2009). The themes identified in the GT analysis are also part of the identification process indicated in this step. 135 Step three of stage two includes the primary analyses, which include the textual, discourse practice, and social practice. Fairclough (1992) begins with a textual analysis by asking \"interactional questions\" about the macro-level properties of the text such as who is controlling the framing of initiatives and agendas to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities? The textual analysis included discursive theme identification (identifying thematic structure), word meaning and frequency (key racial concepts and words where the potential structured meaning acts in a hegemonic way and as a potential site for resistance), and wording (comparing and contrasting wording across texts, with a focus on contradictory meanings; Fairclough, 1992, 2001, 2012). Analyzing discourse practice relies on the textual findings to inform its analysis of interdiscursivity/manifest intertextuality (which focuses on how texts are produced), inter-textual chains (which focuses on the distribution of texts), and coherence (which focuses on how texts are interpreted; Fairclough, 1992, pp. 232-233). Finally, the analysis of social practice focuses on the social matrix of discourse (which identifies possible hegemonic social structures and relations), orders of discourse (which identifies relationship between social and discursive practices and their contribution to or challenging of existing orders of discourse) and, the ideological and political effects of discourse (which include \"systems of knowledge and beliefs, social relations, social identities [selves]\"; Fairclough, 1992, pp. 237-238). The next section focuses on ethical considerations, which include strategies to protect participants in the data collection process. 4.6 Ethical Considerations 4.6.1 Strategies for protecting participants and institutional review board (IRB) approval. Protecting participants and the data collected during individual 136 interviews were a primary ethical concern in the research process. I completed the required training for research with human subjects through the University of Maryland (UMB). Additionally, I completed an application for review and approval by the UMB Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to any contact with participants. Confidentiality and privacy were also vital concepts in conducting an ethical research study. A concise but thorough written explanation about the nature and focus of the study was provided to all participants (see Appendices B and C). Upon agreeing to participate in the study, each research participant received an explanation about the informed consent process and two consent forms to sign, one to keep for his/her records and one for the researcher. Because of the emotionally charged nature of racism, the participants were informed that their participation is voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time during the study. Provisions were also available for anyone feeling overwhelmed by the topic during or immediately after the trainings. These included resources to contact for immediate support, which no one requested. Privacy rights and respect for peoples' decisions about participating were discussed after participants agree to meet for an interview. 4.6.2 Strategies for protecting data. The participant interviews were immediately downloaded into a password protected computer file, to which only the researcher had access. A certified transcriptionist (Ms. Gwen Young), as prescribed by the UMB School of Social Work, did the interview transcriptions. Once transcriptions were completed and returned to the researcher, they were kept in a password protected electronic file on my personal laptop computer to which no one else had access. Paper 137 copy transcriptions, handwritten memos, and notes from journaling were stored in a locked cabinet to which no one else had access. 138 Chapter 5: Results 5.1 Introduction This chapter presents the grounded theory (GT) coding analysis of the initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities and interviews with 15 social welfare/health professionals. Section 5.2 provides the findings for the GT analysis of the initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities, while section 5.3 offers the GT results of social welfare/health professionals' interviews across social worker, nursing, and medical participants. Section 5.4 presents possible connections between the professional interviewees' actions and how they frame racial concepts. Finally, the critical discourse analysis (CDA) findings from the initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities and social welfare/health professionals' interviews are presented in Chapter 6 (Discussion) instead of Chapter 5 (Findings) because of the unique interpretive nature of critical discourse analysis (CDA). Although findings still emerged from the CDA, the interpretive power of the methodology provided a unique approach to the Discussion Chapter. The discourse analysis furthered the thematic analysis from GT by analyzing the contextual social and political meanings undergirding the discourse. An extended discussion of CDA was presented in Sections 3.3.1 (Theory) and 4.5.2 (Methodology), which describes its analysis of language, discourse, power, and ideology. The grounded theory thematic analysis used to collect the information presented in this chapter was described in Chapter 4. The following is a brief summary of the data sources analyzed through grounded theory and critical discourse analysis to develop the findings. The analyses offered insights to the following research questions: 139 1) How does the conceptualization of race, racism, and Whiteness influence the discourse on health disparities/inequities within international, national, state, and local policy initiatives whose expressed purpose is to address disparate or inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? 2) How do social welfare/health professionals conceptualize race, racism, and Whiteness in their discourse, as it relates to disparate or inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? 3) What is the relationship between the discourse conceptualizing race, racism, and Whiteness and the actions taken by professionals to address disparate or inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? 5.2 Initiatives Addressing Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities This section focuses on the grounded theory analysis and thematic identification conducted on the five initiatives addressing racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities. Each document is discussed and then a brief comparison of the themes is provided at the end of the section. All focused codes and category reference numbers are found in the Appendix section, under the corresponding initiative, unless otherwise indicated. Table 5.1 provides an example of how text from an initiative or transcript became a code, then category, and eventually a theme. 5.2.1 Healthy Baltimore. Healthy Baltimore's explicit purpose is to identify challenges and priorities in order to use \"the goals and indicators provided in the report to go beyond traditional health measures and explore the root causes that tend to drive health inequities\" (p. 3). I identified 119 initial codes, which then led to 67 focused codes (see Appendix E). Several focused codes focused on \"promoting\" or \"promotion\" of 140 particular health-related behaviors, resources, or access to health care (focused codes 22-24, 29, 35, 44). Additional focused codes referred to individual outcome indicators as goals to various aspects of health promotion, many identifying \"reducing\" or \"decreasing\" individual behaviors such as \"rate of substance related admissions,\" \"students' self-reports of substance abuse,\" and \"decreasing density of vacant buildings.\" Table 5.1 Coding Process Example 141 The next phase of coding, axial, produced eight categories encompassing the 67 focused codes. \"Improving access to and quality of health care\" formed a category with the most focused codes (16). Two categories, \"personal-level risk factors\" and \"decreasing unhealthy personal behaviors,\" implicitly identify the community residents' responsibility to decrease racial and ethnic health inequities. Social and policy context also formed the basis for two additional categories, \"policy decisions influencing health\" and \"promoting healthy neighborhoods.\" Finally, \"measuring and reporting racial and social indicators\" or statistical representation of outcomes was another prominent category. From these eight categories, four themes emerged: a) health promotion and health care access; b) public policy and health; c) engagement and collaboration; and d) data collection and reporting. An important finding from the initial coding process was the minimal framing of racial concepts such as race or racism or even defining \"health disparities\" (related to racial and ethnic groups). However, each identified health disparity between racial groups includes charts highlighting the differential outcomes between African American/Black and White populations. 5.2.2 Maryland Plan. The Maryland Plan to Eliminate Minority Health Disparities (MD Plan) comprises two texts: one for planning (2006-2010) and the other for implementation (2010-2014). Both were coded individually through the axial coding process, where the categories were aggregated in order to form the themes. Together the documents produced 736 initial codes (488\u2014the planning document; 248\u2014the implementation document). During the focused coding process, the combined documents included 161 total codes (103\u2014planning document; 58\u2014implementation document; see 142 Appendix F). The planning document's focused codes referred to data collection and research (codes 9, 10, 16, 18-20, 23, 25, 30), stakeholder collaboration and policy integration (codes 40-43, 45, 47), and defining racial concepts and health disparities (codes 51-55), among others. Focused codes relating to collaboration and data collection were also found in the implementation document. Cultural and linguistic competency focused codes also emerged in both the planning and implementation documents. The focused codes from the planning document (2006-2010) laid the groundwork for 13 categories. These include a) data collection, monitoring and research; b) multisectoral collaboration and policy integration; c) improving access to and quality of health care; d) policy and framework for action; e) economic impact of health disparities; f) defining health disparities; g) defining racial terms; h) racially diversify health care workforce; i) cultural and linguistic competency; j) contextualize social aspects of health disparities; k) public input and stakeholder feedback; l) health care is a human right; and m) discourse on health disparities. Pertinent to the current study, the MD Plan provided definitions for key concepts such as \"health disparities,\" \"race,\" and \"ethnicity.\" However, there was no connection made between differential health outcomes between racial groups and racism. Two categories, \"health care is a human right\" and \"discourse on health disparities,\" also emphasized the social justice perspective associated with health disparities and how the public comes to understand what these mean through public discourse. Although both are identified as categories, there was only one focused code undergirding each category, which reflects a limited (but important) contextualization of these categories within the actual document. 143 There were six categories from the implementation document (2010-2014): a) state-sanctioned organization creation; b) improved usage and coordination of health disparities data; c) coordination and collaboration among stakeholders; d) cultural and linguistic competency and understanding; e) funding and grants; and f) promoting health awareness. An obvious distinction between the categories identified from the planning and implementation documents is the latter focuses more on actions to address racial and ethnic health disparities. Common categories between the planning and implementation include health disparities data, coordination and collaboration, cultural and linguistic competency, and promoting healthy behaviors. In other words, there is almost a direct correlation between the issue identified in the planning document and the suggested solution in the implementation document. For example, \"limited\" or \"lacking\" cultural and linguistic competency is identified as part of the problem (health disparities) and more cultural competency skills/services are called for in the implementation document. The 19 categories between the planning and implementation documents formed an aggregated grouping in order to identify ten themes. The identified themes include a) collaboration and feedback; b) discourse and context of health disparities; c) health promotion and health care access; d) data collection and monitoring; e) policy and legislation; f) defining racial terms; g) diversifying workforce; h) cultural and linguistic competency; i) health care economics and funding; and j) health care is a human right. Taken collectively, there is a combination of individually focused issue/solution identification. For example, themes such as \"health promotion and health care access\" and \"cultural and linguistic competency\" are more interpersonally focused whereas 144 themes \"policy and legislation\" and \"health care is a human right\" emphasize a more macro perspective. 5.2.3 HHS Plan. The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) 2011 Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (HHS Plan) represents a comprehensive state-sanctioned plan to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities. After completing the initial phase of coding, 357 initial codes were identified. Subsequently, these initial codes formed the basis for 96 focused codes (see Appendix G). Prominent groupings of focused codes included emphasis on measuring and monitoring racial health disparities data (focused codes 35, 39, 40, 41, 43, 54), promoting healthy behaviors and education (codes 77, 79, 84, 87, 88, 92) and collaboration between stakeholders (codes 10, 12, 17, 19, 23, 25, 26). Similar to the MD Plan, the HHS Plan highlighted cultural and linguistic competency and diversifying the workforce as both issues and solutions to addressing racial and ethnic health disparities. The 96 focused codes then entered the axial phase of coding where nine categories were identified. The categories included a) link public and private community-level stakeholders to deliver programs; b) collaboration and outreach; c) state-sanctioned health disparity reduction plans; d) measuring, monitoring and evaluating racial and ethnic health data; e) increase access to quality health care; f) cultural and linguistic competency skills; g) diversify health professional workforce; h) professionals' awareness of health disparities; and i) promoting healthy behaviors and health care education. There is a distinctive focus on individual-focused issue and solution development with categories such as stakeholder collaboration, education and awareness, and quality health care and promoting healthy behaviors. From these nine 145 categories, six themes emerged: a) collaboration and overlapping policy actions; b) health promotion and health care access; c) health disparity awareness; d) diversify workforce; e) data collection and monitoring; and f) cultural and linguistic competency skills. 5.2.4 CERD Report. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) Unequal Health Outcomes (CERD Report) is a report focused on monitoring nation-states' compliance of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), where the U.S. is one of those signatories. Upon conducting an initial coding analysis, 405 codes were identified. The next phase of coding produced 138 focused codes (see Appendix H), which grouped around such broad concepts as government and policy accountability (codes 13, 16, 19, 22, 135, 137); government policies creating racial and ethnic health disparities (codes 39, 40, 43, 45); and the economic pressures contributing to racial health disparities (codes 98, 99, 101, 103, 104). Three groupings of focused codes were similar to the previous three initiatives, which include access and quality of health care, cultural competency, and increasing workforce diversity. However, these received less emphasis than the other Unequal Health Outcomes' focused codes mentioned in the previous sentences. The 138 focused codes evolved into 13 categories through the axial coding process, which included such divergent code groupings such as economic \"medical apartheid\" and diversifying the workforce, with the former referring to separate but unequal health care for low-income and \"minority\" patients. The 13 categories include a) structural inequities producing racialized health outcomes; b) government's non-accountability to eliminate racial health disparities; c) government and institution policies 146 creating/perpetuating racial and ethnic health disparities; d) challenging disparate racial outcomes; e) reporting accurate data about racial and ethnic health outcomes; f) improving access to and quality of health care; g) economic and medical apartheid; h) racialized social interactions; i) social and community-level determinants of health; j) racial segregation; k) cultural and linguistic competency; l) increasing workforce diversity; and m) health care as a human right. The subsequent thematic identification led to seven themes: a) racialized health outcomes and social determinants; b) policy impact and disparate outcomes; c) workforce diversity and cultural competency; d) government [non]accountability to eliminate racial health disparities; e) health care access and quality; f) economics and medical apartheid; and g) health care as a human right. A unique theme, as compared to previously discussed documents, is the government [non]accountability to eliminate health disparities. It emphasizes the important concept of accountability, which inherently includes aspects of social power when determining whether systems and institutions are accountable to community residents in their follow through of identified objectives related to eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities. 5.2.5 WHO Framework. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health (WHO Framework) is a document that recommends a framework, resources, and actions to address health inequities. The initial coding phase produced 282 initial codes, which subsequently resulted in the identification of 118 focused codes (see Appendix I). New focused code groupings emerged from the WHO Framework, such as the importance of political context, socioeconomic factors, stratification, conceptualizing power, and redistribution 147 policies to ameliorate health inequities. Because of its explicit focus on presenting a conceptual framework, these concepts received theoretical explanation. For example, the concept of \"power\" received extensive discussion as it relates to both the systemic and political forces making decisions about health inequity policy but also the community residents' power to be \"active protagonists\" (focused code 80) and \"the need to account for political and power-related variables\" (focused code 69). Additionally, social positioning and stratification along identities arose as complementary forces that create ongoing health inequities, which provided an intersectional lens to investigate one's relationship to power and their affect on equitable health. The axial coding process transformed the 118 focused codes into 13 categories: a) social determinants of health conceptual framework; b) political context and responsibility of the state; c) structural determinants of health inequities; d) social context and stratification; e) social positioning and conceptualizing power; f) clarifying \"power\" in \"empowerment;\" g) human rights, key concept for health equity; h) redistribution policies to address health inequities; i) health equity as an ethical foundation; j) measuring and analyzing determinants of health inequities; k) defining racial terms; l) intermediary determinants of health; and m) failed traditional approaches to eliminating health inequities. The WHO Framework categories formed connections between health equity and ethics, human rights, and critically examination of previous approaches to eliminating racial and ethnic health inequities. Subsequently, five themes were identified: a) social determinants of health conceptual framework; b) social power and political context; c) human rights and ethical policies; d) measuring and analyzing determinants of health inequities; and e) defining racial terms. 148 5.2.6 Thematic comparison of initiatives. Each of the documents provided various perspectives of conceptualizing racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities. Although every text specifically expressed a commitment to addressing, reducing, or eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities, there was a noticeable scarcity of conceptualizing or even defining racial concepts such as race, racism, or Whiteness. The Maryland Plan defined race and ethnicity, in addition to providing a substantial discussion regarding health disparities. However, the differential racial health outcomes were not framed as unjust, unfair, or as racism. Referring to Table 5.2, there were four common themes across the three U.S. initiatives: a) health promotion and access to health care; b) engagement and collaboration; c) data collection and monitoring; and d) policy and legislation actions. Cultural and linguistic competency and diversifying the workforce were additional identified themes in the Maryland and HHS plans. The international texts, the CERD Report and the WHO Framework, included focused more on government accountability (or lack thereof), social and political power dynamics, and health as a human right. The emphasis of themes varied across texts. Although data collection and monitoring was discussed in every document, the emphasis in the U.S documents focused on objectively collecting racial health disparities data to better understand the issue. Conversely, the UN CERD Report highlighted the need for racial and ethnic health data that are accurate. The report actually challenged the health data presented by the U.S. government by highlighting its under-reporting of pervasive racial and ethnic disparities throughout the lifespan. Similarly, the theme \"health care as a human right\" is mentioned in the Maryland Plan but is done so in limited context, basically stated in one sentence 149 Table 5.2 Themes (in Bold) and Categories of Health Initiatives 150 without additional discussion or explanation about how this fits within the broader plan. (continued) 151 without additional discussion or explanation about how this fits within the broader plan. On the other hand, the CERD Report and the WHO Framework provide political and social context to further elaborate on why health is a human right and action steps to make it happen. 5.3 Social Service and Health Professional Interviews\u2014Grounded Theory Analysis Sections 5.3 and 5.4 present findings from social service and health professionals' responses to interview questions identified in Table 5.3, which provide the basis for answering research questions 2 and 3, respectively. Because I identified particular question/code groupings to more accurately reflect relevant codes related to how social welfare/health professionals understand health and community context (questions 2B32 and 3); health disparities and inequities (questions 5A-5B); race, racism, and Whiteness (questions 6A-6C); and how racial concepts influence health outcomes (question 7). It's important to note that not only did respondents hear question 7 but I also presented a chart (see Appendix D) to participants as a way to visually represent the differential outcomes between Upton/Druid Heights and Roland Park/Poplar Hill. Codes from questions 2A, 4 and 8 formed the basis for exploring research question 3, what is the relationship between the discourse and conceptualization of racial concepts and the actions taken by professionals to address inequitable health outcomes? Like the health promotion texts to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities, the social service/health 32 Although the wording for question 2B read, what factors beyond access to healthcare contribute to health and wellness, most of the participants responded with challenges that they perceived to hinder residents in West Baltimore from attaining health and wellness. The vast majority of discourse around racial and ethnic health disparities focuses on \"access to healthcare\" as a barrier to health and wellness. It makes sense respondents would include additional barriers to health and wellness. 152 professional interviews followed the constructivist grounded theory coding approach, which included initial, focused, and axial steps to ascertain relevant codes, categories, Table 5.3 Participant Interview Questions 153 and themes (Charmaz, 2006, 2014). The following section provides a broad overview of the initial coding process. This is followed by a more detailed discussion about findings related to the aggregated codes from each profession and interview question groupings. 5.3.1 Social work professionals. Health and community context\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (questions 2B and 3). There were 42 aggregated focused codes for questions 2B (factors beyond access to health care contributing to health and wellness) and 3 (challenges to achieving more equitable health outcomes), from the five social work participants (see Appendix J). Six focused codes 10-12, 15, 38, 39 referenced some form of distrust in describing the health context of West Baltimore. Several participants mentioned the issue of distrust between residents and professionals as a prominent factor within the context of community interactions. Additional focused codes affecting residents' health involved various aspects of the community such as limited access to foods (focused codes 1, 2, 7), \"dilapidated homes\"/limited housing (focused codes 6, 19, 34). Cumulatively, these focused codes represented an axial code (category), social and structural health determinants, which each question contained as a category. When addressing the challenges and barriers to health within the community context, the responses often focused on institutional and systemic barriers to health. Participant 6 poignantly identified systems as a distinct barrier within those social and structural health determinants based on interactions with community residents by stating, \"It's easier to be 'resilient' and to overcome one or two dysfunctional system[s], but when your entire life is overcoming the educational system, overcoming the justice system, overcoming [the] health care system, I can't imagine. I wouldn't swap shoes with 154 them any day.\" Not only does this indicate an awareness of systemic barriers that residents face but also an understanding relative position of power as a professional and not wanting to give that up. Nine total categories were identified for questions 2B and 3, as indicated in Table 5.4 below. Only one participant identified race or \"everyday racism\" as a challenge to good health or a contributor to poor health (focused codes 13 and 14). The reference to \"everyday racism\" is an important concept within racial theories, which connects structural racism to common everyday interactions and ideological aspects of racism to individual attitudes/beliefs (Essed, 1991). Although only one participant mentioned race and racism as a barrier or contributing factor to health and wellness, I deemed the category relevant based on the research subject and the focus of conducting grounded theory through a social justice lens (Charmaz, 2011; MacDonald, 2001). In addition to the category \"social and structural health determinants,\" two other categories were identified through axial coding, which include \"lack of resources to access health services, knowledge, and behaviors\" and \"mistrust and racial stress.\" Health disparities and inequities\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (questions 5A-5B). Questions 5A and 5B focused on ascertaining the of \"health disparities\" and \"health inequities\" (see Appendix K). The literature indicates each term is often used interchangeably, along with \"health inequalities,\" which is predominantly a European concept (Isaac, 2013). Five focused codes were identified per question for a total of ten, where \"differences\" and \"inequity\" in health access and outcomes highlighted a majority of the focused codes (8 out of 10 codes). Four categories 155 Table 5.4 Social Work Categories and Themes Comparison 156 developed, including barriers to health care access; differential health care access and health outcomes; differing levels of health care and access based on identities; and inequitable health outcomes, opportunities, and services. The common reference to some form of \"different\" (levels of access, health outcomes, etc.) is more descriptive than the tautological explanation of \"health inequities\" by defining them as \"inequitable health outcomes.\" The four categories resulted in two themes, \"differential health access and outcomes\" and \"differential/inequitable health care access and outcomes.\" These two themes appear quite similar however, differential health outcomes (health disparity) and differential health care outcomes (health care disparity) represent different \"differences.\" According to the Maryland Plan to Eliminate Minority Health Disparities (2006), a health disparity refers to the differential burden of illness or mortality between groups of people and health care disparities are differences in access, insurance coverage, or quality of health care. Race, racism, and Whiteness\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (questions 6A-6C). Participant answers to the following questions regarding the definitions of race, racism, and Whiteness formed the basis for key codes and themes to answering research question two (see Appendix L). A total of 32 focused codes were identified across all three questions, which included 12 for race, 8 for racism, and 12 for Whiteness. The focused codes for \"race\" revolved around racial self-identification, racial categorization, social construct, skin color, and confusion/conflation of the term. Participant 1 accurately sums up the varying understandings of \"race\" by saying, \"Race is, I think, an interesting, fascinating, juicy, scary, horrific kind of topic to try to define, because it's all human 157 created.\" The 12 focused codes for \"race\" resulted in three categories: a) skin-color identification; b) self-defined characteristic and categorization; and c) conflation with other concepts. The resulting themes included \"skin color self-identification and categorization\" and \"conflating concepts.\" Racism produced eight focused codes, which included such concepts as (pre)judgments (focused codes 65, 66, 68, 71), discrimination (68, 72), control (69, 70), and power (67, 69). Although \"control\" and \"power\" were identified less than the other two focused codes, both were connected to individual and institutional power to control messages and perceptions. Additionally, Participant 6 offered a unique view of the intersection of control and power as it relates to resisting social inequity, \"I think in terms of racism and power that there's, I actually think that people do give just enough power to other groups that they prevent rebellion and revolt, but not enough to actually make things equitable or just.\" Two categories were identified through the axial coding process, which include \"racial prejudgments and discrimination\" and \"control through institutional and systemic power.\" In turn, these served as the basis for two themes, \"racial prejudgments and discrimination\" and \"control and power.\" The answers to defining \"Whiteness\" created 12 focused codes. Common terms and concepts included skin color (focused codes 73, 77, 83, 84), power (78, 79, 84), dominant (78, 84), and profit/wealth (74, 80, 81). As indicated by the codes \"power\" and \"dominant,\" these terms were used in conjunction with each other. Additionally, focused code 84 (group most dominant and controlling, in relationship to power, based on skin color) incorporated all three and indicated relational interconnection between the concepts in understanding \"Whiteness.\" \"Culture\" also came up from two respondents 158 and Participant 6 clearly connected culture with focused codes \"dominant\" and \"power\" describing \"Whiteness\" as \"me, my culture, and the dominant culture of the U.S. in terms of, certainly in terms of power.\" A majority of the five participants had a hard time defining \"Whiteness,\" which was indicated by several \"I don't knows\" and expressions of surprise when questioned. The 12 focused codes for \"Whiteness\" developed into three categories, which include privileged and dominant skin color; dominant White culture and relationship to social power; and value profit over health outcomes. Ultimately, two themes emerged from the categories, \"dominant White culture\" and \"profits over outcomes\" in describing Whiteness. The overall thematic count for the three questions addressing race, racism, and Whiteness is six. I attempted to aggregate the themes in order to condense them further; however, the result yielded an oversimplified and decontextualized view of very complex concepts so a methodological decision was made to include two themes from each question. The broader range of themes better represented the various levels of conceptual understanding and ultimate translation in the critical discourse analysis. Racial concepts, influence on health\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (question 7). Question 7 focused on ways race, racism, and Whiteness influence health outcomes in an attempt to understand how participants connect racial concepts with inequitable health statuses (see Appendix M). Twenty-nine focused codes emerged from participant responses, with a wide variation of explanations ranging from institutional/systemic distrust (focused codes 85, 89, 90, 93) and micro-aggressions (113) to limiting resident choices (95) and economic challenges (86, 97). One participant expressed an understanding of how the US Public Health Services, Tuskegee Study and how residents 159 perceive the \"medical model\" as \"still stealing from African American communities.\" Participants also attributed the influence of racial concepts on health to the privileging of White people within the health care system (focused codes 86-88, 92, 103, 107). The axial coding process produced three categories: a) privileging White people within the health care system; b) increased distrust of health and welfare systems; and c) racialized differences and barriers. Because of the relative divergent nature found in the categories, the three categories formed the basis for three central themes, which included systemic privileging of White people; distrust of health-related systems; and racialized differences and barriers. The social work categories and themes, from each question area, are presented in Table 5.4. Overall, social workers identified the challenges and barriers to health by identifying the social (ecological) context of the community through structural determinants of health, which focused more on the systemic and institutional barriers. Social workers also included an individual-based theme by identifying limited services and knowledge, bridging the connection between structural and individual societal factors. Mistrust and racial stress rounded out this grouping of questions, which was also identified as a theme (distrusting health-related systems) in Question 7, how racial concepts influence health. Questions 5A-5B about health disparities and inequities produced some fairly homogenous themes revolving around differential health care access and health outcomes (health disparities) and inequitable health outcomes/opportunities related to identities. Social worker responses to questions about race, racism, and Whiteness produced a broad range of responses, which resulted in six themes. Two of the themes, \"skin color 160 self-identification and categorization\" and \"racial prejudgments and discrimination,\" are focused on an individualized conceptualization of race and racism. Conversely, three additional themes emphasize a more structural and systemic conceptualization of racial concepts. These are \"control and power,\" \"dominant White culture,\" and \"profits over outcomes.\" The remaining theme, \"conflating concepts,\" indicated a general lack of clarity regarding the concept of race. Question 7 themes focused on how the process of privileging White people occurs as a result of individual skin privilege and through \"dominant and controlling\" relationships to institutions and systems. 5.3.2 Nursing professionals. Health and community context\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (questions 2B and 3). Questions 2B and 3 relate to the community context (factors beyond access to health care and challenges to achieving health). After aggregating the five social work transcriptions, each question contributed 46 and 81 initial codes, respectively (see Appendix N). Subsequently, a total of 37 focused codes were identified from both questions. Similar to social work, nursing participants identified trust/distrust between professionals and residents as a barrier to health and wellness multiple times (focused codes 7, 22-24, 35-37). Participant 14 delineated how residents \"mistrust\" fluctuate depending on who is receiving care stating, \"And there's the mistrust; people don't wanna go cause they don't really trust. For their kids they'll trust, but not for themselves.\" Other focused codes referenced individual residents \"lacking\" something such as health care knowledge (focused codes 2, 4, 10, 15, 16) or sufficient time to build relationships with providers (17, 21, 32, 33). 161 The axial coding process produced five categories: a) lacking health and health care education; b) social and structural health determinants; c) limited time and relationships; d) lack of trust; and e) interpersonal communication and understanding \"real\" needs. From these categories, three themes developed as limited health awareness, distrust and limited relationship building time, and social and structural determinants of health. Health disparities and inequities\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (questions 5A-5B). The aggregated initial codes for questions 5A and 5B totaled 17, which led to 13 focused codes (see Appendix O). The three concepts that participants identified most frequently when defining \"health disparities\" were \"differences,\" \"gaps,\" and \"inequities.\" These were also found in descriptions for \"health inequities,\" however, there were additional descriptors identified for \"inequities\" such as \"equal treatment\" and \"different causes.\" One participant offered the same definition for both \"disparities\" and \"inequities,\" which included a distinguishing descriptor, \"nonmodifiable risk factor,\" as used in reference to differential health outcomes. Another participant identified a \"justice principle\" as an element of health equity or as lacking in health inequities. The \"nonmodifiable\" and \"justice principle\" language are similar to the \"unavoidability\" and \"unjust\" nature of inequities described by Whitehead (1992) when defining a health inequity, meaning a factor contributing to differential health outcomes that is unchangeable and not \"unjust\" such as biological variations between groups of people. Conversely, particular groups of people not having equitable opportunities to health and wellness are considered avoidable and lacking a \"justice principle.\" 162 The 13 focused codes evolved into four categories: a) inequitable opportunities for quality health care access; b) differences in health outcomes; c) differing opportunities and exposure to unhealthy factors; and d) gaps in health status/outcomes. In turn, two themes emerged from the four categories; differential/inequitable opportunities and outcomes and differences not based on nonmodifiable risk factors. Ironically, two nursing participants used the term \"inequities\" to describe \"health disparities,\" which reflects the frequency to interchange those terms. Race, racism, and Whiteness\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (questions 6A-6C). I identified 16, 11, and 24 initial codes for the questions about race, racism, and Whiteness, respectively, for a total of 51 initial codes (see Appendix P). Thirty-four total focused codes developed from the initial codes. There were 11 focused codes related to \"race,\" which ranged from a self-defined characteristic (focused codes 6, 7) to its use for funding requests (code 10). Additional responses often minimized the importance of race (\"...becoming less and less meaningful because how do you really identify race?\") or expressed uncertainty about the concept (\"...it's really hard to define even race and ethnicity; I think they kind of overlap, and I'm not clear.\"). One participant drew genetics into the response to defining race by stating, \"We keep hanging our hat on to this concept of race, but it's becoming less and less meaningful, although the genetics is making it kind of more complicated in that regard, because there are certain genetic traits that are concentrated in certain racial groups.\" The participant ends the answer with a statement indicating a belief that \"people are a little bit confused as to what, is it a perception category or is it a biological observational category?\" The resulting axial coding process 163 produced two categories, challenging to define/low priority concept and self-defined skin color/category. Racism included 11 initial codes, which then resulted in eight focused codes. The close number of initial-to-focused code ratio reflects some heterogeneity of participant responses. An interpersonal prejudgment or preconception about an individual or group was common in focused codes 13, 15, and 16. One participant expressed a belief that racism was like any other \"ism\" in \"getting a preconceived notion of what it's gonna be even before you get to that person.\" The focused codes formed three categories related to racism, which are racial prejudgments and discrimination, conflating/rank ordering \"isms\", and ignorance passed down from generation to generation. Although the last category only included one focused code, I chose to include it because the intergenerational aspect of racism is important. The nursing participants' responses to describing \"Whiteness\" produced 24 initial codes. Subsequently, the axial coding process created 15 focused codes. Common descriptors for \"Whiteness\" included \"skin color\" (codes 24, 28, 29, 34), \"privilege\" (focused codes 22, 25), and \"attitude\" (codes 27, 34). As with social workers, nursing participants expressed some unfamiliarity with the term by stating, \"I've never heard that term before\" and \"I never thought about that one.\" Additionally, two participants indicated the emotionally loaded nature of the term Whiteness, when one exclaimed, \"Oh God, that is a loaded question!\" Another participant added, \"...That's such a loaded topic, the whole idea of Whiteness.\" The focused codes led to two categories, privileged skin color/attitude and unfamiliarity with term. 164 Three total themes across all three questions were identified from the seven categories. In a minor shift from social work participants, the nursing participants' responses appeared slightly more homogenous, given the similarity among the identified categories. The three overall themes for the racial concepts included a) self-defined skin privilege; b) racial prejudgments and discrimination; and c) unfamiliarity with concept. Racial concepts, influence on health\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (question 7). Responses from nursing participants produced 51 initial codes related to how race, racism, and Whiteness influence health and wellness outcomes. Subsequently, twenty-two focused codes were identified where the concept of \"distrust\" came up frequently with participants (focused codes 5, 8-11; see Appendix Q). Participant 11 connected distrust to the professionals not representing the racial group they're serving by stating, \"...well racism tends to foster mistrust, because maybe you don't wanna go to a provider that doesn't look like you.\" Respondents also indicated financial aspects are closely tied with racial concepts and influence the health of the community (focused codes 11, 12, 18, 21), with codes 11 and 12 indicating that income may have more to do with health outcomes than race. The 22 focused codes formed the basis for five categories through the axial coding process. Because of the divergent nature of the focused codes, a greater proportion of categories were required to cover the varied responses to the question. The five categories include a) economic instability; b) fostering distrust; c) community context; d) professional/resident interactions; and e) race[d] experiences. As a result, three themes emerged, which included economic instability, distrust and relationships, and race[d] experiences. 165 Table 5.5 provides an overview of the nursing categories and themes from each set of questions. The \"health and community context\" (Questions 2B and 3) focused on three themes: a) impact of social health determinants; b) limited health awareness; and c) distrust and limited relationship building time. Similar to social work professionals, the nursing participants identified systemic/institutional influences on health (social and structural determinants) and more individual level barriers (limited health and health care awareness). Distrust was also identified as a theme and included the challenge of needing additional time to build relationships with residents. Questions 5A-5B regarding health disparities and inequities focused on differential/inequitable health outcomes and opportunities. Two participants described the concept of \"health disparities\" with some form of the term \"inequitable.\" When asked about \"health inequities\" in the next question (5B), both participants used the term \"differences\" in causes and opportunities. The nursing themes for race, racism, and Whiteness focused on the self-identification aspect of racial skin privilege, along with racial prejudgments and discrimination. Nursing included the \"privileged\" aspect of race when discussing Whiteness but not race. The theme \"racial prejudgments and discrimination\" emerged from the discussions relating to racism. Nursing participants also honestly expressed some uncertainty about the racial concepts in question, which can actually serve to open up further dialogue rather than expressing an \"expert\" knowledge about such complex concepts. This is further addressed in the discussion section. Nursing responses to question 7, racial concepts and their influence on health, produced three additional themes: a) economic instability; b) distrust and relationships; 166 and c) race[d] experiences. Three out of five nursing participants identified trust (distrust) as a factor in how racial concepts impact health and wellness. \"Race[d] experiences\" is a Table 5.5 Nursing Categories and Themes Comparison 167 unique theme created to identify racialized experiences of residents in West Baltimore and the interactions between residents and professionals who serve them. The \"d\" is bracketed to indicate race and Whiteness represented more than static concepts but also included active processes which people are \"raced\" or in other words racialized into a racial societal position. One participant mentioned how young Black men have \"normalized\" the process of being arrested and incarcerated as a \"rite of passage.\" This connects the racial identity of a young Black man to a racial socialization (or racializing process, racialization). Not only is race an identity but also a collection of racial experiences that iteratively inform a particular group of people while that same group of people informs and represents what racial mores are acceptable within a given community context. 5.3.3 Medical professionals. Health and community context\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (questions 2B and 3). The five medical professionals' responses resulted in 57 initial codes. From those initial codes, twenty-nine focused codes developed. Social and structural health determinants in the form of food deserts, inadequate housing, transportation, and institutional barriers permeated the focused coding process for questions 2B and 3 (see Appendix R). Limited communication/time with residents (focused codes 18, 21, 23, 28) and access to health information (codes 5, 13, 16) were common for question 3. Participant 2 connected the lack of time and the challenge of understanding the context of residents' lives in response to question 3: \"My biggest challenge personally is just time with patients. Time with patients for their medical concerns, but certainly just time to understand what the context of your life is like. So that's my personally, my 168 professionally biggest challenge is, how do I try to understand you, try to understand...both the things you have access to and the things you don't.\" The 29 focused codes became four categories, which include social and structural health determinants; lack of health awareness; communication and lack of time to build relationships; and limited access to decision makers. Subsequently, four themes were identified: a) social and structural health determinants; b) limited health awareness; and c) communication and relationship building. Health disparities and inequities\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (questions 5A-5B). Nineteen initial codes formed the basis of the medical respondents regarding health disparities and inequities, which led to developing 13 focused codes (see Appendix S). Like social work and nursing, medical professionals' focused codes involved various aspects of \"differences\" between groups such as \"health outcomes\" (focused codes 1, 5), \"language and genetics\" (code 3), and \"social identities\" (codes 5, 7). Participant 5 offers specific reference to measurable health differences between groups by defining health disparity, \"...is when one select population is different from the general population on whatever you wanna measure.\" Health disparity was also connected to the concept of \"diverse\" or diversity according to different social identities. The focused codes for health inequities also included references to \"differences,\" however, additional distinguishing factors for health inequities (vs. health disparities) included \"unfairness\" (focused code 12) and \"prejudicial\" treatment (code 9). One participant identified \"inequalities\" as a definition for both a \"disparity\" and \"inequity.\" The focused codes from questions 5A-5B created six categories through axial coding. The categories for question 5A include differences in health outcomes, not 169 biological related; general differences between groups; and inequalities. For question 5B, the categories are systemic and unfair differences; prejudicial treatment; and limited access and opportunities. Two themes were constructed from the six categories, differential health outcomes and access and inequalities and unfair differences. Race, racism, and Whiteness\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (questions 6A-6C). Questions 6A-6C produced 13, 17, and 21 initial codes, respectively, for a total of 51. From these initial codes, 32 focused codes were identified (see Appendix T). The medical professionals' responses included 8, 10, and 14 focused codes for race, racism, and Whiteness, respectively. Two focused codes for \"race\" emphasized \"skin color\" (focused codes 5, 8) and an overall sense of \"race\" being a \"distinguishing\" or \"self-identified\" physical characteristic. One participant discussed race as a \"social construct\" (focused code 6), while another elected to frame race within a discussion about racism (focused code 2). In other words, the small sample size produced varying perspectives about race, which is exemplified by one participant's response to defining race, \"...people who have different backgrounds in a sense...may have different genetic[s] from where they come from...race is a type of diversity.\" The \"race\" focused codes resulted in three categories from the axial coding process, which are a) self-identified skin color; b) social construct of appearance; and c) \"race is a type of diversity.\" The 10 focused codes related to racism emphasized some form of \"difference\" in treatment/expectations (focused codes 10, 12, 18) or \"pre-judgments\" toward a person's racial identity (codes 9, 11, 14). Focused codes 17 and 18 highlighted power as an important aspect of racism, in addition to \"bias\" based a racial group's appearance (focused code 15). Participant 15 explained power's relationship to racism and even 170 distinguishing between racism and discrimination: \"... [racism] is about a dynamic of power. So it's not necessarily just about discrimination. I think everybody has the ability to discriminate. But I think racism is really about power and creating a hierarchy and different opportunities based upon race.\" The participant went on to clarify power as \"...the ability to make change; power is the ability to make decisions about your own life, to control one's destiny, yeah, it's about privilege, it's many things.\" The focused codes developed into three categories: a) prejudicial interpersonal treatment; b) uncertainty about structural aspects of racism; and c) power and racial hierarchy creation. The five medical professionals' responses produced 14 focused codes, from the 21 initial codes. There was a broad range of focused codes including references to skin color, category, exclusiveness, reference group and norm. Participant 5 (racially identified as White) captured this sentiment, \"...I felt very reference group, I felt very norm... and I think that's how a lot of statistics are reported in this country, with non-Hispanic Whites as your reference group, and everything else is compared to that.\" Skin color and appearance covered four of the focused codes (21, 22, 29, 31), reflecting an emphasis on connecting \"Whiteness\" with identity. Additional focused codes described \"Whiteness\" as a social construct, a privilege, and a racist person. The focused developed into three categories, which were a) skin color and appearance; b) \"norm\" or reference group; and c) individual and societal identifier. The overall thematic results of the aggregated categories from race, racism, and Whiteness included four themes. The first was skin color and prejudice, followed by interrelationship between individual and society; power and privilege; and diversity and norm. 171 Racial concepts, influence on health\u2014Codes, categories, and themes (question 7). The medical professionals' responses produced 28 initial codes, which led to identifying 14 focused codes (see Appendix U). A majority of focused codes used to describe how race, racism, and Whiteness influences health and wellness through inequitable/differential race-based outcomes across social determinants of health (focused codes 80, 82-86, 88). Other codes related to professionals' prejudicial attitudes toward residents' health behaviors came up (focused codes 75, 79, 81). Participant 2 stated, \"...it [race, racial concepts] impacts the assumptions I have about the importance of your health or the behaviors that impact your health\u2014smoking, drugs, sexual practices.\" The 14 focused codes formed the basis for three categories: a) racialized outcomes of social and economic health determinants; b) prejudicial attitudes toward residents regarding health behaviors; and c) equating fears between racial groups. These categories resulted in identifying two themes, racialized outcomes and prejudicial attitudes and fear. The overall categories and themes for medical professionals are in Table 5.6. The health and community context coded responses followed a similar thematic pattern as social work and nursing. The \"social and structural health determinants\" theme encompassed additional health challenges manifest in various systems such as transportation, housing, and food/agriculture. Residents' limited awareness of health resources was another theme, however, this one focused more on the individual level (what residents know about health resources). The third theme, \"communication and relationship building,\" veered from the \"distrust\" theme in both the social work and 172 nursing participants but replicated the latter part of the nursing theme \"distrust and relationship building time.\" Table 5.6 Medicine Categories and Themes Comparison 173 The medical professionals approached questions 5A-5B, health disparities and inequities, with responses that resulted in similar themes as the social work and nursing participants. One theme, \"differential health outcomes and access,\" embodied medical participants' conceptualization of health disparities. The second theme, \"inequalities and unfair differences,\" also included differences but with the added descriptor, \"unfair.\" Medical participants' responses produced three themes to definitional questions pertaining to race, racism, and Whiteness. The \"skin color and prejudice\" theme emerged from three categories developed from each of the three questions (6A-6C). The second theme, \"interrelationship between individual and society,\" captures the iterative nature of how racial concepts influenced by individuals and societal level factors. Referring to race as \"diversity\" and Whiteness as the \"norm\" created the third theme, \"diversity and norm.\" This theme represented more of an individual-focused (interpersonal) conceptualization of racial concepts. The final theme, \"power and privilege,\" repeated the social work theme of \"social/economic power.\" In addition to power, a category undergirding this theme also included reference to the creation of a racial hierarchy as part of a social power dynamic. Question 7 produced themes relating to \"racialized outcomes\" and \"prejudicial attitudes and fear\" to describe how race, racism and Whiteness influence health. 5.3.4 Comparing professions. Health and community context (questions 2B and 3). Table 5.7 provides a category and theme comparison across professions. Each profession's coding process culminated in three themes for this section. A pattern held true across all three professions where \"social and structural health determinants\" emerged as a common 174 theme to describe barriers beyond access to health care and challenges to achieving more equitable health outcomes. Nursing and medical professionals shared another theme, \"limited health awareness,\" while the social work theme was similar (\"limited health Table 5.7 Health and Community Context: Categories and Themes (Questions 2B and 3) 175 services, knowledge, and behaviors\"). The nursing theme, \"distrust and relationship building time,\" appeared as a connector between social work's theme (\"mistrust and stress\") and medical's theme (\"communication and relationship building\"). It is important to note that only one participant mentioned race or racism as a challenge or barrier to health and wellness. Health disparities and inequities (questions 5A-5B). Table 5.8 offer a summary of the categories and themes from questions 5A-5B regarding health disparities and inequities. All three professions used descriptors related to differences, inequalities, and inequities in health outcomes and access. Social work respondents employed \"differences\" in outcomes/access when describing health disparities and \"inequitable\" outcomes to describe inequities. Conversely, the nursing themes for health disparities combined \"differences\" and \"inequitable,\" while \"health differences not based on nonmodifiable risk factors\" represented the theme for health inequities. Medical professionals' theme for health disparities was similar to social work and nursing (\"differential health outcomes and access\"). However, the medical theme for health inequities (\"inequalities and unfair differences\") added additional dimensions to the concept. Parts of all three professions' themes for health inequities replicate the definition by Whitehead's (1992) definition of health inequities (and distinguishing from differences in health outcomes). The two primary definitional characteristics of health inequities were \"unfairness\" (or unjust) and \"avoidability,\" meaning the difference in health outcomes was modifiable, unlike a nonmodifiable factor such as genetics. Race, racism, and Whiteness (questions 6A-6C). Social work and medical coding processes produced four themes each and nursing developed three themes for 176 questions 6A-6C in defining race, racism, and Whiteness (see Table 5.9). Social work themes focused on the individual and structural dimensions of racial concepts. The individual focused themes included \"skin color self-identification\" and \"racial prejudgments and discrimination\", with the former emerging from definitions related to Table 5.8 Health Disparities and Inequities: Categories and Themes (Questions 5A-5B) 177 \"race\" and the latter from defining racism. The more structurally focused themes, \"social/economic power\" and \"dominant White culture,\" offer aspects from questions Table 5.9 Race, Racism, and Whiteness: Categories and Themes (Questions 6A-6C) 178 defining racism and Whiteness. I included the category \"conflation with other concepts\" under the theme \"social/economic power\" because the ability and resources necessary to create professional discourse around any concept or use concepts interchangeably is based in power to do so. \"Power\" was also a part of the \"dominant White culture\" theme by identifying White culture as being in relationship to social power. The nursing coding process produced three themes, which included a) self-defined skin privilege; b) racial prejudgments and discrimination; and c) unfamiliarity with concept. Like the social work theme, self-identifying skin color developed from the nursing coding process. However, by taking a skin-related category from responses to defining Whiteness, the added \"privilege\" descriptor was included in nursing's theme. The second theme, \"racial prejudgments and discrimination,\" was common in social work. The medical profession's theme, \"skin color and prejudice,\" combined two elements of themes present in both social work and nursing. The last theme for nursing, \"unfamiliarity with concept,\" developed from categories representing each of the three related questions about race, racism, and Whiteness. I believe it is important to highlight the importance of this theme, especially when professionals can often feel inhibited to express our lack of understanding about a particular concept or topic for fear of being seen as lacking racial awareness or knowledge. A few participants even indicated they would like to see a dictionary before answering or letting me know they plan to review the meaning of \"race.\" Additionally, several participants across professions expressed uncertainty and unfamiliarity with particular concepts, especially \"race\" and \"Whiteness.\" The openness that uncertainty brings around racial concepts can be transformed into an opportunity for greater understanding by including critical dialogue, 179 a commitment to collectively understand racial concepts, and sustained actions to change the manifested outcomes of those concepts. Similar to social work and nursing themes, medical responses formed the basis for a theme related to skin color (\"skin color and prejudice\"). The prejudice part of the theme came from the responses to define racism whereas the skin color descriptors developed from the questions about race and Whiteness. A unique medical theme, \"interrelationship between individual and society\", captured an important aspect of how social construction of racial concepts are continually shaped and molded by individual actors and structural forces within society. Another medical theme, \"diversity and norm,\" emerged as an in vivo (participant wording) code, where race was described as a \"diversity\" and Whiteness referred to as the \"norm.\" Combining these two into a theme created a marriage between an oft-used conceptualization of race (as diversity) with a less prominent reference to the relative normalization of Whiteness. The \"power and privilege\" medical theme echoes the social work theme of \"social/economic power.\" Racial concepts, influence on health (question 7). Table 5.10 below provides an overview to themes developed from responses the following interview question: In what ways do you think race, racism, and Whiteness (racial concepts) influence health and wellness outcomes in West Baltimore? Participants also responded to a chart (Appendix D) comparing neighborhood indicators from two West Baltimore communities (Upton/Druid Heights) and two northern communities (Roland Park/Popular Hill). The stark differences in numerous social and health indicators may not be entirely attributable to race, racism, and Whiteness. However, some part of the outcomes did involve the racialized nature of both communities and outcomes. 180 The social work and nursing themes identified \"distrust\" as key influence of racial concepts on health outcomes. Because of the distrust, residents will sometimes avoid accessing medical treatment and potentially create more risk for the individual. Nursing and medical themes, \"race[d] experiences\" and \"racialized outcomes,\" spoke to how race is not only a noun but a socialization process that can influence lived experiences and health outcomes. 5.4 Social Welfare and Health Professional Interviews\u2014Connection between Racial Concepts and Actions The following findings, in addition to the findings from the previous two research questions, offer insights to research question 3: What is the relationship between the Table 5.10 Influence of Racial Concepts on Health Outcomes: Categories and Themes (Question 7) 181 discourse and conceptualization of racial concepts and the actions taken by professionals to address inequitable health outcomes? Responses from the five interview participants, representing each profession (social work, nursing, medical), were coded using constructivist grounded theory. I identified initial codes, focused codes, categories (axial coding), and themes. As previously discussed, the analysis focused on thematic identification rather than continue on through theory creation. Each phase of coding corresponds to question from which they originated, through axial coding. Once categories from each interview question are identified, then all categories from the three questions (2A, 4, and 8) are aggregated and then themes are identified. Appendices in the back of this paper provide an overview of each profession's focused codes, categories (axial codes), and themes. The following findings presentation of each profession will include codes from the corresponding profession's appendix, unless otherwise indicated. The interview questions being discussed are as follows: 2A. How does your work contribute to the overall health and wellness of the community? 4. What policies and practices do you and your organization employ to address the problems associated with inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? 8. Which community groups, organizations, or political efforts that advocate for health or racial equity are you involved with (either through your paid position or as a volunteer)? 5.4.1 Social work. From social workers' interview responses to questions 2A, 4, and 8, I created 38, 93, and 77 initial codes, respectively. Subsequently, the 38 initial codes for question 2A evolved into 15 focused codes, which highlighted the importance 182 of providing health-related services (focused codes 10, 13, 15; see Appendix V). Identifying factors within the social context of health was another common response. These included understanding the influence of trauma (focused code 9), limited economic resources (focused code 3), and a general analysis of the broader determinants of health (focused codes 2, 8, 14). The axial coding process developed three categories for interview question 2A: a) engagement and collaboration; b) supporting health-related services and behaviors; and c) understanding social context of health. Responses from interview question 4 resulted in 93 initial codes from social work professionals. The next phase of coding yielded 38 focused codes. Professional and community relationship-related focused codes included \"improving feeling when you (as parents and students) enter the building\" and \"holding events for entire school community and general community to come together.\" Additional focused codes addressed the concepts of \"power\" and \"empowerment\" (focused codes 22, 23, 31, 32), which juxtaposed against another cluster of focused codes identifying a less explicit approach to racial and political concepts (focused codes 18, 20, 40, 43). Ultimately, these focused codes resulted in four categories, which include analyzing em[power]ment; examining and challenging health system; improving institutional climate and community relationships; and cautious approach to racial and political concepts. Social work responses to Question 8 developed into 77 initial codes, which then led to identifying 32 focused codes. Similar to focused codes in question 4, interactions between community residents and professionals emerged in the coding process (focused codes 63, 65, 82). Additional focused codes emphasized the importance of discussing the language related to racial heath disparities (codes 66, 77-79), which is particularly 183 relevant to the current study's focus on racial discourse and language. The focused formed the basis for three categories, which include language of race and health disparities; advocacy and ethical actions; and collaboration and relationship building. The overall thematic identification emerged from 10 aggregated categories as a result of coding the three interview questions. Subsequently, the categories then formed following four themes: a) analyzing em[power]ment and ethical actions; b) racial disparities language and health system; c) collaboration between residents and professionals; and d) cautious approach to racial and political concepts. 5.4.2 Nursing. The coding process for interview questions 2A, 4, and 8 produced 34, 30, and 46 initial codes, respectively. The 34 initial codes for interview question 2A developed into 17 focused codes, which included several references to providing health services (focused codes 5, 6, 8) and health promotion (focused codes 7, 11; see Appendix W). Other focused codes highlighted organizing, advocacy, and accountability. Taken collectively, the 17 focused codes laid the foundation for three categories: a) providing health services; b) promoting health and relationship building; and c) supporting community organizing and accountability. Interview question 4 included 30 initial codes that formed the basis for 20 focused codes. Similar to question 2A, resident relationships and interactions with professionals emerged as frequent responses (focused codes 25, 26, 29). Another area of code convergence revolved around directly discussing racial issues such as \"taking into account how each situation is affected by race in one way or another\" and \"being able to be honest about our racial identity.\" Additionally, one participant identified the People's Institute for Survival and Beyond (n.d.) and their Undoing Racism workshop as a 184 resource to engage in an analysis of racism and organize to \"undo\" it. Because of the relatively clear code groupings, the 20 focused codes became two categories (\"improving provider/recipient interaction\" and \"explicitly discussing race and racial issues\") through the axial coding process. Finally, 46 initial codes resulted from participants' responses to question 8. Subsequently, the next level of coding produced 16 focused codes. Issues of increasing racial diversity without the stigma of \"tokenism\" came up from nursing respondents (focused codes 39-41). Although Question 8 focused on actions taken to advocate for health or racial equity, four out of five participants focused on health equity in their responses or used concepts like \"social justice\" to frame racial aspects of their actions. One participant commented, \"...and people don't like to bring up the topic, that kind of race stuff, [be]cause it's loaded and they don't know how to, they're afraid they're gonna, it's gonna get out of control.\" Two nursing respondents indicated part of their work toward racial or health equity involved mentoring/teaching students in West Baltimore, which reflects the multiple avenues social service/health professionals can influence how racial concepts are conceptualized. From the 16 focused codes, three categories emerged: a) influencing nursing students; b) service work and community engagement; and c) racially diversifying workforce. Based on the nine aggregated categories from the three participant interview questions, a total of three themes were identified, which include health provision and promotion; community engagement and organizing; and race training and racial diversity. Overall, these themes covered commonly emphasized approaches to racial and ethnic 185 health disparities, which are providing health care, engaging community, and increasing race training and diversifying the workplace. 5.4.3 Medical. The initial coding for medical participants answers to interview questions 2A, 4, and 8 produced 9, 30, and 39, respectively. The relatively low number of initial codes (compared to the other professions) developed into a similar number (8) of focused codes (see Appendix X). These codes centered on service provision and improving medical students' skills. Some of the focused codes included \"providing direct services to the community,\" \"treating patients on an individual level in community,\" and \"increase awareness of diversity.\" The axial coding process created two categories, \"individual-focused service provision\" and \"improve medical students' health care skills.\" The 30 initial codes from responses to question 4 created the basis for 14 focused codes. Focused codes included references to providing help and outreach to community as an approach to addressing problems associated with inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes (focused codes 12, 21, 22). Improving awareness of racial biases and inequities related to health was another area of emphasis through focused codes such as \"acknowledging our personal racial biases,\" \"removing preconceived notions about client/patient,\" and \"treating everyone the same.\" At the same time as highlighting the importance of racial awareness, one medical participant stated, \"...hardly ever do we say, 'race,' but we mean it an awful lot when we talk about who's in the room and who's not in the room, who comes to meetings, who doesn't come to the meetings, who has resources and who doesn't have resources.\" The next coding phase, axial, produced three 186 categories: a) community outreach and help; b) recording and reporting health indicators; and c) awareness of racial biases and health inequities. Interview Question 8 included 39 initial codes from medical professionals' responses, which then evolved into 14 focused codes. Similar to focused codes relating to service provision and community outreach in interview Questions 2A and 4, respectively, a group of focused codes revolved around volunteer work and building relationships. Two focused codes included \"participating in church activities\" and \"providing needed services to women of color.\" Another area of concentration highlighted the importance of addressing economic issues related to health care (focused codes 28, 33, 34). The 14 focused codes were then axial coded into three categories: a) service work and interpersonal relationships; b) economics of health care; and c) influencing medical students. The eight aggregated categories from medical professionals' responses formed the basis for three representative themes. These include serving, services and outreach; professional skills and racial awareness; and health management and economics. The next section will provide a broad comparison of themes across professions. Table 5.11 provides an overview of the codes and themes emerging from social work, nursing, and medical professionals related to interview Questions 2A, 4, and 8. All three groups of professionals identified some type of racial awareness or training related to race, in general, and racial health disparities, more specifically. The social work participants identified a related step in addressing racial disparities by highlighting the importance of analyzing \"power,\" especially in the context of \"empowerment.\" Some type of collaboration or outreach to the community by professionals was another common 187 theme among the three professions. In other words, the professionals I interviewed expressed the need for ongoing efforts to build relationships between our professions and the communities we serve. However, doing so cross racially or even between Table 5.11 Professionals' Actions: Categories and Themes (Questions 2A, 4, and 8) 188 professionals and nonprofessionals is a significant challenge, as indicated by several of the interviewees. The GT themes provided a text-level analysis of the policy initiatives and participant interviews, which replaced a more technically linguistic analysis often found in most critical discourse analyses. The next chapter employed CDA to further analyze the texts and GT themes as unique way to further contextualize the racial discourses found in each set of data. 189 Chapter 6: Discussion 6.1 Critical Discourse Analysis 6.1.1 Introduction. The findings from the grounded theory (GT) analysis provided a baseline thematic basis to the policy initiatives and participant transcripts. The following critical discourse analysis (CDA) deepens the analysis as to how racial concepts were conceptualized and how they may or may not influence interventions by social welfare and health professionals, policymakers, and practitioners. Section 6.2 presents CDA findings from the policy initiatives and section 6.3 covers the participant interviews. Prior to elaborating on the CDA findings, the next section provides an overview of relevant terminology frequencies in order to clarify the extent to which racial, and related, concepts are used within the corpus of texts. 6.1.2 Race-related terminology frequencies. Based on the GT analysis earlier in this chapter, the following race-related concepts and terms were included in the frequency count: a) minority/minorities; b) race; c) racism; d) White/Whiteness; e) inequity/inequities; f) disparity/disparities; and g) power/empowerment. The term or concept was only counted if it appeared within the body of the policy or in participants' responses. Fairclough's (2003) theoretical approach to CDA highlights the exclusion/inclusion aspect of discourse analysis where suppression of particular words, concepts, actors, and discourses reveal as much about a social issue as what is actually included. In other words, \"what is 'said' in a text is 'said' against a background of what is 'unsaid', but taken as a given\" (Fairclough, 2003, p. 40). In a complementary manner, Bonilla-Silva (2010) identifies \"minimization\" of racism as a frame of color-blind racism that reduces the visibility of systematic, racialized outcomes. 190 Table 6.1 below indicates the frequencies of racial terms from each policy agenda. The use of \"minority/minorities\" as common terms in the Maryland Plan, HHS Plan, and the CERD Report represents a particular representation of people of color, along with other non-dominant groups. Policies developed in the U.S. generally preferred the use of \"race,\" and even \"White,\" rather than \"racism\" or \"Whiteness,\" respectively. The terms \"race\" and \"White\" frequently referred to racial groups compared across various health indicators and outcomes, replicating the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Statistical Directive 15 (1997), which provides guidelines for racial categories used in the census, federal grants, and scientific research. Initiatives from the U.S. also preferred to use the Table 6.1 Race-Related Terminology Frequencies: Policy Initiatives 191 terms \"disparity/disparities\" rather than \"inequity/inequities,\" which were found more frequently in the international documents. Each U.S. policy at the city, state, and national level omitted the terms \"racism\" and \"Whiteness\" when discussing policies related to eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities. The two international documents, the CERD Report and the WHO Framework, infrequently included the terms \"racism\" and \"Whiteness.\" However, the injustice of inequitable racial health outcomes was recontextualized through such concepts as \"power/empowerment\" and \"inequities\" rather than the use of terms such as \"access to health care\" and \"differences.\" The concept of \"power\" received no attention in four of the five initiatives; the WHO Framework was the only initiative to discuss social theories of power and their relationship to health inequities. The social welfare and health professionals' use of race-related terminology provided some initial insights to their areas of emphasis (see Table 6.2). The terms \"minority/minorities\" were used infrequently across professions whereas \"race\" was discussed more frequently, with social workers using it the most. Medical professionals employed the term \"racism\" most frequently as compared to other professions. \"Whiteness\" was used relatively infrequently but more often than in the policy texts; this was probably due to the interview question that explicitly asked the participants to define the term. The terms \"disparity/disparities\" appeared more frequently than \"inequity/inequities.\" Finally, the terms \"power/empowerment\" were used relatively infrequently, with the social work professionals referring to these concepts most frequently. 192 6.2 Initiatives to Address Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities and Inequities The identified GT themes and language usage supporting those themes from the policy texts and interview transcripts served as the starting point to analyze discourse through a critical lens. Each set of data (interviews and policy texts) shared the first stage of analysis, identifying a social issue through a semiotic relationship, where language, discourse, nonverbal indicators, and other social signs form a meaning-making process. Stage two focused on determining the barriers to addressing the social issue and consists of three steps: a) examining the relationships between discourse and other elements (social practices, events); b) selecting texts and categories for analysis; and c) actual analysis, including the interpretation and explanation of discourse. These are incorporated in the discussion section. After addressing stage one, the subsequent stage will address the policy texts and participants' interviews, in turn. Because CDA minimizes the dichotomy between \"findings\" and \"discussion\" presentation, this section provides a Table 6.2 Race-Related Terminology Frequencies: Participant Responses 193 transition from the more traditional findings in the grounded theory section to the discussion and implications sections that follow the findings section. In the current study, discourse involving racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities forms the basis of the social issue under analysis. Fairclough's (2009, 2012) dialectical-relational approach to CDA emphasizes the discursive aspects of a social issue, including its causes, resistance to addressing it, and social action to transform the inequitable results. The terms in \"racial\" \"health\" \"disparities\" include multiple intersecting meanings depending on field of practice, political affiliation, received media messages, and socialization. Each term in the collective concept of \"racial health disparities\" represents various contested meanings across a number of social contexts. CDA focuses on analyzing discourse at the textual, discursive, and social practice levels in order to include additional context that would lead to a more thorough understanding of the power of language and discourse (Fairclough, 2001, 2012; van Dijk, 2008). The current discourse analysis included an examination of multiple levels of discursive relationships. Each policy text reflected a particular level of social and governmental contexts, which include city, state, national, and international. Within each of those levels, various institutions and individuals assigned meanings related to \"racial,\" \"health,\" and \"disparities,\" in addition to the collective concept. Conversely, the individual terms and collective concepts also serve to potentially reinforce or contradict social welfare and health professionals' socialized meanings attached to the terms and concepts. The intersection of meaning between policy texts and professionals is not always direct or even related. However, CDA provides an examination of where the 194 overlap may (or may not) occur, the context from which it emerges, and how the social actors involved represent those most affected by racial health disparities. The five policy texts included in the critical discourse analysis are as follows: a) Healthy Baltimore 2015 (Healthy Baltimore); b) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities): Maryland Plan to Eliminate Minority Health Disparities 2006-2010 (planning document) and the second is 2010-2014 (implementation document; Maryland Plan); c) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (HHS Plan); d) United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD): Unequal Health Outcomes (CERD Report); and e) World Health Organization: A Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health (WHO Framework). To better understand the frequency of race- and disparities-related terms in the policy texts, I examined the frequency of race- and health-related terms based in their titles and identified purposes. Two of the five documents included \"racial\" in the title of the document or the sponsoring organization's title\u2014the HHS Plan and CERD Report, respectively. The Maryland Plan referenced racial groups by using the term \"minority.\" Only one policy text (the HHS Plan) explicitly included a race-specific term in its title (\"racial\"). Another one referred implicitly to race by including the term \"minority\" (the Maryland Plan). Although \"racial\" or \"race\" did not appear in the Maryland Plan's title, the document explicitly indicated that its focus was on racial and ethnic health disparities. The remaining titles couched racial concepts within health outcomes (Healthy Baltimore), unequal health outcomes (the CERD Report), and social determinants of 195 health (the WHO Framework). It is important to note CERD's acronym is \"Committee to Eradicate Racial Discrimination\" and the WHO's Framework conceptualizes race-based health inequities as a \"structural determinant of health,\" which is discussed further below. The primary purpose of each text focused on plans and actions to address racial and health disparities/inequities. However, there was limited explanation or discussion regarding race-specific concepts such as racial categories, racial terms, or the historical, political, and economic aspects of inequitable racial health outcomes, especially in the U.S. documents. In addition to examining explicit references to racial concepts, I also examined what interventions were emphasized to better understand the conceptualization of racial concepts. The basic logic of how we define a social issue leads us to particular solutions, which indirectly operates as a concept descriptor by assuming the solution corresponds to the defined social issue. The final themes identified in the GT analysis for the policy texts acted as discursive reference points for the CDA. Particularly relevant to the U.S. initiatives (the Healthy Baltimore, Maryland Plan, and HHS Plan) were the shared themes across these documents. All three U.S. policy texts included the following four themes: a) health promotion and access to health care; b) engagement and collaboration; c) data collection and monitoring; and d) policy and legislation actions. The Maryland Plan and the HHS Plan shared two additional themes\u2014diversifying the workforce and cultural/linguistic competency\u2014that speak directly to specific interventions regarding racial and ethnic health disparities. Although there may be an inclination to assume the documents influence each other, the Maryland Plan was written 5-6 years prior to Healthy Baltimore and the HHS Plan. Furthermore, the CDA traced intertextual links between the three 196 current U.S. policy text and the foundational 1985 Malone-Heckler Report, which is discussed more below. Considering these three policy initiatives implicitly or explicitly focused on racial and ethnic health disparities, only one (the Maryland Plan) offered a definition of \"race\" or other race-related terms. The CDA for the three U.S. initiatives to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities, combined with GT thematic identification, revealed two discourses related to contextualizing racial concepts, state-sanctioned racial categorization and individualized differences and interventions. The discourses overlapped so the analysis is presented in a more fluid narrative style rather than demarcated by sections. Racial categorizations of people within the U.S. policy texts represented a focal discourse for assigning racial meaning among city, state, and national governments. Healthy Baltimore and the HHS Plan employed racial categories to identify populations as comparison groups to exemplify but without an explicit explanation of the categories and their connection to the OMB Statistical Directive 15. Policy makers and practitioners are then able to apply a race-neutral and non-structural analysis, which continues the reification of racial concepts based on racial group differences across health outcomes. Furthermore such racial comparative approaches are shown to limit the identification of factors causing health disparities, the possible interventions, and overemphasizes the perceived common characteristics within each racial group (Bediako & Griffith, 2007). Focusing on racial differences as ethically neutral also obscures the \"how\" of their emergence from socially constructed binary positions, where \"White\" represents the \"good,\" \"norm,\" and ultimately the standard by which all other non-White groups are construed as \"different\" (Dyer, 1997; Moore, 2012). 197 An important component of CDA is examining how cues or meanings from earlier texts are found in subsequent written or spoken words whereby each text is an amalgamation of messages based on the writer's or speaker's influences. Intertextuality represents a key theoretical and analytical components of discourse as a discursive practice because of their inherent historical connection to the previous texts, in addition to the connection between micro- and macro-levels of society (Fairclough, 1993). Intertextuality is most commonly found in the form of \"reported speech\" (including writing and thought), where attribution of a previous text's influence may or may not exist (Fairclough, 2003, p. 219). Reported speech usually manifests as \"direct reporting\" (quotations using the same terminology) or as \"indirect reporting\" (summarized version of content, not the actual words). The Maryland Plan offered the most explicit explanation of racial categories and health disparities. In a section titled, \"Who is the target population?\" groups are racially categorized through direct and indirect reporting as indicated in the passage below: In this Plan, minority is defined as members of the following groups: African American, American Indian, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander. This definition of minority groups is based on House Bill 86, from the 2004 Maryland Legislative session. In addition, this Plan recognizes that health disparities beyond racial and ethnic differences alone. Groups that have faced discrimination because of underlying differences in social status can also lead to disparities in health and healthcare....Most statistics are collected based on standard Office of Management and Budget (OMB) categories. OMB makes a distinction between race and ethnicity. The term 'race' is an inexact socio-biological category, but 198 commonly accepted; \"ethnicity\" is used to describe groups with a common cultural or language heritage but can, as in the case of Hispanics and Asians, mask significant differences by country or culture of origin. Where possible, an effort has been made to report figures for Non-Hispanic White and Non-Hispanic African Americans in order to separate race from ethnicity. OMB uses the term 'Black' rather than 'African American,' and distinguishes between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White and Black populations. In this document, however, the term 'African American' is used. (Hussein et al., 2006, pp. 18-19) The direct reporting is found in the reference to the House Bill 86, where the definition of \"minority\" is found verbatim33. Although no quotations marks were included, this is an example of an intertextual chain connecting a racialized category through mutually supportive state-level legislation and health policy. Furthermore, the passage referenced the OMB distinction between \"race\" and \"ethnicity,\" which is from a summarized version from a federal level document with legal requirements for specifying racial categories as part of national granting agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Morning, 2011). Healthy Baltimore used racial categories, \"Black\" and \"White,\" in comparing various health indicators, yet there was no elaboration on the connection between the racial disparities and the possible injustice of those outcomes. There were no definitions of \"disparities,\" \"inequities,\" \"Black,\" \"White,\" or \"race,\" although all were used several times. Healthy Baltimore's \"health policy agenda\" expressed its vision as, \"A city where all residents realize their full health potential.\" The proposed interventions included 33 The 2004 Maryland Legislative House Bill 86 defines minority, \"minority person includes African American, Hispanics, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians statewide\" (p. 3). 199 promoting healthy behaviors/lifestyles and reducing/preventing unhealthy behaviors, indicating an emphasis on individual responsibility for inequitable racial outcomes. For the U.S. policy texts (Healthy Baltimore, Maryland Plan, HHS Plan), health disparities referred to \"differences\" in health outcomes and racial appeared as a method of categorizing populations by race. Healthy Baltimore did not include a conceptualization or definition of race or racism but included references to other policies/initiatives among their guiding documents. This led me to a Google search of the Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) and Healthy Baltimore 2015, which led to an official blog written by the former BCHD Health Commissioner, Oxiris Barbot (2011). Upon reading her blog posts, I found that she explicitly referenced the National Prevention Strategy by the National Prevention Council, which focused on general health promotion strategies and offered a section on the \"Elimination of Health Disparities\" but omitted any discussion of race or racial concepts. The Maryland Plan is a longer and more comprehensive document than Healthy Baltimore because it is divided into two documents focusing separately on the planning (2006-2010) and implementation (2010-2014) stages. In its Executive Summary, the Maryland Plan explains \"minority health disparities...as differences in the incidence, mortality, and burden of diseases...that exist among the historic disenfranchised minority groups in the state\" (p. 11). In addition, the document distinguishes between \"health disparity\" (difference in burden of illness, injury, mortality, etc. between population groups) and \"healthcare disparity\" (differences in insurance, coverage, access to health care services, etc. between population groups). \"Differences\" were discussed more 200 explicitly in the Maryland Plan, as compared to Healthy Baltimore where the differences were implied by the reported differential health outcomes between races. The Maryland Plan defines \"race\" as \"an inexact socio-biological category, but commonly accepted....\", which contains conflicting messages when viewed through the textual level of discourse analysis (p. 18). Describing \"race\" as a \"socio-biological category\" is actually combining two very distinct perspectives regarding \"race.\" The sociological aspect of \"race\" often emphasizes the social constructivist nature of the concept (Saperstein, Penner, & Light, 2013; Vera & Feagin, 2007). Conversely, the biological perspective frames \"race\" as a hereditary-based, immutable human characteristic (Roberts, 2011). By adding the phrase \"commonly acceptable,\" the definition presents the sociological and biological perspectives as equally accepted generally, and specifically in relationship to racial health disparities. The inclusion of biological perspective further individualizes the understanding of race rather than expanding the analysis to include systems and institutions (G\u00f3mez, 2013). Additional questions arose when the initiative attempted to distinguish ethnic and racial concepts by stating \"'ethnicity' is used to describe groups with a common cultural or language heritage but can, as in the case of Hispanics and Asians, mask significant differences by country or culture of origin\" (p. 18). The mention of \"Hispanics\" and \"Asians\" as ethnic groups contradicts the U.S Census Bureau's definition of ethnic and racial groups, where the former is categorized as an \"ethnicity\" and the latter as a \"race.\" The U.S. Census identifies two ethnicities (Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino) and five racial categories: a) Black or African American; b) White; c) Asian; d) American Indian or Alaska Native; and e) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 201 (Humes, Jones, & Ramirez, 2011). These categories are a product of the U.S Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that were codified in1997 through the OMB Statistical Directive 15, which guides all federal agencies in racial classification. The Maryland Plan also included the term \"minority\" to identify African Americans, American Indian, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander. The definition of \"minority\" was accredited to Maryland House Bill 86 and Maryland Senate Bill 177, which is commonly identified as intertextuality or the presence of elements in one text that originated in a previous one (Hussein et al., 2006). This is discussed in more detail below. The HHS Plan focused on eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities, which complements another national plan to address health disparities, the 2011 National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity from the National Partnership for Action (NPA). The HHS Plan envisions \"a nation free of disparities in health and health care\" by strengthening HHS infrastructure, accountability, efficiency, and scientific knowledge and also transform/improve the health and well-being of people and their health care (p. 11). The HHS Plan focused almost exclusively on racial and ethnic health disparities. \"Race\" is presented in the context of other demographic indicators such as ethnicity, sex, primary language, and disability. More specifically, the HHS Plan contextualized \"race\" and \"ethnicity\" using the U.S. OMB Statistical Directive 15 as a state-sanctioned mechanism to categorize and classify racial and ethnic group differences. The HHS Plan defined \"race\" as a category within \"health disparities\" by stating, \"...persistent and well-documented health disparities exist between different racial and ethnic populations and health equity remains elusive. Health disparities\u2014202 differences in health outcomes that are closely linked with social, economic, and environmental disadvantage...\" (p. 1). The \"differences\" among racial groups' outcomes serve as a comparative method of statistically measuring the efficacy of initiatives to eliminate racial health disparities and establish goals within them, especially for the three U.S. policies. However, racial health disparity initiatives often conflate \"disparity reduction with minority health promotion\" and \"impedes the ability to precisely conceptualize, define, and measure target goals\" [emphasis in original] (Bediako & Griffith, 2007, p. 53). The HHS Plan also mentioned the concept of \"health equity\" as an \"elusive\" element. However, basic logic dictates that if \"equity\" is the goal then \"inequity\" (not \"disparity\") is the social issue. Whitehead (1992) clearly distinguishes between \"inequity\" and \"disparity\" where the former relates to injustice, unfairness, and avoidability rather than nonjudgmental differences as reflected in the latter term. Some of the literature on racial health disparities has attempted to define \"disparity\" through the meaning and language of \"inequity\" (Braveman, 2014). The result can further limit the political, economic, and legal understanding of racial concepts by avoiding the \"unjustness\" of differential racial health if discussed as \"inequities\" or \"racism.\" This calls into question whether or not racial health disparities are considered unethical. At the international level, the CERD Report focused on examining the extent of governments' response to health disparities and recommending governmental actions to address health disparities more effectively. The CERD Report was the first policy document of the five analyzed to connect the concept of \"racism\" with \"health disparities\" by identifying various levels of racism and racial discrimination in 203 conjunction with differential health outcomes. At the societal level, racial health inequities were associated with racial segregation and the inequitable distribution of resources and conceptualized as a structural determinant of health outcomes. The CERD Report treated racial health disparities as a human rights violation based on the \"disparate outcomes\" racism produces, rather than relying on the U.S. legal system's \"intentionality\" level of scrutiny for litigations involving racial discrimination charges. On a more individual level, the document discusses \"interpersonal racism\" that manifests in \"daily interactions during which people of color are denied access or degraded based on their race or ethnicity\" (p. 20). Another form of racism related to health disparities the CERD Report identified was \"internalized racism,\" which describes how people of color internalize negative racial messages. Both types of racism put undo emotional and physiological stress on people of color leading to negative race-based health implications whereby racism is directly connected to an individual's health (Carter, 2007). The CERD Report, similar to the U.S. plans, employed the concept of \"racial health disparities.\" However, instead of focusing solely on the U.S. government's role as a mechanism to eliminate racial health disparities, the report identified the government as perpetuating racialized health outcomes through its policies, practices, and limited enforcement of regulations related to discriminatory actions. The discursive shift in emphasis from \"government as social issue solver\" to \"social issue purveyor\" provided an institutional and systemic analysis missing in the U.S. documents. By framing governmental systems and institutions as contributing to racial health disparities, the solutions must account for levels beyond an individual-focused approach. The CERD Report suggested actions such as increased federal investigations and enforcements 204 regarding discriminatory accusations; shifting level of scrutiny in racial discrimination cases from discriminatory \"intention\" to identifying \"disparate outcomes\" across health indicators; and using federal agencies to hold states accountable to federal policies. The WHO Framework is an international document focused on addressing the social determinants of health at the global level by understanding health determinants and mechanisms, along with creating policy to identify \"entry points for interventions and policies\" (p. 3). \"Race\" was considered a social construction and a \"structural determinant [mechanism] of health inequities\" (p. 30). According to the WHO Framework, \"structural mechanisms\" determining health produce \"stratification and social class divisions\" by defining individuals' \"socioeconomic position within hierarchies of power, prestige, and access to resources.\" Furthermore, \"structural mechanisms are rooted in the key institutions and processes of the socioeconomic and political context\" [emphasis added] (p. 5). The WHO's language conceptualizing \"race\" reinforces and extends the CERD's Report regarding macro considerations such as social hierarchies, power, and political and socioeconomic contexts. The WHO Framework emphasized strategies to build \"strong coordination\" across social policies and health policies, where health inequities are not only about access to health care but include an analysis of how social, political, and economic systems create inequitable health outcomes. Three key strategies were identified for policy interventions: a) addressing the social determinants of health through context (social, political, economic); b) intersectoral coordination among agencies; and c) social participation and empowerment. 205 6.3 Social Welfare and Health Professionals' Interviews The grouping of interview questions found in the GT analysis focused on five different areas: a) health and community context (interview questions 2B and 3); b) health disparities and inequities (interview questions 5A and B); c) defining race, racism, and Whiteness (interview questions 6A-6C); d) how racial concepts influence health outcomes (interview question 7); and e) connection between conceptualizing racial concepts and actions taken by professionals (including policy makers and practitioners) to address inequitable health outcomes (interview questions 2A, 4, and 8). Mirroring the approach used in the policy text section, the CDA delved deeper into analyzing the meanings assigned to racial concepts and the actions identified to address racial and ethnic health disparities/inequities. As previously mentioned in racial concept usage (frequencies) section, the social welfare/health professionals were asked directly to define racial concepts instead of reading a previously written policy so they received prompts to discuss race, racism, and Whiteness. However, CDA presented opportunities to indirectly connect the conceptualization of racial concepts to race-neutral interview questions, leading to identifying two discourses of skin color identification/categorization and racial (pre)judgments/discrimination as predominant ways of conceptualizing race, racism, and Whiteness. The following discussion complements the CDA of policy texts and answers research question 2, which focused on how social welfare professionals conceptualized racial concepts. Each set of interview questions (2B and 3; 5A-5B; 6A-6C; 7; and 2A, 4, 8) was analyzed for discursive cues to conceptualize racial concepts. 206 When asked what factors and challenges influence health in West Baltimore, one interviewee directly mentioned \"race\" as a \"factor\" contributing to \"health and wellness\" or \"challenges\" in achieving \"more equitable health outcomes\" (quoted from the interview questions). When asked about the factors and challenges to achieving equitable health outcomes, participant 10 stated: I think a lot of it, and there's been studies that show that race definitely impacts beyond access, and the way that that plays out is because of the way that folks in our community are predominantly African American...there's also a lot of stress that comes with racism on a day-to-day, the micro-aggressions. Racism was presented as a direct challenge to the health status of individuals, who were racially categorized as African Americans. The use of micro-aggressions indicated a more interpersonal example of racism. However, despite the study's focus on racial and ethnic health disparities (as indicated in the outreach e-mail and consent form) and the ongoing racial disparities in West Baltimore communities, twelve out of 15 social welfare/health professionals omitted \"race\" or racism as a challenge to or influence on health. Another respondent made reference to \"race,\" not directly in relationship to health outcomes, but as it related to communicating with community residents. Participant 11 responded: So 98 percent of the [people] there are African American. So I as a White...provider, can they relate to me? Are they [going to] come see me? Research that I'm aware of shows that people are [going to] be more likely to see a provider that looks like them, is from their community, understands their 207 culture. And I think it's a generational thing, it's not a racial thing...some of the language and terms and stuff I didn't know...I had to say, 'Well what do you mean by that?' Cause it was a word I hadn't heard before or a slang or whatever. So that's a barrier to dialect I guess you could say too. The response reflects an understanding of racialized identities by referencing the Whiteness of the respondent and the African American (Blackness) of the community. However, an explicit denial of the communication breakdown was attributed to a \"generational thing\" rather than a \"racial thing.\" The use of word \"their\" when referring to African American communities' culture created an \"us\" (White, dominant race, ingroup) versus \"them\" (people of color, subordinated races, outgroup) \"ideologically biased\" discourse based in polarizing groups (van Dijk, 2001, p. 103). Another barrier to equitable outcomes focused on interpersonal relationships between professionals and community residents. Social welfare/health professionals identified the inability to create trusting relationships as a challenge to attaining equitable health outcomes in sets of questions focused on barriers/challenges to equitable health outcomes and the influences of racial concepts on health outcomes. When participant 7 was asked about the challenges to achieving equitable health outcomes, s/he responded: ...getting trust would be the biggest one...there are people that...are well-meaning [professionals], but they come in and they'll have...projects that they [want to] do and maybe it'll be for a school project. I remember doing one something once with a graduate school and I went to...some kind of community group...that was supposed to be trying to find some kind of experience to do for school. And there was that sense [from community members], \"Well who are 208 you? You're [going to] be another one of those students that comes just to kind of use us for your...\" they didn't say that, but it was the feeling that you got was, \"We've seen this before and we're not really wanting to just serve your purposes and not get anything out of it.\" Similarly, motives of professionals coming into the community came into question when participant 10 stated, University of Maryland...[is] an academic institution, and so folks may be a little leery of, \"Who are you coming in our community to do work? How long are you here? And what are your motives?\" And I kind of look at that as a healthy suspicion...I think it's healthy because of what has happened in the past with people just coming in to do research or poke and prod and have other motives, and not really have the best interest of those who are in the community at heart. Although interpersonal interactions between professional and community are critical to building trust, a historical understanding of racism within the health care system as a structural determinant of health is necessary to build trust beyond individual relationships. Both responses indicated the importance of generally understanding our professions' history and its connection to current relational breakdowns with communities we serve. However, the ramifications of scientific racism in the health care system, such as the U.S Public Health Service syphilis experiment and Willowbrook State School hepatitis experiments on children, are often framed as aberrations rather than a pattern of scientific racism continuing to the current day (see Byrd & Clayton, 2002; Roberts, 2011; Washington, 2006). Interviewees referred to professionals unethical and unjust actions as influential factors inhibiting effective relationships with community 209 members, however \"race\", racism, or racial injustice isn't explicitly identified in connection with identifying distrust as a barrier to achieving equitable health outcomes. Even commonly referring to the racism of intentionally infecting unknowing African American men with syphilis as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, instead of the U.S. Public Health Service syphilis experiment, avoids attributing responsibility to the federal government and the internal practices that allowed this to happen. The result implicitly disassociates the racialized health outcomes from power structures such as the health care system and the federal government. The repeating of such messages illustrates the power of discourse to re-inscribe a decontextualized event as a collectively understood reality. The second set of questions asked participants to define \"health disparities\" and \"health inequities,\" which shifted from the broader questions to the interviewee's specific understanding. Both concepts represented ways of defining differential/inequitable health outcomes based on various social identities, including race. The phrasing of the definitional questions that included \"Can you define...\", initially caused some participants to search for a \"correct\" response. Participant 4 immediately asked, \"Can I pull out my Oxford Dictionary?\" Participants included some form of \"difference,\" \"inequitable,\" or \"inequality\" in health outcomes. Participant 2 defined health disparities as \"a difference in health outcome that cannot be accounted for by biological processes,\" representing an aspect of health \"inequities\" by differentiating health outcomes caused by something other than biological processes. Participant 14 answered by indicating health disparities are an \"inequitable opportunity for health, quality of health and health care access.\" Participant 2 above excludes biological health differences from consideration as a health disparity, which has an intertexual link with Whitehead's (1992) distinction 210 between unavoidable differences (biological) and unnecessary/unfair differences. Participant 14's response inferred that \"disparities\" are the same as \"inequities,\" where in fact the former refers to \"differences\" and the latter refers to \"unjust\" or \"unfair\" circumstances coupled with the extent of control the individual has to avoid diminished health outcomes (Whitehead, 1992). The discourse of individual differences permeated the definitions of \"health inequities\" across professions by focusing on the differential treatment and often omitting a connection to unjustness of those differences. Participant 11 defined health inequities as \"just different opportunities; not everybody has the same opportunity,\" which implies individual equality (sameness) response and not necessarily equitable (fair and just) response. Equality emphasizes the \"sameness\" of resources for individuals or groups of people without accounting for historical oppression and its impact on current conditions. Participant 3 included personal prejudices within the definition of \"health inequities\" by stating, \"...health inequity can come sometimes from people, their own prejudice, I mean the providers, the provider's own prejudice by how they are treating the people based on their race, color, language\". This reinforces such policy-recommended interventions as cultural competency and diversifying the workforce, which also focuses on the individual level of disparate/inequitable health outcomes and minimizing political and systemic influences. The third set of questions focused exclusively on defining racial concepts; race, racism, and Whiteness. All three groups of social welfare professionals included discourses regarding skin color identity and racial prejudgments/discrimination to explain 211 race, racism, and Whiteness. The following excerpt from participant 5 defining race represented a similar conceptualization found across social welfare/health professionals: How do I define race? Okay. Hmm, well, it's really self-identified. I think you look, you know, primarily visually at someone's skin and you make sort of a snap judgment about that. But I think of it as your heritage, where you come from; yeah. The reference to self-identification individualized the conceptualization of race by inferring the power each individual has to name their racial identity, as people do on the Census. The understanding of race is reduced to a demographic characteristic void of hierarchical relationships among racial groups. The interviewee highlights the semiotic nature of translating preconceived thoughts into words as a meaning-making process mediating connection between the \"primarily visual\" and a \"snap judgment\". Participant 5 also pointed out the often invisible and normative nature of \"Whiteness\" by stating: How would I define Whiteness? Wow. I think of it as the reference group in this country, as the norm...I didn't feel that I had a very strong identity cause there wasn't anything really unique and defining about me, cause I'm a White, middle class, college educated female. I felt very reference group, I felt very norm. I didn't feel like I had a disability or I was a minority; I just felt like the norm. I also went to school in New England, so it was pretty White; so I was pretty the norm. And the professor did not like my paper, but it was truly how I felt. I do feel like the reference group. And I think that's how a lot of statistics are reported 212 in this country, with the non-Hispanic White as your reference group, and everything else is compared to that. The combination of an ahistorical, apolitical, and individual-focused discourses regarding race not only further marginalizes people in subordinated positions on the racial hierarchy but also reiterates the dominant position of White people in that hierarchy. White identity and the legal concept of Whiteness are distinct yet complementary and vital elements of any inequitable outcomes involving race. L\u00f3pez (2006) asserts that \"an unexamined acceptance of White identity requires the uncritical, perhaps unconscious protection of that identity...,\" while concurrently \"the maintenance of Whiteness necessitates the conceptual existence of Blacks, Latinos, Native Americans and other races as tropes of inferiority against which Whiteness can be measured and valued\" (L\u00f3pez, 2006, pp. 131-132). In another example, participant 13's response to defining \"race\" reflected the mediating effect of discourse between state-sanctioned racial categorization (policy texts) and the professional's role to reinforce those racial categories as a step toward gaining a form of power through accessing grant monies: RESPONDENT: Yeah. That's really interesting because I don't even, it's not even something that I think about. The only time I have to think about it is that we have federal funding and we have to keep track of it. I've never been in a study where we took people out because of certain races, which is sometimes very ethical to do in some studies. But to me it's just...another person. And the only time I check it off is on the demographic sheets so we keep getting our money. So I don't really look at it as being different. 213 INTERVIEWER: Right. So you see it as almost categories, cause that's what it is on the sheet, right? RESPONDENT: That's exactly what it is; yeah...I have to have it for my funding. First of all, \"race\" isn't a major consideration for the interviewee, which other professionals expressed by identifying more prominent factors (other than race) such as poverty, culture, or genetics when answering other interview questions. Furthermore, \"race\" is describe here as a categorization and requirement to ascertain federal funding, which \"occurs within a society that already perceives race/ethnicity as the most salient axis of human difference...\" whereby allocating grant resources and designing scientific studies \"stem from political decisions based on those differences that have currency in broader areas of public policy decision-making\" (Craddock Lee, 2009, p. 56). Even as major granting agencies encourage people of color to apply for grants, studies show that Black applicants are 10% less likely than Whites to secure research funding (Ginther et al., 2011). The last set of interview questions (2A, 4, 8) focused on answering research question 3, What is the relationship between the discourse conceptualizing racial concepts and the actions taken by professionals to address disparate or inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? The three common discourses across social work, nursing, and medicine were as follows: a) collaboration, engagement, and outreach; b) health provision and promotion; and c) race training, awareness, and diversity. Interview question 8, What policies and practices do you and your organization employ to address the problems associated with inequitable racial and ethnic health 214 outcomes, directly connected actions with racial health inequities. Participant 9 highlighted racial awareness and cultural competency as important actions to address racial and ethnic health inequities, which aligns with interventions indicated in the U.S. policies. INTERVIEWER: What policies and practices do you personally, and your organization, employ to address problems associated with inequitable racial and ethnic health outcomes? RESPONDENT: I think that we try to be mindful of it, just to be aware of it, to educate ourselves and our residents. We live in a society where, my opinion is that regardless of what people say, it is not a race bias free society. Not at all. And we all bring our biases to what we do, and it's important to just (1) be aware of it and try to get people to acknowledge and see how it affects their day-to-day interactions. And then there's this whole movement of course towards cultural competency. Participant 9 acknowledges \"racial bias\" and that \"awareness\" of them will decrease the \"affects\" on \"day-to-day.\" This is necessary for an initial exploration of how race and racism is connected to differential health outcomes. However, an implicit assumption remains that if individuals can just understand their biases and improve interpersonal interactions, institutions and systems will adjust accordingly. Participant 6 offered the action of \"speaking up\" about racism, both as sharing voices and literally speaking up the professional hierarchy to challenge manifestations of racism, as an important way to collaborate with community residents. I included an extended version to connect the challenges of even saying a word (institutional racism), 215 which indicates even further difficulty with conceptualizing and effectively redressing it. The dialogue picks up where the participant explained the need to speak up as a professional to instances of racism and not expect or wait on communities to speak up. The interaction between participant 6 and I continued: RESPONDENT ...Even though I may never use the word racism or institutional racism or any of that with the person I'm speaking to, but understanding that that's a dynamic that's happening. INTERVIEWER: Why wouldn't you use the term, institutional racism? You just mentioned that you wouldn't. RESPONDENT: I certainly do use it at times. I think it's important to say it at times. I think it depends on what I'm trying to get done at the moment. Because I've also seen people when I use that term or someone else [is] in the room uses that term, it's almost like eyes glaze over, like, \"Oh here's another talk on racism.\" Cause I think there's a lot of people that just truly believe that racism is not a big issue in our country. And I've even experienced that amongst professionals. I mean I remember being at my eye doctor a year ago and he was trying to convince me how hard it's gonna be for his White male son in this world because of reverse racism and everything. And I'm just like, \"Do you see the outcomes?\" Look at any domain in a person's life and compare outcomes for a White [person] verses anyone else...and I kind of mentioned it earlier that I'd struggled with balancing empowerment and talking about, and I think I've struggled with that with institutional racism as well, and I don't know that I've completely resolved that. First I used to...take more of a listening approach and 216 try to put some facts out there, but not really call it what it was and wait for maybe a Black person to speak up and say, \"This is what's happening.\" But I actually had a friend and colleague really push back against that and say, \"People are actually more likely to listen to you than to me,\" this was a Black woman telling me that, \"and so actually I need you to speak up. Because even though it's not right and it's not fair that they would listen to you verses me, that's the reality that we're in.\" And hearing that from her has really challenged me to think about that and to speak up more frequently when that's what's going on, and to call it what it is verses trying to beat around the bush. The participant described the \"glazing of the eyes\" in colleagues when \"racism\" is discussed, which speaks directly to the nonverbal range of emotions I witnessed in interview participants when asking about race, racism, and Whiteness. Nervousness, surprise, discomfort, and oftentimes a distinct sense of not knowing how to respond are a few examples of responses. Additionally, the interviewee's colleague clearly illuminates what most people of color know in White institutional spaces; the field isn't level based on expectations, promotions, and racial power dynamics present. Although speaking up is obviously a critical aspect of addressing racial injustices, the interpersonal nature of the intervention must connect with more collective and political actions to change institutions and systems. As is evident across the three research questions' discourse, individual social welfare/health professionals and policies influence the type of interventions that are available or even fundable. The 1985 Malone-Heckler Report categorized recommended actions to address the first ever state-sanctioned acknowledgment of racial and ethnic 217 health disparities, which included: a) health information and education; b) cooperative efforts with non-federal sector; c) data development; d) delivering and financing health services; e) health professionals' development; and f) research agenda. Table 6.3 compares recommended action categories with the common GT themes identified in three U.S. health disparities initiatives. The discursive similarities are unmistakable. The more recent U.S. initiatives made limited or no reference to the Malone-Heckler report yet presented very similar strategies to approach racial and ethnic health disparities. This offered an important view of how the documents, across almost 30 years, shared emphases. Although the Maryland Plan was the only one to explicitly mention the Malone-Heckler Report, the shared language and meaning among all the U.S. texts is apparent. Additionally, the U.S. plans and the Malone-Heckler Report minimized the importance of understanding an institutional and systemic analysis of racial concepts in health disparities policy, which also corresponded to the overall analysis of social Table 6.3 Historical Comparison of Health Disparities Initiatives 218 welfare/health professionals. The discursive meanings associated with both the policy initiatives and participant interviews continually intersect by constituting, and being constituted by, the meanings produced from both sets of texts. The comparison emphasizes the persistent focus on individualized nature of policies related to racial and ethnic health inequities and the minimization of systems' culpability 2013). For example, Bloche (2004) described Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) policymakers involved with the rewrite of the annual National Healthcare Disparities Report as attempting to minimize the extent of racial and ethnic health inequities by conceptualizing the elimination of inequitable health outcomes as the personal duty of each individual. Their objections to the original version of the report related to the extent of responsibility placed on institutional and systemic factors, rather than solely on the individual within the health care system (Bloche, 2004). Arthur J. Lawrence, principal deputy assistant secretary for health and a person who encouraged the rewrite, spoke candidly in an internal DHHS memo by stating the section about provider responsibility [for racial and ethnic health inequities] should be removed and that focusing \"so strongly on the system, its practitioners, and flaws suggests that the onus is only on that side of the equation\" (as quoted in Bloche, 2004, p. 1568, emphasis added). 219 Chapter 7: Implications and Conclusion 7.1 Limitations The primary limitation of using qualitative methodologies is the lack of generalizability due to the limited points of data collection. Because the study involved a total of 15 interviews, across three professions (5 each), there are challenges involved in applying the research results to specific professions or to health care professions in general. Although I attempted to improve generalizability of the findings by aggregating responses across the professions within the CDA, the limitation remains because of the small cohort size. Although the findings may lack generalizability, the study added to current racial and ethnic health disparities literature. By examining the discourse at intersecting levels of policies (city, state, national, international) and professions (social work, nursing, medicine), the study focused on often ignored elements of racialized health inequities\u2014language, meaning, and knowledge production. The replication of unexamined conceptual meanings, and their influence on possible interventions, often results in the perpetuation of inequitable processes that repeat the inequitable outcomes we are attempting to ameliorate. Another limitation was not having additional co-researchers to conduct concurrent analyses to improve the reliability and accuracy of the findings. The presence of an additional researcher or two conducting the coding would have provided opportunities to compare findings across researchers' processes, further strengthening and validating how we assign meaning to the data collected. By analyzing the data as a lone researcher, the ability to further strengthen the findings was limited. Additionally, my race, gender, or involvement with racial health equity work on the UMB campus and in the community 220 may have influenced how participants' answered the interview questions. The addition of another researcher with different social identities than mine could potentially have minimized that influence. 7.2 Implications The current study focused on how policy initiatives and social welfare/health professionals discursively conceptualized racial concepts in relationship to racial and ethnic health disparities. The city, state, and national policy initiatives to eliminate racial health disparities focused on two complementary discourses, state-sanctioned racial categorizations and racial differences, as the basis for individual-focused interventions. Similarly, the professionals' discourses included skin color identification/categorization and racial [pre]judgments/discrimination. Finally, the common discourses professionals' used to describe actions taken to address racial and ethic health disparities were: a) collaboration, engagement, and outreach; b) health provision and promotion; and c) race training, awareness, and diversity. Each set of discourses offers insights as to how racial concepts are assigned meaning and form the basis for interventions. We interpret the world through socialized messages we receive from our family, colleagues, friends, the media, and our occupations. Some of these messages serve to support justice goals, some do not; some reside in an individual's consciousness, some in the unconsciousness. This means that there are numerous messages that either do not support a socially just society or that we may be unaware how they influence our thoughts. Inherently, these individualized influences and meanings are also connected to more macro level factors related to knowledge production such as institutions, systems, 221 and structures. Discourse and language mediate how we receive and express the knowledge contained in the messages flowing among the various levels of society. However, prior to conveying a message, a person must make a decision as to how, what, why, and when the information is shared depending on situational circumstances. Choices then become an important aspect of which messages we rely on when assigning meaning to a particular concept, situation, or social interaction. Are we framing racial health inequities as a form of racism or cultural \"incompetency\" and differences? Do we see \"Whiteness\" as a racial identity or a foundational concept in our country's racial hierarchy of outcomes that affect the cultural, political, economic, legal, and social realms within society? Are we willing to interrogate racialized health outcomes as inequitable and steeped in social power dynamics? Or, will an emphasis on reifying racial identities and improving interpersonal interactions take the place of transformative changes in power distribution that would increase the likelihood of equitable outcomes? The answers to these questions will emerge from the interactions among individuals, institutions, systems, policies, and laws. Individual professionals often interpret policies and guidelines to practice within their roles as social workers, nurses, and physicians. In particular, the elimination of racial and ethnic health inequities provides social workers with opportunities to apply their ethical commitment to social justice and collectively organize for social change. Receiving health care that leads to equitable health outcomes is an ongoing challenge for the oppressed communities we serve. As social workers, we often act as advocates within institutions and systems that may not provide equitable treatment to historically marginalized groups. However, the ways in which the social welfare/health professionals conceptualize and discuss the 222 causes of health disparities will either facilitate or hinder the levels at which advocacy efforts will be directed and the degree of change that could be achieved. The need to respond to the presence of racial and ethnic inequity in any social indicator unquestioningly fits into the following National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Ethical Standard, 6.04(d): \"Social workers should act to prevent and eliminate domination of, exploitation of, and discrimination against any person, group, or class on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, political belief, religion, immigration status, or mental or physical disability\" [emphasis added] (NASW, 2008). However, there are still conflicting discourses within social work, nursing, and medical about racial concepts. Consequently, the social work profession struggles with how to analyze racial concepts and how to intervene to address inequitable racialized outcomes. Professional guidelines such as the NASW Code of Ethics and the CSWE's Education Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) omit the words \"racism,\" \"Whiteness,\" or \"power\" in their descriptions of racial \"domination,\" \"exploitation,\" and \"discrimination.\" By veiling these race-relevant concepts, the people we serve and even the students we educate can question our actual commitment to connecting our bold ethical values with actual institutional and systemic change. A critical approach to the discourse employed to define and operationalize racial concepts in research requires a multi-level analysis, which includes the individual, community, institutional, and systemic manifestations of race, racism, and Whiteness. Dominant approaches to social work research, however, present race as a static, immutable concept; they often omit the historical and political context from which race 223 continues to evolve. For example, the use of studies emphasizing \"gold-standard\" research methodologies, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), often emphasize an objective, apolitical analysis of racial issues and the subsequent framing of related solutions. Since the state-sanctioned identification of disparate racial health outcomes in 1985, the language of the biomedical paradigm and evidence-based medicine (EBM) has driven \"data\" gathering in regard to racial and ethnic health disparities through the use of quantitative, epidemiological methods. The EBM movement, and its subsequent application as evidence-based practice (EBP) in fields like social work, began in the early 1990's with a focus on using the best scientific evidence to treat individual diseases and ailments (Adams, Matto, & LeCroy, 2009; Staller, 2006). While EBM strengthened various aspects of research methodology like internal validity and improved guidelines for intervention assessments, critics of EBM's use in health disparities research point to its methodological shortcomings. Braveman, Egerter, Woolf, and Marks (2011) emphasize the ethical issues involved in using a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to generalizing health interventions across varying populations and in using EBM to assess community-level health promotion interventions to eliminate racial and ethnic health inequities. These methodological challenges are further magnified when applying EBM to research on social policy, which prompted Braveman et al. (2011) to emphasize \"the need for evidence from a broader array of approaches\" and to support the use of more critical methodologies (p. S60). Critical discourse analysis provides a methodology to broaden the conceptualization of race, racism, and Whiteness in health inequities research. This research provides a critical examination of common discourses used in health disparity interventions. By doing so, policy makers and practitioners may 224 be better equipped to frame a social issue beyond the individual level to include the institutional and systemic levels, an approach that can support more comprehensive interventions. Furthermore, critical discourse analysis brings into focus such concepts as \"power,\" \"political context,\" and \"systemic barriers,\" thus broadening our analysis and imagination for transformative changes. Social work practice relies heavily on the ability to develop effective and authentic relationships with people experiencing such challenging life issues as homelessness, domestic violence, police brutality, and physical, mental, and sexual abuse. The language and discourse we assign to racial concepts while discussing the ecological context of the people we serve can act as a barrier or a bridge to the formation of constructive relationships. For example, a social worker who offers a culturally competent approach to interpersonal relations within a marginalized community of color may establish an effective working relationship with individuals from that community. However, community residents who understand the deeper racial influences of political, economic, and historical contexts that contribute to institutional and systemic racism based on a pattern of oppressive policies are likely to express distrust toward professionals. By proactively examining and adopting a structural racism analysis based on understanding the social, political, and power dynamics, social workers can development more transformative relationships and actions that address the root causes of people's problems, in addition to the interpersonal ones. Policy creation and its connection to political context are vital components of the conceptualization of racialized health outcomes. As the findings highlighted, the U.S. policy texts focused on apolitical, race-neutral interventions to address health differences 225 between races. A critical approach to the analysis of racial health inequities discourse frames systems (e.g., governmental, health care, social welfare, legal) as possible barriers to equitable health outcomes, rather than benevolent entities whose every action is assumed to support a solution. As professionals with access and some influence within these systems, we can more intentionally support efforts that emphasize necessary systemic changes and connect them to our professional interactions with community residents. The WHO Framework and the CERD Report offered contrasting approaches to addressing racial and ethnic health inequities. These include establishing the \"unjust\" nature of racialized health outcomes and analyzing the influences of political context. Additionally, the international agendas also include essential discussions regarding theories of power and the need for improved government accountability to those most marginalized by racial and ethnic health inequities. Discourse encompasses every aspect of a profession's existence. We are constantly called upon to deal with complex, multi-level issues and make sense of particular approaches to addressing the problem. As the current study bore out, the meaning assigned to racial concepts spanned across professions, policies, and regions. Although the creation of more diverse workplaces is often a proposed antidote for inequitable racialized outcomes, the diversity of racial conceptualizations also creates barriers to the identification of comprehensive and effective solutions. The social work profession has ethical obligations to eliminate social injustices, which includes racial and ethnic health inequities. However, the profession must strive for a clearer analysis of how race, racism, and Whiteness are conceptualized within social work education, research, practice, and policy. The analysis requires a commitment to the 226 institutional and systemic levels of racial concepts. Otherwise we replicate individualized, inadequate approaches to developing comprehensive interventions for racial and ethnic health inequities. 227 Appendix A Excerpts from Initiatives to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Health Inequities From Healthy Baltimore 2015\u2014Baltimore City Health Department (as described in the National Prevention Strategy) \"America benefits when everyone has the opportunity to live a long, healthy, and productive life, yet health disparities persist. A health disparity is a difference in health outcomes across subgroups of the population. Health disparities are often linked to social, economic, or environmental disadvantages (e.g., less access to good jobs, unsafe neighborhoods, lack of affordable transportation options). Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health on the basis of their racial or ethnic group, religion, socioeconomic status, gender, age, mental health, cognitive, sensory, or physical disability, sexual orientation or gender identity, geographic location, or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion. Many health concerns, such as heart disease, asthma, obesity, diabetes, HIV/ AIDS, viral hepatitis B and C, infant mortality, and violence, disproportionately affect certain populations. Reducing disparities in health will give everyone a chance to live a healthy life and improve the quality of life for all Americans.\" From Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2011)\u2014Department of Health and Human Services 228 \"Medical advances and new technologies have provided people in America with the potential for longer, healthier lives more than ever before. However, persistent and well-documented health disparities exist between different racial and ethnic populations and health equity remains elusive.

Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) \"Many people of color live in neighborhoods that are largely segregated from white Americans, and the communities in which they reside differ significantly on a number of important social, economic, and environmental conditions in ways that can negatively influence health. People of color are also exposed to additional health risks in the form of racism and discrimination, which present stressors that are exacerbated by residential segregation.\" (p. 18) \"Race-related stress operates to wear down health in several ways.

Thus, in the United States, life expectancy for African-Americans is significantly lower than for whites, while an African-American woman is twice as likely as a white woman to give birth to an underweight baby. Indigenous groups endure racial discrimination in many countries and often have health indicators inferior to those of non-indigenous populations.\" (p. 34) \"By definition, then, action on the social determinants of health [like structural racism] is a political process that engages both the agency of disadvantaged communities and the responsibility of the state.

Excerpts Conceptualizing Inequitable Health Outcomes Please read the follow excerpts from various initiatives to eliminate racial/ethnic health inequities. As you are reading, please consider the following questions: Which of these descriptions of racial/ethnic health disparities most closely matches your understanding of the concept? Which description best describes the connection between race/racism and inequitable health outcomes? 1. America benefits when everyone has the opportunity to live a long, healthy, and productive life, yet health disparities persist. A health disparity is a difference in health outcomes across subgroups of the population. Health disparities are often linked to social, economic, or environmental disadvantages (e.g., less access to good jobs, unsafe neighborhoods, lack of affordable transportation options). Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health on the basis of their racial or ethnic group, religion, socioeconomic status, gender, age, 235 mental health, cognitive, sensory, or physical disability, sexual orientation or gender identity, geographic location, or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion. Many health concerns, such as heart disease, asthma, obesity, diabetes, HIV/ AIDS, viral hepatitis B and C, infant mortality, and violence, disproportionately affect certain populations. Reducing disparities in health will give everyone a chance to live a healthy life and improve the quality of life for all Americans. 2. In order to assess the disparities in health..., it is necessary to look at health outcomes, care and treatment, and the supporting system; therefore, for this report disparity is defined in the context of burden and care [quality]...In terms of health outcomes and treatment, it is important to make a distinction between a health disparity and healthcare disparity.... A health disparity can be defined as a difference in the burden of illness, injury, disability, or mortality between one population group and another [health outcomes and illness burden]. A healthcare disparity can be defined as differences in insurance coverage, access to or quality of healthcare services. The causes of these disparities are myriad and complex, and may emerge from any number and combination of patient, healthcare system, and societal factor. 3. Medical advances and new technologies have provided people in America with the potential for longer, healthier lives more than ever before. However, persistent and well-documented health disparities exist between different racial and ethnic populations and health equity remains elusive. Health disparities\u2014differences in health outcomes that are closely linked with social, economic, and environmental disadvantage\u2014are often driven by the social conditions in which individuals live.... Racial and ethnic minorities often receive poorer quality of care and face more barriers to seeking care than non-236 Hispanic Whites. Providing incentives for quality care in these populations is critical for improving patient outcomes and creating high-value healthcare system that promotes equity. 4. In societies marked by racial discrimination and exclusion, people's belonging to a marginalized racial/ethnic group affects every aspect of their status, opportunities and trajectory throughout the life-course.

I am currently in the process of recruiting participants for a study focusing on how racial concepts are conceptualized within professional and policy discourse. If you're currently connected with one of the following schools: Medicine, Social Work, Nursing, or Public Health and have worked in West Baltimore for at least the past six months, please consider participating. The purpose of the interview is to learn how you understand racial concepts and their relationship to inequitable racial/ethnic health outcomes. This information will enhance our understanding of the reciprocal relationship between the conceptualization of race and racism and the development of policies designed to eliminate racial/ethnic health inequities. In other words, my research seeks to understand how the conceptualization of race and racism influences policy and how the design of policies to eliminate racial/ethnic health inequities, in turn, influences the conceptualization of race and racism. If you are interested in participating, the time commitment for the in-person, recorded interview would be approximately 1.5 hours. It would take place at a convenient, private location. There is the possibility of a brief follow-up contact regarding any clarification 238 needed to ensure that the transcription of the interview is accurate. This contact can take place by phone and will last no longer than 30 minutes. Each participant will receive a $5 gift certificate from Starbucks as a token of appreciation for sharing your insights. I look forward to hearing from you if you would like to participate. Please contact me by phone (207-907-9782) or by e-mail, tvanidestine@ssw.umaryland.edu, for further information and to discuss your interest in participating. Thank you very much for considering this invitation.

The information used in this table comes from http://baltimorehealth.org/neighborhoodmap.html. Upton/Druid Heights and Roland Park/Poplar Hill are less than four miles apart, and Upton/Druid Heights is less than two miles away from the University of Maryland, Baltimore campus. aAvertable deaths are deaths that could have been avoided if all neighborhoods in Baltimore had the same opportunities at health. Data presented here are based on the assumption that the death rates experienced in the five communities with the highest median incomes are achievable in every community. The avertable deaths thus represents an estimate of the percentage of area deaths that would have been avoided if they had experienced the same mortality rates as the highest income communities for years 2005-2009. A negative percentage means that the area experienced a lower mortality rate than the top five neighborhoods. bYears of potential life loss (YPLL) are the number of years of life lost due to death before age 75. For example, a person dying at age 74 accrues 1 YPLL, whereas a person dying at age 30 accrues 45 YPLL. YPLL provide a measure of the impact of premature mortality on a population. Deaths that occur earlier in life contribute more years of life lost than deaths later in life, capturing the value society places on young lives. At the neighborhood level, the YPLL was based on the sum of years of life lost for all the residents of that neighborhood who died in 2005-2009. 240 Appendix E Healthy Baltimore: Codes, Categories, and Themes Focused codes Category (bold) and supporting focused codes Themes 1.
