Jiaogulan is a plant that grows wild in China. The leaf is used to make medicine. Jiaogulan is sometimes referred to as \"Southern Ginseng\" because it grows in south central China and is used in similar ways as ginseng. Jiaogulan is used for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and improving heart function. It is also used for strengthening the immune system, increasing stamina and endurance, increasing resistance to environmental stress (as an \"adaptogen\"), improving memory, and preventing hair loss. Other uses include treatment of poor appetite, cough, chronic bronchitis, ongoing stomach pain (chronic gastritis), pain and swelling (inflammation), ulcers, constipation, stress, gallstones, obesity, cancer, diabetes, trouble sleeping (insomnia), backache, and pain. Some people use jiaogulan as an anti-aging antioxidant, and detoxifying agent. How does it work? Jiaogulan contains substances that might help reduce cholesterol levels. [](https://www.rxlist.com/lowering_cholesterol_slideshow_15_tips/article.htm) SLIDESHOWSee Slideshow Possibly Effective for... - Reducing cholesterol levels. There is some evidence that taking jiaogulan can decrease total cholesterol and increase the \"good\" high-density lipoprotein (HDL)/total cholesterol ratio in people with high cholesterol levels. Insufficient Evidence to Rate Effectiveness for... - Liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). Early research suggests that taking jiaogulan three times daily by mouth for 4 months does not improve markers of liver function, body mass index, cholesterol levels, kidney function, or blood sugar in people with a type of liver disease called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. - Regulating blood pressure. - Bronchitis. - Stomach disorders. - Ulcers. - Constipation. - Gallstones. - Obesity. - Cancer. - Diabetes. - Trouble sleeping (insomnia). - Backache. - Pain. - Improving memory. - Improving heart function. - Other conditions. Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate [(detailed description of each of the ratings).](#) [](https://www.rxlist.com/quiz_high_cholesterol_hyperlipidemia/quiz.htm) QUESTIONSee Answer Not enough is known about the safety of jiaogulan during breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. \"Auto-immune diseases\" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Jiaogulan might cause the immune system to become more active. This could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have an auto-immune condition, it's best to avoid using jiaogulan until more is known. Bleeding disorders: Jiaogulan may slow blood clotting. There is a concern that it might make bleeding disorders worse. Surgery: Jiaogulan might slow blood clotting. There is some concern that it might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using jiaogulan at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. Medications that decrease the immune system (Immunosuppressants)Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider. Jiaogulan increases the activity of the immune system. By increasing the immune system jiaogulan might decrease the effectiveness of medications that decrease the activity of the immune system. Some medications that decrease the immune system include clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider. Jiaogulan might slow blood clotting. Taking jiaogulan along with medications that also slow clotting might increase the chances of bruising and bleeding. Some medications that slow blood clotting Report Problems to the Food and Drug Administration You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.
