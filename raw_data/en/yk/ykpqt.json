MMR shot conundrum I don't want to start any kind of argument about vaccines or politics. I am just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue within your family. I am a FTM in the U.S. Also, I love my husband even though we have our differences of opinion, perspectives, and mindsets, so please don't share any judgments about him. My hope is to get advice or hear stories from other mommas! My husband is not anti-vaccine -- our almost 9mo has gotten all of his required shots so far. However, after randomly watching the documentary \"Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe\", my husband now believes that our son needs to wait until age 2 before getting his first MMR shot instead of getting the shot at 1yo. I actually work as a librarian for a pharmaceutical consulting firm, so I felt very confident that I could easily compile and present the published literature to show my husband that the evidence does not point to the MMR vaccine as causing autism or any other illnesses for the vast majority of 1yo male recipients beyond the possible common reactions/side effects. Unfortunately, I was met with a response about conspiracy theories and the pharmaceutical industry. Since my husband doesn't trust that the scientific evidence is legitimate, I don't know what I can possibly bring to the conversation. I also feel like he tries to guilt me into agreeing with him by saying things like -- \" How can you be ok with risking something happening to him?\" I have pointed out that we risk something happening every time we take him somewhere in the car, but that's not really the point. My husband also consistently brings up his disagreement with parents in the U.S. not having a choice when it comes to vaccinating your child (at least if you're going to use a licensed childcare center or public schools and you don't have a real religious exemption), but my explanation about public health is not convincing enough. Getting the vaccine at age 1 matters to me because 1) I want my son to be protected against the measles in particular; 2) I want the option for him to go to daycare (we currently have a nanny); 3) I've read that pushing back against required vaccines can lead to pediatricians essentially dropping you, which means finding a pediatrician who will keep you despite not being up to date on shots or using urgent care as your child's healthcare provider. Again, the problem exists only until our son is 2 -- I haven't yet watched the documentary to know why that makes sense. There is no compromise or middle ground that I can see -- either he gets the shot or he doesn't. I don't know how to win this one and would love to hear any advice or relevant personal experiences! Here's a picture of my beautiful LO wearing pj's that belonged to his momma in the late 80s! [For verified information about vaccines, visit our vaccine resources page.](//www.whattoexpect.com/family/vaccines) I watched it, MMR is one I would never give my baby. where are you getting 72? I see people claim that number but don't understand where it's coming from. Looking at the cdc recommended schedule and including the flu shot every year until 18 years old, and vaccines recommended for ages 11 and up, I count less than 60 where do you live? How many vaccines for kids? i am so glad i don't live in america I got 30, kids are now getting 72 People in their 20s, 30s, 40s definitely did not receive as many vaccines as babies are given nowadays. Just saying were you vaccinated? Didn't you turn out ok? I know I was vaccinated and turned out great! not true, for example my baby isn't at risk for hep b because he is 9 weeks old & isn't sexually active. You clearly know nothing about vaccines. Go ahead & inject your baby with neurotoxins for things they are highly unlikely to catch. Hope they turn out okay your baby isn't at risk thanks to everyone else my baby isn't at risk for any of those which is why I'm not worried about it. If you feel your kid is at risk go for it. Everyone is different and the vaccine schedule is not one size fits all. Also there are a ton of vaccines on the CDC recommend schedule that are not even required for school. thanks for sharing this!!!! Not exaccctly true. Polio outbreak currently in NY, measles on the rise, I have seen pertussis, influenza, meningitis and HiB cause death in babies while working in PICU. Hepatitis B is still very much a thing and I have had adult patients that had it. Pneumonia is huge. And HPV is still very real and not at all rare. Just to name a few that exist still. There's literally a polio outbreak in New York right now because of anti vaxxers. Things we vaccinate against are rare because we vaccinate not because they don't exist anymore. Do you understand why they're nearly nonexistent.....? (it's because of vaccines) same here I just had my first baby and declined all 8 vaccines at his 2 month appt. If my baby does get any I'm at least waiting a couple years. Most of them have aluminum (neurotoxin) and I just don't feel comfortable injecting that into my tiny baby when brain development is sooo important. Most things we vaccinate for are non existent so I'm not worried about him catching anything. He's also breastfeeding which protects him. do you vaccinate otherwise? Yeah I agree w your husband. You can always give the vaccine but you can never take them back so it's fine to wait a bit til baby gets older I will also be delaying MMR I will be delaying MMR as well. Probably until 3. I'm a stay at home mom so my LO isn't going to daycare. Just need to make sure we have everything before school :) same boat! My son will be staying home with my mom when he turns 1...no daycare or strangers are around him so I am considering delaying to 2 as well. I haven't read much into MMR but am curious when it began being recommended for 1 years of age. I am 21 and was vaccinated for MMR at 2 and 4 at least 2 but maybe longer. We don't have the pressure of daycare or preschool anytime soon. The higher the body mass and the more developed her body (and immune system) is the easier it will be to respond and detox from the vaccine. how long are you delaying? No judgement to any other parents out there but I'll be getting every immunisation my son is due when it's due. I'm a paediatric nurse and I've seen too many times the consequences of not vaccinating children against these easily preventable illnesses. What about some of the ingredients being carcinogenic? How will we know if people's cancers are being caused by their childhood vaccinations or not The likelihood of having life-changing complications as a result of having one of these childhood illnesses is far far greater than having an adverse reaction to an immunisation. I've never met a child that has a disability as a result of being vaccinated but I've met loads that have been disabled after having the measles for example. I'm pediatric infectious diseases specialist, doing the same. Hard no it doesn't to autism. preachhhh mama! Crazy. not a Peds @samyuf11 and @shewalksonalane and @aml122 and @Gab-S, are all of you on the same page as your partner with your decisions about the MMR shot or vaccines in general? Yes, my husband is a paramedic so he has also had similar training and experiences as I have. If he didn't though I'd still be getting our son vaccinated. It's too important to me. I'm not risking my son's health for anybody, not even his Dad. We both had the MMR at 1 and our son will be having it too. My husband's cousin wasn't vaccinated and ended up getting mumps and she was incredibly ill so she's now all caught up on her vaccinations too. I'm a single parent so it's up to me on vaccines. I am definitely not anti-vaxx. My son is up to date on all shots and will be getting the flu shot here soon. I am hesitant on MMR. Regardless he will absolutely get it, just not sure as to when between 1-2. I received it as a child at ages 2 and 4. I am 21. Not sure if guidelines have changed but both my sister and I did first dose at age 2. He doesn't go to daycare and is not around strangers we watched Vaxxed together, you should definitely watch it. yes my husband & I agree :) I share more of your husbands opinion. I think a good compromise would be to delay it if both of you feel strongly about your position. your right to choose for you or your baby. many delay certain or all vaccines (more than many realize), or there those who choose to follow the guided schedule the physicans use. i work i. health care with many doctors and nurses who support both. In the end we as parents will be left with our children getting sick from a vaccine, or from lack there of. be comfortable in your decision, its okay to make the decision either way. I've never dealt with this, my husband and I have always been on the same page. Watchung a documentary and thinking you know better than pretty much all reputable science is sort of unfathomable to me. My response to \"How can you be ok with risking something happening to him\" would be, \"How can YOU?\" Measles outbreaks have started again because of lunacy like this. He's willing to put your child's life at risk because he's afraid of autism? Even if vaccines caused autism - which they absolutely don't - I'd rather have an autistic child than one dead of measles. I wish you luck - I'm shocked and afraid at how many comments are reinforcing your husband's view. YES this omg thank you!! 100% agree Yep!!! THIS! I don't understand your husbands side at all. There is literally no evidence for any link between vaccines and autism or any other developmental delays/issues but even if there was how is a dead child from an easily preventable disease favorable to an autistic child? Honestly if my husband tried to tell me we couldn't/wouldn't follow the vaccination schedule I would leave and sue for custody on the ground of medical negligence. Absolutely agreed. I find it absolutely insane people who are not doctors or trained medical professionals giving opinions about medical issues. I'm a lawyer, and what I hated the most is when my clients thought they knew the law better than me with 0 legal training. Bottom line, talk to your doctor and if you need/want a second opinion or even a third FINE. But go to a doctor. Fully vaccinated on recommended schedule! Big believer in science from those who went to school more than me over google.
