Here are my Top 5 reasons why you should consider trying acupuncture and Chinese medicine today. 1 \u2014 Pain Pain is the most common reason why people try acupuncture for the first time. Whether you suffer from back pain, headaches, sports injuries or osteo arthritis, acupuncture and Chinese manual therapies (such as massage, cupping, moxibustion and gua sha) are extremely effective in the management of musculoskeletal & neurological pain conditions. Less commonly known however, is that acupuncture can effectively manage other types of painful conditions as well. These include menstrual pain, pain due to endometriosis, abdominal and digestive related pain. These types of pain also respond particularly well to Chinese herbal medicine. 2- Its Natural It goes without saying that one of the benefits of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is that it is a more 'natural' option for your choice in health care, but what does that really equate to? Essentially using TCM to manage your health care is beneficial as you aren't required to rely on pharmaceutical drugs, both short or long term which may cause side effects or adverse reactions. TCM is particularly useful in the management of chronic pain as the long term use of opioids can become addictive. Even high use of over the counter pain killers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol have been shown to have adverse effects on your health. For other individuals who are already on medication, or those who are unable to take certain drugs (due to factors such as pregnancy or allergies), TCM provides natural alternative options. TCM alternatives such as acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine, will not have the same adverse impacts as pharmaceuticals as they work through different mechanisms,whilst still providing the relief required. The key philosophy underlying TCM is the concept of preventative care. By using Chinese medicine, you will be able to find both relief from your current conditions, as well as build better health for your future self. 3- Cosmetic Acupuncture is a thing, and you should try it. Cosmetic acupuncture has now become common practice to incorporate into beauty regimes. Used by the likes of Kim Kardashian & Jennifer Aniston, cosmetic acupuncture is a natural way to maintain health skin. Unlike botox, acupuncture works by actively helping your skin heal itself. Acupuncture and Chinese manual therapies improve micro-circulation in the small capillaries of the skin & increase collagen production. Cosmetic acupuncture helps reduce fine lines as well as soften the skin and clear blemishes. In TCM, the health of the skin is seen as a reflection of your health and internal body. In addition to pampering the skin, we also look at your entire bodies well being to manage hormonal imbalances or other influencing factors which may be contributing to unhealthy skin. The use of gua sha and dermal rollers are also a great tool to add to your daily self care & beauty routine. You can have these techniques done for you by a professional, and then pamper yourself daily in between acupuncture sessions to enjoy longer lasting effects. 4- Integrated Health Care It is common for your Chinese medicine practitioner to work alongside GPs and specialists to ensure you are getting the best possible health care for your condition. TCM is effective in the treatment of a wide variety of conditions- not just pain management. Whether you are struggling with stress, anxiety or depression, digestive complaints, skin conditions, or need support in reproductive health, your Chinese medicine practitioner can support you as part of a wholeistic approach to your healthcare. Either modality can also be utilised in the management of more serious, or chronic illnesses alongside conventional therapies. This approach to integrative health care is commonly seen with much success in the areas of complex pathologies such as IVF, oncology, diabetes management & stroke rehabilitation to name a few. 5- Women's Health Acupuncture and herbal medicine are both extremely effective in promoting women's health, and managing the symptoms of numerous conditions. By regulating hormones, and improving micro circulation, TCM can have a profound impact on women's health particularly in the management of conditions such as painful periods, endometriosis and PCOS. TCM can also support women's health by facilitating IVF and fertility, in addition to alleviating the symptoms of menopause.
