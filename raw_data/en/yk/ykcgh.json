Crystal healing is a form of alternative medicine that uses crystals or gemstones to heal the body, mind, and spirit. Each crystal has unique vibrational properties that can balance the body's energy and promote healing. The crystals are placed on or around the body and are used in meditation or visualization practices. It is believed that by doing this the crystal's energy interacts with the body's energy field, helping to clear blockages and restore balance. At Panchtattva Studio, based on the date of birth we provide charged crystals to address each person's particular issues in order to give great healing potential for situations like health- or relationship-related problems, among others. The primary goal is to adjust and balance the flow of vital energy, or prana. By placing assorted stones on and around the body in a pattern that resonates with their chakras, the healer can use the vibrations of the crystals to move, absorb, focus, direct, and spread energy throughout the body. The result is a powerful healing system that can be tailored to every individual and solve life's specific issues, To provide you with more powerful holistic healing, we integrate meditation, reiki, and crystal healing. These services can help people relax and reconnect with their inner selves, allowing them to gain clarity and insight into their lives.
