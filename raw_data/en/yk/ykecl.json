To honor the care his wife received from the clinical team who provided neuro-oncologic and palliative care, radiation, and surgery, Jonathan Oppenheimer established The Jennifer Oppenheimer Cancer Research Initiative through a gift from the Oppenheimer Generations Foundation. \"My family and I are grateful for the kind and expert care Jennifer received during the most challenging and difficult time of our lives,\" said Jonathan. \"Jennifer was a powerful and vibrant force for good who touched the lives of thousands through her extensive advocacy for civil society organizations. This gift is a way to honor the physicians who cared for her, carry forth her work to help others, and inspire others to support research in this field.\" The largest individual gift for glioblastoma research in the history of Dana-Farber, the initiative established a Tiger Team\u2014a group of experts from multiple disciplines\u2014to focus on the goal of advancing immunotherapies to treat these intractable cancers. The Tiger Team is led by David Reardon, MD, clinical director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at Dana-Farber, and includes James T ulsky, MD, chair of the Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, also at Dana-Farber, and Alexandra Golby, MD, director of Image-Guided Neurosurgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital. In 2018, Reardon and Catherine Wu, MD, chief of the Division of Stem Cell T ransplantation and Cellular Therapies, showed that a vaccine made from a patient's own cells can spur a response against glioblastoma. Immune T cells generated by the vaccine migrated into the brain tumor\u2014the first time a vaccine was shown to generate immune cells against glioblastoma. The vaccine increased survival, but the tumors eventually developed resistance. Although limited, the vaccine's effect is promising because glioblastomas contain very few immune cells that can trigger and sustain an immune response. Building on these results, Reardon and Wu are now advancing a clinical trial of the vaccine in combination with a drug that stimulates T cells to attack cancer cells more effectively. Another Tiger Team group is mapping the interplay between glioblastoma cells, immune cells, and non-cancerous cells to fully understand the role that each cell type plays in resistance, with the goal of finding new targets and strategies. T ulsky and William Pirl, MD, vice-chair for Psychosocial Oncology, together with clinical psychologist Timothy Sannes, PhD, are leading a study of the effect of depression and anxiety on outcomes associated with immunotherapies. They hope that concurrent behavioral interventions during clinical trials may potentially Oppenheimer gift creates Tiger Team to tackle glioblastoma with immunotherapies James Tulsky, MD (left), and David Reardon, MD, are leading research at Dana-Farber funded by the Oppenheimer Generations Foundation.In tribute to Jennifer Oppenheimer (above), a visionary gift from the Oppenheimer Generations Foundation established a multidisciplinary Tiger Team at Dana-Farber to overcome challenges in glioblastoma. 4 Investing in translational research \" Jennifer was a powerful and vibrant force for good who touched the lives of thousands through her extensive advocacy for civil society organizations.

This visionary gift provides momentum toward the campaign, currently in the quiet phase. 2Impact |SPRING 2020 Melany N. Duval Senior Vice President, Chief Philanthropy Officer Dear Friends, As I write this letter, the first winter of the new decade is coming to a close and I am well into my second year as Senior Vice President and Chief Philanthropy Officer of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Jimmy Fund. I am inspired daily by the Institute's deep commitment to our patients and all that we are accomplishing thanks to our passionate and powerful donor community\u2014a community that is growing every day. Building on our deep roots in Boston, the Institute is bringing our high-quality care to more patients, closer to where they live, and establishing new research collaborations within the growing biomedical community to accelerate discoveries that will benefit patients everywhere. This growth is also reflected in the generous philanthropy you will read about in the following pages. In fact, one quarter of our donors in 2019 were from outside the New England region. Even more impressively, this group contributed nearly half of our fundraising revenue! One area where we have a tradition of exceptional support is in Palm Beach. I recently had the pleasure of spending time with this generous community during the 29th annual Palm Beach Discovery Celebration\u2014a wonderful reminder of just how much passion and dedication drives our Dana-Farber T rustees and philanthropic partners in Florida. Dana-Farber's excellence is increasingly attracting extraordinary support and attention, as more patients learn this is the best place to receive care, especially for rare or difficult-to-treat cancers. This increasing recognition is allowing us to form new partnerships and garner additional support for our innovative approaches and lifesaving work. In this issue, you'll read about individuals and foundations from across the country and around the globe who have generously chosen to support Dana-Farber's scientific and clinical leadership excellence. Gifts like these reflect a truth we know all too well: cancer affects people everywhere. As we grow and help more people here in New England and around the world, we remain steadfast in our mission\u2014to advance cancer science and provide unparalleled patient care. I'm so grateful for all that you do to make that mission possible. I hope to see many of you soon as we look ahead to warmer days and a busy Jimmy Fund events season. With sincere thanks, CELEBRATING RICHARD SMITH The dedication of Richard Smith to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is longstanding and multifaceted. Since following in his father's footsteps and joining Dana-Farber's Board of Trustees in 1962, Smith has served in a variety of capacities including Board Chairman from 1979 to 1982. Along with his late wife, Susan, also a Dana-Farber Trustee, Smith has made leadership gifts to every major Institute fundraising initiative including, most recently, a $25 million gift to support the Strategic Plan and provide momentum to the Institute's comprehensive campaign, currently in the quiet phase. In honor of Smith's 95th birthday, Dana- Farber President and CEO Laurie H. Glimcher, MD, who is the Richard and Susan Smith Professor of Medicine, hosted a luncheon in her office with (from left) Richard Smith; 2019 Nobel Laureate William G. Kaelin Jr., MD, the Sidney Farber, MD, Professor of Medicine; and Chief Scientific Officer Emeritus Barrett J. Rollins, MD, PhD, the Linde Family Professor of Medicine. St. Baldrick's Foundation strives to realize cures for childhood cancers and help survivors lead long and healthy lives by funding research studies, consortium collaborations, and emerging experts in pediatric cancer. For more than a decade, St. Baldrick's has provided steadfast support to Dana-Farber, exceeding $10 million in funding since 2008. In 2019, several Dana-Farber researchers received St. Baldrick's grants totaling $884,000. One important way that St. Baldrick's advances pediatric cancer science is by investing in its future leaders. Among several grants to Dana- Farber researchers this past year, Katie Greenzang, MD, EdM, and Alyssa Kennedy, MD, PhD, were awarded grants from St. Baldrick's. Because 80% of children with cancer become long-term survivors and most experience long-term side effects from treatment, parents need to understand the consequences of various treatments. St. Baldrick's funding is enabling Greenzang to build a website to help parents make informed treatment decisions for their child while planning for their child's future health needs. Kennedy's work focuses on inherited mutations that may make children more likely to develop leukemia. Inherited predisposition syndromes may account for 10% of pediatric and young adult leukemia cases, and these patients have much lower survival rates. To improve outcomes, it is important to know why these mutations lead to cancer and are harder to treat. With support from St. Baldrick's, Kennedy aims to help develop new ways to monitor and treat children and young adults at high risk for leukemia. These grants drive crucial research and allow early career investigators to pursue projects that expand their expertise, helping to position them as the next leaders in pediatric cancer care and treatment. \"St. Baldrick's is proud to support the most auspicious research and talented investigators on the path to finding cures for childhood cancers,\" said Kathleen Ruddy, chief executive officer at St. Baldrick's Foundation. \"Dana-Farber is home to pioneers that are expanding the boundaries of cancer medicine. Together, St. Baldrick's Foundation and Dana-Farber can truly have a positive impact on the lives of children and their families worldwide.\" St. Baldrick's surpasses $10 million in cumulative funding with grants to fuel the future of pediatric cancer treatment To learn more, contact Erin McKenna, Erin_McKenna@dfci.harvard.edu 800-535-5577 or visit Dana-Farber.org/LegacyJoin Jim and Barbara Sadowsky, Dana-Farber Society Co-Chairs and Institute Trustees, as members of the Dana-Farber Society during its 30th anniversary year.

The Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) has been a steadfast partner of Dana-Farber for more than a quarter of a century. In 1994, Dana-Farber was selected as one of eight institutions to receive an inaugural grant from BCRF . Since the start of this transformative partnership, BCRF has awarded more than 135 grants to Dana-Farber researchers, totaling nearly $39 million in cumulative support. This year, BCRF awarded nearly $5.3 million in grants to Dana-Farber breast cancer investigators\u2014the largest combined total in a single year to date. \"At BCRF , we are committed to advancing the world's most promising breast cancer research,\" said BCRF President and CEO Myra Biblowit. \"We're proud to support the incredible science underway at Dana-Farber. Together, we are undoubtedly speeding towards prevention and a cure.\" Judy Garber, MD, MPH, chief of the Division for Cancer Genetics and Prevention and Susan F . Smith Chair at Dana-Farber, and scientific director at BCRF , is among the many longtime recipients of BCRF funding. \"BCRF-funded researchers have been involved in every major breakthrough in breast cancer research of the past 25 years,\" said Garber. \"That's an incredible track record that truly speaks to their commitment to big ideas and innovative science.\" A BCRF investigator since 2001, Garber is using her funding to research gene mutations that may increase the risk of developing blood cancer after receiving breast cancer therapy. \"BCRF enables the cutting-edge care we at Dana-Farber offer patients each and every day. Our research partnership helps accelerate clinical progress and gives hope to patients and their families,\" she said. William G. Kaelin Jr., MD, the Sidney Farber, MD, Professor of Medicine and a 2019 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Medicine, has been a BCRF investigator for over a decade. His BCRF-funded research focuses on understanding the biological mechanisms of a hormone therapy used to treat estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. He and his team are also leveraging their grant to test new molecules that may hold promise as future treatment options for resistant ER-positive breast cancer. \"BCRF funding allows cancer researchers to explore critical questions with field-changing potential,\" said Kaelin. \"I am honored to be a longstanding BCRF grantee.\" The diverse research projects conducted by the 20 Dana-Farber investigators funded by BCRF this year address a broad array of topics and disease areas, from laboratory studies of triple-negative breast cancer to clinical trials exploring novel therapy combinations. Eric P . Winer, MD, chief of the Division of Breast Oncology in the Susan F . Smith Center for Women's Cancers and the Thompson Chair in Breast Cancer Research at Dana-Farber, is using BCRF funding to optimize treatment regimens for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Since many of these patients may receive more treatment than is necessary, he and his colleagues are carefully conducting studies to determine which women may be able to receive less intensive chemotherapy with fewer side effects. In recognition of his pioneering research, Winer received BCRF's Jill Rose Award in October 2019, an esteemed honor that also celebrates his devotion to improving the care and quality of life for breast cancer patients. \"What makes BCRF unique is their openness to novel ideas,\" said Winer, who is also Dana-Farber's senior vice president for medical affairs and faculty advancement and serves on BCRF's scientific advisory board. \"By supporting researchers who take scientific risks, they pave the way for innovation that moves us closer to a world without breast cancer.\" Breast Cancer Research Foundation awards largest number of grants to Dana-Farber in partnership's history From left: Judy Garber, MD, MPH; William G.

Smith Center for Women's Cancers at Dana-Farber hosted its 11th annual Beyond Boston Luncheon: an inspiring celebration of the progress made in the detection, treatment, and prevention of breast and gynecologic cancers at the Smith Center. The luncheon raised $230,000 for the Smith Center, and more than a decade of Executive Council events has cumulatively raised $18.3 million. The Beyond Boston Luncheon featured a panel of Dana-Farber physician-scientists, moderated by Judy Garber, MD, MPH, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention and the Susan F . Smith Chair at Dana-Farber, detailing the Institute's revolutionary research and treatments for women's cancers. Dana-Farber patient and breast cancer survivor Suzanne Merritt shared her story with more than 200 event attendees. After multiple surgeries and chemotherapy over the course of her treatment, Merritt is cancer-free and now runs her own award-winning small business. \"Calling the Susan F . Smith Center was one of the best decisions I've ever made,\" Merritt said. She shared that she is \"100 percent sure\" she is now a survivor because of the comprehensive care she received at Dana-Farber, including genetic testing to assess her future cancer risk and inform her care plan. \"Our mission is to support education, advocacy, and funding for women's cancers,\" said Meredith Beaton-Starr, who co-chaired the event with Kimberly Amsden. \"The work of the Susan F . Smith Center gives women with difficult diagnoses hope.\" Fred Levin is a fighter. A lung cancer survivor himself, Levin has been a dedicated and renowned advocate for those struggling with repercussions of smoking and exposure to tobacco carcinogens throughout his life and career. When he was given only eight months to live following a lung cancer diagnosis in early 2016, Levin left his Pensacola, Fla., home to travel to Boston for the surgery that would save his life. \"When my dad was diagnosed, I knew I wanted to take him to Dana-Farber,\" said Martin Levin, Fred's son. \"My wife was treated here, I have friends here, I live here. I knew that this place is the best.\" Four years later, Fred Levin credits the world-class oncology team at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center for his survival. In tribute to this care, he has made a transformative $2 million gift to Dana-Farber through the 2019 Pan-Mass Challenge (PMC), inspired by a generous matching challenge that he believed could increase the impact of his gift. Which it certainly did: Levin helped push the PMC's 2019 fundraising to an astounding $63 million. The gift includes $1 million to establish the Fredric G. Levin Endowment in T ranslational Cancer Research, and $1 million to the Presidential Initiatives Fund, to support high-risk high-reward studies that hold great potential for discovery, providing critical momentum in the Institute's comprehensive campaign, currently in its quiet phase. \"Fred Levin's extraordinary gift furthers his investment in helping those victimized by the tobacco industry,\" said Laurie H. Glimcher, MD, president and CEO of Dana-Farber. \"Every breakthrough begins with discovery, and discovery is fueled by philanthropy.\" One initiative that this gift supports is a program under the direction of David Kozono, MD, PhD, to collect, process, store, and annotate patient specimens to identify early indicators of treatment resistance and potential toxicities. \"This generous gift allows me to expand the program so that doctors can change the course of treatment sooner and further personalize lung cancer treatments,\" said Kozono. \"I am incredibly grateful for Mr. Levin's investment in what I believe will have a tremendous impact on patients' lives.\" This is the second $2 million gift that Levin has made in honor of his Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's oncology team. He views his passion for philanthropy as a family tradition, one that began with his father. \"My father was a Jewish pawn broker in a conservative Florida town, so we weren't accepted in the country clubs,\" said Levin. \"But he stepped up to give what he could at fundraisers. He showed me what an easy thing it is to do to help others.\" Honoring that philanthropic legacy drives Levin, and it is a quality he and his late wife, Marilyn Kapner Levin, instilled in their children. \"I'd been given eight months to live, and I'm still alive four years later,\" said Levin. \"It's simple: Give what you can when you can.\" Levin's $2 million investment spurs breakthrough discoveries at Dana-FarberImpact is available online at JimmyFund.org/Impact From left: Martin Levin, Fred Levin, Laurie H.

The Pan-Mass Challenge (PMC) started the new year on a high note, selling out its PMC Winter Cycle for the first time. In January, more than 1,000 riders participated in the all-day indoor cycling event at Fenway Park, raising more than $800,000 to kick off 2020 fundraising efforts for the PMC, which donates 100 percent of every rider-raised dollar to Dana-Farber and the Jimmy Fund in support of cancer research, treatment, and patient care. The PMC Winter Cycle featured six 45-minute sessions led by top spinning instructors from EverybodyFights, The Handle Bar, Turnstyle Cycle, CycleBar, B/SPOKE, and Life Time. There was also an \"extreme rider\" option that invited riders to spin outdoors, overlooking the field at Fenway. \"PMC Winter Cycle is high-energy and is always well-received by riders, instructors, and spectators alike, but this year's sell-out event was particularly successful, \" said PMC Winter Cycle Program Manager Justine Darmanian. \"It was wonderful to see so many people take time out of their busy lives, channeling physical, mental, and emotional energy to fight cancer. It was the perfect way to kick off our 2020 season as we strive to raise $65 million for Dana-Farber this year. \"PMC Winter Cycle kicks off 2020 Pan-Mass Challenge fundraising campaign Susan F.

She left an inspiring legacy that endures, among many ways, in her family's longstanding and generous support of melanoma research at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Most recently, Sharon's three children\u2014Chuck Martin, Lisa Martin Fideli, and Susie Martin Mitchell\u2014 made a $500,000 gift in her memory to support research led by F . Stephen Hodi, MD, director of the Melanoma Center and the Center for Immuno-Oncology, and the Sharon Crowley Martin Chair in Melanoma at Dana-Farber. Sharon's family has been involved in Hodi's important work since Sharon herself participated in his groundbreaking clinical trial that demonstrated the efficacy of an immunotherapy in treating advanced melanoma. This breakthrough, along with additional clinical research spearheaded by Hodi and supported by the Martin family, led to FDA approval of ipilimubab in 2011\u2014marking the first drug approved for advanced melanoma in more than a decade. Since then, with the family's sustained investment, Hodi has continued to expand and enhance the use of immunotherapies in melanoma, particularly through novel combination approaches. In October 2018, he reported findings from a study showing that 52% of patients survived for more than five years with treatment that paired two immune checkpoint inhibitors. The Martin siblings have personally witnessed the effects of these breakthroughs, as their aunt has survived more than eight years with stage IV melanoma while being treated with immunotherapy under Hodi's care. According to Fideli, her family remains grateful for Hodi's care and committed to supporting him as he strives to build on the advances enabled by their loyal philanthropy. \"We are inspired by what Dr. Hodi has done for our family and for so many people affected by melanoma and other cancers,\" she said. \"And we are pleased to help advance his work to improve immune-based treatments so they benefit even greater numbers of patients.\" The 2019 B.A.A. Half Marathon\u00ae returned to Franklin Park in Boston last October, where 335 runners from the Dana-Farber team took off from the start line to help the Jimmy Fund reach the ultimate finish line: a world without cancer. Though many of the 2019 team members were from Massachusetts, the Dana-Farber B.A.A. Half team was comprised of runners from as far as Canada and California. The 13.1-mile course through the city's Franklin Park allows runners to enjoy a scenic, woodsy route just steps from the city streets of Boston. This year's Dana-Farber B.A.A. Half team raised more than $530,000 to support the lifesaving work at the Institute. Jamie Gordon of Wellesley, Mass., was the team's top individual fundraiser, raising $14,625 to bring his total funds raised to nearly $45,000 since 2015. Thirty-four runners from the Boston law firm Ropes & Gray, the top fundraising group on the Dana-Farber team, had their highest fundraising year yet, collectively raising $51,523 for a total of nearly $203,400 raised since 2014. \"Since Dana-Farber first fielded a team in the B.A.A. Half Marathon in 2003, our runners have raised more than $8 million towards innovative cancer care and research,\" said Jan Ross, assistant vice president of Running Programs at Dana-Farber and the Jimmy Fund. \"Runners have passion, and we are grateful to those who channel that passion into raising funds to help fight cancer for the benefit of patients everywhere.\" Martin Family continues generous support for melanoma research Dana-Farber B.A.A.

Seven Dana-Farber Cancer Institute investigators received grants from Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF) totaling nearly $2,000,000 in 2019. All funds will support pediatric oncology, fulfilling the mission of ALSF to help find cures and improve the lives of children with cancer. Birgit Knoechel, MD, PhD, Jun Qi, PhD, and Rosalind Segal, MD, PhD, received ALSF Innovation Grants. Innovation Grants are awarded to leading pediatric oncologists across the United States, each of whom will receive $250,000 over the course of two years to pursue unique projects exploring better treatments and cures. \"The Innovation Grant encourages experienced researchers in the field to push for breakthroughs in childhood cancers, ultimately leading to new clinical interventions,\" said Liz Scott, co-executive director of ALSF . \"We're thrilled to honor three Dana-Farber investigators with this award and are confident their work will propel us forward, bringing desperately needed cures to patients and their families.\" Knoechel will use the funding to investigate new therapeutic approaches to treat T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), an aggressive blood cancer in children. Knoechel aims to uncover novel strategies to overcome treatment resistance by studying the genetic and epigenetic (non-genetic) changes that cause resistance to existing therapies. This work could ultimately lead to much-needed, new treatment options for young patients with T-ALL. Qi will explore a potential new therapy for neuroblastoma that may cause fewer toxicities, which ALSF Founder Alexandra \"Alex\" Scott had raised $1 million to combat childhood cancer by the time of her death in 2004 at age 8.Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation awards nearly $2 million to Dana-Farber for pediatric cancer research Continued on page 106Impact |SPRING 2020 Discovery Celebration Chair and Institute Trustee Phyllis Krock (left) with 2019 Nobel Laureate William G.

Anderson is program director of the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center and LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics at Dana- Farber and the Kraft Family Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a position he has held since the Kraft family established the professorship in 2002. The new Kraft Family Chair at Dana-Farber will be renamed the Kraft Family and Kenneth C. Anderson, MD, Chair upon his retirement at a future date to recognize Anderson's enduring friendship and preeminence in multiple myeloma research. The first incumbent is Nikhil Munshi, MD, director of Basic and Correlative Science at the Jerome Lipper Center for Multiple Myeloma, and a close colleague of Anderson's. \"I was humbled, deeply grateful, and very proud to learn that Robert endowed a Dana-Farber chair in our names. It has been an honor to team up with my cherished friend to help patients, and this generous gift continues this legacy,\" said Anderson. \"I cannot think of a more deserving individual than Nikhil to be the incumbent. His expertise in bench-to- bedside myeloma research has led to better options for patients worldwide. And he is also an ardent Patriots fan!\" Robert Kraft and the Kraft family are champions on and off the field. Robert has been a Dana-Farber T rustee since 1978, and his son Dan joined the board in 2012. Under the family's ownership, the New England Patriots have brought home six Super Bowl titles. Another winning effort spearheaded by the family, together with Anderson, is the Kraft Family Blood Donor Center at Dana-Farber and Brigham and Women's Hospital which is, quite literally, saving lives. More than 84,000 individuals have donated blood or platelets since it opened in 1984. It was former Boston Patriots player Ron Burton, who fought bravely against multiple myeloma under Anderson's care, who inspired Kraft's support of the Patriots Platelet Pedalers Pan-Mass Challenge team, which has raised over $11 million for myeloma research. The family has also made substantial investments in research for ovarian cancer, the disease that took the life of Kraft's late wife, Myra, as well as in efforts to reduce healthcare disparities. \"I love the progress and medical advancements that the team at Dana- Farber has made to identify, treat, and eradicate cancer,\" said Kraft. \"They are saving lives and I am proud to support their efforts. Ken has been a dear friend for a very long time and is someone I deeply respect and admire. I'm pleased to recognize him and promote his legacy of work with the naming of this chair in his honor.\" Kraft's latest gift will have a multifaceted impact, strengthening Dana-Farber's commitment to retaining and recruiting world-class physician- scientists while also providing powerful momentum toward the Institute's comprehensive campaign, currently in the quiet phase. \"Robert, Ken, and Nikhil are a powerhouse team, now united under the Kraft name,\" said Laurie H. Glimcher, MD, Dana-Farber president and CEO. \"Robert leads by example when it comes to one of our most important priorities\u2014supporting our world-class faculty.\" Thirty local restaurants and caterers gathered at Chez Josef in Agawam, Mass., for the 30th anniversary Chefs for Jimmy presented by Winer Levsky Group of UBS Financial Services Inc. With a theme of \"One Night of Peace, Love and Food,\" reminiscent of the 1960s and Woodstock, chefs, restauranteurs, and caterers treated more than 1,000 attendees to an array of delicious local dishes featuring global cuisine. With an additional boost from a silent auction, the event raised over $110,000 for Dana-Farber's cutting-edge research and compassionate care, bringing the grand total to $1.9 million raised since 1990. This year was also an important milestone for the venue host Chez Josef and Springfield caterer Elegant Affairs, who have been participating in the event since its inception. \"We've been involved with Chefs for Jimmy since we first started out in business 30 years ago,\" said Peg Boxold, founder and president of Elegant Affairs. \"It's a great event for a great cause, and we see it as a way of giving back to our community. Food connects people.\" Chefs for Jimmy was created by Co-chair and Founder Michael Katz, who was inspired by his father's treatment for leukemia at Dana- Farber. The event is held annually with support from the Jimmy Fund Council of Western Massachusetts in memory of Neal Webber and Stan Winer, who were longtime supporters of the Jimmy Fund.

Many of today's remarkable advances in cancer research\u2014from unlocking the immune system to fight cancer, to the development of potent targeted therapies\u2014have been driven by alumni of the Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare (DF/PCC) Hematology/ Oncology Fellowship Program. This intensive training program immerses some of the country's brightest young physicians in clinical practice and research under the mentorship of recognized leaders in the field, many of whom were fellows themselves. Building on earlier support, the Frank R. and Elizabeth Simoni Foundation recently made a grant of $200,000 to support one of these promising fellows. The Simoni Foundation was created in 1991 by Frank Simoni, a prominent New England real estate developer and founder of The Simoni Companies. \"The Simoni Foundation has been proud to support organizations like Dana-Farber that are committed to innovation in healthcare,\" said Matthew MacDonald, the Simoni Foundation's chairman. \"We are thrilled to honor Frank's legacy by providing a talented doctor with the training and experience needed to one day lead the way in cancer treatment.\" \"We are incredibly grateful to the Simoni Foundation for giving a fellow the financial freedom they need to cultivate their curiosity and pursue their scientific interests in a way that catalyzes extraordinary discoveries,\" said Ann LaCasce, MD, MMSc, fellowship program director.

Simoni Foundation invests in next generation 8Impact |SPRING 2020 With a $100,000 grant from the Ira Schneider Memorial Cancer Research Foundation, Dana-Farber immunologist Judith Agudo, PhD, is studying how to harness immune cells to prevent metastasis\u2014the potentially deadly spread of tumors. When tumor cells escape a primary tumor, they enter into a dormant state and wait for more favorable conditions. These pre-metastatic cells are resistant to chemotherapy, and Agudo is developing a method for the immune system to eradicate them before they can grow into new tumors. \"Our goal is to develop ways to destroy these dormant tumor cells early on so that there is no chance of metastases growing years later,\" said Agudo. In the lab, Agudo has engineered T cells\u2014immune cells that protect the body from foreign invaders\u2014to mount an attack specifically against pre-metastatic cells. She discovered that these manufactured T cells are able to locate and destroy most of the pre- metastatic cells, which she tags with a green fluorescent protein to make them more visible. She is now studying how the T cells migrate to and find scattered cancer cells in organs such as the brain, lung, and liver. \"The Ira Schneider Memorial Cancer Research Foundation is proud to support the important work of Dana-Farber and to defeat cancer,\" said foundation founder Michael Shapiro. The fashion community put its best foot forward for the 26th annual QVC Presents \"FFANY Shoes on Sale\" last fall, to support breast cancer research at Dana-Farber's Susan F . Smith Center for Women's Cancers. Through live television sales on QVC and an annual gala in New York City, the Fashion Footwear Association of New York (FFANY) has contributed more than $7.5 million directly to the Susan F . Smith Center\u2014and $55 million nationwide\u2014since Shoes on Sale began in 1994. Throughout the month of October, QVC and FFANY sell footwear donated from the fashion industry's top designers, at discounted prices, to benefit breast cancer research across prevention, detection, and treatment. The fundraiser began in a single tent in Central Park and has since grown into the largest effort of its kind in the footwear industry, supporting \"first step\" breast cancer research\u2014novel strategies and early career researchers that may not receive funding elsewhere. \"FFANY has no agenda other than fighting cancer,\" says Eric Winer, MD, chief of the Division of Breast Oncology within the Susan F . Smith Center and the Thompson Chair in Breast Cancer Research at Dana- Farber. \"Their generosity allows us to advance critical research and attract and retain the brightest young minds, year after year.\" The latest gift from the foundation established in memory of Ira Schneider (above) is driving research to help prevent metastasis.Erica Mayer, MD, MPH, is among the faculty in Dana-Farber's Susan F.

In addition to her career in education research, Sandra loved to cook, play piano, and was a gifted weaver. Her brothers, Ron and Steven, remember her as their best friend and protector. When Sandra was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in December 2008, it was devastating for the Rieder family. Sandra was strong, though, and fought with courage while undergoing treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for two years. T ragically, Sandra passed away from complications related to treatment in December 2010. In Sandra's honor, her parents, Evelyn and Sidney Rieder, arranged a gift to Dana-Farber in their estate plans to endow the Evelyn and Sidney Rieder Family T rust Fellowship in perpetuity. Following their passing in 2018, the fellowship contributed nearly $1.5 million to ALL research at Dana-Farber under the direction of Daniel DeAngelo, MD, PhD, chief of the Division of Leukemia. A small portion of this gift was dedicated to the creation of the Rieder Family Fund for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Research, a current-use fund to accelerate the purpose of the endowment. ALL is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes\u2014a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the immune system. While there are standard treatment options for ALL, the diagnosis is rare among adults and more research is needed to find more effective treatments for older patients. \"We are incredibly grateful to Evelyn and Sidney Rieder for their remarkable gift to Dana-Farber,\" said DeAngelo. \"We are honored that the family entrusted our team to lead the future of leukemia medicine, and we will remember Sandra as we continue to research new treatment options for adult patients of ALL.\" DeAngelo's research cohort at Dana- Farber is focused on bringing novel therapeutic agents to the forefront of treatment for patients with leukemia. In fact, Dana-Farber is the lead coordinating site for a large clinical trial using dose-intense pediatric-like regimens for adult patients with ALL. With the generous support from the Evelyn and Sidney Rieder Family T rust Fellowship, DeAngelo and his team can continue and expand on this important work for years to come. \"Sandra was full of life. Anyone who knew her, knew she was one of the universe's energy sources,\" said Sandra's brother Ron Rieder. \"Sandra died from the treatment intended to heal her. This is why more research is needed to develop new and safer drugs in the fight against leukemia.\" The Rieder family hopes that this gift will help Dana-Farber make progress in the research of alternative treatments for this disease and that other families might avoid the pain and suffering that cancer can cause. Ron added, \"Any family that has had to address cancer understands this sense of purpose, and the decision to leave a significant gift should be easy.\" Family's legacy gift honors beloved daughter and supports leukemia research The Rieder family (from left), Sandra, Sidney, Evelyn, Steven, and Ron celebrating the occasion of Sidney and Evelyn's 50th wedding anniversary. \" Any family that has had to address cancer understands this sense of purpose, and the decision to leave a significant gift should be easy.\" \u2014 RON RIEDERSPRING 2020 |Impact 9 10% of all designated gifts supports our Faculty Research Fund to advance Dana-Farber's research missionCureSearch for Children's Cancer is a national nonprofit that aims to accelerate the development of less toxic and more effective treatments for pediatric cancers by driving innovation, overcoming research barriers, and solving the field's most challenging problems. By funding innovative projects that have the greatest potential to move rapidly into the clinic, CureSearch expedites laboratory research and advancements that benefit young patients. As part of its comprehensive efforts to tackle childhood cancer, CureSearch provides critical funding to support the work of early career investigators. Dana- Farber's Adam Durbin, MD, PhD, recently received one of the foundation's $225,000 Young Investigator grants to bolster his efforts to develop a new targeted therapy for neuroblastoma. Almost 700 children are diagnosed with neuroblastoma in the U.S. every year, and there remains an urgent need to identify new therapies for this population. Through his research, Durbin discovered that the EP300 protein plays a key role in driving high-risk neuroblastoma growth and survival, so he partnered with Dana- Farber's Jun Qi, PhD, to develop a drug that can be used to target EP300. CureSearch's grant will enable Durbin to test whether this new therapy is effective against neuroblastoma cells. If so, his research could provide new hope for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, as well as children with other cancers driven by EP300, such as high-risk pediatric myeloid leukemia and rhabdomyosarcoma. \"Dr. Durbin's project aligns with our organizational research vision to focus on promising therapeutics for deadly pediatric cancers where safe and effective treatments are currently lacking,\" stated Caitlyn Barrett, CureSearch national director of research and programs. \"His work will propel a novel therapeutic strategy for high-risk neuroblastoma toward clinical trials and more importantly to where it can reach children.\" CureSearch seeks to accelerate discoveries, cures for young patients everywhereMugar Family fosters young investigators and innovative lung cancer treatmentsA fabulous year for Dana-Farber UnMask Cancer The Mugar Foundation recently pledged $300,000 to establish the Mugar Family Fellowship in Lung Cancer under the direction of Pasi J\u00e4nne, MD, PhD, director of Dana-Farber's Carole M. and Philip L. Lowe Center for Thoracic Oncology. This fellowship will advance the career of a young investigator while simultaneously supporting lung cancer efforts in the Lowe Center. \"Dr. J\u00e4nne leads a tremendous group of unyielding and passionate people working together to achieve the Institute's ultimate goal,\" said Peter Mugar of the Mugar Foundation. \"Dr. J\u00e4nne's contributions to developing targeted therapies speak for themselves, and this fellowship position will help provide additional support.\" Working side by side, the Mugar Family Fellow and J\u00e4nne will research innovative treatment options for all patients with lung cancer, hone targeted therapies, and evaluate novel genomic strategies to treat the disease. The Mugar Family Fellow will also use data and laboratory models to study the immune system's potential for attacking malignant tumors. \"The Mugar Family Fellowship will allow my team to further our research into genetic mutations in lung cancer,\" said J\u00e4nne who is also the director of the Robert and Ren\u00e9e Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science. \"We are always striving to eradicate this disease while providing our patients with the most effective and personalized cancer treatment possible\u2014this fellowship brings us one step closer to meeting that goal.\" More than 320 guests boogied the night away at the sixth annual Dana- Farber UnMask Cancer presented by The Herb Chambers Companies at the Mandarin Oriental, Boston. Attendees danced and mingled while enjoying delicious \"dinner by the bite,\" craft cocktails, and a live auction hosted by actor and comedian Lenny Clarke. Well-known NECN sports anchor Chris Collins also led the evening's call to action, which heightened enthusiasm and provided a special perspective on the impact of philanthropy. This year's disco-themed party featured entertainment by the popular local DJ Kim Collins and raised more than $175,000 to support adult and pediatric cancer care and research at Dana-Farber. Since its debut as a unique gala in 2013, UnMask Cancer has raised more than $1.14 million to accelerate promising studies and extend comprehensive patient initiatives led by the Institute's esteemed physician- scientists. The UnMask Cancer event committee, chaired by Mark Scribner, was humbled by each supporter's dedication to our shared mission to defeat cancer and amazed by the powerful sense of community present throughout the entire evening.

After being diagnosed with Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia\u2014a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\u2014 Tim Bliss sought to learn as much as he could about it, and what he could do to help people who share his diagnosis. His research soon led Tim and his wife, Ginny, to Dana-Farber's Bing Center for Waldenstr\u00f6m's Macroglobulinemia, the largest and most comprehensive referral center for Waldenstr\u00f6m's in the world. Under the direction of Steven T reon, MD, PhD, the center has made key discoveries into the genetic drivers of the disease and spearheaded the first- ever FDA-approved Waldenstr\u00f6m's therapy in 2015. \"When you have an illness, you want the best and brightest, but also the most passionate,\" said Bliss. \"Dr. T reon is both.\" The Blisses have made gifts totaling more than $260,000 to support the Bing Center's newly launched 300 Project, an ambitious effort to perform tissue banking and genomic and epigenetic sequencing for 300 patients to create a comprehensive genomic \"roadmap\" for Waldenstr\u00f6m's. \"The 300 Project supported by Tim and Ginny Bliss is the most comprehensive genomic mapping undertaken in Waldenstr\u00f6m's, and will provide integrated genome, transcriptome, and epigenomic information that can enable us to understand the many layers of regulation that underlie this malignancy,\" said T reon. \"This is also one of the most comprehensive genomic mapping endeavors in any lymphoma, and has the potential to drive new personalized medicines for Waldenstr\u00f6m's, and potentially other lymphomas.\" \"At the end of the day, it's the people,\" said Bliss. \"If you can get going with good people, you can get going on the breakthroughs.\" Tim and Ginny Bliss are supporting comprehensive genomic mapping for Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia.Bliss gift advances genetic 'roadmap' for Waldenstr\u00f6m's 10 Impact |SPRING 2020 After being diagnosed with lung cancer, Marilyn Jones came to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to pursue her care. When Marilyn and her husband, Bill, first met with Khanh Do, MD, to develop the course of treatment, they witnessed firsthand the need for new, effective treatments and the importance of drug development. In honor of the care Marilyn received, Bill and his family established the Marilyn Jones Fund for Hope. Bill, his daughter, Diane, son-in-law, and granddaughters wish for this fund to enable therapeutic advances that ultimately extend the lives of other patients and give them more time with their families. \"We feel that Marilyn's life was extended by the clinical trial she received under Dr. Do's care, and we are ever grateful for the extra time we had with our wife, mother, and grandmother,\" said Bill about his late wife's treatment. The fund will support the work of Do and Geoffrey Shapiro, MD, director of the Early Drug Development Center (EDDC). EDDC research assesses the safety and effects of experimental drugs to help accelerate the development from idea to FDA approval. Since 2008, clinical trials developed in the EDDC have led to the FDA approval of 15 new anticancer therapies. \"Marilyn's participation in her clinical trial helped advance treatments for other patients and exemplifies the progress that can still be made. Her spirit and resilience serve as motivation for our ongoing research,\" said Do. Paula Cosgrove had not heard of Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (WM) until 2016 when she was diagnosed with this rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. One of just under 1,500 people each year who receive this alarming news, Paula and her husband sought out a second opinion. Their research revealed that \"all roads led to Dana-Farber,\" Bill says. \"So, we're thrilled to support their efforts to improve outcomes globally for people with WM.\" Inspired by the unparalleled \"culture of caring and commitment\" at Dana-Farber, Paula and Bill have given $100,000 to establish the Paula and Bill Cosgrove Family Fund for Waldenstr\u00f6m's Macroglobulinemia Research. Their gift supports the collaborative efforts of Steven T reon, MD, PhD, director of the Bing Center for Waldenstr\u00f6m's Macroglobulinemia, and Paula's physician, Jorge Castillo, MD, the center's clinical director. The fund will help the team leverage the wealth of data emerging from their genomic studies into targeted and personalized treatment approaches. \"The Cosgrove Fund helps the Bing Center move closer to a comprehensive roadmap for the disease, aiming for novel targeted therapies and additional clinical trials,\" says Castillo. The Cosgroves have since become active in the WM community in their home state of Ohio and across the U.S. \"It's a lifesaver,\" Paula says. \"Very little is known about living as a 'Wally,' as I call myself, and it's been a learning curve. We want to help others understand and navigate the disease.\" Paula and Bill Cosgrove say the unparalleled \"culture of caring and commitment\" is a key reason for their gift to Dana-Farber.Bill Jones and his family are supporting the Early Drug Development Center in honor of his late wife, Marilyn Jones. Ohio couple supports Waldenstr\u00f6m's research The American Heart Association (AHA) has long been a supporter of basic science research at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. With a recent grant of $103,328, Christopher Riley, PhD, is taking a closer look at the incidence of heart failure, stroke, and diabetes, all of which have risen to epidemic levels, driven by the exponential increase in obesity and metabolic syndrome. \"We now know that obesity is highly correlated with adverse health outcomes ranging from atherosclerosis to cancer,\" said Riley. \"Our knowledge of how obesity arises and the development of therapies with which to treat it are sorely lacking. It is clear that fighting this plague with traditional methods, modulating diet and exercise, is no longer satisfactory, especially for those that are physically unable to follow these regimens.\" Riley and his colleagues have discovered a novel circulating factor that increases energy expenditure through activation of the body's fat tissue. With this AHA support, Riley is further investigating the mechanisms driving this factor in order to engineer a new therapy that harnesses fat itself to fight obesity. \"The AHA is committed to funding cutting-edge science and building careers in collaborative research, in support of its newly revised mission to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives,\" said Joseph C. Wu, MD, PhD, Director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and AHA Research Committee Chair. \"The discoveries made possible by AHA investigators are translated into medical advancements and guidelines that give healthcare providers tools to most effectively treat patients, and help people improve well-being. Research funded by the AHA directly contributes to Dana-Farber's mission to provide expert, compassionate care to cancer patients while advancing the science of cancer and related diseases.\" AHA grant supports investigations targeting obesity to reduce cancer riskMarilyn Jones Fund for Hope established in support of early drug development often affect pediatric patients who undergo conventional radiation and chemotherapy. If successful, the investigative molecule will target a key protein called EP300, which neuroblastoma cells need to survive, without causing toxicity to the surrounding, normal tissue. Segal, who is the Edward J. Benz Jr., MD, Chair at Dana-Farber, will study a protein called Eya1 that is typically present in medulloblastoma, a common brain tumor in pediatric patients. Eya1 enables cancer cells to divide quickly, facilitating rapid tumor growth. Segal and her team hope to learn more about how Eya1 works and how best to target the protein and slow tumor growth. This work could also lead to new treatments for neuroblastoma, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and other pediatric cancers.Mariella Filbin, MD, PhD, was honored with the 'A' Award, a four- year, $800,000 grant, designed for early career scientists who want to establish a career in pediatric oncology research, as well as a one-year, $125,000 pilot grant from ALSF's Crazy 8 Initiative, created to fund research exploring strategies to cure hard-to-treat childhood cancers. Filbin plans to sequence single cells in high-grade gliomas and the environment surrounding these tumor cells to learn more about how best to develop effective treatments. Natalie Collins, MD, PhD, David Shulman, MD, and Shuning He, PhD, also received grants from ALSF last year. Collins, the recipient of a one- year, $200,000 Single Cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas Award, will analyze osteosarcoma tumors to benefit ALSF's atlas of gene expression profiles for pediatric cancers. \" We're thrilled to honor Dana-Farber investigators and are confident their work will propel us forward.\" \u2014 LIZ SCOTT , co-executive director of Alex's Lemonade Stand FoundationAlex's Lemonade Stand Foundation continued from page 5SPRING 2020 |Impact 11 10% of all designated gifts supports our Faculty Research Fund to advance Dana-Farber's research missionGet involved, have fun, and beat cancer - visit JimmyFund.org Impact | SPRING 2020 |Volume 23 Issue 2 Impact is a newsletter of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Jimmy Fund published by the Division of Philanthropy.

With 100 percent of all program proceeds benefitting care and research, buyers not only share holiday cheer with family and friends but also support the work at Dana-Farber. In 2019, the program raised more than $350,000 through sales of holiday products including cards, candles, stuffed animals, and jewelry\u2014several of which featured patient artwork or Boston Red Sox themes. Since its inception, Dana-Farber Holiday Cards & Gifts has raised a total of more than $9 million for the Institute. Items were available September through December online, at the Friends' Corner Gift Shop and Yawkey Center for Cancer Care, and at leading retail locations including Stop & Shop, Terrazza, Crafty Yankee, and Long's Jewelers. A hallmark of Dana-Farber Holiday Cards & Gifts is its \"Give to a Patient\" program, which allows individuals to send select gifts to patients undergoing treatment at Dana-Farber. One such item was Hope, a cuddly stuffed animal. Hope's name was selected by the Jimmy Fund's Instagram audience, and she sported a bandana designed by 11-year-old Kylie, a patient in Dana-Farber's Jimmy Fund Clinic. Kylie and her classmates in North Grafton, Mass., raised money at school to buy Hope for other kids at the clinic. This year, generous donors sent more than 1,000 holiday gifts to grateful patients. In boxing, a haymaker is a powerful punch delivered with great force, hopefully ending the fight with a knockout. Haymakers for Hope\u2014a nonprofit raising vital funds to battle cancer\u2014aims to do just that. Co- founders Julie Anne Kelly and Andrew Myerson met in 2009 while training to compete in the New York City Golden Gloves boxing tournament. Kelly is a Hodgkin lymphoma survivor and Myerson had lost a close friend to cancer. This shared experience inspired the creation of Haymakers, which hosts charity boxing events that provide novice boxers the chance to literally fight for a cure. The boxing initiative has raised nearly $2.5 million for Dana-Farber Cancer Institute since its inception.Haymakers for Hope gives ordinary people the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete in a live boxing match with thousands in attendance, raising funds for cancer care and research in the process. Participants spend four months training rigorously, learning proper techniques for footwork, bobbing and weaving, and throwing jabs. In addition to the grueling physical commitment, each fighter is asked to meet a fundraising goal for the cancer charity of their choice. To date, nearly 800 challengers have gone toe-to-toe at Haymakers events, raising more than $14.5 million to knock out cancer. In addition to matches in New York City, Denver, and Washington D.C., Haymakers holds two annual Boston-based events. Rock 'N Rumble in the spring, and Belles of the Brawl in the fall. Dana-Farber has received funds raised by boxers at nearly every Haymakers for Hope event since its inaugural year, and in fiscal year 2019, raised $583,298 for Dana-Farber. \"The relationship between Haymakers for Hope and Dana-Farber is without a doubt, a special one,\" says Mark Avery, director of Haymakers for Hope. \"Haymakers is proud to support Dana-Farber's cutting-edge research and patient care, and that pride is often fueled by our passionate fighters who enter their four-month Haymakers journey with Dana-Farber's mission top of mind.\" Chairman of the Jimmy Fund Larry Lucchino delivered gifts purchased by donors to patients like Zeke at Dana- Farber.
