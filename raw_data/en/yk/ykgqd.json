Our contributors in this issue have done an admirable job of addressing this question. Dr. Susan Johnson advises us in practical ways with suggestions for lifestyle changes and methods to enhance our immune system and assist in the prevention of common illnesses. Mary Jo Oresti discusses \"universal activities that can be done as a brief respite during the workday to provide centering and strength,\" which are presented in relation to the seven planets. Barbara Bressette-Mills shares the steps of the \"Hallelujah\" Soul exercise that \"can help one feel well, refreshed, and inwardly still\", in an easy-to-follow manner with a link to a video soon to be released. Jeff Tunkey addresses the Pedagogical Law and how we can be of help to each other with the touchstone of \"Faith, Love and Hope\". Other intriguing aspects regarding self-care can be found in many indications given by Rudolf Steiner regarding health. Dr. Steiner speaks practically about the importance of Soul Health and presents suggestions for ways to achieve it. In reviewing the Subsidiary Exercises, I am once again struck by the wisdom and careful guidance that is provided to assist an individual who chooses meditation as a path of self-healing and self-development. I quote Dr. Steiner here when he lectures about the culmination of doing the five exercises and then speaks particularly of the sixth, \"The sixth exercise is the matter of persistence. One should try to repeat all five exercises again and again systematically in regular turns. In this way a beautiful balance is gradually achieved in the soul...One gains a quiet understanding of things that previously were totally closed to the soul. Even the gait and gestures of a person change under the influence of such exercises...(see Rudolf Steiner, Esoteric Development).\" I am filled with gratitude for the tools we are given, such as this Meditation, and the ones from our aforementioned colleagues that can assist us on our journey towards health and helping ourselves and others. From the \"Course for Young Doctors\", March 11, 1924 It was in ancient times, There lived in the initiates' souls Powerfully the thought, that ill By nature is every human being And educating was regarded Akin to the healing process Which to the child maturing Brought health along the way For life's fulfilled humanity. -Rudolf Steiner Current AHE news: AHE board members and friends have been working on various projects to stay timely with the needs of schools and the best venues to bring them to you. Using funds from a grant we received from the Waldorf Education Fund, we completed a round of on-line consults with individual teachers from schools across the country. We just learned that the grant has been renewed, so we will continue this program next fall.

AHE's Educational Support Program (ESP) began a new 3 year cycle in the fall of 2021, with in-person attendance hosted by the Waldorf School of Lexington in Massachusetts.

This maxim is similar to \"adjust your oxygen mask, before assisting others\". As teachers, what methods do we use for self-care? Your choices will of course depend on your own preferences and your constitution. Obviously, the primary focus in self-care is maintaining a balance in our physical, soul, and spiritual health. Steps include nutrition, sleep, inner life, exercise, EMF protection, the arts, and spending time with what enriches your happiness. The purpose here though is not to suggest any guidance with this very individual path but rather to present more universal activities that can be done as a brief respite during the workday to provide centering and strength. They are organized to reflect qualities of the 7 planets.

I have found that most often an incredible stillness comes over the space and within the participants, along with a feeling of well-being and quiet. Stillness and quiet, a feeling of wellness, are essential aspects of self-care.

Thus, especially in a time when stress is the common denominator, we can offer others at least a homeopathic dose of the needed responses as Holzapfel describes them.
