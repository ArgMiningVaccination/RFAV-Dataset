The priorities identified in this report help to guide the hospital's community health improvement programs and community benefit activities, as well as its collaborative efforts with other organizations that share a mission to improve health. The hospital's dedication to engaging with the community, assessing priority needs, and helping to address them with community health program activities is in keeping with its missi on. As CommonSpirit Health, we make the healing presence of God known in our world by improving the health of the people we serve, especially those who are vulnerable, while we advance social justice for all. This CHNA report meets requirements of the P atient Protection and Affordable Care Act that not -for-profit hospitals conduct a community health needs assessment at least once every three years. S an Joaquin County is one of California's fastest growing counties; it includes seven cities, many small to wns, and a number of rural farm and ranching communities. County residents are diverse, including Latinx , White , Asian , Black Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaskan Native populations. San Joaquin is a county of contrasts, home to economic and community growth opportunities and a variety of assets and resources to support health, while facing significant challenges in terms of economic security and health inequities . The San Joaquin County 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) presents a comprehensive picture of community health that encompasses the conditions that impact health in the County. The overall goal of the CHNA is to inform and engage local decision -makers, key stakeholders, and the com munity -at-large in efforts to improve the health and well -being of all San Joaquin County residents. From data collection and analysis to the identification of prioritized needs, the development of the 2022 CHNA report has been an inclusive and comprehensi ve process guided by a Core Team planning group and broadly representative Steering Committee, with input from hundreds of community residents. This collaborative effort stems from a desire to address local needs and a dedication to improving the health of everyone in the community. Conducting a CHNA every three years has been a California requirement for nonprofit hospitals for more than 20 years and is now a national requirement for Public Health Accreditation. San Joaquin County's CHNA is unique in that all of its non -profit hospitals, the local health department and key stakeholders join together to support one countywide assessment. The process in 20 22 included interviews with 1 0 key informants, 29 focus group discussions with 291 di verse community resi dents, and data analys es of over 1 00 indicators, creating a robust picture of the issues affecting people's health where they ii live, work, and play. The 20 22 CHNA process applied a social determinants of health framework and examined San Joaquin County's social, environmental, and economic c onditions that impact health in addition to exploring factors related to diseases, clinical care, and physical health. Analysis of this broad range of contributing factors resulted in identification of the top health needs for the County. This CHNA report places particular emphasis on the health issues and contributing factors that impact historically underserved populations that disproportionately have poorer health outcomes across multiple health needs. It explored disparities for populations residing in specific geographic areas referred to as \"Priority Neighborhoods\", as well as disparities among the County's diverse ethnic populations. These analyses will inform intervention strategies to promote health equity. Through a comprehe nsive process combining findings from demographic and health data as well as community leader and resident input, nine health needs were identified (see box). Through a multi -step prioritization, the following three health needs emerged as the highest prio rities for San Joaquin County: Mental Health /Behavioral Health Including Substance Use : Mental health affects all areas of life, including a person's physical well -being, ability to work and perform well in school and to participate fully in family and com munity activities. Residents of San Joaquin County experience more days of poor mental health per month and have a higher rate of deaths by suicide, drug overdose and alcohol poisoning combined than the California average , with significantly fewer mental health care providers available. Key informants and focus group participants stressed the urgency of increasing access to mental health and substance use treatment and services by addressing the barriers presented by cost, lack of insurance, transpo rtation, language/cultural competency and social stigma. Access to Care : Access to comprehensive, quality healthcare is important for health and for increasing the quality of life for everyone in San Joaquin County. The health care provider shortage within the County can lead to poor health outcomes, which are particularly nota ble among pregnant and postpartum women of color and their babies . Key informants and focus group participants described the difficulties residents experience in accessing medical , dental and specialty care due to a lack of providers or CHNA Health Needs Highest Priority Mental Health Access to Care Income and Employment Medium Priority Housing Chronic Disease/HEAL Community Safety Lower Priority Family and Social Support Education Transportation iii available appointme nts, inadequate insurance coverage, language/cultural barriers and the cost of services, co -pays, insurance and prescriptions. Income and Employment : People with steady employment are less likely to have an income below poverty level and more likely to be healthy. San Joaquin County's high er unemployment, lower average income and pervasive poverty, especially among people of color, affect opportunities and behaviors that exacerbate chronic disease and disability, reduce food security, limit healthy food and physical activity choices, erode mental health, and impact substance use . Key informants and focus group participants reported extensive job loss as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected historically underserved communiti es and threatened residents' ability to maintain housing, provide their families with healthy foods, and access medical care. For the 2019 CHNA, community members identified Chronic Disease/Healthy Eating Active Living as their top health issue. There has been progress on this health need but there is much more to do. As a result, it remains a priority and will be addressed in the subsequent development of the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). Additional health needs that were explored during the CH NA, including Chronic Disease/Healthy Eating Active Living, are described in the full report. San Joaquin County will use the results of this CHNA to drive the development of a CHIP. The CHIP will identify strategies and actions to address health needs u sing a collaborative approach . It will leverage resources and skills from a variety of County organizations and agencies to maximize the potential for a collective impact that results in concrete changes for County residents. Community partners across the County will work together to set priorities and coordinate and target resources. Additionally, the hospitals involved in the CHNA will each develop a complementary Implementation Strategy (IS) plan to outline how they will address priority health needs. These strategies will build on a hospital's own assets and resources, as well as on evidence -based strategies and best practices, wherever possible. Their IS will be filed with the Internal Revenue Service. Both the San Joaquin County CHNA and the IS report , once finalized, will be posted publicly on each of the hospitals' websites. The 2022 CHNA report and the subsequent CHIP will be available at www.healthiersanjoaquin.org iv A full list of potential commun ity resources is available in Appendix G: Community Resources of the report, and San Joaquin County 211 offers resource and referral support 24 hours per day, 365 days out of the year. Residents can access resources by dialing 2 -1-1, or by visiting www.211sj.org . This CHNA report was adopted by the Dignity Health St. Joseph's Behavioral Health Center community board in May 2022. The report is widely available to the public on the hospital's website, and a paper c opy is available for inspection upon request at St. Joseph's Behavioral Health Center . Written comments on this report can be submitted to the St. Joseph's Behavioral Health Center Community Health Director , 1800 N. California Street, Stockton, CA 95204 or by e-mail to Tammy.Shaff@dignityhealth.org . 1 I. Introduction/Background The San Joaquin County 20 22 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) presents a comprehensive picture of community health that encompasses the conditions that impact health in the County. The overall goal is to inform and engage local decision - makers, key stakeholders, and the commu nity-at-large in efforts to improve the health and well -being of all San Joaquin County residents. The San Joaquin County community has a long tradition of working collaboratively and has conducted a joint triennial CHNA for many years. This collaborative effort stems from a desire to address local needs and a dedication to improving the health of everyone in the community. San Joaquin County will use the results of this CHNA to drive the development of a joint Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), whic h will identify long -term, systematic strategies and actions to address health needs. Community partners across the County will work together to set priorities and coordinate and target resources. The 20 22 CHNA report will be available at www.healthiersanjoaquin.org . Additionally, the hospitals involved in the CHNA will each develop an Implementation Strategy (IS) plan to outline how they will be addressing priority health needs. These strategies will build on a hospital's own assets and resources, as well as on evidence - based strategies and best practices, wherever possible. Their IS will be filed with the Internal Revenue Service. Both the CHNA and the I S reports , once finalized, will be posted publicly on each of the hospitals' websites. A. Purpose of the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) Report Conducting a triennial CHNA has been a California requirement for nonprofit hospitals for more than 2 5 years (SB 697). The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) adopted a federal model similar to regulations already in place in California, making the CHNA a national mandate for nonprofit hospitals to main tain their tax -exempt status. Section 501(r) of the Internal Revenue Code now requires all nonprofit hospitals to conduct a CHNA and develop an IS every three years (http://www.g po.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR -2014 -12-31/pdf/2014 -30525.pdf ). Additionally, t his 2022 San Joaquin County CHNA fulfill s San Joaquin County Public Health Service's requirement to maintain its national Public Health Accreditation. From data collection and analysis to the identification of prioritized needs and implementation strategies, the development of the 2022 CHNA report has been an inclusive and comprehensive process guided by a Core Team planning group and a broadly representative Steering Committee. As many co mmunity members as possible were engaged in the process. Opinions were sought from decision makers and key stakeholders and more importantly, from residents whose voices are not often heard. 2 B. Description of the CHNA Process The CHNA was a collaborative e xamination of health in San Joaquin County, updating and building on work done in prior years, including many of the themes identified in previous CHNA cycles. The 2022 CHNA process applied a social determinants of health framework and examined San Joaquin County's social, environmental, and economic conditions that impact health in addition to exploring factors related to diseases, clinical care, and physical health. Analysis of this broad range of contributing factors resulted in identification of the top health needs for the County. The 2022 CHNA assessed the health issues and contributing factors with greatest impact among vulnerable populations that disproportionately have poorer health outcomes across multiple health needs. The CHNA explored dispariti es for populations residing in specific geographic areas referred to as \"Priority Neighborhoods\", as well as disparities among the County's diverse ethnic populations. These analyses will inform intervention strategies to promote health equity. The 2022 CH NA utilized a mixed -methods approach. San Joaquin County Public Health Services epidemiologists compiled a comprehensive set of secondary data from national, statewide, and local sources to provide a multi -faceted picture of health in San Joaquin County. These data were compared to benchmark data and analyzed to identify potential areas of need. In addition, Ad Lucem Consulting, in concert with the Core Team, collected primary data via key informant interviews and f ocus groups that offered a wide range of opinions about issues that most impact the health of the community, as well as examples of existing resources that work to address those needs, and suggestions for continued progress in improving these issues. The a nalyzed quantitative and qualitative data were triangulated to identify the top health needs in the County. A summary health need profile was then created for each of these. Health needs were ranked into highest, medium and lower priority at a meeting of the CHNA Steering Committee during which the CHNA data and findings were presented . Steering committee members prioritized the needs based on a set of criteria emphasizing the severity of the need, disparities and inequities related to the need, and the ab ility to make an impact in addressing the need. These methods, the data collected and the resulting prioritized community health needs are presented in this report and in the appendices. II. Community Served A. Definition of Community Served Each hospital partic ipating in the San Joaquin County CHNA defines its hospital service area to include all individuals residing within a defined geographic area surrounding the 3 hospital. For this joint CHNA, the hospital partners chose San Joaquin Cou nty as the primary servi ce area, however St. Joseph's Medical Center primarily serves residents of Stockton along with members of neighboring communities within San Joaquin County. The overall service area consists of 24 ZIP codes, and based on the top 75-80% of discharges from F Y20 (July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2020) the patients served were from the following zip codes; 95205,95207, 95206, 95210, 95204, 95209, 95203, and 95215. B. Map and Description of Community Served Figure 1. Map of San Joaquin County 4 i. Geographic Description of the Community Served San Joaquin County , in the Central Valley of California, is roughly 60 miles east of San Francisco and 35 miles south of Sacramento, with a total population of 7 42,603 (2019). Historically, agriculture has been a strong driver of our econ omy and many migrants and immigrants have settled here to work in the fields and help with agricultural processing or shipping. The County is mostly rural, with one large urban core (Stockton) and seven smaller cities, as well as many ranching and farming communities scattered across the County. ii. Demographic Profile of the Community Served San Joaquin County is home to a high concentration of residents at elevated risk for COVID -19 and who have experienced enormous impacts from the pandemic. A quarter of residents are foreign -born. Overall, 14.5% of residents live in poverty. Residents aged 65 years and older have a poverty rate of 9.9%. The educational attainment of San Joaquin County residents is much lower than California residents. Only 18.8% of County residents aged 25 and older have a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 33.9% of Californians aged 25 and older that have a bachelor's degree or higher. Table 1. Demographic Profile - San Joaquin County Race/ethnicity Total Population 742,603 Asian races 3.9% White 31.9% Source: US Census, 2019 Socioeconomic Data Living in poverty (<100% Federal poverty level) 14.5% Children in poverty 16.6% Older adults (ages 65+) in poverty 9.9% Employed (ages 20 -64 years) 52.6% Insured (ages 19 -64 years) 90.5% Adults with no high school diploma 20.7% Bachelor's Education or higher 18.8% Source: US Census, 2019 5 Many residents of San Joaquin County speak languages other than English at home (Figure 2) . Over one quarter of San Joaquin County residents communicate at home in Spanish , which is less than the overall rate for California, and fewer County residents speak Chinese languages than California as a whole . A higher percentage of County residents speak Tagalog , Punjabi and Khmer as compared to California overall . Figure 2. Languages Spoken at Home (California and San Joaquin County ) iii. Hospitalizations in the Community Served The CA Department of Health and Human Services tracks the rate s of hospitalizations for common chronic conditions for each county . San Joaquin County ha d higher (risk - adjusted) rates of adult hospitalization for heart failure, COPD/asthma (ages 40+), asthma (ages 18 -39) and hypertension in 2020 than California overall (see Figure 3). Many of these hospitalizations could potentially be avoidable through access to high - quality outpatient care. Source: US Census Bureau, ACS 2017 6 Figure 3. Adult Hospitalizations (California and San Joaquin County) iv. Leading Causes of Deaths of the Community Served In San Joaquin County, the top five causes of death are heart disease, cancer, COVID - 19, stroke and lung disease (see Table 2) . According to 2021 County Health Profiles, out of 58 counties , SJC had the 14th highest death rate from diabetes, 26th highest coronary heart disease death rate, and the 5th highest stroke death rate in the state. The top five causes of death differ by race/ethnicit y. Heart disease and cancer are among the top five causes of death for all racial/ethnic groups; d iabetes is among the top five causes of death for Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander residents , and unintentional injuries appear s in the top five causes of death for Black /African American , Latinx (Hispanic) , Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and multiethnic residents. COVID -19 was the number one cause of death for Asian and Latinx (Hispanic) residents. Table 2. Top Five Causes of Death - San Joaquin County * Source: CA Health and Human Services Open Data Portal 7 Source: San Joaquin County Public Heal th Services *The death data is a 5 -yr average, age -adjusted rate, 2016 -2020 except for COVID. COVID is only 1 year, 2020. III. Who Was Involved in the Assessment? A. Identity of Partner Organizations that Collaborated on the Assessment The San Joaquin County 2022 CHNA was an effort of the Healthier San Joaquin Collaborative that included San Joaquin Public Health Services, San Joaquin's nonprofit hospitals as well as many partner organizations and individuals throughout the community. Th e CHNA was led by a Core Team that was responsible for planning and key decision -making, including providing input for developing data collection instruments, working alongside Ad Lucem Consulting to collect and analyze data, and reviewing and commenting o n the report. The broadly representative CHNA Steering Committee supported the process by collecting primary data and participating in data review and health need prioritization. i.

San Joaquin County Community Residents The San Joaquin County 2022 CHNA would not have been possible without the support and engagement of County residents. Many community residents volunteered their time as focus group participants to provide the critical perspectives of residents living, work ing, and raising families in County communities. Others helped to support the process by providing feedback/validation of the preliminary findings. B.

Sources and Dates of Secondary Data Used in the Assessment The data used for this CHNA follows the health need s organization and indicators found in the Kaiser Permanente (KP) Community Health Data Platform1. The most up -to-date data w ere included and data by race/ethnicity w ere also compiled , as well as a number of additional demographic indicators. For details on specific definitions , sources and dates of the data used, please see Appendix A. Data for health status, behavior, and risk factor indicators can be found in Appendix B. ii. Methodology for Collection, Interpretation, and Analysis of Secondary Data The data included in this CHNA presents a focused set of community health indicators that al lows readers to understand what is driving health outcomes in S an Joaquin County , including understanding racial/ethnic disparities and comparing local indicators with state benchmarks. The 2019 CHNA2 primarily used data from the Healthy Places Index (HPI)3 and the US Census. However, during the development of the 2022 CHNA, updated data was not 1 Kaiser Permanente. (2022). Community Health Data Platform. Oakland, CA. https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kp.chna.data.platform 2 San Joaquin County. (March 2019). 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment . http://www.sjcphs.org/disease/documents/20190514_Comm%20Hlth%20Needs%20Assmnt.pdf 3 Public Health Alliance of Southern Cali fornia. (2018). The California Healthy Places Index (HPI) . https://map.healthyplacesindex.org/ 10 available on the HPI site, and some indicators previously drawn from the US Census changed in definition. To maintain data integrity, PHS staff downloaded data meth odology and data sources from HPI along with the data sources from the KP Community Health Data Platform. The KP Platform \"Health Topics\" was used as a framework for the 2022 CHNA measures. Unfortunately, this Platform did not have measures stratified by race/ethnicity , therefore , PHS staff attempted to gather the information from the defined data sources. Due to similarities between the 2019 CHNA indicators and the KP Platform measures, a crosswalk was developed to remove redundancies: If there was a di fference between the CHNA measure and KP platform measure, (ex. Health insurance), the 2019 CHNA measure was kept and updated. If the 2019 CHNA measure did not have updated information, then the closest KP platform measure was chosen as a replacement. If the 2019 CHNA measure did not have updated information and there was not a match in the KP platform, then the measure was kept and labeled with \" - \". The main goals for secondary data collection and analysis were the following: To compare county values to state values and measure divergence (% above or below). To gather county indicator data by racial/ethnic group and measure of divergence from county benchmark and White population. To compare priority neighborhood values to county values and measure divergence (% above or below). To track change over time between 2019 CHNA and 2022 CHNA. To show rate stability by calculating statistical significance for each measure, if available. Analysis of the secondary data included assigning a score to each health need (4: very high, 3: high, 2: medium, 1: lower) based on how many indicators within the health need were statistically significantly worse than state benchmarks. The majority of health needs had at leas t one indicator for which racial /ethnic disparity data were available ; an additional score was assigned to each health need based on the number of racial/ethnic groups for whom each indicator was significantly worse than for White residents. 11 B. Community Input i. Description of Who W as Consulted Community input was provided by a broad range of community members using key informant interviews , focus groups and community meetings . Individuals with the knowledge, information, and expertise relevant to the health needs of the community were consulted. These individuals included representatives from local governmental and public health agencies , community -based organizations, and leaders, representatives, or members of underserved, low -income, and racial/ethnic populations. Additionally, wh ere applicable, other individuals with expertise o n local health needs were consulted. For a complete list of individuals who provided input, see Appendix C. ii. Methodology for Collection and Interpretation Key Informant Interview Methodology Ad Lucem Consulting conducted key informant interviews with ten individuals representing diverse sectors including: public health, health care, community -based organizations, social services and government. The key informants were identified by Healthier San Joaqu in Collaborative Core Team members. All interviews were conducted by telephone in English and took approximately 30 -45 minutes to complete. The interviews followed a standard set of interview questions and the interviewer took detailed notes during the ca ll. At the beginning of the interview, confidentiality was assured and the respondents were invited to skip questions that were not applicable to the respondent's experience. Interview topics: Interview questions were developed by Ad Lucem Consulting with input from Core Team members. For the complete list of interview questions, see Appendix D. Questions addressed the following topics: 1. Top health issues in San Joaquin County 2. Factors and challenges that contribute to the top health issues 3. Impact of COVID -19 on the top health issues 4. Impacts on specific populations (e.g. low income, racial/ethnic subpopulations) 5. Successful strategies and community assets to address top health issues 6. Opportunities and roles for addressing the top health issues Data Analysis: Ad Lucem Consulting used software to code and analyze responses by health need. The number of mentions for all themes related to a particular health need were tallied to develop an interview data score. Health needs were assigned points based on the frequency of mentions of the health need by key informants. Points for each health need were tallied across interviewees to develop interview scores for health need priority, racial/ethnic disparities, geograp hic or other disparities. Focus Group Methodology 12 Twenty -nine community resident focus groups were conducted in geographic areas within San Joaquin County, including Stockton, Linden, Lodi, Tracy and Manteca. Twenty groups were conducted in English and nine were conducted in Spanish . Participants were primarily young adults, adults, and older adults who represented underserved, low -income, and varied ethnic communities. Figure 4. San Joaquin County Focus Group Participant Profile 13 Representatives from c ommunity -based organizations (CBOs) and public agencies who were members of the CHNA Steering Committee were trained by Ad Lucem Consulting to conduct focus groups with community residents. This approach allowed for a large number of focus groups to capture the diverse perspectives of many County subpopulations. CBOs/public agencies attending the training received instruction on a 10-step focus group process, including participant recruitment, focus group logistics, focus group facilit ation, note taking and summarizing the focus group discussion. The training participants received a toolkit which included a focus group manual describing the 10 steps as well as the focus group guide and instructions on return ing the focus group materials . The CBOs/public agencies had the opportunity to apply for funds to support focus group logistics and focus group participants were provided with a $25 gift certificate as a thank you for their participation. CBOs/public agencies conducted 2 7 of the focus groups. CBO/public agency staff recruited participants and organized logistics for the focus groups. Each focus group session averaged 60 minutes and was facilitated by a participating CBO/agency. Due to the pandemic, eight out of the twenty -nine focus gr oups took place using a virtual format. During the focus group, CBO/public agency staff members took notes (either the focus group facilitator or a co -moderator); CBOs/public agencies were instructed to use the notes to prepare a focus group summary on a t emplate provided in the toolkit. CBOs/public agencies emailed focus group summaries and demographic questionnaires to Ad Lucem Consulting for data entry and analysis. Two focus group s were conducted by Community Health Insights (CHI), the consultant prepar ing the CHNA for Sutter Health in San Joaquin County. CHI used a similar focus group guide and generously shared notes from the focus group s, which were included in the focus group analysis described below. Focus group question guide: A focus group guide ensured consistency across groups. The focus group questions were developed by Ad Lucem Consulting with input from the Core Team. Questions were open -ended and additional probing questions were used as needed to elicit more in -depth responses and richer d etails. The questions were translated into Spanish by a native Spanish speaker experienced in translation. At the beginning of each focus group session, participants were welcomed and assured anonymity of their responses. An overview of the discussion was provided as well as a review of discussion ground rules. For the complete list of focus group questions, see Appendix E. Questions addressed the following topics: 1. What is healthy about the community 2. What makes it difficult to be healthy in the community 3. Top health issues in community 4. Impact of COVID -19 on the top health issues 14 5. Strategies to address top health issues 6. How the pandemic impacted the community's health needs Data Analysis: Summaries of focus group discussions were prepared by the CBOs/agencies who facilitated the focus groups and were submitted to Ad Lucem Consulting. The most prominent themes in the focus group summaries were identified. Health topics discussed by focus group participants were organized into the he alth need categories defined by the secondary data . Health needs were assigned points based on the frequency and importance given to the health need by focus group participants. Points for each health need were tallied across focus groups to develop scores for health need priority, racial/ethnic disparities, geographic or other disparities. i. San Joaquin County Reports and Assessments A number of San Joaquin County partners have published documents that contribute to the overall understanding of the local social, environmental, and economic conditions that impact residents' health . These documents were reviewed as part of the CHNA assessment to highlight health issues and contributing factors for the County's historically underserved populations . This information can inform intervention strategies to promote health equity. For the complete annotated bibliography, see Appendix F. C. Written Comments Each hospital has provided the public an opportunity to submit written comments on the facility's prev ious CHNA Report through their website. These websites will continue to allow for written community input on each facility's most recent CHNA Report. As of the time of this CHNA report development, members of the Core Team had not received written comment s about the previous CHNA report. Core Team members will continue to track any submitted written comments and ensure that relevant submissions will be considered and addressed by the appropriate facility staff. D. Data Limitations and Information Gaps The CHN A data platform includes over 100 secondary indicators that provide timely, comprehensive data to identify the broad health needs faced by a community. However, there are limitations with regard to these data, as is true with any secondary data : Some data were only available at a county level and did not contribute to the understanding of neighborhood level needs. A number of indicators reported rely on the Census/American Communities Survey which may be based on small sample sizes and are estimates rather than actual measures. 15 Disaggregated data around ethnicit y/race are not available for all data indicators, which limited the ability to examine health disparities. Data are not always collected on a yearly basis, and some data are several years old. The COVID -19 pandemic had an impact on both socioeconomics and health and exacerbated existing racial/ethnic disparities; the impact of the pandemic is not necessarily captured by the secondary data presented in the CHNA as most of this data was collected pre -pandemic. Primary data collection and health need ranking processes are also subject to limitations and information gaps: Themes identified during interviews, focus groups and surveys were likely dependent upon the experience of individuals selected to provide input; input from a robust and diverse group of stakeholders sought to minimize this bias. The final list of ranked health needs is subject to the affiliation and experience of the individuals who attended the ranking meetings, and to how those in dividuals voted on that particular day. V. Priority Neighborhoods Table 3 lists the 14 San Joaquin County Priority Neighborhoods. The residents of the Priority Neighborhoods are the most impacted by both historic health disparities and the risks and impacts of COVID -19. Table 3: San Joaquin County Priority Neighborhoods (Census Tracts) Census Tract City Included in 2019 CHNA 1 Stockton 3 Stockton 6 Stockton 7 Stockton 16 Stockton 22.01 Stockton 27.01 Stockton (Garden Acres) 33.12 Stockton 53.03 Tracy 16 The Map in Figure 5 below shows where the Priority Neighborhoods are located. In the 2022 CHNA, there are 14 Priority Neighborhoods: 10 from the previous CHNA (2019) for continued work and comparisons, and four new Priority Neighborhoods for better geographical representation. The new Priority Neighborhoods were chosen based on the following criteria: (a) considered a Census Designated Place (C DP), (b) larger population estimate compared to other CDPs, and (c) low Healthy Places Index percentile than other CDPs. Profiles of the 14 Priority Neighborhoods (Census Tracts) are presented in Section VII.A. Each Priority Neighborhood's profile includes the following: map of the census tract, demographic data, root causes of health, and birth and death statistics. For the ten Priority Neighborhoods that were included in the 2019 CHNA, change over the last 3 years is described in addition to presentation of current conditions. Figure 5. Map of 14 Priority Neighborhoods 17 VI. Identification and Prioritization of the Commu nity's Health Needs A. Identifying Community Health Needs i. Definition of \"Health Need\" For the purposes of the CHNA, health needs are defined as including requisites for the improvement or maintenance of health status both in the community at large and in particular parts of the community (such as particular neighborhoods or populations experiencin g health disparities). Requisites may include addressing financial and other barriers to care as well as preventing illness, ensuring adequate nutrition, or addressing social, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence health in the community. Health needs were identified by the comprehensive identification, interpretation, and analysis of a robust set of primary and secondary data. ii. Criteria and Analytical Methods Used to Identify the Community Health Needs The following criteria were used: It fits the definition of a \"health need\" as described above. It was confirmed by multiple data sources (i.e., identified in both secondary and primary data). Indicator(s) related to the health need performed statistically significantly worse than the state aver age. It was chosen as a community priority. Prioritization was informed by the frequency with which key informants and focus groups mentioned the need. The final list included only those that informants and focus groups identified as a need. The following methods were used: A health needs identification table was developed which included all related indicators that benchmarked statistically significantly worse than the state. Race and ethnicity data were reviewed (when available) to identify all indicators for which disparities existed. The number of groups experiencing disparities for a given indicator was noted and addressed during prioritization. Primary data were reviewed and assessed for overall priority, racial/ethnic disparities, geographic dispariti es and disparities affecting other groups . While Cancer, Climate and Environment and Sexual Health each had at least one indicator that performed poorly against the state average, they were not included as health needs for the 20 22 CHNA because they were not mentioned with frequency in the primary data collection. 18 Nine health needs met the above criteria: Highest Priority Mental Health /Behavioral Health Including Substance Use Access to Care Income and Employment Medium Priority Housing Chronic Disease/ Health Eating, Active Living ( HEAL ) Community Safety Lower Priority Family and Social Support Education Transportation B. Criteria and Process Used for Prioritization of Health Needs i. Prioritization Criteria The following criteria were identified to use in prioritizing the list of health needs: Health measures : San Joaquin County indicators compare poorly to the California average . Clear disparities or inequities: Data show d ifferences by racial/ethnic subgrou ps. Community input: Interviews/focus groups identified important issues related to the health need . Prevention: Opportunit ies exist for health promotion and disease prevention rather than treatment . Leverage community assets: San Joaquin County has e xisting partnerships, momentum, current program ming and assets that address the health need. ii. Prioritization Process CHNA Steering Committee Ranking Meeting: This two -hour virtual meeting was attended by 48 Steering Committee members. At the meeting, the primary and secondary data, organized by the nine health needs, were presented and discussed during small group breakouts to foster in depth discussion of the data. The data scoring 19 was also presented and pa rticipants engaged in a multi -voting process to determine the highest, medium and lower priority health needs. Multi -voting Process: During the Steering Committee meeting, a multi -voting method was used to prioritize the nine identified health needs; part icipants considered the prioritization criteria when making their decisions. Participants took part in two rounds of voting to prioritize the nine health needs. For the first round, participants voted for their top three priority health needs. The three ne eds that received the most votes were identified as highest priority. The same voting process was used for round two: participants voted for their next three priorities among the remaining six health needs. The three that received the most votes were ident ified as medium priority health needs. The remaining needs were identified as lower priority health needs. Community Meetings: The CHNA assessment finding and health need prioritization were presented at a series of meetings with community residents. Meeti ng attendees provided input and concurred that each of the nine health needs was important and that these issues are interrelated. C. Prioritized Description of Health Needs Identified through the CHNA See Section VII .B. for the nine complete Health Needs Profiles. Highest Priority Mental Health /Behavioral Health Including Substance Use : Mental health affects all areas of life, including a person's physical well -being, ability to work and perform well in school and to partici pate fully in family and community activities. Those facing challenges related to lower economic opportunit ies often experience high levels of stress in their daily lives, coupled with fewer resources for coping. Residents of San Joaquin County experience more days of poor mental per month and have a higher rate of deaths by suicide, drug overdose and alcohol poisoning combined than the California average, with significantly fewer mental health care providers available. Key informants and focus group partic ipants stressed the urgency of increasing access to mental health and substance use treatment and services by addressing the barriers presented by cost, lack of insurance, transportation, language/cultural competency and social stigma. Access to Care : Access to comprehensive, quality healthcare is important for health and for increasing and maintaining high er quality of life. In San Joaquin County, residents are more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid or other public insurance, which is a factor related to overall poverty. People of color, especially Latinx children and adults, are the most likely to be uninsured. The health care 20 provider shortage within the County can lead to poor health outcomes, which are particularly notable among pregnant and postpar tum women of color and their babies. Key informants and focus group participants described the difficulties residents experience in accessing medical, dental and specialty care due to a lack of providers or available appointments, inadequate insurance cove rage, language/cultural barriers and the cost of services, co -pays, insurance and prescriptions. Income and Employment : People with steady employment are less likely to have an income below the poverty level and more likely to be healthy. San Joaquin County's higher unemployment, lower average income , pervasive poverty and variable high-speed Internet access , especially among people of color, may affect opportunities and behaviors that exacerbate chronic disease and disability, reduce food security, li mit healthy food and physical activity choices, erode mental health, and impact substance use . Key informants and focus group participants reported extensive job loss as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected historically unde rserved communities and threatened residents' ability to maintain housing, provide their families with healthy foods, and access medical care. Medium Priority Housing : Stable, affordable housing is strongly associated with health, well -being, educational achievement , and economic success . When compared to California overall, indicators of housing instability in San Joaquin County are better than state averages. However, secondary data indicates that disparities exist for residents of color related to home ownership and crowded housing. Focus group participants and key informants linked housing challenges such as rent affordability and multigeneration or crowded households to significant anxiety, leading to mental/behavioral health difficulties and interpers onal issues, sometimes escalating to domestic violence. Key informants also noted the many challenges related to homelessness in the County, which both they and focus group participants agreed is a complex problem requiring a multisector approach to solve. Chronic Disease/ Healthy Eating, Active Living ( HEAL ): Chronic diseases are a primary cause of poor health outcomes and death and a leading driver of health care costs. Those who have limited access to healthy foods have a higher risk of developing a chronic disease, such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes or asthma. Along with a healthy diet, physical activity is key to preventing and reducing complications from chronic diseases. Obesity rates and diabetes prevalence were 21 higher in San Joaquin County as compared to the state , with children and adults of color having significantly higher rates of obesity than their White neighbors. Secondary data also indicate significant disparities related to hospitalization and deaths from cardiovascular diseases an d asthma. Poverty, lack of access to healthy food and safe places for physical activity, and easy access to unhealthy foods were frequently mentioned as barriers by key informants and focus group participants. For the 2019 CHNA, community members identifie d Chronic Disease/Healthy Eating Active Living as their top health issue. There has been progress on this health need but there is much more to do. As a result, it remains a priority and will be addressed in the subsequent development of the Community Heal th Improvement Plan (CHIP). Community Safety : Safe communities promote community cohesion and economic development, and provide more opportunities to be active and improve mental health while reducing untimely deaths and serious injuries. Violent crime rates and rates of injury, motor vehicle and pedestrian deaths are all higher in San Joaquin County than in the state , with Black/African American residents experiencing the highest rates of deaths . Focus group participants discussed crime and drug use in their communities, reporting that public spaces created for physical activity (parks, sidewalks or bike paths) don't feel safe because of gang violence, homelessness, discarded drug paraphernalia, broken lights and rundown equipment. They also emphasized the need for improved relationships between law enforcement and the community, particularly for communities of color and unhoused individuals. Lower Priority Family and Social Support : The presence or absence of a strong social support network affects all aspects of life, including physical and mental wellbeing. Communities are the context in which families prosper or struggle, highlighting the importance of identifying areas of need and disparity and leveraging community resources to address them. San Joaquin County has a higher percentage of residents living with a disability than the state average, with Black/African American residents having the highest rate . Many residents have limit ed English proficiency. Focus group participants perceived that social connections are integral to creating and sustaining healthy communities with large support networks. They expressed concern about the lasting impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic on familie s. 22 Education : The link between education and health is well known \u2014those with higher levels of education are more likely to be healthier and live longer. Fewer children in San Joaquin County are enrolled in preschool, which is associated with academic readiness and success. San Joaquin County s tudents have lower rates of proficiency in math and reading than students across C alifornia , with evidence of signi Black/African American , and multiethnic students. Adults in the County are less likely to have a high school diploma or have completed a college degree. Key informants stressed the importance of addressing systemic barriers r elated to education to improve community health and lift families out of poverty. Transportation : Without reliable and safe transportation, individuals struggle to meet basic needs such as earning an income, accessing health care, and securing food. Focus group participants and key informants agreed that San Joaquin County residents experience challenges related to transportation, substantially impacting decisions related to employment, healthcare, housing and nutrition, and potentially leading to po or physical and mental health. Secondary data indicates that County residents are less likely to engage in active tran sportation , such as biking or walking, and are more likely to commute alone by car . D. Community Resources Potentially Available to Respond to the Identified Health Nee ds San Joaquin County's community -based organizations, public agencies, hospitals and clinics, and other entities are engaged in addressing many of the health needs identified by this assessment. Key resources available to respond to the identified health nee ds of the County are listed in Appendix G Community Resources. As a licensed, not -for-profit facility, providing comprehensive behavioral health services for psychiatric an d chemical dependency disorders, St. Joseph's Behavioral Health Center is committed towards addressing mental and behavioral health needs for San Joaquin County residents. In addition to providing access to mental health care through inpatient, outpatient, and day treatment services, the following community benefit investments expand com munity resources. Community Health Improvement Services o Support Groups o 24 hr. Mental Health Evaluator Services o Transportation assistance for those in need of access care o Transitions of Care support for patients experiencing homelessness Health Professions Education for medical and nursing students Cash and In -Kind Contributions to support community based organizations 23 VII. Impact of Actions Taken Since the Preceding CHNA Since the last CHNA from 2019 , St. Joseph's Behavioral Health Center (SJBHC) has adapt ed and adjusted services to ensure COVID safety precautions and transitioned to telemedicine services and programming. Behavioral Evaluations to assess patient needs and risks remained available 24-hours daily, 365 days per year to anyone who presents at any communit y hospital Emergency Department countywide . Support Groups and Aftercare Services also remained available virtually in order to support individuals with a new or continuing life -alerting diagnosis. These services along with additional community benefit programs, resulted in supporting over 19,000 persons and invested over $2 million in the community to support the residents of San Joaquin County. Below is a brief summary of impact efforts and more information regarding community health improvement efforts can be found online at, http://stjosephscares.org/communityhealth or by contacting Tammy.Shaff@dignityhealth.org . Mental & Behavioral Health: 4,417 individuals were provided with free behavioral evaluations to assess needs and risks and appropriate treatment. These services were provided regardless of the individual's eligibility for se rvices and ability to pay. Additionally, SJBHC staff, provided expertise and guidance in the development of the Commun ity Health Worker strategies at St. Joseph's Medical Center to advance mental health programming and trauma informed strategies in the br oader community. Access to Care : To improve access to quality healthcare and create the physician workforce of the future for Stockton and surrounding Central Valley communities, the Graduate Medical Education is the primary strategy and has expanded fro m internal, family and emergency medicine and added specialties - psychology, anesthesiology, urology and neurology. With 95 residents in 2022, the program is set to expand to 200 residents by 2025. SJMC has engaged in the development of a new GME program . Housing: Significant investments from CommonSpirit Health's Homeless Health Initiative strategy have resulted in an expansion of street outreach services, permanent housing solutions, and comprehensive case management services for patients post discharg e. Over $2.3 million has been invested in San Joaquin since 2020, offering over 63 additional permanent housing options for chronically homeless individuals for years to come. 24 VIII. Profiles A.

Health Need Profiles Mental health /behavioral health including substance use Rationale: Why this is a Critical Health Need Mental health affects all areas of life, including a person's physical well -being, ability to work and perform well in school and to participate fully in family and community activities. Those facing challenges related to lower economic opportunity often experience high levels of stress in their daily lives, coupled with fewer resources for coping. Chil dren and youth experiencing stress have an increased likelihood of poorer mental and physical health. Deaths of despair \u2014 those due to suicide, drug overdose, and alcoholism \u2014 are on the rise . Communities across the country are experiencing a critical lack of capacity to meet the increased demand for mental health and substance use treatment services. Mental/behavioral health SJC Performs Significantly Worse than CA Ethnic/Racial Disparities Present in SJC Mental health providers per 100,000 population Yes NA Deaths of despair per 100,000 population Yes No Suicide deaths No No Poor mental health (days per month) Yes NA Substance use Current smokers Yes NA Opioid -related overdose deaths per 100,000 population No NA Alcohol -impaired driving deaths No NA Excessive drinking No NA Key Findings and Disparities Across San Joaquin County (based on health data) Residents of SJC have access to significantly fewer mental health care providers than CA overall. SJC has 33% fewer mental health practitioners than the state. 68 Rates of deaths of despair (death due to suicide, alcohol -related disease, and drug overdoses) are 25% higher among SJC residents (43 per 100,000 population) than CA as a whole (34 per 100,000 population); Asian and Hispanic residents have significantly lower rates of deaths of despair and fewer suicides than White residents. SJC residents experience significantly more poor mental health days per month (4.4) than the CA average (3.7). 15% of SJC adults are currently smokers, compared to only 11% of Californians. What Community Stakeholders Say About Mental Health and Substance Use (based on key informant interviews and focus groups) Overall 69% (20 of 29) focus groups and 6/10 key informants identified mental health as a top priority in SJC. 45% (13 of 29) focus groups and 1/10 key informants identified substance use as a top priority in SJC. Many focus group participants expressed concern about the increase in substance use in their communities, particularly the rise in drug and alcohol use among children/adolescents and unhoused residents. Existing resources for mental health care, like the San Joaquin County Pride Center, El Concilio, and other local, small non -profit organizations, need support. Key informants discussed the County's inadequate treatment capacity for substance use disorders; several key informants emphasized the importance of treating substance use while concurrently addressing mental health issues and homelessness, often co -occurring problems . Focus group participants frequently linked substance use with a threat to community health and safety, expressing frustration with drug -related a ctivities in public spaces that result in trash/blight and prevent spaces being used for recreation and physical activity. Disparities Key informants described how every vulnerable or underserved population in San Joaquin County has been disproportionately impacted by the insufficient availability \"Anything that we can do to get more mental health services in pre-K to 12th grade is going to be a great thing. And even in childcare facilities. There's not a lot of this happening locally, except in Early Head Start where mental health services are available to children and families at a very young age. That's the model that is going to set a child up in such a better way because you're dealing with childhood trauma right then and there, and working with the family to let them know it's okay to receive services when you need them for mental health. \" - Community Based Organization Leader \"COVID -19 has created significant mental health struggles that are being experienced universally (helping with stigma) but services to address or even acknowledge the grief being faced are in short supply with very long waitlists .\" - Focus Group Participant 69 of mental health services, listing children, adolescents, the elderly, those who identify as LGBTQ+, unhoused people, people of color, immigrants, rural communities, and low -income residents as having the greatest needs around accessible mental health services. Barriers to access included cost, lack of insurance coverage, transportation, language and cultural or social stigma . Focus group participants stated that more needs to be done to reduce stigma around seek ing mental health care, especially for people of color, non -English speakers, LGBTQ+ and unhoused individuals. A few focus group participants mentioned that the societal changes of 2020, created by the pandemic and the social unrest caused by protests against racially motivated police brutality, led to increased stress and fear of racial discrimination and social injustice. Impact of COVID 19 The pandemic has taken a toll on mental health. Focus group participants reported feelings of depression, anxiety, fear, bore dom, isolation and despair. Focus group participants and key informants stated that many people turned to unhealthy coping strategies, such as alcohol or drug use, to manage mental health, in part because of the perception that mental health services wer e unavailable or inaccessible. 70 Access to care Rationale: Why this is a Critical Health Need Access to comprehensive, quality healthcare is important for health and for increasing the quality of life for everyone. Components of access to and delivery of care include: insurance coverage; adequate numbers of primary and specialty care providers; health care timeliness, quality and transparency; and cultural competence/cultural humility. Limited access to healthcare and compromised healthcare delivery negatively affect health and quality of life. Key Findings and Disparities Across San Joaquin County (based on health data) SJC residents have access to significantly fewer health care providers than the CA average. SJC has 26% fewer primary care physicians (59 per 100,000 population) and 34% fewer dentists (58 per 100,000 population) than the state benchmarks (80 and 87 per 100,000, respectively). Pregnant and postpartum mothers and their babies in SJC experience significantly worse outcomes compared to CA averages: infant deaths per 1,000 live births in SJC (6) are 50% higher than CA (4), low birth weight (8%) is almost 10% higher than CA (7%), preterm births (10%) occur over 10% more often than CA as a whole (9%). The percentage of mothers receiving prenatal care in the f irst trimester in SJC (80.8%) is significantly worse than the CA benchmark (84%). In addition, Hispanic, Black and Multiracial mothers all have a significantly lower likelihood of receiving prenatal care than White mothers in SJC. Access to care SJC Performs Significantly Worse than CA Ethnic/Racial Disparities Present in SJC Infant deaths (per 1000 live births) Yes No Uninsured children (ages <19 yrs) No Yes Insured (ages 19 -64 yrs) No Yes Medicaid/public insurance enrollment No No Low birth weight Yes Yes Pre-term births Yes Yes Prenatal care in 1st trimester Yes Yes Dentists per 100,000 population Yes NA Primary care physicians per 100,000 population Yes NA 71 SJC has a higher percent of insured children and adults than CA, but disparities are present; Hispanic children (16%) are more likely to be uninsured than White children, and Hispanic, Asian, Black and Multiracial adults are more likely to be uninsured than White SJC adults. Communities Disproportionately Impacted (based on Priority Neighborhood Profiles) Eleven of the 14 Priority Neighborhoods have lower access to prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy as compared to SJC overall. Over half of the Priority Neighborhoods have higher rates of low -birth-weight babies compared to the County. Low birth weight can be addressed with early access to prenatal care. CT 22.01(Stockton) saw a 62% increase in low -birth-weight babies since 2019. What Community Stakeholde rs Say About Access to care (based on key informant interviews and focus groups) Overall 45% (13 of 29) focus groups and 3 of 10 key informants identified access to care as a top priority health need in SJC. Many key informants and focus group participants stated that even with health insurance, access to specialty care of all kinds is problematic. Key informants cited numerous barriers to care: few local specialists, inadequate appointment availability, inadequate insurance coverage and language/cultural barriers. Additional financial barriers to care cited by focus group participants i ncluded high costs for medical/dental services, insurance, co -pays and prescriptions. Disparities Focus group participants described too few healthcare providers who speak their languages or understand their cultures, echoing a common theme expressed by ke y informant interviewees who cited a need for more culturally appropriate and sensitive providers. In addition, key informants emphasized the need for provider training in patient care for LGBTQ+ residents and those with diverse gender expressions. \"The way healthcare is going, people who were already struggling with their day -to-day, they don't have the time to find out what they need to do, or they may not h ave the tools to get there, or they're afraid of the costs.... People are apprehensive. In my experience working with families, they'll tell you horror stories about how they got stuck with a bill that they didn't expect.\" - Community Based Organization Lead er 72 Severa l focus group participants described limited access to pharmacies, especially for residents with transportation or mobility barriers. One key informant identified lack of access to care as an important factor influencing birth outcomes for Black women in SJC. Impact of COVID 19 Many focus group participants discussed the negative impact of the switch to telephone/online healthcare, perceiving the care as inadequate to address their needs and plagued by internet access issues, making online visits difficult or impossible for residents in a number of SJC communities. \"COVID made doctors go to video chat and this is horrible when you are trying to manage your illness and have medical needs to attend to...This makes a distance between the patients and the doctors. - Focus Group Participant 73 Income & employment Rationale: Why this is a Critical Health Need People with steady employment are l ess likely to have an income below poverty level and more likely to be healthy. Strong economic environments are supported by the presence of well -resourced schools and an adequate concentration of well -paying jobs. Childhood poverty has long -term effects. Even when economic conditions improve, childhood poverty still results in poorer long -term health outcomes. The establishment of policies that positively influence economic conditions can create sustainable improvements in the physical and mental health o f individuals and communities. Key Findings and Disparities Across San Joaquin County (based on health data) Among employed SJC residents, average yearly income ($64,000) is almost 15% less than the CA average ($75,000); average income for White SJC residents is close to the CA average, but Hispanic ($59,000), Black ($46,000), Native American ($60,000) and multiethnic ($58,000) residents earn significantly less . 53% of SJC residents (ages 20 -64) are employed, almost 30% lower than the CA average (74% employment); SJC Hispanic and Black residents are significantly less likely to be employed than White SJC residents . The poverty rate in SJC (15%) is significantly higher than the CA average (13%); Hispanic (18%), Asian (12%), Black (22%) and multiethnic residents (18%) have much higher poverty rates than White SJC residents.

Communities Disproportionately Impacted (based on Priority Neighborhood Profiles) All 14 Priority Neighborhoods have lower average income than SJC overall. Adult employment is low in the Priority Neighborhoods; 12 of the 14 have lower rates of adult employment as compared to the County average. Census Tract 1 (Stockton) has the lowest average income ($16,289) among the Priority Neighborhoods, and almost 60% of this neighborhood's population lives in poverty. What Comm unity Stakeholders Say About Income & Employment (based on key informant interviews and focus groups) Overall 2 of 29 focus groups and 3 of 10 key informants identified income and employment as a top priority in SJC. According to the key informants, income and employment challenges in SJC influence health behaviors that exacerbate chronic disease and disability, reduce food security, limit healthy food and physical activity choices, erode mental health, and impact substance use. Focus group participants stated that the cost of living in their communities has substantially increased recently, and that many of the jobs available do not offer enough compensation to offset cost increases. Key informants suggested that targeted investments and strategic multi -sector planning are needed for the econ omy to benefit all residents equally. Focus group participants want more help for unemployed residents to access jobs, through employment placement programs, job fairs and employment resources available in multiple languages. \"To be food insecure, housing insecure \u2014these are still issues in our County, in some of our low - income areas, that you may not see in other parts of the state. You can't expect a child to learn in school if they're hungry...or don't know where they're going t o sleep at night. There are so many things that are tied into a basic notion that you're going to have a place to sleep and food to eat... .\" - Community Based Organization Leader 75 Disparities Key informants reported that income and employment are unstable in SJC, especially for historically underserved populations. Several key informants identified factors contributing to income and employment challenges : elevated high-school drop -out rate, insufficient vocational training, and limited jobs that pay living wages . Key informants highlight ed the food purchasing c hallenges faced in low-income communities , where income -earners often work multiple jobs to pay rent , bills, and provide food for their families . Impact of COVID 19 Key informants stated that people of color in SJC were disproportionately affected by the economic insecurity caused by the pandemic and i nequities becam e more apparent . Focus group participants reported extensive job loss as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, impacting reside nts' ability to maintain housing, provide their families with healthy foods, and access medical care. \"COVID -19 has impacted us because me and my partner lost our jobs and housing. Due to homelessness, we are now in a shelter where we are separated due to family limitations. The pandemic stopped a lot of people from being able to do their jobs properly, putting the community on a hold \". - Focus Group Participant 76 Housing Rationale: Why this is a Critical Health Need The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development defines housing as affordable when it costs no more than 30 percent of a household's income. Higher expenditures can result in the household being unable to afford other necessities such as food, clothing, transportation, and medical care. The physical condition of a home, its neighborhood, and the cost of rent or mortgage are strongly associated with the health, well -being, educa tional achievement, and economic success of those who live inside. Homelessness is correlated with poor health: poor health can lead to homelessness and homelessness is associated with greater rates of preventable diseases, longer hospital stays, and great er risk of premature death. Key Findings and Disparities Across San Joaquin County (based on health data) When compared to CA overall, indicators of housing instability in SJC are better than state averages. However, this comparison is skewed due to coastal CA cities with some of the highest housing costs in the natio n. The homeownership rate in SJC is similar to CA overall, but for SJC residents of color, rates significantly decline. Hispanics (47%), Blacks (35%), multiethnic residents (43%), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (49%) and American Indian/Alaskan Native s (55%) are significantly less likely to own their home than White SJC residents (56%). Housing SJC Performs Significantly Worse than CA Ethnic/Racial Disparities Present in SJC Homeownership No Yes Uncrowded housing No Yes Low-income renters (Severe housing cost burden) No NA Low-income Homeowner (Severe housing cost burden) No NA Severe housing cost burden No NA Median rental cost No NA Housing Habitability No NA Housing affordability index No NA Percent of income for mortgage No NA 77 Rates of uncrowded housing are similar in SJC to the CA average, but Hispanic (87%) and Asian (88%) SJC residents experience the highest rates of crowded housing. Com munities Disproportionately Impacted (based on Priority Neighborhood Profiles) Homeownership is lower in 13 of the 14 Priority Neighborhoods when compared to the County overall. CT 1 (Stockton) has substantially lower rates of homeownership than the County (2% versus 57%) and homeownership has decreased in this Priority Neighborhood by 50 percent since 2019. What Community Stakeholders Say About Housing (based on key informant interviews and focus groups) According to several key informants, in spite of targeted federal assistance and eviction moratoriums during the COVID -19 pandemic, housing instability and homelessness have increased in SJC. Overall 34% (10 of 29) focus groups and 5 of 10 key informants identified housing as a top priority in SJC. Focus group participants and key informants linked housing challenges such as rent affordability and multigeneration or crowded households to significant anxiety, leading to mental health difficulties and interpersonal issues, sometimes escalating to domes tic violence. Key informants listed many challenges to addressing homelessness, including lack of political will; zoning and permitting impeding the construction of affordable, multi - unit housing; lack of treatment options for mental illness/substance abus e; resident opposition to the construction of affordable, supportive housing in neighborhoods; and limited funding and resources for transitional/permanent supportive housing. Disparities Focus group participants reported that there is inadequate affordabl e housing in their communities, there are long wait lists for affordable housing, and that neighborhoods with affordable housing are less safe. Impact of COVID 19 \"Housing is the reason why people are homeless. The reason why people are homeless in our county in such large numbers is because over half of citizens are rent burdened. Even if they can find and maintain stable housing, they can't afford it. They're struggling to even buy necessities like foo d.... I really cannot overemphasize how much housing is the root of a lot of our issues in the community \" - Community Based Organization Lead er \"The unhealthiest things about my community are the amount of homelessness and lack of mental health services. The large amount of homelessness makes me feel unsafe to walk or ride my bike .\" - Focus Group Participant 78 Chronic disease/HEAL Rationale: Why this is a Critical Health Need Six in ten Americans live with at least one chronic disease , which are the primary causes of poor health outcomes and death and a leading driver of health care costs . Those who have limited access to healthy foods have a higher risk of developing a chronic disease, such as obesity , heart disease, diabetes or asthma . Along with a healthy diet, physical activity is key to preventing and reducing complications from chronic diseases. This exploration of chronic disease focuses on the most common chronic conditions causing illness and death and does not include many other chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases.

The heart disease death rate in SJC (154 per 100,000 population) is 10% higher (140 per 100,000) than CA overall, and death from stroke (52 per 100,000) is 38% higher (37 per 100,000) . Black SJC residents have the highest rates of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease and are 40% more likely to be admitted for heart disease and almost 70% more likely to be admitted for stroke than White residents. Pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospitaliza tions for asthma are approximately 15% higher in SJC than the CA average. Black SJC residents with asthma visit the ED at a significantly (almost 300%) higher rate than White residents, and are hospitalized at a significantly (370%) higher rate. Diabetes i s among the top five causes of death for Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander residents. Approximately 34% of adults in SJC experience obesity, compared to only 27% within CA; American Indian/Alaskan Native SJC adults have a significantly higher rate of obesity (40%) than White adults (31%). For SJC children in grades 5, 7 and 9, the obesity rate (43%) is significantly higher than the CA average (40%). SJC Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander children have the highest obesity rate -- over 50% higher than S JC White children (35%); SJC Hispanic children have an obesity rate nearly 40% higher than White children. Adults in SJC have a significantly (nearly 50%) higher rate of physical inactivity than adult Californians. Over 12% of SJC residents are food insec ure, significantly higher than the CA average. SJC SNAP (food assistance) enrollment is over 60% higher than CA overall. Black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaskan Native and multiethnic (19%) SJC residents all have at least double the rate of SNAP enrollmen t compared to white SJC residents. Communities Disproportionately Impacted (based on Priority Neighborhood Profiles) Heart disease is one of the top five leading causes of death across all 14 Priority Neighborhoods. CT 33.12 (Stockton) saw a substantial i ncrease in rates of death from heart disease (160% increase) and stroke (106% increase) since 2019, and these rates are more than double the SJC average. What Community Stakeholders Say About Chronic Disease, HEAL Opportunities and Food Security (based on key informant interviews and focus groups) Overall 45% (13 of 29) focus groups and 4 of 10 key informants identified chronic disease as a top priority health need in SJC. 80 38% (11 of 29) focus groups identified HEAL opportunities as a top priority health need in SJC, and 5 of 10 key informants mentioned it. Focus group participants cited lack of accessible preventive care as contr ibuting high rates of diabetes, heart disease, obesity (adult and pediatric), asthma and cancer. Key informants linked obesity and diabetes to food insecurity and limited HEAL opportunities. Most identified poverty as the driving force behind limited HEA L opportunities, while some discussed how residents need accessible nutrition education within their communities. Key informants cited HEAL challenges: lack of access to healthy food (few grocery stores); easy access to cheap unhealthy food (fast food, liquor stores, unhealt hy food at schools and food banks); few safe places for physical activity; and little understanding of healthy lifestyle and how to prepare healthy foods. Focus group participants cited the rapidly increasing price of food as a concern, especially for high quality foods, such as fresh or organic products. Disparities Key informants stated that high chronic disease rates among low income communities are symptoms of larger societal problems, describing that residents living in poverty do not have the luxury o f time or money to prioritize physical health; stress resulting from poverty and discrimination, untreated mental illnesses, and care access issues were cited as contributing to chronic disease rates. Impact of COVID 19 Factors that limit access to healthy foods and physical activity in SJC were exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic. According to focus group participants, many residents experienced a drop in their overall health over the past 22 months, due in part to moving less because of isolating and eating more from stress, anxiety or boredom. These negative impacts were especially felt in disadvantaged and marginalize communities, including unhoused people, LGBTQ+ individuals, those living in poverty, and those living in rural areas. \"If I don't really have a way to get to an actual grocery store where I can buy better, healthier foods, and if my income is limited, then it's cheaper to buy junk food. Depending on your socioeconomics, not having access to healthier food and the costs associated with making healthier food choices is an indirect contributor to diabet es\" - Community Based Organization Leader \"...[I]t makes a difference to live in highly industrial neighborhoods that are surrounded by freeways. Air quality and noise make it difficult to be physically or mentally healthy there. There is little access to healthy, affordable foods on the South and East sides of Stockton, especially for those with mobility and transportation issues. Many of the spaces that have been created for physical activity (like parks and walking paths) don't feel safe .\" - Focus Group Participant 81 Communit y safety Rationale: Why this is a Critical Health Need Safe communities promote community cohesion, economic development, and opportunities to be active while reducing untimely deaths and serious injuries. Crime, violence, and intentional injury are rela ted to poorer physical and mental health outcomes for victims, perpetrators, and the community at large. Communities that have been systematically marginalized experience higher rates of violence. Children and adolescents exposed to violence are at risk fo r poor long - term behavioral and mental health outcomes. In addition, the physical and mental health of youth of color \u2014particularly males \u2014is disproportionately affected by juvenile arrests and incarceration related to policing practices. Motor vehicle crash es, pedestrian accidents and falls are common causes of unintended injuries, lifelong disability, and death. Key Findings and Disparities Across San Joaquin County (based on health data) The rates for deaths caused by injuries and motor vehicle crashes in are significantly worse in SJC than the CA average, with Black SJC residents experiencing significant disparities; the injury death rate is 35% higher for Black residents compared to White residents and motor vehicle fatalities are 59% higher fo r Black residents than White residents. Pedestrian deaths for Black SJC residents are over twice the rate for White residents. The rate of violent crimes in SJC (788 per 100,000 population) is almost 80% higher than CA overall (439 per 100,000). Community safety SJC Performs Significantly Worse than CA Ethnic/Racial Disparities Present in SJC Injury deaths Yes Yes Motor vehicle crash deaths Yes Yes Pedestrian accident deaths Yes Yes Violent crimes Yes NA Premature death (YPLL) Yes NA 82 SJC has a significantly higher rate of premature death than CA overall; with years of potential life lost under age 75 (YPLL) 38% higher than the CA average. What Community Stakeholders Say About Community Safety (based on key informant interviews and focus groups) Overall 28% (8 of 29) focus groups identified community safety as a top priority health need in SJC and 2 out of 10 key informants mentioned it. Focus group participants discussed crime and drug use in their communities, reporting that public spaces created for physical activity (parks, sidewalks or bike paths) don't feel safe because of gang violence, homelessness, discarded drug paraphernalia, broken lights and rundown equipment. Focus groups perceived unhoused populations, mental illness, do mestic violence and neighborhood blight as increasing the likelihood of crime and violence in their communities. Disparities LGBTQ+, unhoused individuals and African American focus group participants expressed fear about personal violence while out in publ ic, and believed that law enforcement is not as present and helpful in managing crime as they should be . Focus group participants discussed the need for improved relationships between law enforcement and the community, particularly for communities of colo r and unhoused individuals. Key informants linked violence to racial/ethnic disparities, citing disproportionate impacts of violence on African American and Asian communities and pointing out that policing practices increase stress and negatively impact th e health of African American residents. \"Violence is still disproportionate to the African American communities here. Issues of policing and all of those things certainly have an impact on the health of those residents .\" - Community Based Organization Leader \"[Priority issues are] police relations with the community, ...the high rate of substance abuse in the Black community, domestic violence rates, and the spread of hate between race groups . - Focus Group Participant 83 Family and social support Rationale: Why this is a Critical Health Need The presence or absence of a strong social support network affects all aspects of life, including physical and mental wellbeing. Communities are the context in which families prosper or struggle, highlighting the importance of identifying areas of need and disparity and leveraging community resources to address them. Key Findings and Disparities Across San Joaquin County (based on health data) Almost 13% of SJC residents of all ages are living with a disability. SJC Black (13%) residents have the highest disability rates. Limited English proficiency is similar in SJC as compared to the CA average (40%); all SJC racial and ethnic groups have significantly higher rates of limited English proficiency than White and Black residents . Residents of SJC were less likely to have voted in the 2020 election than the Californians overall (63% versus 71%) . Communities Disproportionately Impacted (based on Priority Neighborhood Profiles) Eight of the 14 Priority Neighborhoods have lower rates of two -parent households when compared to the County overall. Family and social support SJC Performs Significantly Worse than CA Ethnic/Racial Disparities Present in SJC Disability Population (all ages) Yes NA Disability Population (ages <65 years) Yes Yes Limited English proficiency No Yes Seniors living alone (ages 65+ years) No NA Two parent households No NA Voting in 2020 Yes NA Nine of the 14 Priority Neighborhoods have higher teen birth rates (mothers aged 15 -19) than the County overall. 84 What Community Stakeholders Say About Family and Social Support (based on key informant interviews and focus groups) Overall 52% (15 of 29) of focus groups identified family and social suppor t as a top priority in SJC, and 4 of 10 key informants mentioned it. Focus group participants perceived that social connections are integral to creating and sustaining healthy communities with large support networks. Several focus group participants expressed a need for affordable childcare and afterschool programs. Disparities One key informant discussed the negative impact of diminished social support for older adults, many of whom suffer from isolation, loneliness, and depression, and have challenges accessing virtual services and support. Impact of COVID 19 Focus group participants expressed concern about the lasting impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic on families; pandemic related stress may have increased substance use, abuse and/or domestic violence, exposing children to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) that have long term health and well being impacts. \"We've gone through 20 months of COVID with decreased socialization and loneliness. First line of seeking help differs for different cultures. We may pick up th e phone and dial 911, or dial the crisis line and talk to someone, but in other cultures, that first line may be a religious leader or maybe a community member, someone they trust. The lack of socialization also increases the lack of contact with their pri mary source of support .\" - Community Based Organization Leader \"Health will be lacking where community connection is lacking .\" - Focus Group Participant 85 Education Rationale: Why this is a Critical Health Need The link between education and health is well known \u2014those with higher levels of education are more likely to be healthier and live longer. Pre -school education is positively associated with readiness for and success in school, as well as long - term economic benefits for individuals and society, including greater educational attainment, higher income, and lower engagement in delinquency and crime. Individuals with at least a hig h school diploma do better on a number of measures, including income, health outcomes, life satisfaction, and self -esteem. Wealth among families in which the head of household has a high school diploma is 10 times higher than that of families in which the head of household didn't complete high school. Moreover, the majority of jobs in the U.S. require education beyond high school. Disruptions in schooling due to the COVID -19 pandemic particularly affected Black and Hispanic students and those from low -incom e households, who suffered the steepest setbacks in learning and achievement. Key Findings and Disparities Across San Joaquin County (based on health data) The percentage of children enrolled in preschool in SJC (44%) is significantly lower than the CA average (50%) . Students in SJC have significantly lower rates of proficiency in math (31%) and reading (43%) than students across CA (40% and 51%, respectively) and SJC Hispanic, Black, and multiethnic students have significantly lower proficiency in ma th and reading compared to White SJC students. The on -time high school graduation rate for SJC students (80%) is significantly lower than the CA average (84%); SJC Black students have a significantly lower rate of on -time graduation (71%) than White high schoolers (81%) . Only 8% of SJC Hispanic adults have completed a college education, 67% lower than SJC White adults.

In CT 6 (Stockton), the percentage of children enrolled in preschool has decreased by over 50% since 2019, and is only one -third that of the County overall. The percentage of adults with a Bachelor's degree or higher has decreased by over 50 percent in CT 6 since 2019. What Community Stakeholders Say About Education (based on key informant interviews and focus groups) Overall 2 of 29 focus groups identified education as a top priority health need in SJC, and 5 out of 10 key informants mentioned it. Focus group participants expressed concern about s tress students experience at schools, perceiving that schools have insufficient resources to meet mental health needs of students and teachers. An additional worry was that students are bringing drugs and vape pens into school, and that safety on school ca mpuses has deteriorated. Key informants stressed the importance of addressing systemic barriers related to education to improve community health and lift families out of poverty. Key informants discussed education as intersecting with other health needs, including oral health, asthma, income and employment, and mental health. Disparities Several key informants reflected on racial/ethnic disparities in education, noting that high school dropout rates illustrate community inequities; one key in formant noted that children from impoverished families with limited access to technology or social supports face compounding challenges in school, reducing their likelihood of graduation. Impact of COVID 19 The COVID -19 pandemic negatively impacted educati on for all children, according to focus group participants. They feared that the school closures and remote learning of 2020 and 2021 will have long -lasting effects on educational and social development, especially for students in underserved, rural or vul nerable populations. \"The fact that San Joaquin County has one of the most dismal graduation rates...it all speaks to: How well are the kids? If the kids aren't doing well, then the whole economy is doomed. And the kids are doing terribly, with their mental health, with their outcomes in school .\" - Community Based Organization Leader \"Kids who live in rural areas like Banta could not easily transition to online learning because they do not have Internet . I have to take my grandkids to the library to do their homework because we do not have Internet where I live.\" - Focus Group Participant 87 Transportation Rationale: Why this is a Critical Health Need Without reliable and safe transportation, individuals struggle to meet basic needs such as earning an income, accessing health care, and securing food. Transportation infrastructure favors automobile use, which is associated with a number of adverse outcomes, including motor vehicle injuries and deaths, vehicle ownership expenses, and greenhouse gas emissions (which are a risk factor for heart disease, stroke, asthma, a nd cancer.) For households without a vehicle - including many low -income individuals and people of color - walking, biking and using public transportation provides a critical link to employment, access to essential services, promotes exercise and supports social cohesion. Key Findings and Disparities Across San Joaquin County (based on health data) 82% of SJC workers drive alone to work, significantly higher than the CA average (78%). Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander workers in SJC drive alone to work significantly more often than White workers. More SJC workers drive alone with long commutes (18%) than CA workers overall (11%). Retail density is significantly lower in SJC than CA overall. When stores and restaurants are spread out over a wider geograp hic area, barriers related to transportation can be more pronounced. Transportation SJC Performs Significantly Worse than CA Ethnic/Racial Disparities Present in SJC Workers driving alone to work Yes Yes Workers driving alone with long commutes Yes NA Workers commuting by transit, biking or walking (Active Commuting) Yes NA Retail density Yes NA Automobile Access No NA 88 Communities Disproportionately Impacted (based on Priority Neighborhood Profiles) Ten of the 14 Priority Neighborhoods have lower access to automobiles when compared to the County. CT 1 (Stockton) has markedly low automobile access when compared to the County (43% vs. 94%), presenting challenges accessing employment, health care, education, grocery stores, and more. What Community Stakeholders Say Abou t Transportation (based on key informant interviews and focus groups) One key inform ant noted that the COVID -19 pandemic made public transportation feel less accessible and less safe. Overall 1 of the 29 focus groups identified transportation as a top priority in SJC, and 6 of 10 key informants mentioned this need. Focus group participants and key informants agreed that SJC residents experience challenges related to transportation, substantially impacting decisions related to employment, healthcare, housing and nutrition, and potentially leading to poor physical and mental health. Focus group participants and key inf ormants suggested that affordable or free transportation be available to residents needing it for medical services. Disparities Many rural or low -resource communities do not have stores or restaurants that offer fresh produce or healthy products, leaving fewer options for those without accessible, affordable transportation . The transportation infrastructure in SJC has created areas of concentrated pollution; focus group participants stated that many highly trafficked neighborhoods have poor air quality an d noise concerns that discourage outdoor physical activity. A number of focus group participants requested safer and more equitable public transportation, noting the lack of bus routes and bus stops in many neighborhoods. Impact of COVID 19 \"As we look at areas of low - income housing, there are not a lot of doctors. So in terms of access to care, then, we're always coming back to transportation issues. Transportation issues impact access to care. We go back to transportation when people don't have that ready access or because they're working in a low paying job where they are hourly and then don't have access to sick leave. Everything stems from the issues of poverty.\" - Community Based Organization Leader \"There is little access to healthy, affordable foods on the South and East sides of Stockton, especially for those with mobility and transportation iss ues.\" - Focus Group Participant 89 VIV.

Indicators (either percentage of county population or a rate per designated number of residents) are presented across 15 health need categories. Definitions for each indicator and associated data source are provided in Appendix A. Table 1 below notes statistically significant differences for 1) indicators for which the county performs markedly worse than California averages and 2) indicators for which ethnic disparities are present within the county.

A. Why are these the top priorities? ( An issue can be a top priority because it impacts lots of people in the County, impacts vulnerable populations such as kids or older adults, costs the County lots of money, or impacts County resident's ability to have a high quality of life.) B.

Introductory Question Let's start by introducing ourselves. Tell us your first name. Community Health We would like to discuss what is healthy and not so healthy about your community. 116 1. Think about how your community is right now. What is healthy about your community? Things that make a community healthy can include the environment (sidewalks, clean streets, parks), social factors (e.g., feeling safe, access to mental health services), opportunities for healthy behaviors (e.g., places to buy healthy food, places to exercise) community services and events (e.g., low cost o r free activities for families), and health care (e.g., access to health care services) 2. What makes it difficult to be healthy in your community? For example, lack of access to health services, few grocery stores with healthy, affordable food, unsafe neighborhoods, lack of access to transportation, lots of pollution in the air, no safe places to be active, no affordable dental care Identifying priority health issues/Successful strategies to address health issues 3. Thinking about what does or does not make your community healthy, what do you think is the most important health issue facing your community? A health issue can be a disease like heart disease or cancer, or something that causes poor health like unhealthy food or drug abuse, or something that affects overall wellbeing like mental health, violence or access to care. We know you might have ideas about many important health issues, bu t try to limit your answer to identify the most important health issue. 4. Thinking about the health issue you identified as most important, what are the top one or two things that could be done to fix this issue? Some examples could be improvements to your community (like fixing sidewalks so it is easier to walk or starting farmers markets where you can get fruits and vegetables) or changes to clinic services (like health and mental health services available at places you usually go, services availab le in your preferred language). 5. Is there anything about the most important health issues you mentioned that changed because of the COVID -19 pandemic? If so, in what ways did COVID change these important health issues? Final Question 6. We're just about ready to wrap up. Is there anything else you feel is important for us to know about health in your community? Thank you for your participation! 117 Appendix F: Annotated Bibliography of San Joaquin County Reports and Assessments Document Title Sponsoring Organization/ Author Link to report Overview Key Findings First 5 San Joaquin - Characteristics of Families Served First 5 San Joaquin https://www.sjcki ds.org Describes population served and programming provided to families with children 0-5 served by First 5 San Joaquin in 2020 - 2021. 90% of the population served come from ethnic/racial groups that are historically underserved.

There was a 50%+ increase in caregiv ers telling/reading stories to their children. 824 referrals for support services were completed; the most common referral was for housing support. The COVID -19 pandemic led to difficulty with virtual learning and technological issues, limited social oppor tunities, income and basic needs issues and illness. Opportunities to strengthen the program include: o Creative outreach solutions o Training for contractor agencies and parents o Building data capacity. 119 First 5 San Joaquin - Special Needs Newsletter First 5 San Joaquin Special Needs programs during 2019 -2020 created robust screening and referral training for contractors to detect early signs of children with special needs. 3,000 children were screened for a potential developmental delay. The racial/ethnic breakdown of children screened was: 46% Hispanic, 16% White, 13% Multi racial, 13% Black. One-on-one trainings were implemented to increase the ability for F5SJcontractors to use the Ages and Stages Questionnaire to screen for developmental delay and understand the referral process. 13% of screened children were referred to an agency or school district. Challenges in accessing special needs services include: o Not knowing the support/services available o Language barriers o Not wanting a referral o Long wait times COVID -19 challenges with special needs services: o Educational delays wi th virtual learning o Insufficient learning supplies at home o Limited socialization of children o Staff difficulty identifying developmental delays First 5 San Joaquin - Coordination between First 5 San Joaquin's WORKs programs First 5 San Joaquin https://www.sjcki ds.org First 5 San Joaquin funds three programs that served 479 families who qualitied for CalWORKs in 2019 - 2020. .

The 2019 Point in Time Count, found 2,969 unhoused individuals in San Joaquin County, the majority of which are male (63%) and white (65%) though there is representation from Hispanic (28%) and Black (25%) populations. The most common ailments that unhoused residents sought emergency department care for included: skin or wound treatment, substance abuse, mental health crisis or musculoskeletal problem. San Joaquin County has limited infrastructures for coordinated post - discharge care for the unhoused. This is due to insufficient funding, lack of a committee on mental/behavioral health and lack of technology to facilitate communication. Recommendations for improving health outcomes for the unhoused population include: o Utilizing Integrated Information technology system for healthcare and community organizations o Implementing the Integrated Healthcare System Framework to facilitate coordinated care o Advocating for supportive housing Healthcare Improvement in Stockton, California: Collaboration, Capacity - Building and Medicaid Expansion The Commonweal th Fund https://www.com monwealthfund.o rg/ publications/case - study/2017/jul/he alth-care- improvement - stockton - california - collaboration - capacity Report of San Joaquin County and Stockton increase in health ranking among 306 hospital referral regions in the United States from 156 in 2012 to 93 in 2017.

North San Joaquin Valley: Regional Discovery Session San Joaquin Council of Governments , City of Merced, The Community Foundation of San Joaquin, Stanislaus Community Foundation, University of the Pacific https://www.sjcog .org Proceedings from a July 2020 convening of Stanislaus, Merced and San Joaquin Counties to understand the potential benefits of a regional partnership to coordinate priorities and increase economic prosperity. The 3 County Region could benefit from shared approaches due to economic similarities. Similarities among the 3 Counties include: o Commuting patterns to the Bay Area o Higher population growth than Bay Area and California o Higher annual job growth than CA average since 2008 recession o Many occupations with low wages ( e.g., agriculture, service industry ) 123 Bike, Pedestrian, Safe Routes to School and Smart Growth Programs San Joa quin Council of Governments https://www.sjcog .org/377/Bike - Pedestrian -SRtS - Smart -Growth - Incent The San Joaquin County Master Plan (2017 - 2021) increases safe and active commuting to and from school by creating safer walking and biking paths through a ser ies of local grants called Smart Growth Incentives. Measure K program provides funding after a 2006 vote among San Joaquin voters. Smart Growth Incentives were made available for local jurisdiction applications for: walking community projects, ameliorating roads and transit amenities, encouraging alternate forms of transportation As of 2018, $19.63 million were distributed to 21 projects in the San Joaquin Valley. Projects include: o Street and sidewalk improvements o Bike lane construction or improvements o Rapid Flash Beacons o Trail improvements South Stockton Community Mobility Assessment San Joaquin Council of Governments https://www.sjcog .org/DocumentCe nter/View/ 5437/23233_Sout hStockton_Mobilit y Assessment_FIN AL-1?bidId= Community mobility assessment (June 2020) conducted to address equity in the region through active transportation, including commuting via biking and walking. South Stockton has more residents in poverty, more residents of color, less English proficiency, more overburdened renters and more zero-vehicle households than Stockton. These factors make South Stockton residents more likely to use active transportation. Factors important to South Stockton residents: o Personal safety and security o Street lighting o Road conditions South Stockton barriers to safe active transportation include: o Sidewalks are uneven with tripping hazards o Limited crosswalks or bike lanes o Limited placemaking (I.e., trees, lighting, shade) o Heavy traffic makes active commuting less desirable o r more dangerous Recommendations: o Implement short -term solutions (bike lanes, traffic calming, encourage biking at local schools) o Invest in longer -term opportunities (E.g. coordinating with Caltrans and Union Pacific to facilitate pedestrian/bike crossings ) o Improve transportation system issues (pedestrian infrastructure with sidewalks, public transit improvements) 124 Sustainable Communities Strategy Implementation Study San Joaquin Council of Governments https://www.sjcog .org/DocumentCe nter/View/ 5436/23233_SCS _Implementation _Study_F INAL?bidId= June 2020 study on the impacts of the 2017 Regional Transportation Plan in San Joaquin County.
