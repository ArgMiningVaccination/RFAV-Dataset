A description of the points used and a discussion of the western and eastern medicine philosophy behind the points will follow. There will be a discussion of how it is being used in programs around the country and how it can be used to help with opiate withdrawal, with and without MAT, and with co-occurring disorders to help calm anxiety and improve sleep.
