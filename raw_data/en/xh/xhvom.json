Deloitte has provided a quote for the migration of the Board's existing database to a cloud -based model. The plan requires ongoing software l icensing costs or per user cost. The estimated cost for this software licensing of BasicGov and Salesforce would be $25,311. The Board is asking for an increase in the 8581 expenditures category of $25,311 to cover ongoing software licensing costs for this online cloud -based model. (This Salesforce database is a part of the Board's ASET Strategic Plan as well as part of the Governor's Goal Council 5 Online Services Recommendation Plans) The Board plans to onboard and w ork with other agencies to reduce the cost of data migration by Deloitte. Funding Issue: Security Guard Services (ADSPO18 -00008084) Priority -2 In December of 2017, the Board relocated into the 1740 West Adams building on the capitol mall with 26 other state agencies. The Board budget reflects and reducing in the cost of private rental space for FY 19 and FY20. Included in the 1740 building is sha red building Wi -Fi, conference rooms, conference room phones, and building security. These items are a shared cost between the agencies located inside 1740. In August of 2018, a new Security Services contract was put in place by SPO. This new contract refle cted an increase in the cost of the shared Security Services utilized by the building. The increase d cost is shared with the building as a whole , and the Board of Chiropractic Examiners portion is projected to be approximately $1,600 above the estimate provi ded in FY2018. It is for this reason that the Board asks for an additional $1,600 to the Board appropriation to pay our fair share of the utilized security services in FY2020. Funding Issue: Shared Services Personnel (ADOA & CSB) Priority -3 In December of 2017, the Board relocated into the 1740 West Adams building on the capitol mall with 26 other state agencies. The Board budget reflects and reduci ng in the cost of private rental space for FY 19 and FY20. The modern layout of the 1740 building allows for a shared administrative assistant position to provide coverage for the teller window in the lobby. 21 agencies will be utilizing the shared teller window , and the Central Services Bur eau (a division of ADOA) will be providing the administrative assistan t and then will be reimbursed from the Board's funds. This administrative assistan t will be a shared cost between the 21 agencies located inside 1740 that are sharing the single window . The increase d cost is shared with the building as a whole , and the Board of Chiropractic Examiners portion is projected to be approximately $1,900 and is a new expense not provided in FY2018 . It is for this reason that the Board asks for an additional $1,900 to the Board appropriation to pay for our share of the utilized administrative assistant services in FY2020. ADOA FY 2019 BUDGET ISSUE S u m m a r y : The Arizona Department of Administration requests an increase from the Special Services Fund in the GAO Division of $186,598 to fund AD4208. P r o g r a m : General Accounting Office/Office of the Controller/Central Services Bureau Description of issue and how recommending the agency's request furthers the agency's mandates : The Central Services Bureau (CSB) will be relocating to the 1740 West Adams Street building along with 27 other boards, commissions, and agencies. In an effort to consolidate core building costs, it has been proposed that CSB will be billed for 3 armed guards, building WIFI, common area phones, common area data center charges, and efax services. CSB will also provide an administrative position located in the building lobby. CSB is asking for an appropriation increase for consolidated building costs of $150,889 and 1-FTE $35,709. Total request $186,598. Proposal : This shared services model will enable vendors to have one point of contact within the building which will enable the state to respond faster. Vendors will also be able to provide a single invoice for service, rather than one for each agency in the building. This will drive efficiencies not only for the vendor, but also for the state. The proposed shared costs are: Shared Cost Annualized FY2020 Security Guards (Armed) 111,478 191,630* Building-Wide Wi-Fi 9,118 9,118 Common Room 10,305 Common Room Network 7,988 7,988 eFax Solution 12,000 12,000 Total $ 150,889 $ 231,041 * In August of 2018 a new Statewide contract for Security Guard Services (ADSPO18-00008084) went into effect for an increased cost for the planned armed security officers. The increases is reflected in FY2020. By sharing an administrative assistant position in the lobby, each agency will not require its own FTE. The current building model is such that constituents will not have access to floors 2-4. All board rooms will be located on the first floor, as well as windows that will serve as the first point of contact for constituents. Several of the larger agencies will have a dedicated window using current FTEs, however approximately 20 of the smaller agencies will need CSB assistance to staff an FTE on the first floor to assist constituents and stakeholders. CSB will bill the agencies for actual expenditures related to the shared building costs. Cost allocation for the shared building costs will be based on each agency's square footage in the buildings space allocation plan as detailed below. The costs for the shared administrative assistant position in the lobby will be allocated to the participating agencies as a percentage of their total FTE count as detailed below. Agency/Board/Commission Square Foot Allocation % Occupancy FY 19 Dollar Allocation display the effects of the proposal: Current Performance Measures for Issue: (without proposed change) Performance Measure Type FY 16 Actual FY 17 Actual FY 18 Expected FY 19 Expected FY 20 Expected Customer satisfaction with CSB QL N/A N/A 6.5 6.5 6.5 Expected Performance Measures for Issue: (with proposed change) Performance Measure Type FY 16 Actual FY 17 Actual FY 18 Expected FY 19 Expected FY 20 Expected Customer satisfaction with CSB QL N/A N/A 6.5 6.5 6.5 Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection : The alternative would be for each agency to contract individually with vendors for services. The shared constituent window that CSB will staff, could be replaced by a phone and list, where the constituent could call up to the agency, and have the agency come down and respond as needed. This does not however align with the states approach of deciding faster, responding faster, resolving faster, or saving taxpayer dollars. Impact of not funding this fiscal year : CSB would not be able to provide the agencies with the level of service that is required or needed to drive efficiencies in the 1740 building. Statutory reference : Although there is no statutory or legal mandate that requires this be the course of action, there is statutory authority to use the Special Services revolving fund in this manner in A.R.S. \u00a7 35-193.02. Equipment to be purchased, if applicable : None Classification of new positions - 1 - FTE, Administrative Assistant II, Grade 15, Job code AUN06609, Salary $25,507, ERE $10,202 (calculated at 40%). Total for FTE is $35,709. Cost allocation for Administrative Assistant II will be based on each participating agency's current FTE count (not all agencies will be using the shared window: the Medical Board, Board of Nursing, and Cosmetology Board will each service their own windows).

PageAgency 5-Year Plan The Board of Chiropractic Examin ers has made several savings, b oth one time and ongoing, to red uce expenditures from the Chiro practic Examiners Board Fund. While the Board continues to make efficiencies ever ywhere possible there are costs that continue to rise outside o f the control of the Board. It is for this reason that the Board submitted an Omnibu s Bill in the 2015 Legislative Session which included language authorizing the Board to adjust fees on an annual basis. T hrough this legislation the B oard obtained the ability to adjust some licensure fees in mode st amounts to ensure that the Board can begin each fiscal year with a healthy fund balanc e. The Board is considering the first modification to its fees in nearly 20 years. As previously stated the Fee increase will occur in FY18 and the Board received an increase in revenue as expected.Issue 1 Secure adequate revenues to addre ss the Board's declining fund balance. Current licensure and renewal fees have not been adjusted since 2002. Despite efforts to minimize expenditures; declining num bers of new applicants as well license renewals had made it impossible to collect revenues in excess of expenditures since FY 2007. Th e Board addressed changes and has worked to increase the licensing base by providing an easier path to licensure here in Arizona. The changes the Board made in FY14 and FY 15 has reflected and increasing t rend in the licensing base. Curre ntly, due to the expanded grow th of Arizona in FY 15 and FY 16, the Board is seeing an increase in the numbers of Chiropractic Phy sicains returning to practice i n Arizona. The Board has adjusted its fees and the change in fees will pro vide increased revenue in FY19.Description: Solutions: The Board made changes to the pe rsonnel structure, separating t he duties of the Deputy Director from that of the Investigator, allowing the Investigator to focus his/her fu ll attention to the receipt, an alysis, presentation and processing of all complaints through f inal adjudication. The Board approved the establishm ent of an Interagency Service Agreement with the Attorney Gener al's office to provide for the appointment of a dedicated Assistant Attorney Gen eral to represent the Board, pr event the risk of interrupted ser vices, and enhance the timely completion of Formal Interviews and Formal Hearings. The Board is continuing to reduce the amount of time involved i n a case by streamlining the com plaint process and having a qua lified and trained investigator review and process complaints. The Board has conducted a AZLEAN process on the complaint proce ss and throught the use of new tools like Google Suite has stre amline the initial complaints process. FY 19 and FY20 should see a reduced timefra me for complaints processing.Issue 2 Improve the timelines to complete investigations, formal interv iews and formal hearings. While FY2014 resulted in the Board's ab ility to increase the percentage of complaints resolved within 180 days of receipt with no hearing required as well as the average number of months to resolve adm inistrative hearings; the Auditor General's Office recommends t hat cases be concluded within 180 days.Description: Solutions: The Board is engaging with Deloitte who is on the statewide con tract for providing an online cloud-based database. Deloitte ha s provided a quote for the migration of the Board's existing database to a cloud-based model. The plan requires ongoin g software licensing costs or p er user cost. The estimated cost for this software licensing of BasicGov and Sale sforce would be $25,311. The Board is asking for an increase in the 8581 expenditures category of $25,311 to cover ongoing software licensing costs f or this online cloud-based model. (This Salesforce database is a part of the Board's ASET Strategic Plan as well as part of the Governor's Goal Coun cil 5 Online Services Recommendation Plans) The Board plans to onboard and work with other agencies to reduce the cost of data migration by Del oitte.Issue 3 Update information technology to ensure capable tracking of lic ensure and complaint activities. The Board's previous Access data base had been in use for over 1 0 years and did not possess adequate capabilities for the integ ration and tracking of all th e above-referenced processes. There was concern the system would have be gun to disintegrate or lose cri tical data.Description: Solutions: Board staff established an onlin e exam for out of state applica nts through a secure testing pro cess. In FY 18 the Board has mo ved to the entirely online jurisprudence examination. Staff has recieved ver y positive fee dback regarding the online exam. Staff continues to find ways t o increase the access to online services for the licensees and applicants.Issue 4 Provide access to the Board's jurisprudence examination, comple tion of which is required for licensure. Previously applicants for licensure in Arizona were required to be physically present at the Board's office in order to take t he required exam. Many applicants do not reside in Arizona and must make t ravel arrangements in order to complete this step of the licens ure process.Description: Solutions: The Board has worked with ADOA ASET and Dept. of Treasury to im plament an online credit card payment portal. The portal opened in August of 2018. The Board has began acceptin g credit card payments and ex pects that the number of payments will increase due to increase d workflow and time saving.Issue 5 Establish the capability of accepting licensure and payment for services in electronic formats. The Board previously only accepted hard copy applications for renewal and payments in the fo rm of check or money order.
