Introduction According to the homeopathic model, the primary cause of diseases is an imbalance of the organic vital force, whilst the return to health status occurs by restoring the integrity ofthis vital principle. Homeopathy expands understanding of the health-disease process and also attributes the manifes- tation of chronic diseases to the action of chronic miasms, afundamental cause and main obstacle to the natural resolu- tion of these diseases.According to the biomedical model, the vital functions of the physical body are controlled by biochemical informa-tion contained in the DNA or genome (exome plus epi- genome), with the primary cause of diseases being located in the genes encoding physiological disorders that causedisease. In turn, these disease-promoting gene expressions are modulated by the epigenome, a portion of the non- coding protein DNA that regulates the coding portion(exome) and is a fundamental cause for the manifestation of chronic diseases in general.Keywords homeopathy vitalism genetics telomere telomerase biomarkerAbstract Background Philosophical -scienti c correlations described in previous studies sug- g e s tt h a tt h eg e n o m ec a nb et h eb i o l o g i c a lr e p resentation of the vital force, whilst the disease-promoting epigenetic alterations would be the biological representation of thechronic miasmas. In this study, we expand the functional correlation between vital force and chromosomes, describing the mechanism of action of the telomere - telomerase complex in the context of physiological balance.Aims The aim of the work is to study the role of the telomere -telomerase complex in cell vitality, biological aging, and the health-disease process, with the goal of proposingthe use of telomere length as a biomarker of the vital force state and the effectivenessof homeopathic treatment.Results Similar to the vital force, telomere length and telomerase enzyme activity play an important role in maintaining cellular vitality, biological longevity, and physiological homeostasis. Telomere shortening functions as a biomarker of vital imbalance and is associated with numerous diseases and health disorders. On the otherhand, health-promotion practices neutralize the pathological shortening of thetelomeres, acting therapeutically in diseases or age-dependent health disorders.Conclusions As a hypothetical biomarker of the vital force state, an intra-individual analysis of the mean leukocyte telomere length before, during, and after homeopathictreatment can be used as a biomarker of therapeutic effectiveness. received November 3, 2020accepted after revision December 3, 2020 published onlineMay 16, 2021DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0041-1726008.ISSN 1475-4916.\u00a9 2021.

Further based on these assumptions, we have also been proposing the isopathic use of auto-sarcode of DNA (auto-isotherapicof DNA) as a probableanti-miasmatichomeopathic medicine and modulator of gene expression. 1,2 Reiterating these philosophical -scienti c correlations, numerous studies on telomeres (the terminal portion of chromosomes) indicate its role as a biomarker of cellular vitality, biological aging, and the health -disease process. In view of this evidence, telomere length (TL) could be clinically and experimentally used as a hypothetical biomarker of the organic vital force state, both in the disease-promoting vitalimbalance and in the vital rebalancing resulting from thera- peutic interventions. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms of action of telomeres and the telomerase enzyme in the integrity of chromosomes, in the vitality or senescence of cells, in the longevity or aging of the body, and in the healthy or diseasestate. Based on the in fluence of health promotion treatments and practices on telomeric homeostasis, we are suggesting using TL as a possible biological parameter to assess the organic vitalforce state and the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment. Aims The objective of this article is to study the mechanism ofaction of telomeres and the telomerase enzyme in theintegrity of chromosomes, in cellular vitality, in biological aging, and in the health -disease process, proposing to use TL as a biomarker of the organic vital force state and the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment in order to expand the philosophical -scienti c correlations of homeopathic vitalism with modern genetics, as widely discussed in previ- ous studies. 1,2 Cause of Diseases According to the Homeopathic Model Imbalance of Vital Force As a Primary Cause of Diseases According to the Hahnemannian vitalist philosophical concept,3,4the homeopathic vital force medicatrix naturae, manifesting itself automati- cally and instinctively, and being subject to the laws of thephysical body. The vital force has the property to maintain life and the balance of sensations and physiological functions (homeostasis) but loses this capacity with aging or the onsetof a disease process. In understanding the health -disease process according to the homeopathic model, the primary cause of the body 's diseases is located in the imbalance or dystonia of the organic vital force as a result of the dynamic in fluence of disease- promoting agents. On the other hand, healing and a return tohealth occur by restoring the integrity of the vital principle (Organon der Heilkunst , 6th ed., paragraphs 11, 12). 5 In view of its dynamic and non-material nature, the vital force is in fluenced by subtle manifestations of the mind and the psyche such as thoughts, emotions and feelings ( Organon , paragraphs 213 -216).5The vital principle is also weakened by an inadequate lifestyle (sedentary, alcohol and drugs, unbal- anced diet, intellectual and sexual excesses, among others),and is restored by health-promotion practices (physical exer- cise, alcohol and drug abstinence, adequate diet and mental distraction, among others) ( Organon , paragraphs 260 -262). 5 In view of its similar nature, the dynamized or potentized homeopathic medicine is able to restore vital harmony (Organon , paragraph 16),5provided that it is used according to the principle of therapeutic similarity, awakening a cura- tive vital reaction. According to homeopathic vitalist anthropology,6the irra- tional vital force differs in nature and species from the intelli- gent spirit, which is de ned as an autonomous entity and separate from the inseparable physical-vital unit. Hahnemanndid not deepen his understanding of the intimate nature or essence of the organic vital force, although he considered it the primary cause (prima causa morbi) of diseases ( Organon , paragraphs 6 -13). 5 The homeopathic vitalist model presents a set of concepts, entities and properties that are similar to other medical andphilosophical concepts, 4,6such as traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Indian medicine, and anthroposophical medicine. Chronic Miasms As a Fundamental Cause of Diseases In the work The Chronic Diseases, their Peculiar Nature, and their Homeopathic Cure ,7Hahnemann includes the in fluence of three chronic and dynamic miasmas in the etiopatho- genesis of chronic diseases (psora, sycosis and syphilis) , imputing the main obstacle to the cure of these diseases to them. He attaches special importance to psora (the Itch disease), which he considered to be \"the oldest and most Hydra-headed of all the chronic miasmatic diseases \"and from which \"at least seven-eighths of all the chronic mala- dies \"originate ( The Chronic Diseases ,p p .7 - 1 3 ) .7 Reiterating what was previously described, Hahnemann describes a series ofaspects,in the chapter \"Cure of the Chronic Diseases \", sub-section \"Psora \", that weaken the organic vital force (such as inadequate lifestyle and diet, temperature change, lack of physical activity or excess of mental activity, sexual excesses, trauma, acute infectious diseases, use of drugsand alcohol, smoking, inappropriate medicines and treat- ments, emotional and psychic disorders) and \"can bring the psora latent and slumbering to break out into open chronicdiseases \"(The Chronic Diseases , pp. 107 -114). same chapter, sub-section \"The Medicines \",7 Hahnemann indicates that the previous use of speci c homeopathic medicines (anti-miasmatics) would act on these \"too inveterate and more deep-seated \"chronic diseases before administering the homeopathic medicineschosen according to the totality of symptoms characteristic of the classic approach in order to be successful to cure and end these diseases to their fullest extent.

Teixeira 284 Maintaining the conceptual coherence, Hahnemann describes these same characteristics and properties of chron-ic miasms in Organon (Introduction; 5denominating psora as\"the only real funda- mental cause and producer of all forms of disease \"or\"causam morborum chronicum \". The Cause of Diseases According to the Biomedical Model According to the biomedical model, the body 'sv i t a lf u n c t i o n s are essentially controlled by biochemical information con- tained in the DNA of the cells (set of nucleotide sequences), which transmits these characteristics to future generationsand undergoes mutations that allow evolutionary adapta- tions in the face of various environmental factors. This genetic material or cellular genome is contained in highly organized nuclear structures called chromosomes formed by extremely long DNA molecules that contain several genes and other nucleotide sequences with speci c functions, being closely related to gender determination and genetic inheritance. In eukaryotic beings, somatic cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 chromosomes), while sex cellsor gametes have only one copy of each chromosome (23 chromosomes). The genome is composed of the exome (the portion of DNA encoding proteins necessary for maintaining and con- trolling physiological functions) and the epigenome (the portion of non-coding DNA that regulates the expressionof the encoding genes). In turn, physiological imbalances and most chronic diseases manifest as a direct re flection of changes in the patterns of this gene expression. Epigenetic alterations (DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and micro-RNAs, among others) make up a set of enzyme-mediated chemical processes, which represent an additional mechanism for regulating gene expression at the transcriptional level, shaping genome functioning and thephenotypic pro le through the activation or deactivation of genes, without any change in the nucleotide sequence of the genetic code. 8,9 The individual epigenome is transmitted to future gener- ations to a c epigenetic code (transgenera- descendant 's health -disease process.10,11This epigenotype functions as highly interconnected regulatory networks (complex systems of self-organization), and gives the genome instructions forwhen and where genes should be expressed. In addition to being reversible, these epigenetic altera- tions can be expressed in the genome of individuals at anyage, as long as they come into contact with internal and/or external etiopathogenic stimuli (for example, habits and inadequate lifestyle, pollution and irradiation, drugs andhormones, in flammation, stress and emotions), promoting the activation or silencing of genes responsible for manifest- ing diseases. 8,11-16 Therefore, the genome (exome plus epigenome) must be considered as the primary cause of diseases in general, and the speci c aspects related to each individual case of illnessare represented in the disease-promoting epigenetic alter- ations (fundamental cause of chronic diseases). Philosophical -Scienti cC o r r e l a t i o n s between Vital Force and Genome and between Chronic Miasms and Epigenetic Alterations In correlating the characteristics of the organic vital force with those of the genome, we highlight analogies between them, such as: the vital force and the genome are thefundamental substrates for the emergence and maintenance of life (vitality of living beings); the vital principle is respon- sible for maintaining the balance of the body 's sensations and functions, just as the genome stores the biochemical infor- mation which will produce the proteins responsible for maintaining vital processes and developing organisms; dis-eases generally occur due to dystonia of the vital principle, as well as genomic changes which promote disease (the prima- ry cause of diseases); the vital force and the genome are bothaffected by the in fluences of the same external and internal etiopathogenic factors, among others. 2 Furthermore, in correlating the characteristics of chronic miasms with those of epigenetic alterations, we highlight analogies between them, such as: most chronic diseases have a miasmatic (psora) or epigenetic cause which predisposes their appearance and prevents their natural resolution (fundamental cause of chronic diseases); the latency or manifestation of psora and the silencing or activation of disease-promoting genes aretriggered by similar etiopathogenic factors; both and disease-promoting epigenetic alterations are transmis- sible to future generations, and can be reversed by anti-miasmatic drugs or epigenetic treatments, respectively. 1 Since 1997, Khuda-Bukhsh17-19and other research- ers20,21defend the hypothesis that homeopathic medicines act in the genome, modulating disease-promoting gene expression. In this context, dozens of in vitro experimental studies suggest that potentized homeopathic medicines may act in the homeostatic regulation of gene expression, in view of their causing apoptosis in cancer cells and therapeuticregulation in disease-promoting gene expression. 1 Therefore, we can correlate the intrinsic characteristics and properties of the homeopathic vital principle to those ofthe genome (exome plusepigenome), suggesting the hypoth- esis that this is the representation or biological substrate of that according to the biomedical model. 2On the other hand, disease-promoting epigenetic alterations would be the re- presentation or biological substrate of chronic homeopathic miasmas.1 In short, in homeopathic terms, the genome would be the simillimum of organic vital force and the disease-promoting epigenetic alterations would be the simillimum of chronic miasmas. In accordance with these hypotheses, the isopathic use of auto-sarcode of DNA (auto-isotherapic of DNA) could act onthe imbalance of the vital principle or genome, and in the chronic miasmas or disease-promoting epigenetic altera- tions, through therapeutic modulation Homeopathy Vol. 110 No. 4/2021 \u00a9 2021.

Teixeira 285 Telomere and Telomerase: Biological Markers of Cellular Vitality, BiologicalAging, and Health -Disease Process Cellular activity and vitality are related to physiological balance and health -disease process. Its natural and progres- sive decrease causes a decline in physiological functions and in the body 's ability to adapt, causing biological aging and a predisposition to the appearance of diseases. Both the senescence process and the manifestation of diseases are influenced by genetics, epigenetics, and environmental factors that impact the quality of life. In this dynamic complexity, the TL and the activity of the telomerase enzyme are biological markers of cellular vitality, aging, and thehealth -disease process. In 2009, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicinefor discovering the role of telomeres and the telomerase enzyme in the integrity of chromosomes and genetic infor- mation. 22,23These discoveries paved the way for researchers to broaden their understanding of the role of telomeres in the biological aging process and in the development of chronic diseases in general, noting that telomere attrition is in flu- enced by oxidative damage and replicative stress caused by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Just like epigenetic alterations, telomeres are non-coding regions of the genome that are located at the ends of chromosomes, consisting of long series of short and repeated sequences formed by the 5 '-TTAGGG-3 'nitrogenous bases and associated proteins, and play an important role in the maintenance and integrity of DNA. Telomere shortening functions as a cellular vitality marker, and compromisesthe replicative potential of cells, thereby contributing to the natural process of cellular senescence. In order to counteract this process, the telomerase enzyme promotes maintenance of the TL by synthesizing the repetitive sequences of the lost telomeric DNA. During cell division (phase S), cells are unable to replicate around 50 to 200 pairs of nitrogenous bases at the ends of the chromosomes as the DNA polymerase enzyme cannot repro-duce the 3 'end of the linear molecule ( \"nal replication problem \"). This leads to the progressive shortening of chromo- somes along with cell divisions, resulting in loss of replicationcapacity and induction of cell senescence. This mechanism is the main cause of aging and age-related chronic diseases. 24-26 In order to avoid this progressive shortening of telomeres, which occurs with each cell division and the respective loss of genetic information, the lost DNA segments are periodically recovered thanks to a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complexcalled telomerase, comprising the reverse transcriptase (TERT). Under TERT 's action, TERC constitutes a template for synthesizing the repetitive sequences that compose the telomere. In the recovery of the lost telomeric DNA, this RNA template is positioned over the initiator DNA, the nitrogenous basesare added individually and in the correct sequence; then telomerase translocates at the end of the process to restart the process. 26-28Telomerase activity in the neonatal period is reduced or null and is absent in most somatic tissues in the body.Telomerase is active in the early stages of human develop- ment (pluripotent embryonic cells) and throughout life in blood stem cells, germ cells, and adult tissues in continuousrenewal (endometrial tissue, for example). 29The telomeric terminals of the cells are shortened in each cell division as a result of the gradual loss of telomerase activity, reaching aminimum length that makes cell division impossible. 30 As tissues undergoing continuous renewal, 90% of somatic cancer cells exhibit high telomerase expression, maintainingTL and achieving \"immortality \". In these cancer cells, the reactivation of the telomerase silencing gene has been one of the mechanisms used to circumvent the natural system ofcellular senescence and apoptosis, allowing them to continue promoting the lengthening of the telomeres and to replicate in an uncontrolled and uninterrupted manner. 31,32 In demonstrating the relationship between TL and health disorders, numerous studies show that shorter telomeres are associated with a number of chronic diseases. These diseasesinclude: congenital as atherosclerosis,36,37arterial hypertension38and stroke39; type 2 diabetes mellitus40,41; lupus erythematosus42 and psychiatric disorders44,45and neurological conditions46,47, among age-related diseases.48 Acquired chronic infectious diseases such as HIV49,50also promote telomere shortening. Even in acute infectious dis- eases, such as the current COVID-19, telomere shortening is proposed as a marker of disease severity and can identifypatients at risk of higher morbidity and mortality from SARS- CoV-2 infection. 51,52Studies suggest that T-cell lympho- poiesis may be discontinued in individuals with short telo- meres that have been infected.53 The same telomere shortening is observed in other health disorders, addictions or intoxications, such as to pollutants and mineral particles.60 In addition, traumatic social exposures or psycho-emo- tional disorders experienced throughout life, such as chronicstress 61,62and childhood trauma (for example, abuse, vio- lence, racism, bullying, low socio-economic status, maternal depression, family disturbance, institutionalization)63-66 also cause a decrease in TL. TL has a double role in cancer: telomere shortening can lead to induced chromosomal instability and the beginning oftumor formation (pre-cancerous lesion); on the other hand, initiated tumors need to reactivate telomerase to stabilize chromosomes and achieve \"immortal \"growth capacity. 67-69 Studies show a decrease in the size of telomeres associated with chronic health disorders in cancer survivors as a collateral effectofcancer treatment(radiotherapyand chemotherapy).70 Similarly, other drugs demonstrate the same collateral effect of telomere shortening (immunosuppressants,71proton pump inhibitors,72insulin,73and hypnotics,74among others).

Teixeira 286 On the other hand, some therapies are being assessed to counteract telomere shortening and act on telomere dis-eases: for example, sex hormones (aplastic anemia and idiopathic pulmonary brosis), 33,75anti-diabetic agents without acarbose (type 2 diabetes),76and lithium (bipolar disorder).77Similarly, natural compounds and their extracts have been shown to increase telomerase be indicated in treating dis- eases related to telomere shortening. Given that most cancer cells present increased telomerase activity, different anti-cancer approaches have been designed in the suicide gene, and chemicalsthat block telomerase biogenesis. 33,80,81Among )83appear as promising anti-tumor agents that inhibit telomerase activity. In contrast to the physiological shortening of telomeres related to natural aging, numerous studies show the importanceof lifestyle and health promotion practices in restoring the telomere -telomerase complex, 84such as regular physical activity,85balanced diet,86quality sleep,87body spiritual and religious practices,90 which provide for telomere homeostasis and the consequentbalance of various cellular functions, thereby preventingdiseases and other somatic and psychic disorders. Philosophical -Scienti cC o r r e l a t i o n between Vital Force and Telomeres The characteristics and properties of the previously men- tioned telomeres expand understanding of the gene expres- sion mechanism at the chromosome level (DNA molecule orgenomic unit) and reiterate the philosophical -scienti c correlations between the vital principle and the genome described in previous studies. 1,2 Among these analogies, we highlight that the vital force and chromosomes are the substrates for maintaining the phenom- enon of life, and the integrity of the organic vital force and thechromosomal endings (telomeres) are responsible for cellular vitality, longevity and health maintenance, whilst cellular senescence, biological aging and the disease process resultfrom vital imbalance and alteration in TL. Diseases and health disorders originate in vital dystonia or in the dysfunction of chromosomal replication (telomeres) in celldivision, and homeostasis of vital force and telomeres are generally affected by the same etiopathogenic factors (such as inadequate habits and lifestyle, pollution and irradiation, med-ications and hormones, in flammation, stress and emotions). Just as health promotion practices work to restore vital force homeostasis and telomeres, the integrity of organic vitalforce and telomeres can also be achieved by traditional vitalist treatments such as homeopathy. Although vital rebalancing is implicit in the philosophical conception of this therapeuticapproach, there are no studies in the literature that speci cally correlate the vital homeopathic phenomenon with thetelomeric phenomenon. Use of Telomere Length As a Biomarker of Organic Vital Force State and Homeopathic Treatment Effectiveness Just as he suggested, in 1997, the \"gene regulatory homeo- pathic hypothesis \",17-19later reiterated in numerous exper- studies,1,91Khuda-Bukhsh proposed, in 2002, \"a careful study of telomerase activity in these experimental studies to help in understanding the underlying genetic mechanism \".92 In accordance with this suggestion, experimental evi- dence-based studies show the role of potentized homeo- pathic medicines in modulating TL93,94and telomerase activity (expression of TERT),95,96suggesting that the telo- mere -telomerase complex can be a biological marker of the organic vital force state and could be used to evaluate theeffectiveness of homeopathic treatment. Working as a quantitative laboratory analysis method of cellular vitality, biological aging, and the health -disease process, evaluating the TL of leukocyte DNA extracted from peripheral blood could provide parameters of clinical and dynamic health and well-being that can be used as adiagnostic and prognostic method of the illness pro- cess, 97-100as well as in measuring the effectiveness of various therapies and health promotion practices, as previ-ously described. Some methods have been developed to measure TL in cells and tissues, including: Southern blot (SB) analysis of theterminal restriction fragments; quantitative PCR (qPCR), whose output is expressed as the ratio of telomere product relative to a single copy gene product; fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques, including quantitative FISH based on microscopy and FISH using flow cytometry; single telomere length analysis and telomere shortest length assay measurements at the single telomere level, based on a combination of PCR and SB. There is an ongoing debate asto which TL measurement method is optimal in epidemio- logical settings, mainly between SB and qPCR. The advan- tages of the qPCR method are its high throughput and lowcost, whilst the SB (considered the \"gold standard \")y i e l d s both mean TL values and generates the distribution of TLs in the DNA sample. 101,102 Based on tissue type and collection methods, several specimen types have been used for TL measurement (includ- ing whole blood, buccal swabs, and cord blood). Each speci-men type has relative advantages and challenges and may be differentially relevant to a speci c outcome or factor being examined in relation toTL due to cell-type differences. 101,102 Whole blood in circulation is one of the most often reported specimens utilized in telomere research because it is relatively easy to obtain, and so a signi cant number of past and current epidemiological and population studies have used it for TL measurement.

Teixeira 287 speci c cell types from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.101,102 Mean TL in human leukocyte DNA samples re flects the different TLs at the ends of the 23 chromosomes and in an admixture of cells. Regardless of the analysis method, theindividual mean leukocyte telomere length (mLTL) presents very little variation over 1 year, provided that internal and external in fluences remain constant. 103Moreover, individu- als with comparable mLTL display different LTL distribution (LTLD) shapes which are stable over a long time (8 years), indicating that LTLD shape may be characteristic of eachindividual: \"Individuals with comparable mLTLs displayed different shapes of LTLDs. Inter-individual variation in LTLD shape was much larger than intra-individual variation inLTLD shape between baseline and follow-up leukocyte sam- ples. These results show an important individual stability of LTLD shape over time, thus indicating that each individualhas a characteristic LTLD signature \". 104 Reiterating the individualizing characteristic of the vital principle, intra-individual stability of mLTL and LTLD shapeover time supports the proposal to employ sequential and periodic individual measures of LTL as a hypothetical diag- nostic method of the individual 's vital force state; whilst mLTL stability would indicate balance in the vital force and maintenance of a healthy state, a signi cant change in mLTL would indicate an imbalance in vital force (the primary causeof diseases) and corresponding manifestation of future diseases. Analogously, the intra-individual analysis of the mLTL before, during, and after homeopathic treatment could be used as a possible biological marker of homeopathic treatment effectiveness, assisting the homeopathic clinician to analyzethe various parameters of the therapy, such as individualiza- tion of the drug, doses, and homeopathic potencies, among other aspects. In the speci cc a s eo ft h e \"isopathic use of auto-sarcode of DNA as anti-miasmatic homeopathic medicine and modula-tor of gene expression \", 1,2we assume that intra-individual analysis of mLTL could be a method of great sensitivity and speci city for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of treatment. Conclusions The homeopathic philosophical vitalist concept considersvital force dystonia as the primary cause of diseases, whilethe return to health status would occur by vital rebalancing. The homeopathic model expands understanding of the etio- pathogenic dynamics, and also considers the manifestationof chronic miasmas (manifest psora) as a fundamental cause of chronic diseases in general, while health restoration would occur through modulating this miasmatic manifestation(latent psora) . According to the biomedical etiopathogenic process, the primary cause of diseases is the expression of genes respon-sible for the respective physiological disorders, considering the manifestation of disease-promoting epigenetic altera- tions as a fundamental cause of chronic diseases in general.The return to health status would occur through modulating these epigenetic manifestations and consequent inhibitionof pathological gene expression. Having presented similar characteristics and properties in recent studies, 1,2we are now suggesting philosophical - scienti c correlations between vital force and genome (exome plus epigenome) and between chronic miasms and epigenetic alterations that promote diseases, meaning thatthe genome would be the biological representation of organ- ic vital force, and disease-promoting epigenetic alterations would be the biological representation of chronic miasms. The properties and functions of the telomere -telomerase complex expand understanding of the gene expression mechanism at the chromosome level (DNA molecule orgenomic unit) and reiterate the supposed philosophical - scienti c correlations between the vital principle and the genome in view of its recognized role as a biomarker ofcellular vitality, biological aging, and the health -disease process. In this hypothetical context, TL would indicate the organic vital force state and could be used in the diagnosisand prognosis of diseases according to the vitalist approach, expanding the spectrum and scope of classic homeopathic semiology. On the other hand, the telomere -telomerase complex could also be used as a possible biomarker of the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment, employing the intra-individualanalysis of the mLTL (and/or the telomerase activity) before, during, and after therapeutic interventions. If this hypothesis were experimentally con rmed, with these periodic evaluations, homeopathic practice and clinical research could be enhanced via objective and quantitative analysis parameters accepted by the biomedical model, with-out the vitalist and philosophical aspects of the homeopathic health -disease process being neglected, nor the individualiz- ing premises of homeopathic treatment being disrespected. Highlights \u0081The homeopathic vital force is a philosophical non- material substrate, theoretically responsible for main- taining the physiological homeostasis and the body 's health state. \u0081The body 's vital functions are controlled by biochemical information contained in the cell genome (exome plus epigenome). \u0081In line with the similarity of existing characteristics and properties, we suggested that the cell genome can beconsidered as the biological representation of the or- ganic vital force. \u0081Telomere length plays an important role in maintaining cellular vitality, biological longevity, and physiological homeostasis. \u0081Analysis of the intra-individual telomere length might be used as a biological marker of organic vital force state and of homeopathic treatment effectiveness.
