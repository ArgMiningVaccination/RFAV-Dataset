Fenugreek Seeds (Methi Dana) and Cumin Seeds (Jeera) - This common ingredient is believed by researchers to contain chemical compounds called alkaloids that have an analgesic effect. They block sensory receptors, reducing the brain's perception of pain. Fenugreek seeds can be consumed in form of a drink made from water used to soak them overnight or as a powder mixed with warm water. Cumin seeds are a powerhouse of anti-inflammatory and anti-spasmodic antioxidants. The best way to consume these seeds is to boil them in water and then drink it up like tea. 2. Turmeric (Haldi) - It contains curcumin a chemical known for its anti-inflammatory properties. Adding this golden spice to your meals or to your tea can help reduce uterine contractions and hence cramps. 3. Dark Chocolate - We never need a reason to eat dark chocolate, but nasty cramps totally merit snacking on this food, which is rich in magnesium. Known as 'nature's relaxant', magnesium helps in relaxing muscles of the uterus and reducing prostaglandins - chemicals that induce uterine contractions causing menstrual cramps. 4. Fruits: Bananas and Muskmelon - Bananas are rich in magnesium, which helps in reducing the intensity of the pain and they also provide relief from bloating. Eating muskmelon helps in regulating menstrual flow and also eases pain from cramps. 5. Vegetables: Broccolli and Kale - Dark leafy vegetables are rich in magnesium and calcium, which help in reducing pain from menstrual cramps. 6. Chamomile Tea - There's plenty of scientific evidence to show that this herbal tea reduces menstrual cramps. A 2010 study, found that drinking this tea one week prior to the period and for the first five days of the period for a month benefitted women who suffered from painful periods. 7. In addition, sipping warm water helps. It increases blood circulation and hence menstrual flow, which reduces the occurrence of cramps. To keep your energy up during these days, snack on dates and figs. In studies, dried figs have been found to reduce the severity of menstrual cramps. "}
