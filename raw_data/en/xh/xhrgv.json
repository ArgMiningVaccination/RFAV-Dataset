While some may think other aspects are more important, the truth is that without the assurance of cat-safe ingredients in a pet product, nothing else matters. While many brands were excluded from our search due to questionable ingredients, those that made it through the screening process were examined for their manufacturing practices that ensure a reliable, effective, safe product. Finally, the products pre-vetted for ingredients and safety were reviewed for their proven effectiveness. Using customer reviews, third-party lab reports, and other industry sources, we narrowed the list to products with a proven track record of helping pets in the ways they claimed. After all was said and done, we found the four CBD treats above to represent the best of the best. We are confident that your feline friend will benefit from them in ways that assist with everything from anxiety and joint pain to cognitive support and sleep. How To Pick the Best CBD Treats for Your Pet It can be a challenge to select the best CBD for cats that will benefit your cat in all the right ways. Ensure you don't get stuck with an unhappy kitty without top tips for buying feline CBD treats. Know your cat's wellness needs Buy CBD cat treats from reputable brands like the ones above and chances are you'll be able to give your cat general wellness effects that naturally occur when consuming high-quality cannabidiol products. However, take the time to understand your cat's specific wellness needs, and you can choose the right product for your pet every time. For instance, is your cat's stress triggered when you are home, and things are going on or when you are away? Cat's stressed when you leave may require CBD formulas more suited to emotional healing instead of those that calm them during stressful situations resulting from loud noises, fast movements, and other actions that may occur when you are home. Additionally, is the pain your cat is feeling affecting their sleep or eating habits? If so, you'll need to consider formulas to support sleep or boost appetite. In these cases, formulas containing a wide range of hemp-derived cannabinoids may be best compared to [pure CBD isolate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115937/) for just managing age-related pain or injury in a healthy pup. Consider the texture You can buy CBD cat treats in two textures: soft and crunchy. Soft CBD treats are ideally suited for cats with difficulty chewing, digesting, or swallowing. These CBD treats are an excellent way to introduce cats to CBD as they transition from formula to more solid foods. Crunchy CBD treats are best for cats already used to dry or crunchy treats, giving them a familiar texture that helps make CBD consumption more enjoyable. Additionally, when formulated with ample vitamins, minerals, and other healthy ingredients, crunchy treats can help boost a cat's overall oral health, making them a comprehensive wellness solution for cats of all ages. The only drawback to soft CBD treats for cats is their limited shelf life, usually around 6 months compared to the 1-year shelf life of crunchy treats. So, if you plan on offering your cat CBD treats regularly, and they hate the crunchy bulk options available, soft CBD oil treats may be the way to go. However, choose the longer-lasting crunchy treats if your cat loves to play with its food and enjoys the crunch. The added nutritional and health benefits of these high-quality treats make them worth their investment. Consider your cat's weight As with humans, the heavier the cat, the potentially more CBD it may require. This means those with a larger feline friend weighing more than 12 lbs. may need treats that come in larger quantities. That way, you can meet your large cat's wellness needs without worrying about running out too quickly or committing to auto-ship programs. Those who need to add more fats to their cat's diet due to being underweight or having developmental growth issues should consider CBD treats formulated with healthy fats. These can help them gain weight without sacrificing nutrient density or palatability, making them a win-win for keeping cats healthy and happy. Pet parents with cats weighing in under 12 lbs. can choose from a wider range of CBD oil treats, including those with higher concentrations of hemp-derived cannabidiol. These will typically come in smaller portions, making them easier for cats to digest and helping eliminate waste during feeding time. Benefits of CBD for Cats Studies show that all mammals can potentially benefit from CBD and hemp plant compounds, provided they are sourced from premium hemp plants and formulated safely for the species. For cats, this means that a variety of wellness benefits can be seen, both in the short and long term. Age-related pain support Cats age faster than their human counterparts, causing them to experience age-related pain by the time they reach 7 or 8 years old. CBD can help reduce this pain by interacting with the body's endocannabinoid system to calm inflammation and regulate nerve-related discomfort associated with age. Additionally, with many CBD treats for cats containing essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals known to support joint and ligament health, these products make for some of the most comprehensive and effective solutions for cats experiencing age-related pain. Cognitive support CBD can also help support a cat's cognitive functions, allowing them to stay sharp and alert well into its golden years. Cognitive decline is normal with aging, but introducing hemp-derived phytonutrients into your cat's diet can help keep essential brain synapses firing on all cylinders so your cat's mental functions stay engaged and sharp. Furthermore, with many formulas containing omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, CBD cat treats can also help to support recall and memory functions. This makes them ideal for keeping cats calm in familiar but stressful situations like the vet or groomer. Anxiety & stress support It is a well-known fact that cats can suffer from what's colloquially known as the zoomies. This [behavioral syndrome](https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/what-are-zoomies) is caused by repressed energy that can't be released due to environmental constraints, but CBD has been known to calm cats and help them release this pent-up energy without having to resort to destructive behavior. Furthermore, with separation anxiety and home-related stress playing a part in many cats' lack of comfort, CBD cat treats are an effective way to help them cope. With the right formula and dosage, these treats can help cats release tension related to fear and anxiety while also helping them stay relaxed when tensions are high. Oral health support When formulated to be nutritionally rich and with the right texture, the [best CBD cat treats](https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/556906/best-cbd-cat-treats-2022-top-3-healthy-brands-for-your-kitten-to-enjoy/) can also help support your cats' oral health. Crunchy treats can help promote healthy gums and reduce tartar buildup, while soft treats can help to keep teeth clean without putting strain on the jaws or digestive system. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory benefits of CBD can affect gums, making them less sensitive to any ongoing [periodontal issues](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25527493/) that can arise as cats age. This makes them an excellent option for pet parents looking to ensure their cats get the most out of each treat and experience ongoing wellness benefits without suffering in pain to get them. Skin & fur health CBD cat treats can also help to support your cats' skin and fur health. With many formulations containing vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids known for improving hair growth, preventing shedding, and supporting a healthy coat texture, these treats are an excellent way to keep your cat looking its best for years to come. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects of multi-cannabinoid [CBD for cats](https://www.pdxmonthly.com/sponsored/2023/06/cbd-for-cats-5-best-cbd-balms-and-cbd-oils-for-cats) can help to reduce skin irritation, itchiness, and redness associated with seasonal allergies and other environmental influences. This particular benefit is excellent for specialty breeds, cats with autoimmune issues, or those who live indoors and outdoors. Other Forms of CBD for Cats Delicious CBD treats for cats are an excellent way to support their overall well-being, but they aren't the only way. Those looking for an even more convenient way to give cats a daily dose of cannabidiol can always turn to the same popular CBD products used by humans but altered to be safe for our feline friends. CBD oil tinctures for cats CBD oil for cats is commonly given in tinctures when the effects need to be fast acting. CBD oil tinctures contain similar bioavailable and nutritional ingredients, but they bypass the digestive processes needed to break down a CBD treat and instead are infused directly into the bloodstream via the sublingual application. The [best CBD oil for cats](https://www.amny.com/sponsored/best-cbd-oil-for-cats-5-products-to-relieve-stress-pain-and-more/) also has the added benefit of blending seamlessly into their favorite foods. This means that pet owners with picky eaters won't have to find a new way to entice their cats and can instead add a few drops of CBD tincture into their meals for an easy, effective wellness solution. CBD oil topicals for cats Sometimes the best way to manage a cat's pain and discomfort is topically, especially when the source of pain is localized rather than systemic. CBD oil can be infused into balms, lotions, salves, and other topical solutions to help cats with minor ailments that don't require an internal application. These products are excellent for targeting specific areas of discomfort, helping reduce inflammation and redness while calming the nerves and aiding in pain relief. Furthermore, since they can be applied directly to the source of discomfort, pet owners don't have to worry about issues related to proper dosage or a cat's food preferences. Side Effects of CBD in Cats There isn't much evidence showing CBD oil for cats is harmful in the long term, but based on ongoing research and customer reviews from the best brands, [CBD oil for cats](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/03/09/cbd-oil-for-cats-in-2023-5-best-cbd-oils-to-treat-inflammation-pain-anxiety/) is relatively safe, well tolerated, and generally accepted as a safe dietary supplement for all mammals. However, as with any supplement or medication, it is important to be aware of potential side effects to ensure your cat has the best possible experience. Common side effects of CBD in cats may include lethargy, increased thirst, and changes in appetite. These side effects often dissipate with continued use or by modulating the CBD dosage until the effects don't cause discomfort or inconvenience. You can also talk to your vet if you're unsure how to monitor CBD oil's effects and what dosage would be best for your cat's needs. It is important to watch out for particular side effects that could result from unsafe formulations or specific ingredients. For example, some pet CBD oil products include organic coconut oil in the formula to improve the bioavailability of the CBD. If your cat is allergic to coconut oil, that ingredient obviously could be problematic. Always review ingredients carefully for potential allergens. Also, CBD oil treats containing xylitol can be toxic to cats and cause serious harm if ingested. Always make sure that the treats you buy are made from safe ingredients like non-GMO hemp and contain no artificial flavors or preservatives before giving them to your cat. Frequently Asked Questions 1. What CBD dosage is best for my cat? Pet parents will have to use trial and error to figure out the best CBD dosage for their cats. Most start with a low dose of .5 to 1 mg and increase to 2.5 to 5mg depending on their cat's weight, severity of conditions, and desired results. Typically cats weighing over 12 lbs. are on the larger end of that scale, while those just maturing into adulthood may need a lower dose. Always consult the dosing instruction on the package and speak to your vet for any questions about medication interactions or other considerations. 2. What supplement ingredients are cats allergic to? To avoid any risk of severe side effects when taking cat CBD oil treats, be sure to avoid products containing xylitol, grains, corn, or gluten. These ingredients are known to cause everything from allergic reactions to vomiting and diarrhea. Additionally, avoid giving your cat the same CBD oil you take, as human-grade cannabidiol products aren't made with ingredients safe for cats, especially those containing artificial flavoring, essential oils, or natural sweeteners. 3. What are the long-term benefits of CBD for cats? CBD treats for cats are known to provide a range of long-term benefits, including relief from chronic pain, reduced inflammation and stress in the body, improved digestion, and healthier skin and fur. As cats age, these benefits can help them live more comfortable lives with fewer aches and pains associated with old age or other medical issues. CBD also helps support the immune system, making it easier for cats to fight off infections and stay healthy. 4. How often can I give my cat CBD oil? The frequency of administering pet CBD oil to cats can vary depending on the severity of their symptoms and how well they respond to treatment. Generally, brands will list a serving size of 1 to 3 pieces, but you may need to adjust this based on your cat's size, diet, and your personal ability to monitor the effects. No matter how much you give, be sure to dose at the same time each and every day so that the effects of CBD always remain consistent and reliable. 5. Can I give CBD for cats to my dog? Some CBD pet products are formulated for cats and dogs, but not all. While both species make great companions, they have vastly different physiological makeup and should not share supplements. CBD for cats is specially formulated to meet the unique needs of felines, such as increased sensitivity to taste and smell. If you want your dog to enjoy the same benefits of CBD as your cat, consider finding canine-specific products or ones suitable for multiple species. Maintain Your Cat's Health & Wellness With CBD Oil Premium CBD oil infused into delicious, nutrient-rich cat treats gives your feline friend the ability to stay active and healthy while relieving minor ailments or chronic symptoms. With the right dosage from any of the top-rated CBD cat treats above, your furry friend can enjoy the comprehensive wellness benefits of CBD supplements that maintain a better quality of life no matter their age.
