It has been postulated and shown in adults that MIS may occur after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (MIS-V). Our current case is one of the first published cases with a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in an 18-year-old adolescent after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine from Pfizer/BionTech (BNT162b2), who fulfills the published level 1 criteria for a definitive disease: age < 21 years, fever > 3 consecutive days, pericardial effusion, elevated CRP/NT-BNP/Troponin T/D-dimeres, cardiac involvement, and positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The disease starts 10 weeks after the second vaccination, with a fever (up to 40 \u00b0C) and was treated with amoxicillin for suspected pneumonia. The SARS CoV-2-PCR and several antigen tests were negative. With an ongoing fever, he was hospitalized 14 days later. A pericardial effusion (10 mm) was diagnosed by echocardiography. The C-reactive protein (174 mg/L), NT-BNP (280 pg/mL), and Troponin T (28 pg/mL) values were elevated. Due to highly elevated D-dimeres (>35,000 g/L), a pulmonary embolism was excluded by thoracal computer tomography. If the boy did not improve with intravenous antibiotics, he was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins; however, the therapy was discontinued after 230 mg/kg if he developed high fever and hypotension. A further specialized clinic treated him with colchicine and ibuprofen. The MIS-V was discovered late, 4 months after the onset of the disease. As recently shown in four children with MIS-C after SARS-CoV-2 infection and a girl with Hashimoto thyroiditis after BNT162b2 vaccination, we found elevated functional autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors that may be important for pathophysiology but are not conclusive for the diagnosis of MIS-C. Conclusion: We are aware that a misattribution of MIS-V as a severe complication of coronavirus vaccination can lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and blunt the global COVID-19 vaccination drive. However, the pediatric population is at a higher risk for MIS-C and a very low risk for COVID-19 mortality. The publication of such cases is very important to make doctors aware of this complication of the vaccination, so that therapy with intravenous immunoglobulins can be initiated at an early stage.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-11-18", "cleaned_text": "A Risk Factor of Multisystem Inflammatory 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-01353)]. At this time, the coronavirus vaccine was mainly used in adults and no case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after vaccination was published. However, in July 2021 the first three cases with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were published [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-01353)]. The vaccine was not specified in this publication, but two of these patients had COVID-19 disease, shortly before vaccination (34 days and 43 days), and the disease started with a short delay 4 days after the second vaccine or 19 days after the first vaccine. All patients survived and were treated with Methylprednisolone and antibiotics. Another case of MIS-A after vaccination was published in July 2021, and the authors proposed the term multisystem inflammatory syndrome after vaccination (MIS-V) [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-01353)]. [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-30-august-2-september-2021](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-30-august-2-september-2021), accessed on 3 September 2021, published by European Medicines Agency, Domenico Scarlattilaan 6, 1083 HS Amsterdam, The Netherlands). [1](#B1-vaccines-09-01353)]. [3](#B3-vaccines-09-01353)]. A recent review summarizes and evaluates the available evidence on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy, with a special focus on virus induced myocarditis [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-01353)]. Beta adrenoreceptor autoantibodies seem to be important for pathophysiology with therapeutic implications [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-01353)]. We measured elevated autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) after a natural SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-01353)]. The data are in accordance with multiple elevated autoantibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-01353), [8](#B8-vaccines-09-01353)]. We now publish these autoantibodies in an 18-year-old boy with severe inflammatory disease after coronavirus mRNA vaccination and prove the release of these autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors in a girl with Hashimoto thyroiditis after coronavirus mRNA vaccination were significantly elevated after the SARS-CoV-2 2 [Figure were significantly elevated after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. If the girl had no clinical side effects of the vaccination, she would get her second vaccination four weeks later. Six weeks after the second vaccination, anti-TPO further increased, while autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors returned to values slightly above the baseline values. In this time, pacemaker monitoring showed an increase of atrial pacing from 8.7% to 10.5% after the first vaccination and to 19.4% after the second vaccination. Ventricular pacing increased from <0.1% to 0.2% after vaccination, which may indicate an atrioventricular blockade. She had normal T3 and T4 values, but the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) increased from 2.99 U/mL to 8.65 U/mL after the second vaccination, and the thyroid hormone supplementation must be elevated. 4. Discussion [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-30-august-2-september-2021](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-30-august-2-september-2021); accessed on 3 September 2021), our first case is the second published case with a multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) in an adolescent after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, who fulfills the published level 1 criteria for a definitive disease: age < 21 years, fever > 3 consecutive days, pericardial and pleural effusions, weakness, elevated CRP/NT-BNP/Troponin T/D-dimere, cardiac involvement, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, time frame < 12 weeks. [6](#B6-vaccines-09-01353)], he had a comparable pattern of increased autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors adrenergic receptor autoantibodies have been shown to be elevated in adults with heart failure [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-01353)] and children with cardiomyopathies [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-01353)]. However, anti-1 and anti-muscarinergic receptor 3 + 4 autoantobodies were more elevated in four children after SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to this case. The number of cases was too low to be able to draw general conclusions from this. Moreover, we do not know the baseline values (before vaccination) in the boy who had pre-existing illness. [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-01353-f002)). We found a uniform increase of all these autoantibodies after the first vaccination, which returned to baseline six weeks after the second vaccination, but thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies further increased. She had no clinical side effects, but pacemaker monitoring showed an impairment of her arrhythmia, known of since early childhood and currently successfully treated with the dual chamber pacemaker. Moreover, while TPO antibodies significantly increased after vaccination, we had to increase her thyroxin treatment to normalize the elevated TSH values. [7](#B7-vaccines-09-01353)] with known cardiovascular complications of the disease and vaccination. Autoinflammation may explain the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections on Hashimoto thyroiditis [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-01353)], as well as arrhythmogenesis [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-01353)] and myocarditis [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-01353)]. [6](#B6-vaccines-09-01353)]. In both cases, the spike protein is the target of the immune response. We tried to explain the effect of the spike protein on multiple autoantibody pathways, with a blockade of the so called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-01353)]. As recently published, COVID-19-related myocarditis may be related to the cholinergic The nicotinergic acetyl-choline receptor alpha7 subunit (7nAChR) is cardinal in this pathway and is mainly expressed on the membrane of immune cells [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01353)]. There is some evidence of a molecular mimicry of nicotinergic acetyl-choline receptor alpha7 subunit and the spike protein [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-01353)], which could explain the proinflammatory effect by a blockade of the anti-inflammatory pathway that is neuronally controlled by the vagus nerve. [16](#B16-vaccines-09-01353), [17](#B17-vaccines-09-01353)], which indicates low vagus activity. A low heart rate variability in the elderly and patients with chronic diseases may explain the higher risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 infections. We have developed an algorithm, based on a 24 h analysis of heart rate variability, to estimate the risk of death from COVID-19 [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-01353)].
