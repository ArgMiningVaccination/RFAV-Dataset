[Science & Tech](/Science-Tech) science](https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science), a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as [computers](https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer). In order for computers to exchange information, there must be a preexisting agreement as to how the information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it. Without a [protocol](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/protocol), a transmitting computer, for example, could be sending its data in 8- [bit](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bit-communications) packets while the receiving computer might expect the data in 16-bit packets. [Protocols](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Protocols) are established by international or industrywide organizations. Perhaps the most important computer protocol is OSI ( [Open Systems Interconnection](https://www.britannica.com/technology/open-systems-interconnection)), a set of guidelines for [implementing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implementing) networking communications between computers. Among the most important sets of [Internet](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Internet) protocols are [TCP/IP](https://www.britannica.com/technology/TCP-IP) (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), [HTTPS](https://www.britannica.com/technology/HTTP) (Secure HyperText Transmission Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and [DNS](https://www.britannica.com/technology/domain-name) (Domain Name System).
