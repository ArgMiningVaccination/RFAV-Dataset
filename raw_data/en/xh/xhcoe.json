They can interfere with the ability to perform normal household tasks, enjoy meals, and maintain daily function and activities , thereby reducing their quality of lif e. The severity of these symptoms can also reduce adherence to chemotherapy regimens and lead to malnutrition. In addition to the numerous antiemetics that are available, several integrative therapies also significantly reduce chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Acupuncture Several acupressure points , when stimulated by needles, electric ity, or pressure, reduce CINV .1- 3 Acupressure reduces the severity of acute and delayed nausea, however, it has no benefit on the incidence and severity of vomiting .4 For the prevention of nausea, needles shoul d be placed at least 30 minutes before the chemotherapy session and continued for as long as required. Acupuncture can also be done the day before and day after chemotherapy, and should be administered by acupuncturists specially trained in oncology who will have knowledge of contraindications. Some specific acupuncture points are described below. The PC6 (P6) acupressure point alleviates nausea and is easy to find:5 1. Take your index finger and middle finger and place them on your wrist at the base of your palm to measure where your nausea acupressure point is. 2. Two or three finger widt hs down from the top crease in the wrist, centered in the groove between the two large tendons is the PC6 point. 2 of 7 Managing Chemotherapy -Induced Nausea and Vomiting University of Wisconsin Integrative Health www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative 3. 4. Take your thumb and index or middle finger and press firmly on the points on both sides of the wrist when you feel nauseous. You should feel relief in 10 -30 seconds , but it can take up to 5 minutes. 5. You can also t ap your wrists together gently at the acupressure points while taking deep breaths. A lternate with tapping the outsides of your hands together. 3 of 7 Managing Chemotherapy -Induced Nausea and Vomiting University of Wisconsin Integrative Health www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative 6. Purchase a wristband that applies p ressure to the correct spot. They usually have a knob or flat button positioned over the acupressure point. You might feel relief as soon as you put it on, but after your body grows accustomed to the pressure, you' ll need to press down on the acupressure point for extra relief. 7. Another acupressure point that is commonly used for gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea and vomiting, and stress and fatigue is ST36 . Measure four finger -widths down from the bottom of your kneecap, along the outer boundary of the shinbone. If you are in the right place, a muscle should pop out as you move your foot up and down. To use this acupressure point, (1) locate the point then (2) apply downward pressure on the muscle, stimulating the area for 4 -5 seconds. 6,7 Acupressure Point stomach- 36.

One to two drops of peppermint oil can be added to a 12- oz bottle of water and consumed throughout the day. 4 of 7 Managing Chemotherapy -Induced Nausea and Vomiting University of Wisconsin Integrative Health www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Botanicals Note: Supplements are not regulated with the same degree of oversight as medications, and it is important that clinicians keep this in mind. Products vary greatly i n terms of accuracy of labeling, presence of adulterants, and the legitimacy of claims made by the manufacturer. Ginger Ginger ( Zingiber officinale) is a well- known antiemetic and several studies have found it effective for CINV .10 It appears to be more effective for acute nausea and vomiting rather than delayed.11,12 The dose is powdered ginger root 1000 mg daily starting on the first day of chemotherapy and continued for 5 days. Another dosing is 500 mg every 4 hours starting on the first day of chemotherapy and continuing as long as needed. It may be consumed in capsule form, candied ginger, ginger ale (made from real ginger), and tea. Freshly diced ginger tea can be consumed on the day of chemotherapy and continued for as long as needed. Ginger is an anticoagulant, so use with caution in patients who are on blood thinners and avoid high doses in patients wi th a low platelet count. Astragalus Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that has also been found effective in reducing CINV .13,14 Since astragalus is often given in combination with other herbs, a dose as not been established. Mind -Body Most patients who experience CINV attribute these side effects to a psychological etiology , justifying the need for mind- body therapies in managing symptoms. Effective therapies include clinical hypnosis ,15 Guided I magery, progressive muscle relaxation16, systematic desensitization, yoga,17 and healing touch.18 A health psychologist or a practitioner trained in these modalities can teach several of these techniques to patients. Patients may perform progressive muscle relaxation in conjunction to listening to Guided I magery CDs before and during chemotherapy. (For more information, go to the \"Progressive Muscle Relaxation \" tool.) Guided Imagery CDs and MP3s for chemotherapy can be purchased at the Healthy Journeys website . Music therapy can have positive effects when used in conjunction with other mind- body techniques , but the data is inconsistent .19,20 During chemotherapy treatment, encourage patients to use simple distractions, such as listening to a relaxation tape or soft music, drawing, knitting, reading, or doing crossword puzzles. Manual Therapy A study found that 20- minute hand or foot massage sessions given to breast cancer patients during chemotherapy significantly reduced nausea.21 5 of 7 Managing Chemotherapy -Induced Nausea and Vomiting University of Wisconsin Integrative Health www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative General Dietary Recommendations22 1.
