For over 5,000 years, across many different cultures and peoples, essential oils have been used to treat a variety of conditions. These oils are extracted, primarily through steam distillation, from the leaves, bark, flowers, fruits, seeds and roots of plants and trees. The process separates the plant compounds into highly concentrated and aromatic essential oils and water-based complexes called hydrosols. The powerful healing compounds of the plant, concentrated into the single extracted oil can then be used therapeutically. The olfactory (smell) system directly connects to the emotional center in the brain (the amygdala) and to the limbic system which is connected to the parts of the brain controlling memories, stress levels, hormone balance, breathing and blood pressure. This means that aromas almost instantaneously are able to have a direct effect physically and psychologically on the body and mind. Essential oils are composed of very small volatile molecules that can penetrate cells and some can even cross the blood-brain barrier (meaning that the essential oils are absorbed into the bloodstream via the blood vessels of the lungs and then circulated throughout the body - even to the brain - where they can then affect our physical, emotional and mental states.) Inhalation of essential oils using a spritzer or diffuser is the quickest way to obtain their most valuable psychological and physical therapeutic benefits.
