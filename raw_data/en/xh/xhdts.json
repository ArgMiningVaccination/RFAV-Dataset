Natural remedies are a great first start.", "sitename": "thekillers.net", "date": "2023-01-23", "cleaned_text": "The presence of [fleas](https://thekillers.net/pest-control-milwaukie/) in the home can be an unnerving pest issue. The good news is that eliminating fleas doesn't have to be a major undertaking. If you're looking to take care of the problem at home, you can try a few remedies first. When used in combination with regular cleaning and vacuuming, these methods can prove effective in exterminating those irritating creatures. Apply Your Treatment Multiple Times When tackling a flea infestation, it's important to be consistent and thorough with your treatment. This means applying the treatment every few days until the issue is resolved since fleas can quickly lay their eggs. Failure to tackle all stages of the infestation can cause it to linger much longer than necessary\u2014up to several weeks or even months in some cases. So by setting consistent days or intervals where you apply your flea extermination routine, you can effectively eliminate an invasion before it becomes a larger problem. Herbal Flea Spray - To create a powerful flea spray, combine 4 liters of vinegar, 2 liters of water, 500 ml of lemon juice and 250 ml of witch hazel in a spray bottle and shake well until they are fully mixed together. - Vacuum your entire home before applying the homemade flea remedy - remember to empty the contents into an outside bin! - Wash any bedding or cushions that could be infested. - Once these steps have been completed, apply the peppery-smelling solution around your home using a heavy spray - target carpets, furniture, pet bedding, window sills and floors. Lemon Spray Simply slice one lemon thinly and add it to a pint of water. Then bring the citrus solution to a boil before allowing it to sit overnight. Pour the solution into a spray bottle and use it on furniture or other infested areas in your home. Apple Cider Vinegar Spray If you have pets, you can use this treatment to spray them with. Apple cider vinegar is a slightly acidic pH level that helps prevent fleas from living and reproducing on your pet's coat. Make a solution of six cups of ACV and four cups of water (in a 6:4 ratio). To make it even more effective, add a pinch of salt and thoroughly spray the mixture on your dog's or cat's coat and underbelly while avoiding their eyes or any wounds they may have. Citrus Fruit Spray Extracts from oranges and lemons can be used to spray directly on furniture, pet beds, carpets, and other areas that may have become infected. It's important to exercise caution before using citrus fruit products; cats are known to have allergic reactions when exposed to them, so if you own cats, make sure they're out of the room while spraying is taking place. Plants Fleas Hate Choosing the right plants to help repel fleas is an effective and natural way of getting rid of these annoying insects. Many herbs and plants contain natural oils, compounds, and chemicals that fleas cannot stand and will stay away from if the plants are in your home or yard. Plants fleas hate: - Lemongrass - Mint - Lavender - Sage - Oregano - Rosemary - Marigolds - Eucalyptus - Chrysanthemums - Thyme Rosemary Essential Oil Rosemary, a popular choice for an organic flea remedy, can be used to treat both light and heavy infestations. This method of flea prevention is easy to prepare at home. Create a powder with rosemary, rue, wormwood, fennel and peppermint mixed together in a pestle and mortar. Once ground into a fine powder, it should be sprinkled around the home - carpets, furniture, pet bedding, blankets, and window sills being prime spots where fleas tend to thrive. Diatomaceous Earth Diatomaceous earth is highly effective in treating flea infestations but does require a persistent and careful application to be successful. To use it, simply sprinkle the fine powder over your carpets and floorboards, taking care to cover all areas with a thin layer of powder. Allow the diatomaceous earth to sit for two days before vacuuming it up. Dish Soap Dish-washing soap is an effective yet non-toxic home remedy for fleas. Trap them with the help of warm water in a bowl and a moderate amount of soap. Placing these traps in areas where fleas are pestering is highly recommended, preferably at night when they are active. Baking Soda Sprinkle baking soda on affected areas such as furniture and carpets. The powder will penetrate the fibers of the carpets, killing off any fleas hiding there. A hard brush can help push the powder deeper into the fabric or carpet to get rid of all fleas. Vacuuming up the powder and pests immediately afterward is recommended, then throw away the bag outside of your property. Salt Sprinkling salt everywhere where fleas are active will make them dry and eventually die. You need to break out your vacuum cleaner to remove the dead fleas and any residual salt. This includes carpets, which provide the perfect hiding spot for fleas and their eggs. Clean and Vacuum Home and Pet Areas Vacuuming is essential for controlling fleas in your home. Vacuum regularly, and be sure not to forget any areas pets might inhabit, such as their sleeping spots. Also, don't neglect the hidden places where eggs could fall off your pet and hide, like the crevices between baseboards and floorboards. Give Your Pets a Soap and Water Bath The best way to get fleas off your pets quickly is with a soap and water bath. When you immerse your pet in the water, the fleas will rush up its body to escape drowning, so be sure to have a flea comb handy to pick out as many of them as possible around their head. To help prevent future infestations, add a few drops of cedar or lavender oil to your pet's bathwater.
