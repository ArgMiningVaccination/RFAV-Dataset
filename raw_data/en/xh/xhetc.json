This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalisation caused by the Delta variant,\" the authors conclude. If the findings are confirmed, the implications for global Covid policy will be profound. It would not undermine the importance of vaccination for more vulnerable groups in society. However it would weaken the case for vaccinating children, as they (and the people around them) would get superior future protection from contracting the disease. And it would pose a fundamental challenge to the singular emphasis on vaccine passports for travel and large events, if unvaccinated people who have already had Covid actually pose less of a risk.\" [#vaccines](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fvaccines&trk=public_post-text) [#medicine](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmedicine&trk=public_post-text) [#health](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fhealth&trk=public_post-text) [#covid](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fcovid&trk=public_post-text) [#healthcare](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fhealthcare&trk=public_post-text) [](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Funherd%2Ecom%2Fthepost%2Fbombshell-study-finds-natural-immunity-superior-to-vaccination%2F&urlhash=-Owe&trk=public_post_feed-article-content) this isn't \"new\"- it just doesn't fit the narrative that's been spewed for the last 18 months. Thank you for this. As more studies come out, I pray they can make it to the masses. Let truth prevail.
