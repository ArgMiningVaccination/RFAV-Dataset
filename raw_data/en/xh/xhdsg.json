YOU! HEALTH WELLNESS VANDERBILT FACULTY & STAFF How do I know if I am at risk for diabetes? Type 2 diabetes has a number of risk factors, some of which we can change and some we cannot. Im- portant risks we cannot change are: Age over 45 years Family history of diabetes or personal history of gestational diabetes Some races and ethnicities are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes such as: African Americans Hispanic/Latin American Asian American How do I get screened for diabetes? If you believe you are at risk, a simple blood test, HbA1c, can be done. A reading of 6.5% or higher is diabetes A test result of 5.7% to 6.4% is prediabetes Below 5.7% is normal Are there ways to lower my risk for diabetes? A healthy lifestyle is the key to success. Often people can reduce their risk dramatically with losing only a few pounds. Some simple steps include eating a healthy diet with fresh fruits and a variety of veggies and avoiding processed foods. Also, trying to move more and incorporating exercise in simple ways, such as walking, is beneficial. Christianne L. Roumie, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor, Internal Medicine and Pediatrics Care Gap Alerts Vanderbilt Experts on Health Diabetes Holiday Don't Let Your Health Take a The busy season ahead can quickly lead to a hectic schedule.

Work/Life Connections-EAP The Counselor's Psychologist, Work/Life Connections-EAP Q: Dear Counselor, Every year I make a New Year's resolution, but I can't ever seem to keep up with it. Do you have any tips for making my changes stick in 2020? New Start A: Dear New Start, First, you are NOT alone in your struggles; most resolutions fall by the wayside within a few months! With a little bit of thought and planning, however, you can set yourself up for a successful start to 2020. Consider these four tips: 1. Get SMART. One MAJOR trap folks often fall into is choosing resolutions that are too broad, vague, or lofty. By thinking Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound, you're more likely to make sustainable changes. 2. We are all works in progress. If you don't meet your goal on the first try, don't give up! Take a systematic look at where, when and why things got off track and then make realistic adjustments to get back on course. Maybe going from 1 to 6 servings of vegetables per day is a little ambitious but going from 1 to 3 is totally doable. 3. Plan ahead. Think about how your resolutions fit in with what your life looks like right now . For example, if you want to make and stick to a budget in 2020, pick a system and a schedule for tracking spending (e.g., an Excel spreadsheet that you update every Sunday at 8 p.m.). 4. Teamwork makes the dream work. Working on resolutions alone can be HARD, but it's easier if you have someone to keep you accountable. Connecting with a friend, coworker, or family member can provide you both with encouragement when things are tough. Celebrating your wins with someone else is always more fun! For support in setting and sticking to personal goals, Work/Life Connections-EAP (615-936-1327) offers confidential counseling and coaching for a wide range of concerns. Get SMART Don't give up! Plan ahead Teamwork makes the dream work Susan Bosworth MSN, RN-BC, FNP Nursing Education Specialist -Nursing Education & Professional Development, Nurse Residency Program Director & Communicable Disease Response Unit Training Coordinator Passion at Work How do you bond and build community with your coworkers? I enjoy being innovative with team- building activities. It is important that activities are fun and engaging so that people want and enjoy participating in them. One example of a team-building exercise is putting together a puzzle where each participant is given only a piece of the puzzle. To complete the exercise, they must work together to communicate the best way to accomplish the task. How do you exhibit Credo behavior? Commitment to colleagues is extremely important to me. Whether it is my peers, the staff I am training or my direct supervisor, I want to help make sure all voices are heard. Team- building exercises support this goal by creating a safe space for people to share and value the input of each team member. What do you do to celebrate the accomplishments of others on your team? Each staff meeting is started with team members sharing a win \u2014 personal or professional. Whether it is a successful onboarding of nurse residents, a newly published article, birth of a child, or graduations, each win is shared and celebrated. What keeps you connected to and passionate about your work? Success starts with a great team. When I've heard that the professional development facilitated by our team resulted in a positive impact on patient outcomes, it motivates us to increased excellence. Occupational Health Clinic talk: Winter is \"CO\"ming: Keep Yourself Safe from Carbon Monoxide! Lori Rolando, MD, MPH, FACOEM, Director Occupational Health Clinic It's that time of year again \u2014 when the temperature drops, and the heat is turned up. Remember to protect your family from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas, is pro - duced by burning fuels containing carbon monoxide (e.g., wood, coal, gasoline, and natural gases). Potential sources of carbon monoxide build-up in enclosed spaces include furnaces, kerosene space heaters, gas and wood-burning fireplaces, other gas appliances, and car exhaust. Know the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning and how to prevent it to be safe. Overexposure to carbon monoxide can cause a variety of symptoms. Infants, the elderly, and those with chronic lung or heart problems are at increased risk. Symptoms can include headache, dizziness, confusion, nausea/vomit - ing, weakness, and loss of consciousness. Severe levels of exposure can cause seizures, irregular heart rhythms, or myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle). It can even be fatal; recognition of exposure is crucial. As Dr. Donna Seger, Professor of Clinical Medicine and Executive Director of the Tennessee Poison Center, notes: \"Carbon monoxide can cause symptoms at the time of exposure and delayed symptoms. If you think you have been exposed, call your doctor.\" It is extremely important to proactively protect yourself and your family. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), some tips to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning include: Proper installation of fuel-burning appliances. Annual servicing of gas-, oil- and coal-burning appli - ances by a certified professional. Avoiding running vehicles in enclosed spaces, such as a garage. Annual cleaning of fireplaces to keep fuel-burning appliances properly vented. Installing and maintaining carbon monoxide detectors. Dr. Seger reminds us that: \"carbon monoxide detectors can be lifesaving. You should have one on each floor of your house.\" She also stresses the importance of taking carbon monoxide alarms seriously, with this reminder: \"if the alarm goes off, get out of the house and call the fire department.\" Healthy Lifestyle Change: How One Person Made Big Changes Stick Making healthy lifestyle changes stick is really tough. To learn about what it takes, we turn to Dr. Katherine E. Hartman who has made huge strides in improving and sustaining her health in recent years. 1. What made you decide to make a lifestyle change to include regular fitness activities? I knew something had to change as I was sliding towards Type 2 diabetes, had a surgical injury projected to cause permanent limitations in mobility, and would soon have limitations in normal daily activities, like carrying groceries, traveling for college tours with our kids, and taking long walks with our dogs. 2. How difficult was it to incorporate regular fitness into your life? Once I decided I couldn't accept a steady decline in function and increase in disease risk, change wasn't difficult, it was required. Creative solutions for regaining functional fitness and for improving our family's habits became more obvious. I traded down to an inexpensive car and used the \"found money\" to work with an experienced trainer. My husband and I began to overhaul how we planned meals \u2014 nixing take-out and other conveniences. I spent early mornings in the gym. As my abilities improved I added activities, like biking, hiking, and running. I got to a healthy body weight and never looked back. By then, I was hooked on the amazing things our bodies can do when we train steadily, prevent injuries, and have specific goals. I found a sport that I love, kettlebell lifting in competition, and a tribe of people with whom I enjoy training and spending time. The whole structure of my life had been overhauled for the good. 3. What motivates you to continue your fitness routine? Having once been told it would not be safe for me to take stairs or to do exercise other than swimming or non-weight bearing activities, then discovering otherwise, has made me grateful and aware of what we can accomplish through steady investments. I first got fit in my mid-40s. I'm now almost 56 and on a national competition team in my sport. That sense of possibility and achievements that protect my health and longevity make it easy to stay committed. Pairing that with a community of adult athletes who share constant encouragement is powerful protection against losing momentum.

Hartmann, MD, PhD Associate Dean, Clinical and Translational Scientist Development; Deputy Director, Institute for Medicine & Public Health; Director, Graduate Studies in Epidemiology; Professor, Obstetrics & Gynecology and Medicine New Achievements for the Health Plus Diabetes Prevention Program The Health Plus Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), offered to faculty/ staff or spouses who have predia - betes or are at high risk for develop- ing type 2 diabetes, has had a big year!

Yet, many Americans spend at least half their waking time sitting \u2014 in cars, on sofas, and in front of phones, TVs and computers. Sitting too much is now recognized as a health hazard. What is too much? Sitting for 6 or more hours a day increases your risk of premature death by 19%, compared with people who sit fewer than 3 hours, according to research by the American Cancer Society last year. Those reporting the most leisure time sitting had higher risks of death from numerous medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes; kidney, lung, liver and nervous disorders; and musculoskeletal disorders. Make a habit of standing up and moving as often as possible \u2014 as you read, watch TV , or talk or text on your phone. Walk around if you can do so safely. Take breaks at work to refill your water bottle to ensure you're moving and staying hydrated during the day. Fit in some simple stretches at your desk, such as this example from the Health Plus Desk Yoga Workout: 1. Begin by standing at your desk with feet shoulder width apart. 2. Place both hands on the desk and walk back until your back is straight and your hips are directly over your feet. This stretch will be felt in the back, arms, and legs. 3. Hold for 10 to 30 seconds.
