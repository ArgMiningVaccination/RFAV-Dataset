ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) ACTH is extracted from the pituitary glands of animals or made synthetically. ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to release glucocorticoid hormones. These hormones are anti-inflammatory in nature, reducing edema and other aspects of inflammation. Data from the early 1970s indicate that ACTH may reduce the duration of MS exacerbations. In recent years it has been determined that synthetically glucocorticoid hormones (e.g., cortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone, dexamethasone), which can be directly administered without the use of ACTH, are more potent, cause less sodium retention and less potassium loss, and are longer-acting than ACTH. Activities of daily living (ADLs) Activities of daily living include any daily activity a person performs for self-care (feeding, grooming, bathing, dressing), work, homemaking, and leisure. The ability to perform ADLs is often used as a measure of ability/disability in MS. Acute Having rapid onset, usually with recovery; not chronic or long-lasting. Acute attack See Exacerbation Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) ADEM is a brief but intense attack of inflammation in the brain, spinal cord and occasionally optic nerve that causes damage to myelin. Acute partial transverse myelitis Indicates an acute (rapid onset) spinal cord inflammation that is positioned across the partial width of the spinal cord. Acute transverse myelitis Indicates an acute (rapid onset) of spinal cord inflammation that is positioned across the width of the spinal cord. Addison-Schilder disease (adrenoleukodystophy) A rare genetic disease characterized by a loss of myelin surrounding nerve cells in the brain and progressive adrenal gland dysfunction. It is a metabolic disorder combining the characteristics of Addison's disease and cerebral sclerosis (Schilder disease). Adductor muscle A muscle that pulls inward toward the midline of the body (e.g., the adductor leg muscles are used to pull the legs together). ADLs See Activities of daily living. Advance (medical) directive Advance directives preserve the person's right to accept or reject a course of medical treatment even after the person becomes mentally or physically incapacitated to the point of being unable to communicate those wishes. Advance directives come in two basic forms: (1) a living will, in which the person outlines specific treatment guidelines that are to be followed by health care providers; (2) a health care proxy (also called a power of attorney for health care decision-making), in which the person designates a trusted individual to make medical decisions in the event that he or she becomes too incapacitated to make such decisions. Advance directive requirements vary greatly from one state to another and should therefore be drawn up in consultation with an attorney who is familiar with the laws of the particular state. Affective release Also called pseudo-bulbar affect or pathological laughing and weeping; a condition in which episodes of laughing and/or crying occur with no apparent precipitating event. The person's actual mood may be unrelated to the emotion being expressed. This condition is thought to be caused by lesions in the limbic system, a group of brain structures involved in emotional feeling and expression. Afferent pupillary defect An abnormal reflex response to light that is a sign of nerve fiber damage due to optic neuritis. A pupil normally gets smaller when a light is shined either into that eye (direct response) or the other eye (indirect response). In an afferent pupillary defect (also called Marcus Gunn pupil), there is a relative decrease in the direct response. This is most clearly demonstrated by the \"swinging flashlight test.\" When the flashlight is shined first in the abnormal eye, then in the healthy eye, and then again in the eye with the pupillary defect, the affected pupil becomes larger rather than smaller. See Ankle-foot orthosis. Ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) An ankle-foot orthosis is a brace, usually plastic, that is worn on the lower leg and foot to support the ankle and correct foot drop. By holding the foot and ankle in the correct position, the AFO promotes correct heel-toe walking. Allodynia A sensitivity to touch in which clothing or a light touch with a finger causes significant discomfort or pain. Antibody Protein produced by certain cells of the immune system, which is produced in response to bacteria, viruses, and other types of foreign antigens. Anticholinergic Refers to the action of certain medications commonly used in the management of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. These medications inhibit the transmission of parasympathetic nerve impulses and thereby reduce spasms of smooth muscle in the bladder. Antigen Any substance that triggers the immune system to produce an antibody; generally refers to infectious or toxic substances. Aquaporin Water channels through which water moves in cells; also known as the 'plumbing system' of the cells. Aquaporin 4 An aquaporin found in the nervous system that is the primary target of NMO. Aspiration Inhalation of food particles or fluids into lungs. Aspiration pneumonia Inflammation of the lungs due to aspiration. Assistive devices Any tools that are designed, fabricated, and/or adapted to assist a person in performing a particular task, e.g., cane, walker, shower chair. Assistive technology A term used to describe all of the tools, products, and devices, from the simplest to the most complex, that can make a particular function easier or possible to perform. Ataxia The incoordination and unsteadiness that result from the brain's failure to regulate the body's posture and the strength and direction of limb movements. Ataxia is most often caused by disease activity in the cerebellum. Atrophy A wasting away or decrease in size of a cell, tissue, or organ of the body because of disease or lack of use. Autoantibody A substance produced by the body's immune system against its own cells, which it mistakenly recognizes as a threat. NMO-IgG is an example of an autoantibody. Autoimmune condition or disorder A process in which the body's own immune system causes illness by mistakenly attacking healthy cells, organs, or tissue in the body. Autoimmune disease A process in which the body's immune system causes illness by mistakenly attacking healthy cells, organs, or tissues in the body that are essential for good health. Multiple sclerosis is believed to be an autoimmune disease, along with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and many others. The precise origin and pathophysiologic processes of these diseases are unknown. Autonomic nervous system The part of the nervous system that regulates involuntary vital functions, including the activity of the cardiac (heart) muscle, smooth muscles (e.g., of the gut), and glands. The autonomic nervous system has two divisions: the sympathetic nervous system accelerates heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and raises blood pressure; the parasympathetic nervous system slows heart rate, increases intestinal and gland activity, and relaxes sphincter muscles. Axon The extension or prolongation of a nerve cell (neuron) that conducts impulses to other nerve cells or muscles. Axons are generally smaller than 1 micron (1 micron = 1/1,000,000 of a meter) in diameter, but can be as much as a half meter in length. Many axons in the central nervous system are covered with myelin. Axonal Pertaining to the axon. Axonal damage Injury to the axon in the nervous sytem, generally as a consequence of trauma or disease. This damage may involve temporary, reversible effects or permanent severing of the axon. Axonal damage usually results in short-term changes in nervous system activity, or permanent inability of nerve fibers to send their signals from one part of the nervous system to another or from nerve fibers to muscles. The damage can thus result in a variety of symptoms relating to sensory or motor function.

B-cell A type of lymphocyte (white blood cell) manufactured in the bone marrow that makes antibodies. Babinski reflex A neurologic sign in MS in which stroking the outside sole of the foot with a pointed object causes an upward (extensor) movement of the big toe rather than the normal (flexor) bunching and downward movement of the toes. Bell's palsy A paralysis of the facial nerve (usually on one side of the face), which can occur as a consequence of MS, viral infection, or other infections. It has acute onset and can be transient or permanent. Blinding An attempt to eliminate bias in the interpretation of clinical trial outcomes. It indicates that at least one party involved in the clinical trial is unaware of which patients are receiving the experimental treatment and which are receiving the control substance. Trials may be either single-blind (patients do not know which treatment they are receiving) or doubled-blind (neither the examining physicians nor the patients know which treatment each patient is receiving). Blood-brain barrier A semipermeable cell layer around blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that prevents large molecules, immune cells, and potentially damaging substances and disease-causing organisms (e.g., viruses) from passing out of the blood stream into the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). A break in the blood-brain barrier may underlie the disease process in MS. Brain That part of the central nervous system that is contained within the cranium (skull). Brainstem The part of the central nervous system that houses the nerve centers of the head as well as the centers for respiration and heart control. It extends from the base of the brain to the spinal cord. Brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) A test in which the brain's electrical activity in response to auditory stimuli (e.g., clicking sounds) is recorded by an electroencephalograph and analyzed by computer. Demyelination results in a slowing of response time. This test is sometimes useful in the diagnosis of MS because it can confirm the presence of a suspected lesion or identify the presence of an unsuspected lesion that has produced no symptoms. BAEPs have been shown to be less useful in the diagnosis of MS than either visual or somatosensory evoked potentials. Balance El equilibrio o esfuerzo de Pueden un esclerosis se en personas (ir al principio de la p\u00e1gina) Carrier A person or animal that is infected with a specific infectious agent (such as HTLV-1) without obvious signs of disease but is able to transmit the disease to non-infected individuals. Catheter A hollow, flexible tube, made of plastic or rubber, which can be inserted through the urinary opening into the bladder to drain excess urine that cannot be excreted normally. Central nervous system (CNS) The part of the nervous system that includes the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. The nerves that leave the spinal cord and go to the rest of the body make up the 'peripheral nervous system'. Cerebellum A part of the brain situated above the brainstem that controls balance and coordination of movement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A watery, colorless, clear fluid that bathes and protects the brain and spinal cord. The composition of this fluid can be altered by a variety of diseases. Certain changes in CSF that are characteristic of MS can be detected with a lumbar puncture (spinal tap), a test sometimes used to help make the MS diagnosis. Cerebrum The large, upper part of the brain that acts as a master control system and is responsible for initiating thought and motor activity. Its two hemispheres, united by the corpus callosum, form the largest part of the central nervous system. Cerebral Pertaining to the cerebrum. Chronic Of long duration, not acute; a term often used to describe a disease that shows gradual worsening. Chronic progressive A former \"catch-all\" term for progressive forms of MS. Clinical finding An observation made during a medical examination indicating change or impairment in a physical or mental function. Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) A first neurologic event that is suggestive of demyelination, accompanied by multiple, clinically \"silent\" (asymptomatic) lesions on MRI that are typical of MS. Individuals with this syndrome are at high risk for developing clinically definite MS. Clinical trial Rigorously controlled studies designed to provide extensive data that will allow for statistically valid evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a particular treatment. Clonus A sign of spasticity in which involuntary shaking or jerking of the leg occurs when the toe is placed on the floor with the knee slightly bent. The shaking is caused by repeated, rhythmic, reflex muscle contractions. Cognition High level functions carried out by the human brain, including comprehension and use of speech, visual perception and construction, calculation ability, attention (information processing), memory, and executive functions such as planning, problem-solving, and self-monitoring. Cognitive impairment Changes in cognitive function caused by trauma or disease process. Some degree of cognitive impairment occurs in approximately 50-60 percent of people with MS, with memory, information processing, and executive functions being the most commonly affected functions. Cognitive rehabilitation Techniques designed to improve the functioning of individuals whose cognition is impaired because of physical trauma or disease. Rehabilitation strategies are designed to improve the impaired function via repetitive drills or practice, or to compensate for impaired functions that are not likely to improve. Cognitive rehabilitation is provided by psychologists and neuropsychologists, speech/language pathologists, and occupational therapists. While these three types of specialists use different assessment tools and treatment strategies, they share the common goal of improving the individual's ability to function as independently and safely as possible in the home and work environment. Combined (bladder) dysfunction A type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is MS (also called detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia\u2014DESD). Simultaneous contractions of the bladder's detrusor muscle and external sphincter cause urine to be trapped in the bladder, resulting in symptoms of urinary urgency, hesitancy, dribbling, and incontinence. Computerized axial tomography (CT scan) A non-invasive diagnostic radiology technique for examining soft tissues of the body. A computer integrates X-ray scanned \"slices\" of the organ being examined into a cross-sectional picture. Condom catheter A tube connected to a thin, flexible sheath that is worn over the penis to allow drainage of urine into a collection system; can be used to manage male urinary incontinence. Constipation A condition in which bowel movements happen less frequently than is normal for the particular individual, or the stool is small, hard, and difficult or painful to pass. Contraction A shortening of muscle fibers that results in the movement of a joint. Contracture A permanent shortening of the muscles and tendons adjacent to a joint, which can result from severe, untreated spasticity and interferes with normal movement around the affected joint. If left untreated, the affected joint can become frozen in a flexed (bent) position. Controlled study A clinical trial that compares the outcome of a group of randomly-assigned patients who receive the experimental treatment to the outcome of a group of randomly-assigned patients who receive a standard treatment or inactive placebo. Coordination An organized working together of muscles and groups of muscles aimed at bringing about a purposeful movement such as walking or standing. Corpus callosum The broad band of nerve fiber tissue that connects the two cerebral hemispheres of the brain. Cortex The outer layer of brain tissue. Corticosteroid Any of the natural or synthetic hormones associated with the adrenal cortex (which influences or controls many body processes). Corticosteroids include glucocorticoids, which have an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive role in the treatment of MS exacerbations. Cortisone A glucocorticoid steroid hormone, produced by the adrenal glands or synthetically, that has anti-inflammatory and immune-system suppressing properties. Prednisone and prednisolone also belong to this group of substances. Cranial nerves Nerves that carry sensory, motor, or parasympathetic fibers to the face and neck. Included among this group of twelve nerves are the optic nerve (vision), trigeminal nerve (sensation along the face), vagus nerve (pharynx and vocal cords). Evaluation of cranial nerve function is part of the standard neurologic exam. CT scan See Computerized axial tomography. Cystoscopy A diagnostic procedure in which a special viewing device called a cystoscope is inserted into the urethra (a tubular structure that drains urine from the bladder) to examine the inside of the urinary bladder. Cystostomy A surgically created opening through the lower abdomen into the urinary bladder. A plastic tube inserted into the opening drains urine from the bladder into a plastic collection bag. This relatively simple procedure is done when a person requires an indwelling catheter to drain excess urine from the bladder but cannot, for some reason, have it pass through the urethral opening. Cytokines Messenger chemicals produced by various cells, particularly those of the immune system, to influence the activity of other cells.

All Medicare Part D plans include catastrophic coverage for prescription costs. Coverage gap Also called a \"Doughnut Hole,\" this is a gap in insurance coverage during which you must pay the majority of your drug costs. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, the coverage gap is being phased out and will be completely eliminated in 2020. Creditable coverage Drug coverage that is \"just as good as\" coverage provided by Medicare prescription drug plans. Your current insurer must tell you if the drug coverage you now have qualifies as 'creditable coverage'. Deep tendon reflexes The involuntary jerks that are normally produced at certain spots on a limb when the tendons are tapped with a hammer. Reflexes are tested as part of the standard neurologic exam. Degenerative disease A disease in which the function or structure of the affected tissues or organs changes for the worse over time. Dementia A generally profound and progressive loss of intellectual function, sometimes associated with personality change that results from loss of brain substance and is sufficient to interfere with a person's normal functional activities. Demyelinating disorder A disease that damages the myelin (insulation around nerve cells) in the central nervous system. Demyelination A loss of myelin in the white matter of the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord). Decubitus An ulcer (sore) of the skin resulting from pressure and lack of movement such as occurs when a person is bed- or wheelchair-bound. The ulcers occur most frequently in areas where the bone lies directly under the skin, such as elbow, hip, or over the coccyx (tailbone). A decubitus ulcer may become infected and cause general worsening of the person's health. DESD See Detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia. Detrusor muscle A muscle of the urinary bladder that contracts and causes the bladder to empty. Detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia (DESD) See Combined (bladder) dysfunction. Devic's disease Another name for Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO). Devic's syndrome Another name for Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO). Diplopia Double vision, or the simultaneous awareness of two images of the same object that results from a failure of the two eyes to work in a coordinated fashion. Covering one eye will erase one of the images. Disablement As defined by the World Health Organization, a disability (resulting from an impairment) is a restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being. DNA Short for deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA constitutes the chemical basis for genes, the basic units of heredity. See Gene. Double-blind clinical study A study in which none of the participants, including experimental subjects, examining doctors, attending nurses, or any other research staff, know who is taking the test drug and who is taking a control or placebo agent. The purpose of this research design is to avoid inadvertent bias of the test results. In all studies, procedures are designed to \"break the blind\" if medical circumstances require it. Dysarthria Poorly articulated speech resulting from dysfunction of the muscles controlling speech, usually caused by damage to the central nervous system or a peripheral motor nerve. The content and meaning of the spoken words remain normal. Dysesthesia Distorted or unpleasant sensations experienced by a person when the skin is touched, that are typically caused by abnormalities in the sensory pathways in the brain and spinal cord. Dysmetria A disturbance of coordination, caused by lesions in the cerebellum. A tendency to over- or underestimate the extent of motion needed to place an arm or leg in a certain position as, for example, in overreaching for an object. Dysphagia Difficulty in swallowing. It is a neurologic or neuromuscular symptom that may result in aspiration (whereby food or saliva enters the airway), slow swallowing (possibly resulting in inadequate nutrition), or both. Dysphonia Disorders of voice quality (including poor pitch control, hoarseness, breathiness, and hypernasality) caused by spasticity, weakness, and incoordination of muscles in the mouth and throat.

EEG See Electroencephalography Electroencephalography (EEG) A diagnostic procedure that records, via electrodes attached to various areas of the person's head, electrical activity generated by brain cells. Electromyography (EMG) Electromyography is a diagnostic procedure that records muscle electrical potentials through a needle or small plate electrodes. The test can also measure the ability of peripheral nerves to conduct impulses. EMG See Electromyography. Endemic A disease that is constantly present to a greater or lesser degree in people living in a particular location. Erectile dysfunction The inability to attain or retain a rigid penile erection. Etiology The study of all factors that may be involved in the development of a disease, including the patient's susceptibility, the nature of the disease-causing agent, and the way in which the person's body is invaded by the agent. Euphoria Unrealistic cheerfulness and optimism, accompanied by a lessening of critical faculties; generally considered to be a result of damage to the brain. Evoked potential (EP) tests Recordings of the nervous system's electrical response to the stimulation of specific sensory pathways (e.g., visual, auditory, general sensory). Because damage to myelin(demyelination) results in a slowing of response time, EPs can sometimes provide evidence of scarring along nerve pathways that does not show up during the neurologic exam. Evoked potentials (EPs) EPs are recordings of the nervous system's electrical response to the stimulation of specific sensory pathways (e.g., visual, auditory, general sensory). In tests of evoked potentials, a person's recorded responses are displayed on an oscilloscope and analyzed on a computer that allows comparison with normal response times. Demyelination results in a slowing of response time. EPs can demonstrate lesions along specific nerve pathways whether or not the lesions are producing symptoms, thus making this test useful in confirming the diagnosis of MS. Visual evoked potentials are considered the most useful in MS. Exacerbation The appearance of new symptoms or the aggravation of old ones, lasting at least twenty-four hours (synonymous with attack, relapse, flare-up, or worsening); usually associated with inflammation and demyelination in the brain or spinal cord. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) A part of the Minimal Record of Disability that summarizes the neurologic examination and provides a measure of overall disability. The EDSS is a 20-point scale, ranging from 0 (normal examination) to 10 (death due to MS) by half-points. A person with a score of 4.5 can walk three blocks without stopping; a score of 6.0 means that a cane or a leg brace is needed to walk one block; a score over 7.5 indicates that a person cannot take more than a few steps, even with crutches or help from another person. The EDSS is used for many reasons, including deciding future medical treatment, establishing rehabilitation goals, choosing subjects for participation in clinical trials, and measuring treatment outcomes. This is currently the most widely used scale in clinical trials. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis is an autoimmune disease resembling MS that has been induced in some genetically susceptible research animals. Before testing on humans, a potential treatment for MS may first be tested on laboratory animals with EAE in order to determine the treatment's efficacy and safety Extensor spasm A symptom of spasticity in which the legs straighten suddenly into a stiff, extended position. These spasms, which typically last for several minutes, occur most commonly in bed at night or on rising from bed. EAE V\u00e9ase \"Encefalomielitis al\u00e9rgica de placebo.

The bladder tends to overfill and become flaccid, resulting in symptoms of urinary urgency, hesitancy, dribbling, and incontinence. Failure to store (bladder) A type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in MS resulting from demyelination of the pathways between the spinal cord and brain. Typically seen in a small, spastic bladder, storage failure can cause symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, incontinence, and nocturia. FDA See Food and Drug Administration. Finger-to-nose test As a test of dysmetria and intention tremor, the person is asked, with eyes closed, to touch the tip of the nose with the tip of the index finger. This test is part of the standard neurologic exam. Flaccid A decrease in muscle tone resulting in weakened muscles and therefore loose, \"floppy\" limbs. Flexor spasm Involuntary, sometimes painful contractions of the flexor muscles, which pull the legs upward into a clenched position. These spasms, which last two to three seconds, are symptoms of spasticity. They often occur during sleep, but can also occur when the person is in a seated position. Flower cells Lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell in the immune system) with petal-shaped nuclei that look like flowers. Foley catheter See Indwelling catheter. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The U.S. federal agency that is responsible for enforcing governmental regulations pertaining to the manufacture and sale of food, drugs, and cosmetics. Its role is to prevent the sale of impure or dangerous substances. Any new drug that is proposed for the treatment of MS in the United States must be approved by the FDA. Frontal lobes The largest lobes of the brain. The anterior (front) part of each of the cerebral hemispheres that make up the cerebrum. The back part of the frontal lobe is the motor cortex, which controls voluntary movement; the area of the frontal lobe that is further forward is concerned with learning, behavior, judgment, and personality.

Drugs not on the formulary are generally not covered by private health plans. Off-label medications (those prescribed for a reason other than the use approved by the FDA) also are not generally covered by Medicare Part D Plans. Gadolinium A chemical compound that can be administered to a person during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to help distinguish between new lesions and old lesions. After being injected into a vein, the compound leaks into areas that are inflamed, thereby identifying the new, active lesions. See Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Gadolinium-enhancing lesion A lesion appearing on magnetic resonance imagery, following injection of the chemical compound gadolinium, that reveals a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier. This breakdown of the blood-brain barrier indicates either a newly active lesion or the re-activation of an old one. See Gadolinium. Gastrocolic reflex A mass peristaltic (coordinated, rhythmic, smooth muscle contraction that acts to force food through the digestive tract) movement of the colon that often occurs fifteen to thirty minutes after ingesting a meal. Gastrostomy See Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Gene A basic unit of heredity containing coded instructions for manufacturing a protein. Genes are subunits of chromosomes, which are strands of DNA contained within most cells. Glucocorticoid hormones Steroid hormones that are produced by the adrenal glands in response to stimulation by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary. These hormones, which be manufactured synthetically (prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone, dexamethasone), serve both an immunosuppressive an anti-inflammatory role in the treatment of MS exacerbations: they damage or destroy certain types of T-lymphocytes that are involved in the overactive immune response, and interfere with the release of certain inflammation-producing enzymes.

Heel-knee-shin test A test of coordination in which the person is asked, with eyes closed, to place one heel on the opposite knee and slide it up and down the shin. Helper T-lymphocytes White blood cells that are a major contributor to the immune system's inflammatory response against myelin. Hemiparesis Weakness of one side of the body, including one arm and one leg. Hemiplegia Paralysis of one side of the body, including one arm and one leg. Human genome The total set of genes (approximately 90,000 to 100,000) arranged on two sets of 23 chromosomes in most cells of the human body. The Human Genome Project is an international program that was launched in 1990 to map the building blocks of DNA in the genome and determine the function of every gene. Although the mapping of DNA in the human genome has recently been completed, it will take many more years to identify the individual genes and determine their function. This endeavor is expected to provide further basic understanding of human genetics, as well as information that will contribute to the treatment and prevention of diseases. Hyperbaric oxygen A procedure in which the person breathes oxygen under greater than atmospheric pressure in a specially constructed chamber. Once thought to be a potential treatment for MS, it has been evaluated in several controlled, double-blind studies and found to be ineffective for this purpose. Habla escandida Lenguaje en una o familia, pr\u00e1cticas y ambiente. Una myelitis that has no identified cause. Immune system A complex network of glands, tissues, circulating cells, and processes that protect the body by identifying abnormal or foreign substances and neutralizing them. Immune-mediated disease A disease in which components of the immune system--t cells, antibodies, and others--are responsible for the disease either directly (as occurs in autoimmunity) or indirectly (for example, when damage to the body occurs secondary to an immune assault on a foreign antigen such as a bacteria or virus). (as occurs in autoimmunity) or (for example, when damage to the body occurs secondary to an immune assault on a foreign antigen such as a bacteria or virus). Immune-Mediated Encephalomyelitis Another term for ADEM. Immunocompetent cells White blood cells (B- and T-lymphocytes and others) that defend against invading agents in the body. Immunoglobulin See Antibody. Immunology The science that concerns the body's mechanisms for protecting itself from abnormal or foreign substances. Immunosuppression In MS, a form of treatment that slows or inhibits the body's natural immune responses, including those directed against the body's own tissues. Examples of immunosuppressive treatments in MS include mitoxantrone, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and azathioprine. Impairment As defined by the World Health Organization, an impairment is any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function. It represents a deviation from the person's usual biomedical state. An impairment is thus any loss of function directly resulting from injury or disease. Incidence The number of new cases of a disease in a specified population over a defined period of time. The incidence of MS in the United States is approximately 10,000 newly-diagnosed people per year. Incontinence Also called spontaneous voiding; the inability to control passage of urine or bowel movements. Indwelling catheter A type of catheter (see Catheter) that remains in the bladder on a temporary or permanent basis. It is used only when intermittent catheterization is not possible or is medically contraindicated. The most common type of indwelling catheter is a Foley catheter, which consists of a flexible rubber tube that is inserted in the bladder to allow the urine to flow into an external drainage bag. A small balloon, inflated after insertion, holds the Foley catheter in place. Inflammation A tissue's immunologic response to injury, characterized by mobilization of white blood cells and antibodies, swelling, and fluid accumulation. This immunologic response can occur anywhere in the body. Innervation The supply or conduction of nervous impulses to a muscle or body part. Intention tremor Rhythmic shaking that occurs in the course of a purposeful movement, such as reaching to pick something up or bringing an outstretched finger in to touch one's nose. Interferon A group of immune system proteins, produced and released by cells infected by a virus, which inhibit viral multiplication and modify the body's immune response. Three interferon beta medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating relapsing A naturally-occurring substance in the body, produced primarily by activated T cells, which promotes inflammation and is thought to be involved in MS exacerbations. Once tried as a treatment for MS, it was found to make the disease worse. Interferon beta works to counteract the effects of interferon gamma. Intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) A procedure in which the person periodically inserts a catheter into the urinary opening to drain urine from the bladder. ISC is used in the management of bladder dysfunction to drain urine that remains after voiding, prevent bladder distention, prevent kidney damage, and restore bladder function. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia A disturbance of coordinated eye movements in which the eye turned outward to look toward the side develops nystagmus (rapid, involuntary movements) while the other eye simultaneously fails to turn completely inward. This neurologic sign, of which the person is usually unaware, can be detected during the neurologic exam. Intrathecal space The space surrounding the brain and spinal cord that contains cerebrospinal fluid. Intravenous Within a vein; often used in the context of an injection into a vein of medication dissolved in a liquid.

It begins three months before the month you meet the eligibility requirements for Medicare (usually your 65th birthday or 25th month after you have been approved for Social Security Disability Insurance) and ends 3 months after the month you are first eligible. Junta Asesora M\u00e9dica Una junta o grupo de los del estudio se han alcanzado. Lesion See Plaque. Leukocyte White blood cell. L-Hermitte's sign An abnormal sensation of electricity or \"pins and needles\" going down the spine into the arms and legs that occurs when the neck is bent forward so that the chin touches the chest. Living will See Advance (medical) directive. Loftstrand crutch A type of crutch with an attached holder for the forearm that provides extra support. Longitudinally Extensive Transverse Myelitis (LETM) A spinal cord lesion extending over 3 or more vertebral segments, often with swelling of the cord and enhancement with contrast on MRI imaging. Lumbar puncture A diagnostic procedure that uses a hollow needle (canula) to penetrate the spinal canal at the level of third-fourth or fourth-fifth lumbar vertebrae to remove cerebrospinal fluid for analysis. This procedure is used to examine the cerebrospinal fluid for changes in composition that are characteristic of MS (e.g., elevated white cell count, elevated protein content, the presence of oligoclonal bands). Lymphocyte A type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system. Lymphocytes can be subdivided into two main groups: B-lymphocytes, which originate in the bone marrow and produce antibodies; T-lymphocytes, which are produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus. Helper T-lymphocytes heighten the production of antibodies by B-lymphocytes; suppressor T-lymphocytes suppress B-lymphocyte activity and seem to be in short supply during an MS exacerbation.

Macrophage A white blood cell with scavenger characteristics that has the ability to ingest and destroy foreign substances such as bacteria and cell debris. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) A diagnostic procedure that produces visual images of different body parts without the use of X-rays. Nuclei of atoms are influenced by a high frequency electromagnetic impulse inside a strong magnetic field. The nuclei then give off resonating signals that can produce pictures of parts of the body. An important diagnostic tool in MS, MRI makes it possible to visualize and count lesions in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Marcus Gunn pupil See Afferent pupillary defect. Minimal Record of Disability (MRD) A standardized method for quantifying the clinical status of a person with MS. The MRD is made up of five parts: demographic information; the Neurological Functional Systems (developed by John Kurtzke), which assign scores to clinical findings for each of the various neurologic systems in the brain and spinal cord (pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, visual, mental, bowel and bladder); the Expanded Disability Status Scale (developed by John Kurtzke), which gives a single composite score for the person's disease; the Incapacity Status Scale, which is an inventory of functional disabilities relating to activities of daily living; the Environmental Status Scale, which provides an assessment of social handicap resulting from chronic illness. The MRD has two main functions: to assist doctors and other professionals in planning and coordinating the care of persons with MS, and to provide a standardized means of recording repeated clinical evaluations of individuals for research purposes. See Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Monoclonal antibodies Laboratory-produced antibodies, which can be programmed to react against a specific antigen in order to suppress the immune response. Motor neurons Nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord that enable movement of various parts of the body. Motor point block See Nerve block. MRI See Magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) A three-part, standardized, quantitative assessment instrument for use in clinical trials in MS, that was developed by the Task Force on Clinical Outcomes Assessment appointed by the National MS Society's Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of New Agents in Multiple Sclerosis. The three components of the MSFC measure leg function/ambulation (Timed 25-Foot Walk), arm/hand function (9-Hole Peg Test), and cognitive function (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)). Muscle tone A characteristic of a muscle brought about by the constant flow of nerve stimuli to that muscle, which describes its resistance to stretching. Abnormal muscle tone can be defined as: hypertonus (increased muscle tone, as in spasticity); hypotonus (reduced muscle tone); flaccid (paralysis); atony (loss of muscle tone). Muscle tone is evaluated as part of the standard neurologic exam in MS. Myelin A soft, white coating of nerve fibers in the central nervous system, composed of lipids (fats) and protein. Myelin serves as insulation and as an aid to efficient nerve fiber conduction. When myelin is damaged in MS, nerve fiber conduction is faulty or absent. Impaired bodily functions or altered sensations associated with those demyelinated nerve fibers are identified as symptoms of MS in various parts of the body. Myelin basic protein One of several proteins associated with the myelin of the central nervous system, which may be found in higher than normal concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with MS and other diseases that damage myelin. Myelitis An inflammatory disease of the spinal cord. In transverse myelitis, the inflammation spreads across the tissue of the spinal cord, resulting in a loss of its normal function to transmit nerve impulses up and down, as though the spinal cord had been severed. Myelogram An X-ray procedure by which the spinal canal and the spinal cord can be visualized. It is performed in conjunction with a lumbar puncture and injection of a special X-ray contrast material into the spinal canal. Myelopathy A disease of the spinal cord. Macr\u00f3fago examen neurol\u00f3gico, en la cual se utilizando imaginariamente Nerve A of nerve fibers (axons). The fibers are either afferent (leading toward the brain and serving in the perception of sensory stimuli of the skin, joints, muscles, and inner organs) or efferent (leading away from the brain and mediating contractions of muscles or organs). Nerve block A procedure used to relieve otherwise intractable spasticity, including painful flexor spasms. An injection of phenol into the affected nerve interferes with the function of that nerve for up to three months, potentially increasing a person's comfort and mobility. Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) NMO is an autoimmune disorder in which immune system cells and antibodies mistakenly attack and destroy myelin cells in the optic nerves and the spinal cord. The damage to the optic nerves produces swelling and inflammation that cause pain and loss of vision; the damage to the spinal cord causes weakness or paralysis in the legs or arms, loss of sensation, and problems with bladder and bowel function. Nervous system Includes all of the neural structures in the body: the central nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves; the peripheral nervous system consists of the nerve roots, nerve plexi, and nerves throughout the body. consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves; the peripheral nervous system consists of the nerve roots, nerve plexi, and nerves throughout the body. Neuroendocrine Refers to the relationship between the body's nervous system and endocrine system, whereby certain cells in the body release hormones in response to a neural stimulus. Neurogenic Related to activity of the nervous system, as in \"neurogenic bladder.\" Neurogenic bladder Bladder dysfunction associated with neurologic malfunction in the spinal cord and characterized by a failure to empty, failure to store, or a combination of the two. Symptoms that result from these three types of dysfunction include urinary urgency, frequency, hesitancy, nocturia, and incontinence. Neurologist Physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to the nervous system. Neurology Study of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system. Neuron The basic nerve cell of the nervous system. A neuron consists of a nucleus within a cell body and one or more processes (extensions) called dendrites and axons. Neuropsychologist A psychologist with specialized training in the evaluation of cognitive functions. Neuropsychologists use a battery of standardized tests to assess specific cognitive functions and identify areas of cognitive impairment. They also provide remediation for individuals with MS-related cognitive impairment. See Cognition and Cognitive impairment. NMO-IgG An autoantibody produced by the immune system against aquaporin 4, which it mistakenly recognizes as a threat. NMO-IgG is present in 70% of those diagnosed with NMO and is absent in most people with MS, including those with optic neuritis and myelitis. Nocturia The need to urinate during the night. Nystagmus Rapid, involuntary movements of the eyes in the horizontal or, occasionally, the vertical direction. Nervio Conjunto de de las principio de la p\u00e1gina) Occupational therapist (OT) Occupational therapist (OT) Occupational therapists assess functioning in activities of everyday living, including dressing, bathing, grooming, meal preparation, writing, and driving, which are essential for independent living. In making treatment recommendations, the OT addresses (1) fatigue management, (2) upper body strength, movement, and coordination, (3) adaptations to the home and work environment, including both structural changes and specialized equipment for particular activities, and (4) compensatory strategies for impairments in thinking, sensation, or vision. Oligoclonal bands A diagnostic sign indicating abnormal levels of certain antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid; seen in approximately 90 percent of people with multiple sclerosis, but not specific to MS. Oligodendrocyte A type of cell in the central nervous system that is responsible for making and supporting myelin. Olmstead Decision The Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v L.C. (1999) is an interpretation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that affirms the right of people with disabilities to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. The decision recognizes that unnecessary segregation of persons in long-term care facilities constitutes discrimination under the ADA.

The decision recognizes that unnecessary segregation of persons in long-term care facilities constitutes discrimination under the ADA. Open-label study A preliminary (Phase I) clinical trial in which all patients receive the experimental treatment. Ophthalmoscope An instrument designed for examination of the interior of the eye. Optic atrophy A wasting of the optic disc that results from partial or complete degeneration of optic nerve fibers and is associated with a loss of visual acuity. Optic disc The small blind spot on the surface of the retina where cells of the retina converge to form the optic nerve; the only part of the retina that is insensitive to light. Optic neuritis Inflammation or demyelination of the optic (visual) nerve with transient or permanent impairment of vision and occasionally pain. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) A scan that measures the thickness of the retina - the lining at the back of the eye. Orthotic Also called orthosis; a mechanical appliance such as a leg brace or splint that is specially designed to control, correct, or compensate for impaired limb function. Orthotist A person skilled in making mechanical appliances (orthotics) such as leg braces or splints that help to support limb function. See Orthotic. Oscillopsia Continuous, involuntary, and chaotic eye movements that result in a visual disturbance in which objects appear to be jumping or bouncing.

This is also the time you can enroll in the Medicare prescription drug benefit (Part D) if you do not enroll during your Initial Enrollment Period (you may have to pay a premium penalty if you enroll during this time unless you had drug coverage from another source that was at least as good as Medicare's and you were not without that coverage for more than 63 days). Your new coverage will begin January 1. Paralysis Inability to move a part of the body. Paraparesis A weakness but not total paralysis of the lower extremities (legs). Paraplegia Paralysis of both lower extremities (legs). Paresis Partial or incomplete paralysis of a part of the body. Paresthesia A spontaneously occurring sensation of burning, prickling, tingling, or creeping on the skin that may or may not be associated with any physical findings on neurologic examination. Paroxysmal spasm A sudden, uncontrolled limb contraction that occurs intermittently, lasts for a few moments, and then subsides. Paroxysmal symptom Any one of several symptoms that have sudden onset, apparently in response to some kind of movement or sensory stimulation, last for a few moments, and then subside. Paroxysmal symptoms tend to occur frequently in those individuals who have them, and follow a similar pattern from one episode to the next. Examples of paroxysmal symptoms include acute episodes of trigeminal neuralgia (sharp facial pain), tonic seizures (intense spasm of limb or limbs on one side of the body), dysarthria (slurred speech often accompanied by loss of balance and coordination), and various paresthesias (sensory disturbances ranging from tingling to severe pain). Partial transverse myelitis Spinal cord inflammation that is positioned across partial width of the spinal cord. PEG See Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) A PEG is a tube inserted into the stomach through the abdominal wall to provide food or other nutrients when eating by mouth is not possible. The tube is inserted in a bedside procedure using an endoscope to guide the tube through a small abdominal incision. An endoscope is a lighted instrument that allows the doctor to see inside the stomach. Percutaneous rhizotomy An outpatient surgical procedure used in the management of severe, intractable trigeminal neuralgia. The surgeon makes a tiny incision in the side of the person's face and blocks the function of the trigeminal nerve using laser surgery, cryosurgery (freezing), or cauterization. Periventricular region The area surrounding the four fluid-filled cavities within the brain. MS plaques are commonly found within this region. Physiatrist Physicians who specialize in physical medicine and rehabilitation, including the diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal injuries and pain syndromes, electrodiagnostic medicine (e.g., electromyography), and rehabilitation of severe impairments, including those caused by neurologic disease or injury. See Electromyography (EMG). Physical therapist (PT) Physical therapists are trained to evaluate and improve movement and function of the body, with particular attention to physical mobility, balance, posture, fatigue, and pain. The physical therapy program typically involves (1) educating the person with MS about the physical problems caused by the disease, (2) designing an individualized exercise program to address the problems, and (3) enhancing mobility and energy conservation through the use of a variety of mobility aids and adaptive equipment. Pilot study In clinical trials, an early, small-to-moderate-sized study (also known as Phase II) that follows the Phase I (\"safety study\") and is designed to begin determining the effectiveness of the experimental treatment. Placebo An inactive, non-drug compound that is designed to look just like the test drug. It is administered to control group subjects in double-blind clinical trials (in which neither the researchers nor the subjects know who is getting the drug and who is getting the placebo) as a means of assessing the benefits and liabilities of the test drug taken by experimental group subjects. Placebo effect An apparently beneficial result of therapy that occurs because of the patient's expectation that the therapy will help. Plantar reflex A reflex response obtained by drawing a pointed object along the outer border of the sole of the foot from the heel to the little toe. The normal flexor response is a bunching and downward movement of the toes. An upward movement of the big toe is called an extensor response, or Babinski reflex, which is a sensitive indicator of disease in the brain or spinal cord. Plaque An area of inflamed or demyelinated central nervous system tissue. A plaque (or lesion), which can vary from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter, generally contains inflammatory cells (white blood cells) and other cells that are important in brain inflammation. See Inflammation Plasma cell A lymphocyte-like cell found in the bone marrow, connective tissue, and blood that is involved in the body's immune system. See also Lymphocyte. Plasma exchange Plasma exchange involves removing blood from the person, mechanically separating the blood cells from the fluid plasma, mixing the blood cells with replacement plasma, and returning the blood mixture to the body. The rationale for plasma exchange is that the plasma contains immune factors that may stimulate disease activity. Substituting replacement plasma may dilute the strength of these potentially destructive immune factors. However, the detailed mechanisms involved are not yet clearly understood. Plasmapharesis See plasma exchange. Position sense The ability to tell, with one's eyes closed, where fingers and toes are in space. Position sense is evaluated during the standard neurologic exam in MS. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis Another term for Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Post-void residual test (PVR) The PVR test involves passing a catheter into the bladder following urination in order to drain and measure any urine that is left in the bladder after urination is completed. The PVR is a simple but effective technique for diagnosing bladder dysfunction in MS. Postural tremor Rhythmic shaking that occurs when the muscles are tensed to hold an object or stay in a given position. Power grading A measurement of muscle strength used to evaluate weakness or paralysis. Power is tested as part of the standard neurologic exam in MS. Prevalence The number of all new and old cases of a disease in a defined population at a particular point in time. The prevalence of MS in the United States at any given time is about 1/750\u2014approximately 400,000 people. Primary progressive MS A clinical course of MS characterized from the beginning by progressive disease, with no plateaus or remissions, or an occasional plateau and very short-lived, minor improvements. Prognosis Prediction of the future course of the disease. Progressive course Characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any distinct relapses. Depending on the diagnosis, a progressive disorder may move quickly or slowly. Progressive disease A disease or health condition that gets worse over time, resulting in a general decline in health or function. Unlike a relapsing and remitting disorder, there are not many periods of relief from a progressive disorder. Depending on the diagnosis, your progressive disorder may move quickly or slowly. Progressive-relapsing MS A clinical course of MS that shows disease progression from the beginning, but with clear, acute relapses, with or without full recovery from those relapses along the way. Prospective memory The ability to remember an event or commitment scheduled for the future. Thus, a person who agrees to meet or call someone at a given time on the following day must be able to remember the appointment when the time comes. People with MS-related memory impairment frequently report problems with this type of memory for upcoming appointments. Pseudo-bulbar affect See Affective release. Pseudo-exacerbation A temporary aggravation of disease symptoms, resulting from an elevation in body temperature or other stressor (e.g., an infection, severe fatigue, constipation), that disappears once the stressor is removed. A pseudo-exacerbation involves symptom flare-up rather than new disease activity or progression. Pyramidal tracts Motor nerve pathways in the brain and spinal cord that connect nerve cells in the brain to the motor cells located in the cranial, thoracic, and lumbar parts of the spinal cord. Damage to these tracts causes spastic paralysis or weakness. Pyuria The presence of pus in the urine, causing it to appear cloudy; indicative of bacterial infection in the urinary Hay falta de balance y equilibrio que resulta Par\u00e1lisis Par\u00e1lisis del nervio facial de en los m\u00fasculos que mueven la cara, las comisuras de la boca y los parpados.

Quad cane A cane that has a broad base on four short \"feet,\" which provide extra stability. Quadriparesis Weakness or partial paralysis of both arms and legs. Quadriplegia The paralysis of both arms and both legs. Randomized study A clinical trial in which all patients are assigned randomly (by chance) to be in experimental group (receiving the experimental treatment) or the control group (receiving the placebo or control substance). Recent memory The ability to remember events, conversations, content of reading material or television programs from a short time ago, i.e., an hour or two ago or last night. People with MS-related memory impairment typically experience greatest difficulty remembering these types of things in the recent past. Reflex An involuntary response of the nervous system to a stimulus, such as the stretch reflex, which is elicited by tapping a tendon with a reflex hammer, resulting in a contraction. Increased, diminished, or absent reflexes can be indicative of neurologic damage, including MS, and are therefore tested as part of the standard neurologic exam. Rehabilitation Rehabilitation in MS involves the intermittent or ongoing use of multidisciplinary strategies (e.g., physiatry, physical terapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy) to promote functional independence, prevent unnecessary complications, and enhance overall quality of life. It is an active process directed toward helping the person recover and/or maintain the highest possible level of functioning and realize his or her optimal physical, mental, and social potential given any limitations that exist. Rehabilitation is also an interactive, ongoing process of education and enablement in which people with MS and their care partners are active participants rather than passive recipients. Relapsing course Characterized by clearly defined attacks of worsening neurologic function, followed by partial or complete recovery periods (remissions), during which symptoms improve. Relapsing-remitting MS A clinical course of MS that is characterized by clearly defined, acute attacks with full or partial recovery and no disease progression between attacks. Remission A lessening in the severity of symptoms or their temporary disappearance during the course of the illness. Remote Memory The ability to remember people or events from the distant past. People with MS tend to experience few, if any, problems with their remote memory. Remyelination The repair of damaged myelin. Myelin repair occurs spontaneously in MS but very slowly. Research is currently underway to find a way to speed the healing process. Residual urine Urine that remains in the bladder following urination. Retrobulbar neuritis See Optic neuritis. Romberg's sign The inability to maintain balance in a standing position with feet and legs drawn together and eyes closed.

Sclerosis Hardening of tissue. In MS, sclerosis is the body's replacement of lost myelin around CNS nerve cells with scar tissue. Scotoma A gap or blind spot in the visual field. Secondary-progressive MS A clinical course of MS that initially is relapsing-remitting and then becomes progressive at a variable rate, possibly with an occasional relapse and minor remission. Sensory Related to bodily sensations such as pain, smell, taste, temperature, vision, hearing, acceleration, and position in space. Sepsis The presence of sufficient bacteria in the blood to cause illness. Sign An objective physical problem or abnormality identified by the physician during the neurologic examination. Neurologic signs may differ significantly from the symptoms reported by the patient because they are identifiable only with specific tests and may cause no overt symptoms. Common neurologic signs in multiple sclerosis include altered eye movements and other changes in the appearance or function of the visual system; altered reflexes; weakness; spasticity; circumscribed sensory changes. Somatosensory evoked potential A test that measures the brain's electrical activity in response to repeated (mild) electrical stimulation of different parts of the body. Demyelination results in a slowing of response time. Spasticity Abnormal increase in muscle tone, manifested as a spring-like resistance to moving or being moved. Speech/language pathologist Speech/language pathologists specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of speech and swallowing disorders. A person with MS may be referred to a speech/language pathologist for help with either one or both of these problems. Because of their expertise with speech and language difficulties, these specialists also provide cognitive remediation for individuals with cognitive impairment. Sphincter A circular band of muscle fibers that tightens or closes a natural opening of the body, such as the external anal sphincter, which closes the anus, and the internal and external urinary sphincters, which close the urinary canal. Sphincterotomy A surgical enlargement of the urinary sphincter in a male whose spasticity is so severe that he cannot empty his bladder. Once the surgery is performed, the man loses urinary control and must wear an external, condom catheter to collect the urine. This procedure is seldom required in MS. It is performed only on males because urinary drainage problems in females might lead to skin breakdown. Spinal tap See Lumbar puncture. Spirometer An instrument used to assess lung function; it measures the volume and flow rate of inhaled and exhaled air. Spontaneous voiding See Incontinence. Stance ataxia An inability to stand upright due to disturbed coordination of the involved muscles, which results in swaying and a tendency to fall in one or another direction. Steroids See ACTH; Corticosteroid; Glucocorticoid hormones. Suppressor T-lymphocytes White blood cells that act as part of the immune system and may be in short supply during an MS exacerbation. Straight catheter A straight but flexible, hollow plastic tube of variable length and diameter, which can be inserted through the urinary opening into the bladder to drain excess urine that cannot be excreted normally. The straights catheter is the type used for intermittent self-catheterization (ISC). See Intermittent self-catheterization. Symptom A subjectively perceived problem or complaint reported by the patient. In multiple sclerosis, common symptoms include visual problems, fatigue, sensory changes, weakness or paralysis of limbs, tremor, lack of coordination, poor balance, bladder or bowel changes, and psychological changes.

Tandem gait A test of balance and coordination that involves alternately placing the heel of one foot directly against the toes of the other foot. Tenotomy An irreversible surgical procedure performed to cut severely contracted tendons attached to muscles that do not respond to any other type of spasticity control and are causing intractable pain and skin complications related to lack of physical movement. Titubation A form of tremor, resulting from demyelination in the cerebellum, that manifests itself primarily in the head and neck. Tonic seizure An intense spasm that lasts for a few minutes and affects one or both limbs on one side of the body. Like other types of paroxysmal symptoms in MS, these spasms occur abruptly and fairly frequently in those individuals who have them, and are similar from one brief episode to the next. The attacks may be triggered by movement or occur spontaneously. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) TENS is a nonaddictive and noninvasive method of pain control that applies electric impulses to nerve endings via electrodes that are attached to a stimulator by flexible wires and placed on the skin. The electric impulses block the transmission of pain signals to the brain. Transurethral resection A procedure to remove excess thickened tissue at the point of connection between the bladder and the urethra. This thickened tissue, which occasionally develops with the prolonged use of a Foley catheter, obstructs the flow of urine when the catheter is removed. This procedure is quite uncommon and is done mostly in males. Transverse myelitis An acute attack of inflammatory demyelination that involves both sides of the spinal cord. The spinal cord loses its ability to transmit nerve impulses up and down. Paralysis and numbness are experienced in the legs and trunk below the level of the inflammation. Tremor Involuntary shaking, usually of the hands or arms. Trigeminal neuralgia Lightning-like, acute pain in the face caused by demyelination of nerve fibers at the site where the sensory (trigeminal) nerve root for that part of the face enters the brainstem. Twins\u2014dizygotic Also known as fraternal twins, two babies that come from separate, simultaneously-fertilized eggs. If one dizygotic twin develops MS, the other has the same genetic risk for MS (approximately 2-5/100 as any other sibling or first-degree relative. Twins\u2014monozygotic Also known as identical twins, two babies that come from single fertilized egg and share identical genetic makeup. If one monozygotic twin develops MS, the other has a 30/100 risk of developing the disease, indicating that factors other than genetic makeup contribute to the etiology of MS. tipo y dif\u00edciles para tratar y hasta el d\u00eda de uniformemente efectivo. las manos con ejemplo postural Sucede cuando se mantiene o una parte cuerpo en alguna posici\u00f3n en particular por un per\u00edodo de no medio aparatos, con atenci\u00f3n la movilidad f\u00edsica, extremidades superiores, movimiento y coordinaci\u00f3n, 3) con lo que recet\u00f3 el est\u00e1ndar tratamiento aprobado por que usa normalmente y el al principio de la p\u00e1gina) Tier formularies Some formularies sort drugs into \"tiers\" \u2014 medications assigned to higher tiers have higher out-of-pocket costs. Generally, more specialized drugs (such as injectable drugs and those that require special handling) will be assigned to the higher tiers. Urethra Duct or tube that drains the urinary bladder. Urinary frequency Feeling the urge to urinate even when urination has occurred very recently. Urinary hesitancy The inability to void urine spontaneously even though the urge to do so is present. Urinary incontinence See Incontinence. Urinary retention Inability to completely empty the bladder during urination, which can increase the risk of urinary tract infections. Urinary sphincter The muscle closing the urethra, which in a state of flaccid paralysis causes urinary incontinence and in a state of spastic paralysis results in an inability to urinate. Urinary urgency The inability to postpone urination once the need to void has been felt. Urine culture and sensitivity (C & S) A diagnostic procedure to test for urinary tract infection and identify the appropriate treatment. Bacteria from a mid-stream urine sample is allowed to grow for three days in a laboratory medium and then tested for sensitivity to a variety of antibiotics. Urologist A physician who specializes in the branch of medicine (urology) concerned with the anatomy, physiology, disorders, and care of the male and female urinary tract, as well as the male genital tract. Urology A medical specialty that deals with disturbances of the urinary (male and female) and reproductive (male) organs. \u00dalcera de dec\u00fabito o \u00falcera de ocurrir tiempo acostada en la cama o sentada en una silla de Las de la p\u00e1gina) Vertigo A dizzying sensation of the environment spinning, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Vibration sense The ability to feel vibrations against various parts of the body. Vibration sense is tested (with a tuning fork) as part of the sensory portion of the neurologic exam. Videofluoroscopy A radiographic study of a person's swallowing mechanism that is recorded on videotape. Videofluoro-scopy shows the physiology of the pharynx, the location of the swallowing difficulty, and confirms whether or not food particles or fluids are being aspirated into the airway. Visual acuity Clarity of vision. Acuity is measured as a fraction of normal vision. 20/20 vision indicates an eye that sees at 20 feet what a normal eye should see at 20 feet; 20/400 vision indicates an eye that sees at 20 feet what a normal eye sees at 400 feet. Visual evoked potential A test in which the brain's electrical activity in response to visual stimuli (e.g., a flashing checkerboard) is recorded by an electroencephalograph and analyzed by computer. Demyelination results in a slowing of response time. Because this test is able to confirm the presence of a suspected brain lesion (area of demyelination) as well as identify the presence of an unsuspected lesion that has produced no symptoms, it is extremely useful in diagnosing MS. VEPs are abnormal in approximately 90 percent of people with MS. Vocational rehabilitation (VR) Vocational rehabilitation is a program of services designed to enable people with disabilities to become or remain employed. Originally mandated by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, VR programs are carried out by individually created state agencies. In order to be eligible for VR, a person must have a physical or mental disability that results in a substantial handicap to employment. VR programs typically involve evaluation of the disability and need for adaptive equipment or mobility aids, vocational guidance, training, job-placement, and follow-up.

V\u00e9ase \"Directiva M\u00e9dica Anticipada\" White matter The part of the brain that contains myelinated nerve fibers--and therefore appears white--in contrast to the cortex of the brain, which contains nerve cell bodies and appears gray.
