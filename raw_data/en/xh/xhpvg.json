RCHPR is a research unit c oowned by the Norweg ian University of Science and Technology NTNU a nd The S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College HiST and aim to develop and translate new knowledg e in health promotion work. Th e Centre will take part in the scientific exploration of what promotes, maintains and re stores good health - both in healthy, vulnerable and diseased populations. The research group consists re searchers with background as nurses, er go therapists, physiotherapists, medi cal doctors, psychologists, and social scientists - all with a higher research degree and with a bio-psycho -social- existential health understanding. In line with the World Health Organiza tion's view that health is more than the absence of infirmity health is understood as a positive resource which every person has more or less of. What we have observed for the last years, is that the ki nds of health problems now facing us have shifte d, but our thinking about how to re spond to them has not shifted accordingly. We feel that traditional bio-medica l disease research is t oo limited in terms of facing the health challenges of the new millenni um, which includes enormous increases in obesity in many populati ons, psychological distress, inacti vity, musculoskeletal disorders, and self-perceived negati ve health outcomes. In Europe and many other regions around the world, the size of the senior citizen populati on is growing. This cons titutes new challenges for authorities and researcher s in terms of forming good hea lth promotion strategies to handle the myriad of future he alth issues. Norway has the dubi ous position as a leader in the world in terms of money spent on the health care system. A growing number of people are receiving successful medical tr eatments, but many are returned home with adverse, late- stage effects from the disease and/or the tr eatment. Better health outcomes could be achieved with increased knowledge on how to promote health in these populations. Interdisciplinary resear ch is needed to pr oduce new knowledge and understanding about the diverse relationships required for the success of an efficien t health promotion strategy. The Centre will contri bute to new knowledge about fact ors that promote, sustain, and restore good health in healt hy people, vulnerable or exposed groups, and thos e with health deficiencies. The focus is on fact ors that promote health (i.e., salutogenesis) as opposed to the focus on factors that gene rate illness and dise ase (i.e., pathogene sis). As a central guideline for the centre's acti vity Positive Health Research (PHR) is defined \"..as the 4 scientific study of factors leadin g to and determinants of health risk, and of th e interventions which modify these factors and determinants, so as to have a positive impa ct on health maintenance and development.\" Research Centre for Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU comprises four research groups - all with a focus on health promotion in different settings. These are \"Positive occupational health\", \"Health prom otion among \"Health pr omotion in the life cour se.\" The Centre also have a Unit for Best Practice in health promotion and prevention to help organizations gather and systemize research/knowledge on actual he alth promotional interventions, to translate knowledge to practical use, and to ev aluate health promotional and prev entive interventi ons and practice. The main aim with this booklet is to communicate what ki nd of research is carried through in this research group, to gether with our coll aboraters, and the pr actical implications of a positive focus in he alth promotion research. The five se ctions in this book refer to each of the fields of interest in the Centre. We hope that this book let can inspire researchers who have the same research interest as we do, to ta ke contact.

Positive Occupational Health Recently, more and more occupational health psychology researchers and practitioners have recognized that, in order to improve worki ng conditions, simply identifying and preventing work factors related to worker's impaired he alth is not enough. Positive Occupational Health Psychology (POHP) is the study and application of optimal functioning in the workplace. It promotes occupational health and flour ishing, and examines how positive phenomena (contexts, personal resources) can be used to protect against occupational risks. This section provides both theo retical and practical examples within the field of Positive Occupational Health. In Chapter 1, Innstrand pr esents an integrative model on positive and negative work-home interaction building upon CO R theory. Although COR theory is one of the leading theories in explaini ng job stress and burnout, its fo cus on different resources as a part of a greater dynamic process provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for an active, positive psychological perspective in occupational and organi zational psychology. For the development of both theory and method in this area, Christensen and colleagues has developed a questionnaire - the Nordic Ques tionnaire on Positive Organizational Psychology (N-POP) - that provides a full measure of organizational health by focusing on six dimensions of organizational life: Individual resources, Job demands, Job resources, Work- related experiences and attitude s, Individual wellbeing, and Or ganizational performance. In Chapter 2 they present the results from the reliability and validity analyses of the questionnaire which was tested in tw o samples from Sweden and Norway. In Chapter 3, Andr\u00e9 argues for the need fo r the presence of skilled and motivated key personnel in the unit within the health care field in times of change if implementation of these changes is to be successful. Similarly, in Chap ter 4, Gjerstad and Lysberg discuss leadership and its impact on various aspects of work-rela ted health. Health promotion leadership is concerned with creating a culture for health-promoting workplaces. This requires that the leaders are engaged in the systematic deve lopment of both the physical and psychosocial work environment. We hope that this section about positive o ccupational health encourages scholars in occupational and organizational psychology to conduct more positive and resource-oriented research on questions within th e area of occupational health. 8 9 1. Positive and negative work-home interaction: An integrative model SIW TONE INNSTRAND Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, Department of Social Work and Health Science, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion a nd Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway Abstract Building upon Hobfoll's Conservation of Reso urces (COR) theory (1989, 2001), this paper aims to provide a theoretical framework aiding work-home researchers to predict, explain and understand the work-home nexus and its associ ates. With its focu s on both loss and gain of resources, COR theory encompasses the pros and cons of the work-f amily intera ction. In order to prove its applicabili ty, some practical examples and ways of reasoning about hypothesized relationships are illustrated. Introduction Changes in family structure, work context, and the composit ion of the work force mean a host of new challenges for both men and women as they struggle to cope with the often competing pressures of work de mands and personal responsibilit ies. However, multiple roles might also provide arenas for joy and personal growth. There is a growing agreement in the work-home literature that work-home balanc e should be regarded as more than lack of conflict i.e., it may also indica te \"the extent to which an in dividual is equally engaged in - and equally satisfied with- his or her work role and family role\" (Greenhaus, Collins, & Shaw, 2003). Hence, a compre hensive understanding of the work-home interaction (WHI) should include components of bo th conflict and facilitation, and these components should be regarded as bidirectional (Byr on, 2005; Carlson & Frone, 2003; Carls al., 2006; Eby, Casper, Lockwood, & Powell, 2006). Work/home conflict occurs wh en the demands associated with one domain are incompatible with the demands associated wi th the other domain (Perrew\u00e9, Hochwarter, & Kiewitz, 1999), wher eas work/home facilita tion refers to how participation in one role is made better or easier due to participation in the other role (Wayne, Musisca, & Fleeson, 2004). 10 However, few attempts have been made in proposing a comprehensive model of antecedents and outcomes of WH I in which both conflict and facilitation are integrated. Conservation of resource s (COR) theory is a stress and moti vational theory which provides a framework to understand, predict, and examine this transactiona l relationship th at can then be used to shape settings towards more op timal balance of resour ce cost and benefit (Hobfoll, 2011). The aim of this paper is to introduce a conceptual mode l of work-home interaction and show how the COR theory may il luminate this area of research. The model is an elaboration of Hobfoll and Shirom's (2 001) COR model of the interplay between home and work stressors and is graphically depicted in Figure 1. First, I outline the theory and its general applica tion. Second, I turn to th e WHI literature and fi ndings from our own studies to examine how COR theory illuminate this area of researc h. The results from our own study are based on data from a long itudinal study among eight different occupational groups in Norway : lawyers, physicians, nurses, t eachers, church ministers, bus drivers, and people worki ng in advertising a nd information technology (for more information, see Innstr and, 2009). Implications of the find ings are discusse d in the paper. The Conservation of resources (COR) theory The basic tenet of the CO R theory is that peop le have a deeply root ed motivation to obtain, retain, and protect what they va lue, labeled resources. Both work and home life comprise a range of resources wh ich are valued and s ought after (i.e. see Hobfoll, 2001). The COR theory integrates work and home life through the concept of resources that join these different domains in a common economy in which resources are exchanged (Hobfoll & Freedy, 1993). As indicated by th e two separate arrows betw een work resources and home resources in Figure 1, empirical evidence shows that th is exchange is bidirectional but unique in how it operates in ea ch direction (Byron, 2005; Carl son et al., Bakker, & Schaufeli, 2005). Stress or conflict occurs because resources are lost, threatened, or fail to give anticipated return in the process of juggling both work and home life (Grandey & Cropanzano, 1999). On the ot her hand, facili tation follows when resources contribute to the exchange of gains between the dom ains (Hobfoll, 1989; Wayne et al., 2007). Resources are defined as \"...t hose objects, personal charac teristics, conditions, or energies that are valued by the individual or that serve as a means for attainment of these objects, personal charac teristics, conditions , or energies\" (Hobfo ll, 1989, p. 516). These 11 resources may be rooted both in the work domain and the home domain. Hobfoll (1998, 2001) has identified 74 work-rel ated and nonwork-related reso urces. ti me,\" or \"time with loved ones\". Losses and ga ins of these resources are importa nt, because in addition to an instrumental value they also have a symbolic value by defining social identity (Hobfoll, 1989). The COR theory expands previous stress theo ries in that it not only describes what individuals do when confronted w ith stress, but also in the absence of threats. Specifically, when confronted with stress, individuals are pr edicted by the model to st rive to minimize net loss of resources. Si gnificant and ongoi ng drains on resources may pr ovide a state of chronic stress such as burnout (Hobfo ll & Shirom, 2001). Conversely, when not currently confronted with threats, people strive to develop resource surpluses to o ffset the possibility of future loss. When people devel op resource surp luses, they are likely to experience positive well- being and health. Resources are not distributed equally, howev er, and the COR theory postulates that those with the most resources are less vulnerable to resource loss and more capable of resource gain. For example, a strong social networ k (partner, friends) pr ovides social support and a safety net when strain o ccurs. This implies that those who lack strong resource pools are more likely to experience spirals of resource loss; initial losses beget further losses. Similarly, those with a strong res ource pool are more li kely to experience spirals of resource gain. Initial resource gain begets further resource gain (Hobfoll, 1998). Theoretical model COR theory has been applied as a theoretica l framework to work-home conflict (Grandey & Cropanzano, facilitation Perhoniemi, 2011; Wayne, Grzywacz, Carlson, & Kacmar, 2007) separately. However, this is the first attempt to provide a resource based, integrative model of both positive and negative work-home interaction and some of its core relations. In the following sections, I demonstrate how the COR theory can be applied to WHI research. 12 Figure 1. The conservation of resources model of work-home interaction. Personal Characteristics and WHI The COR theory proposes that threat or loss of highly valu ed personal characteristics may ensue stress and work/home conflict. For example, prior research indicates that role identification is positively related to time in vestment in that role (Rothbard & Edwards, 2003), and that highly id entified roles are rela ted to more work-hom e conflict (Adams, King, & King, 1996; Byron, 2005; Fr one, Russell, & Coope anan & Boswell, 2006). Conversely, as ed by the COR theor y, personal characte ristics are also regarded as resources to the extent that they aid stress resistance (H obfoll, 1989). Job self- efficacy is considered to be such a resour ce (Bandura, 1997; W ood & Bandura, 1989). Another personal characte ristic which may rela te to one's resource s is gender. Despite the increase of women in the work force, wome n still take the main responsibility at home (Kitter\u00f8d, 2005; Kristiansen & Sandnes, 2006). This implies a conservation of resource such as time and energy for the women. Moreover, wher eas a strong work rela ted identity accords with the male breadwinner role, it is not consistent with the female homemaker role (Simon, 1995), thus possibly producing more guilt and conf lict in women (Elv in-Nowak, 1999; Livingston & Judge, 2008). Inside the COR framework this mean s that salient gender roles or social identities may be th reatened in the juggling of wo rk and home life. On the other hand, Simon (1997) demonstrated that parent hood simultaneously in volved benefits and costs and was a source of bot h positive and negative emoti ons, especially among mothers. Thus, it could be argued that despite the cost of juggling work and home life in women, multiple roles imply that more resources are disposed of, with positive consequences - 13 particularly for women. This c onfer with the COR theory's pr opositions of re source caravans and that initial resource ga in begets further resour ce gain (Hobf oll, 1998). Job characteri stics and WHI According to the COR model, as more strain is experienced in one domain, fewer resources are available to fulfill one's role in another domain. Thus, the experi ence of workload may leave fewer resources available for family de mands. Conversely, the COR model posits that those with greater resources are less vulnera ble to resource loss and more capable of resource gain (Hobfoll, 1989, 2001). Workload and autonomy are examples of energy resources that may aid the acquisition of ot her resources, such as time for work and family. Home characteristics and WHI In terms of COR theory, marriage or cohabitati on are examples of condition resources that are valued and sought after by many people. If this valued condition is threatened or lost in the juggling of work and home, or through a resource depletion associated with increased responsibility, the theory may be related with resulting conflict. Howeve r, people living with a partner may also have more resources to draw from (i.e. their spouse, more finances). Thus, being married or cohabiting may also enable facilitation instrumentally (more resources to draw on or by) or affectively (i.e. positive m oods and emotions), as suggested by Greenhaus and Powell (2006). Impaired health and WHI One corollary of the COR theory is that indivi duals must invest resources to limit loss of resources, to protect resources, or to gain re sources. For example, individuals experiencing stress or conflict in their interaction between work and family may need to increase their investment of time, energy, and trust in thos e relationships. As illustrated in Figure 1, enduring investments of resour ces may promote burnout. The COR theory describes burnout as a state of extrem e resource depletion (Hobfoll & Freedy, 1993), a conception that was recently supported empi rically in a study by Ne veu (2007). Leiter (1 990) found that loss of resources related to both work and family predicted burnout six m onths later. However, whereas it has previously been assumed that work/home conflict may have adverse effects on health (for a review see Allen et al., 2000), recent research indicates that impaired health may also exacerbate work /home conflict. For ex ample, in a study among police officers in Norway, burnou t was a strong predic tor of work-family conflict (Mikkelsen & Burke, 2004). This relates to another corollary of the COR theory, suggesting that those 14 who lack resources are no t only more vulnerable to resource loss, but initial loss also begets future loss, creating loss spirals (Hobfoll, 1989,1998, 2001). Positive health and WHI The COR theory posits that people strive to develop resource surp luses to offset the possibility of future loss. Wh en people develop resource surp luses, they are likely to experience positive well-being and health. Al though, a systematic rese arch on potential outcomes of facilitation is still lacking (O'Driscoll, Br ough, & Kalliath, 2009) recent studies have found work-home f acilitation to be related to favoura ble outcomes like improved well- being, affective commitment, less depressi on and turnover intent ions, motivation and productivity (Allis & O' Driscoll, 2008; Hammer et al., 2005; Hill, et al., 2007; Wayne et al., 2006). The COR theory further an ticipates that positive experien ces or resources are likely to accumulate, creating a positive spiral of resour ces, which, in turn, is likely to have positive health-promoting effects. In a 3-year cross-lagged panel st udy Hakanen and colleagues (Hakanen et al., 2011), found wo rk-family enrichment and engagement to be reciprocally related supporting the COR theory. Results Building upon data from a longitudinal study among eight different occupational groups in Norway (Innstrand, 2009) we found support for most of the hypothesized relationship illustrated in Figure 1. Personal Characteristics and WHI : In line with the COR theory's proposal that threat or loss of highly valued pers onal characteristics may ensue st ress and work/home conflict we found individual vulnerability (job performa nce-based self-estee m) to contribute significantly to the explanation of work-home interactions, and in particular work-to-home conflict (Innstrand, Langballe, Espenes, Aasland, & Falkum, 2010). This implies that when self-esteem strongly de pends upon performance at work, tim e and energy available for home life tends to be depleted, incr easing the risk for work/home c onflict. Moreover, in line with the COR theory, these variables were reciprocally re lated, thus ensuing spirals of loss. However, job performance-based self-esteem an d work/home facilitati on were only weakly associated. Another persona l characteristic which may relate to one's resource s is gender. By means of latent mean analysis we found women overall reported more conflict and facilitation in both direction as compared to men (Innstra nd, Langballe, Falkum, Espnes, Aasland, 2009). Thus, even t hough the gap between the gend ers in Norway is among the 15 smallest in the world when it comes to economic participatio n and opportuniti es, educational attainments, and political empow erment, our study indicate th at gender differences in the experience of work-home interaction are prevalent Job characteristics and WHI : Workload and autonomy are examples of energy resources that may aid the acquis ition of other resources, such as time for work and family. Examining work/home conflict an d facilitation across four diffe rent family structures in Norway (Innstrand, Langballe, Falkum, Espnes, & Aasland, 2010) we found workload to be positively related to work/home conflict suggesting that initia l losses beget further losses. Conversely, a positive as sociation between autonomy and wo rk/home facilitation supported the COR proposition that those w ith a strong resource pool are more likely to experience spirals of resource gain. Simila rly, exploring occupational differences in WFI (Innstrand, Langballe, & Falkum, 2010) we f ound that those occupational gr oups experien cing the least conflict are also among thos e experiencing the l east facilitation. Similarly, with few exceptions, those experiencing th e most conflict are also amo ng those experiencing the most facilitation. Subsequent analyses indicates th at this apply for both men and women. These results empirically supp ort the orthogonal nature of WFI and suggest that the interaction between work and family may be more perm eable in some occupa tions than others. Home characteristics and WHI : In terms of COR theory, marriage or cohabitation are examples of condition resources that are valued a nd sought after by ma ny people. Examining work/home conflict and facilita tion across four different fa mily structures in Norway (Innstrand, Langballe, Falkum et al., 2010) we found that wo rk/home conflict was more profound among those living in two-parent fa milies and among single parents than among childless couples and singles. However, work-to-home facilita tion did not vary by family structure, whereas the chil dless couples reported more home-to-work facilitation. Impaired/positive health and WHI : One corollary of the COR theory is that individuals must invest resources to limit loss of resources, to pr otect resources, or to gain resources. Enduring investments of resources may pr omote burnout. In a longitudinal study of reciprocal relations we found work-home interaction a nd burnout may ac t as both a predictor and consequen ce of each other (Inn strand, Langballe, Espn es, & Aasland, 2008). Bidirectional work/home was significant a ssociated with both exhaustion and disengagement two years later. Moreover, initial experien ce of emotional exhaustion was associated with increased work/home c onflict two years late r supporting the COR proposition of loss spirals. In a recent study among male and female physicians, we even 16 found that work-home inte raction plays a role above and beyond both individual factors and work-related factors in determining the level of experien ced burnout (Langba lle, Innstrand, Aasland, & Falkum, 2011). Conversely, significant lagged negative effects from work-t o-family facilitation to burnout, suggested that high levels of work-to-family facilitation at Time 1 caused low levels of exhaustion and disengagem ent at Time 2. Moreover, a hi gh level of family-to-work facilitation at Time 1 predicted a low level of disengagement at Time 2 (Innstrand et al., 2008). Thus, in line with the CO R theory's assumptions, a posi tive interaction between work and home may be regarded as a resource surplus as a high initial level of work/home facilitation seems to buffer against burnout. Discussion Researchers have explicitly call ed for greater attent ion to the positive si de of the work-home interaction and the need of a theoretical model integrating bo th the positive and negative aspects and the mechanisms that underlie work-home interacti on (i.e. Geurts & Demerouti, 2003). The aim of this paper is to introduce a conceptual model of work-home interaction and show how the COR theory may illuminate th is area of research. Cl early, if this model's proportions of gain and loss of sp iral are replicated in future empirical research, the practical utility to organizations would be significant. Empirical evidence indicates that different processes may underlie these components and highlights the importance of exploring the whole WHI nexus to understand the work-home balance. For ex ample, our understanding of work-home interaction is incomplete without co nsideration of facilita tion, since facilitation contributes to an understanding of work- home dynamics above and beyond conflict. As suggested by van Steenbergen a nd colleagues (2007) this implie s that organiza tions should carefully examine the outcomes they want to address and tailor their interventions accordingly. For example, interventions aim to reduce impaired health such as burnout should mainly focus on reducing the experience of work-home conflict. Conversely, the aim of interventions is to increase positive health outcomes which might bolste r job performance and work satisfaction, should, in addition to the reduction of conflict, find actions to stimulate the experience of work-home facilitation. Although the COR theo ry provides a heuristic frame work of WHI, the empirical evidence of the model depicted on Figure 1 has to be consid ered with some limitations in mind. It should be noted that al though positive and impaired hea lth is suggeste d as outcomes 17 in the present figure, other ou tcomes like job performance, affective commitment, and work satisfaction is also pl ausible. Similarly, other precursors could be included like home commitment, home satisfaction, a nd global satisfaction just to mention a few. Although the model takes both the direction and the effect of the interaction into considerat ion, the nature of conflict and facilitation can differ as well. For instance, work-home conflict has been proposed to have differe nt dimensions in whic h conflict can be time -based, behavior-based, or strain-based (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985). The level of re source drain mi ght differ along these dimensions as well. Moreover, in the CO R theoretical framework WHI is proposed to be caused by the exchange of valued resources. Howe ver, the exact values of these resources are only assumed. More research is needed on the value or meaning i ndividuals attach to different roles. Similarly, as resource priorities are assu med to be largely culturally determined (Hobfoll, 1998) a nd the present model proposed originates from a Scandinavian point of view, cross-cultural st udies on the viability of the model are warr anted. Finally, the COR theory may in itself cont ain some limitations and biases (for a discussion see Hobfoll, 2001). Nevertheless, the COR is f ound to be a valid and robust co ntribution to the stream of stress scholarship (Qui ck & Gavin, 2001), provid ing a new standard in the field (Schwarzer, 2001) and enhancing contemporary understand ing of stress and coping (Thompson & Cooper, 2001). The presen t paper has proved its applicability to the four dimensions of work-home interaction as well. As long as work and fam ily/home are the two most im portant life domains in contemporary societies, a more profound understanding of the fact ors that affect health and well-being needs to be found in the companion areas of wo rk and home. Clearly more research is needed before firm conclusion can be made, especi ally concerning the facilitation aspect. It is hoped that the proposed model will guide and st imulate future research in this field and encourage more theo ry-driven innovative research. 18 References Adams, G. A., King, L. A., & King, D.

Building engagement and healthy organisations A test of the Nordic questionnaire on Positive Organizational (N-POP) MARIT STRAUME4 1 Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Department of Psychology, Trondheim, Norway 2 Stockholm University, Department of Psychology, Sweden 3National Research Centre for the Working Environment (NRCWE) Copehagen, Denmark 4Finnish Insitute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland Abstract The main aim of this project was to investigate the predictors of positive work related states and attitudes, e.g. work engagement, meaning at work and personal growth, and healthy organisations. A questionnaire was developed and a pilot study was conducted in 2011 in Sweden (N=180) and Norway (N=202). The re sults of these studies were used as a background for a first validation of the No rdic Questionnaire on Positive Organizational Psychology (N-POP). The results of the analyses of the reliability (internal consistency) and the construct validity of the scales in N-POP reveals a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the psychosocial work environment, positive work-rel ated states and attitudes and a series of organizational and individual outcome s in modern work organizations. Finally, the conclusion summarizes that the concepts of work environment, health and productivity seem to be able to flow together in an 'optimum' point where well-be ing at the individual level is coexistent with efficient and productive work organizations. Aims and background of the project The Nordic research project \"Building engagement and heal thy organisations\" has aimed upon developing theory a nd methods on positive factors at work and healthy organisations. The main idea is that a healthy organisation assu mes that the concepts of work environment, health, and productiv ity seem to flow together in an 'o ptimum' point where well-being at the individual level is coexiste nt with efficient and productiv e work organiza tions. For the development of both theory and method in this area the project group has developed a questionnaire - the Nordic Questionnaire on Positive Organizational Ps ychology (N-POP) - 26 that provides a full measur e of organizational health by focusing on six dimensions of organizational life: Individual resources Job demands Job resources Work-related experi ences and attitudes Individual well-being Organizational performance The questionnaire was tested in two samples from Sweden (N=180) and Norway (N=202), and the results from reliability and validity analyses of these pilot studies are presented in this paper. This report is the product of research undertaken by a project group on positive work and organizational psychology that has been supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers since 2006. The project group has since then published two reports on Nordic research on positive work and organizational psychology in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark (Christensen et al., 2008; 2009). In the first two reports from this project, the project group proposed and investigated a model on the relationship between job resources and individual resources on the one hand and work-related experiences and attitudes and organizational and individual outcomes on the other (Christensen et al., 2008; 2009). The working model posits that job demands, job resources and individual resources have an impact on a series of work-related experiences and attitudes that again are of importance for a variety of individual and organizational outcomes, such as sickness absence, well-being and productivity. In this respect, the working model links factors in the psychosocial work environment with a series of positive psychological states and outcomes that are of simultaneous importance at the individual the organizational and the societal level. The working model reflects the concepts that we measure in the Nordic Questionnaire on Positive Organizational Psychology (N- POP). Figure 1 presents the working model and the concepts that are measured in the N-POP. 27 Figure 1 . Conceptual framework of the Nordic Questionnair e on Positive Organization al Psychology (N-POP) Theoretical background The Nordic welfare societies are currently facing two main challenges. The first challenge stems from changes in the demographic composition of the Nordic countries (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2006). These demographic changes may, in combination with widespread early retirement from the labour market (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2006), will result in a shortage of labour in the Nordic countries in the coming decades. The field of positive work and organizational psychology appears to offer some interesting insights in response to this challenge, as the knowledge generated within the field of positive work and organizational psychology may contribute to increasing the labour supply through its emphasis of building on factors related to intrinsic job motivation (Turner, Barling, & Zacharatos, 2002). The issue of labour supply is traditionally approached in terms of establishing economic incentives but an alternative strategy towards increasing labour supply is offered by the field of positive work and organizational psychology (Clausen, 2009). Another challenge that confronts the Nordic countries is related to the consequences of the terms of competition in an increasingly globalized economy. The dynamics of a globalized economy have contributed towards increasing the work-related demands experienced by large segments of the labour force. Firstly, the pace of skill change and the frequency of organizational reorganizations have increased job insecurity. Secondly, the competitive pressure of a globalized economy and a tendency towards increased worker autonomy in the production process entails an increased pressure on the employees to perform (Esping Andersen, 2002; Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001). Certainly, these developmental tendencies will have an impact on the well-being of employees in the contemporary labour market. Thus, in order to counter the increasingly stressful nature of 28 contemporary work life (Ferrie et al., 2001) it appears crucial to focus on the development of a series of positive work-life resources that may increase employees' abilities to cope with work-related demands. Positive psychology, however, may provide some interesting responses to the challenges confronting Nordic welfare societies. The school of positive psychology represents a critique of mainstream psychology; the focus of positive psychology is to create a body of knowledge that focuses on human well-being and growth (e.g. Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). From the perspective of positive psychology, concurrent experiences of positive affect are viewed as the fuel in processes that enhance individual and collective experiences of well-being, engagement and human growth (Frederickson & Losada, 2005; Gable & Haidt, 2005). According to Meyer and Allen (1997), experiences of positive affect are positively correlated with job performance whereas experiences of positive affect have been found to be negatively correlated with turnover intentions (see also Clausen and Borg, 2010). Furthermore, research into the implications of positive experiences shows that experiences of positive affect are associated with creativity (Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki, 1987) and intuition (Bolte, Goschkey, & Kuhl, 2003). Also, Frederickson and her colleagues have found that concurrent experiences of positive affects result in increases in individual resilience (Frederickson, Tugade, Waugh, & Larkin, 2003). Experiences of positive affect at work have furthermore been found to increase an individual's capacity to cope with stress (Glazer & Kruse, 2008), reduce the risk of long-term sickness absence (Clausen et al., 2010) and increase the possibilities for returning to work after long-term sickness absence (Clausen et al., 2011). In addition, studies of Finnish teachers and dentists show that various energizing job resources not only mitigate the negative impacts of job demands and work-life changes on work engagement but also they seem to boost work engagement, particularly when the job demands are high (Hakanen, Bakker, & Demerouti, 2005; Bakker, Hakanen, Demerouti, & Xanthopoulou, 2007). Thus, creating a working environment that draws upon the knowledge generated within the field of positive work and organizational psychology may contribute to the ability of the Nordic welfare societies to meet the aforementioned labour market challenges, both now and in the future. However, in order to reap these rewards it is important to study antecedents and consequences of experiences of positive affect in a variety of work settings. The conceptual framework presented in the model appears to be closely related to the concept of organizational health as it focuses on psychosocial work environment factors, 29 individual well- being and indicators of organizational performance. According to Kivim\u00e4ki and Lindstr\u00f6m (2006) a healthy organization has a dual focus, as the well-being of employees and organizational performance are simultaneously at the centre of attention. Accordingly, organizational health is construed as the capability of the organization to function effectively in relation to various environmental factors and to respond to various environmental changes (Kivim\u00e4ki & Lindstr\u00f6m, 2006, p. 811). The concept of organizational health thus constitutes a nexus that allows the concepts of work environment, health and productivity to flow together in an 'optimum' point where well-being at the individual level is coexistent with efficient and productive work organizations. In the optic angle of positive psychology the concept of organizational health thus appears to have an interesting potential. By drawing on Schaufeli and Bakker's Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R) (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004), we see that the individually experienced balance between job demands and job resources in the psychosocial work environment has an impact on the well- being of the individual. Schaufeli and Bakker describe job demands as the things that have to be done and job resources as the aspects of the job that either/or (1) reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological costs; (2) are functional in achieving work goals;(3) stimulate personal grow th, learning and development (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004, pp. 296). It furthermore follows from the job demands and resource model that the presence of resources in a work organization predicts employee health and well-being whereas excessive demands predict burnout and ill health. Furthermore, Harter, Schmidt, and Hayes (2002) shows that employee engagement are positively correlated with a series of organizational outcomes such as customer satisfaction, profits, turnover, and productivity. Thus, taken together, the findings of Harter et al. (2002) and Schaufeli and Bakker (2004) lend credence to the dynamics inherent to the notion of organizational health as they establish a link from factors in the psychosocial work environment to positive organizational outcomes via work-related well-being at the individual level. Methods The N-POP questionnaire was pilot tested through a data collection in some chosen companies in Norway and Sweden. The Swedish participants were employed in a medium-sized bank and worked within financial service and within departments such as private market, development and administration (N=180). The Norwegian questionnaire was 30 distributed to eight different workplaces. These eight workplaces were categorised into three different categories: Accounting/revision (n = 44), hospitals (n = 69), and university college (n = 89). The total Norwegian sample consisted of 202 respondents. The results of these studies were used as a background for a first validation of the Nordic Questionnaire on Positive Organizational Psychology (N-POP). In this paper, we present results on the reliability and the construct validity of the scales that we included in the N-POP questionnaire. Results and Discussion In this paper we report our testing of the reliability and construct validity of the concepts within the working model (Christensen, 2008; Christensen, 2009) (See Figure 1). The model reflects the concepts that we measure in the Nordic Questionnaire on Positive Organizational Psychology (N- POP). In the working model we accord theoretical primacy to job demands, job resources and individual resources. Accordingly, these entities are expected to have an impact on the work- related states and attitudes that are placed at the center of the working model, and these work- related states and attit udes are then expected to be important in the framing of a variety of organizational and individual outcomes. However, the positioning of the concepts is large done for analytical purposes and it can easily be imagined that some reversed causality may also be at play. For instance, the outcomes at the individual or organizational level could be expected to have an impact on both work-related states and attitudes of individual employees and on the psychosocial work environment in the work organization. However, for analytical purposes we hold to the working model, when analyzing associations between job demands, job resources, work-related states and various outcomes. However, in the real world it is important to be aware that the empirical phenomena that we investigate are intertwined. In this paper we have evaluated the psychometric properties of the scales we included in the Nordic questionnaire on Positive Organizational Psychology - N-POP. We assessed the internal consistency of the scales by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficients for all scales including three items or more. By and large, all scales exhibited satisfactory level for this measure of the internal consistency as 17 of 19 scales that included three or more items. When looking at the two samples the results showed that there were some differences in the internal consistencies of the scales in the two samples. However, these differences were relatively small which leads us to conclude that the scales must be considered as relatively robust measures of the empirical phenomena that they are supposed to measure, as the 31 internal consistency measures are similar in the Swedish and the Norwegian study populations. In assessing the construct validity of the measures included in the N-POP, we conducted a correlation analysis of the included measures. We conducted the tests of the construct validity of the included measures in three steps. In the first step we correlated scales measuring job resources, personal resources and job demands with the scales measuring work-related states and attitudes. These analyses showed that job resources are by and large correlated positively and significantly with the four scales measuring work-related states and attitudes. The results therefore affirm the construct validity of the measures of job resources and work-related states and attitudes as these measures are statistically associated while still being empirically distinguishable. This conclusion also holds validity in the assessment of the construct validity of our one measure for personal resources (optimism) vis-\u00e1-vis the four measures of work-related states and attitudes, as these scales also exhibit moderate to strong correlations. Finally, in the first step the analysis we examined the construct validity of the scales measuring job demands with reference to our four scales measuring work-related states and attitudes. This analysis showed that three of our four measures of work-related states and attitudes correlated negatively with experiences of role conflicts whereas one measure of work-related states and attitudes correlated positively with role conflicts. Surprisingly, our more general measures of job demands correlated positively with the four scales measuring work-related states and attitudes. These findings leads us to conclude that some job demands, as for instance role conflicts, may be considered occupational hindrances that may prevent employees from doing their job properly thereby clashing with professional identities, whereas other types of job demands may be considered challenges that, if dealt with successfully, may affirm the professional identities of employees (cf. Podsakoff, LePine, & LePine, 2007). In the second step of the analysis, we investigated the construct validity of job resources, personal resources and job demands vis-\u00e1-vis the scales measuring organizational and individual outcomes. The correlation analysis showed that job resources by and large correlated positively with the scales measuring organizational and individual outcomes, which supports the construct validity of the included measures. No significant correlations were found between job resources and sickness absence, which is surprising as other studies have demonstrated robust associations between job resources and risk for sickness absence (e.g. Clausen et al. 2012). The correlation analyses furthermore showed that trust and justice were negatively associated with instances of sickness presenteeism which indicates that 32 employees who experience organizational trust and justice may be confident in the abilities of their colleagues to do the job properly which reduces their propensity to go to work in spite of illness. The personal resource of optimism also showed moderate to strong positive correlations with most of the scales measuring organizational and individual outcomes and optimism was furthermore negatively correlated with both sickness absence and sickness presenteeism. The results regarding job demands and organizational and individual outcomes are in line with the findings observed above as role conflicts (hindrance demands) and are associated with reduced in-role performance, recovery, family-work enrichment and sleep quality and increased risk of sickness absence, whereas the general job demands (challenge demands) are associated with increased personal initiative, extra-role performance, work-family enrichment and sleep quality. In the third step of the analysis of the construct validity of the scales in the N-POP, we correlated the scales measuring work-related states and attitudes with the scales measuring organizational and individual outcomes. The results of these analyses showed that all four measures of work- related states and attitudes are positive and significantly correlated with personal initiative, role- performance, work-family/family-work enrichment and life satisfaction. The scales measuring work engagement, meaning at work and organizational commitment are furthermore significantly positively associated with the sleep quality and recovery of the respondents. The results of the third step of the analysis of the construct validity of the scales in the N-POP thereby supports the construct validity of the included scales since the analysis shows that the scales are statistically associated according to our expectations while still being empirically distinguishable. All in all the analyses of the reliability (internal consistency) and the construct validity of the scales included in the Nordic questionnaire on Positive Organizational Psychology lead us to conclude that the N-POP constitutes a re liable and valid instrument for assessing the psychosocial work environment, work-related states and attitudes and a series of organizational and individual outcomes in modern work organizations. The fact that the N-POP was tested and yielded similar results in two countries furthermore lends credence to the robustness of the measures in the questionnaire. It must be considered a major strength of the Nordic questionnaire on Positive Organizational Psychology that it is a part of a long-standing Nordic collaboration looking into positive factors at work. The research group that consists of researchers from Norway, 33 Sweden, Finland and Denmark has collaborated since 2006 and the N-POP can therefore be considered a product of the accumulated experiences of the research group. Secondly, it can be considered a strength of the N-POP that it is informed by two of the most dominant theories within the field of positive organizational psychology - namely the Job Demands-Resource model (Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004) and the conservation of resources theory (Hobfoll, 2001). The questionnaire is therefore solidly anchored within the research traditions of positive organizational psychology, which emphasizes that work must be considered a creative activity that, potentially, contributes to enhancing well-being and personal growth. Thirdly, the measures that have been included in the N-POP have been validated and used in other research. However, many of the applied measures have been abbreviated in the N-POP, which enhances the feasibility of using these measures in the practical assessment of the work climate in modern work organizations. It can, however, be considered a limitation of the validation of the N-POP that the validation procedure is based on relatively small samples. It is furthermore important to stress that the data have been collected in one Swedish company and four Norwegian companies and that the results therefore cannot be considered representative for the Swedish and Norwegian working populations. Finally, the results are based on cross-sectional data and it is therefore not possible to draw causal inferences from the results presented in the present report. Furthermore, the fact that all data are collected at one time-point also means that in cannot be ruled out that some of the observed correlations may be ascribed to common methods biases (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). Conclusion In the present paper we have presented results on the reliability and validity of a new Nordic questionnaire on Positive Organizational Psychology - N-POP. The analyses indicate that the N- POP has satisfactory reliability and construct validity. The questionnaire contributes with a new perspective on organizational psychology as it is anchored within the research traditions of positive organizational psychology, which emphasizes that work must be considered a creative activity that, potentially, contributes to enhancing well-being and personal growth. Finally, the results of the analyses lend credence to the notion of organizational health as the concepts of work environment, health and productivity indeed do seem to flow together in an 'optimum' point where well-being at the individual level is coexistent with efficient and productive work organizations. 34 References Bakker, A., Hakanen, J., Demerouti, E., & Xanthopoulou, D.

Challenges among health ca re workers when changes are introduced BEATE ANDR\u00c9 S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College, Faculty of Nursing, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion a nd Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway Abstract Organizational changes in the social work envi ronment will challenge both the structure of health care organizations and the more deeply rooted organizational climate and culture in health care systems. When c hanges are made in health care, theories and models for change processes that have emerged from various orga nizations/ business companies are often used for explanations. These models or theories wi ll not, however, take in to consideration the nature of the different units and department in health care and their responsibility and purpose. As an example, it is obvious that the values in an organization that cares for patients in their last phase of life are different when compared with companies that are directed towards trade and the market. We have found that if the when computerized tools are introduced in a health care organization, and if this is going to succeed, an adequate training program is imperative. In palliative care, c onflicts between the \"high-tech\" and \"high- touch\" are acutely visible and it is important that the implem entation process is conducted in such a manner that the health care personnel are involved; if this occurs, the benefits of the tool can be realized. There is also a need for skilled and motivated key personnel to be present in the unit if implemen tation is to be successful. The challenge of introducing changes in organizations The increased use of technology in an or ganization may challeng e basic institutional assumptions, disturb traditional patterns of conduct and force people to modify established routine practices (Anderson, 2002; Ash et al., 2000; 2001). Models from h ealth psychology can describe connections and causes concerning how people tend to react. These models assume that perceived behavioral co ntrol indirectly a ffects behavior by a ffecting underlying intentions (Strobe, 2008). Under certain cond itions, perceived behavi oral control can also directly affect behavior that is not originally mediated by in tentions, such as when health care workers are busy with clin ical work most of the day an d have little or no time for 38 working at the computer. Thus , although health ca re workers may in tend to use the computer, the actual lack of control over their workday may casually and directly influence their behavior. Health workers' motivation to help patients, their ability to improve the quality of patient care with or without changing rout ines (Ash et al., 2003; Friedman, 1999), and their perceived behavioral co ntrol in situations in which they experience changes are all important factors in a changing pr ocess. For instance, a change can be incorrectly interpreted as a threat or a personal loss (Brown & Coney, 1994; Fr iedman, 1999; Lorenzi & Riley, 2000). It is said that the heart and the soul of every organization can be found in the knowledge, the skills and the va lue systems of its people (A ndrew, 1996). Accordingly, the leadership of an organization should take care in introducing innovat ions that are not consistent with the organiza tion's existing values (Ande rson & Aydin, 1997; Friedman, 1999). The subjective norms in ev ery single person as well as in different groups of people must be acknowledg ed (Shefter, 2006). The effect that changes and implementations has on the culture, on behavior and in the organization has been descri bed (Massaro, 1993). The cult ural and behavioral problems seem to be more important pr oblems than the user-friend liness of the ne w technology. Further, Massaro finds that \" it is widely appreciated that the introduction of a major new technology can be a dest abilizing event\" (Massaro, 1993). This fact has been accepted by parts of the busines s world, but it has been given little at tention in health care where new technologies are in troduced frequently. An information technology system is not culturally neutral; the values of the organization and th eir responses to this cultural assault are predictable, and cannot fix pr oblems that it did not create (Massaro, 1993). However, Massaro found that such technology can acc entuate existin g problems by di verting attention from the underlying causes and fundamental issues involved. Cross-functional innovation in an institution structured alon g functional lines requi res active and consta nt support from the top management team (Massaro, 1993). The culture and values in an organization may expect to be of importance when changes are introduced. One basic idea is that mastering the proce ss of polari zation and unification is the most important aspect of successf ul change in orga nizations (Sj\u00f8vold, 1998). 39 Figure 1 The Elements of Group and Organizational Culture (Sj\u00f8vold, 1998). One way of describing organiza tional culture is by its elemen ts, as shown in Figure 1 (Sj\u00f8vold, 1998). A polarization always exists between group s or individu als acting on different \"Basic Assumptions\". While norms re present rules of behavior which connect the personality of individuals to the roles required for maintain ing group culture , and values legitimate the sanctions administered to those who break th e norms, the \"Basic Assumptions\" govern the way group memb ers should think (S j\u00f8vold, 1998). Reactions to change When people are presented with innovations that requ ire changes in their behavior, such as the introductio n of new technology to heal th care units, they may r eact in a variety of ways (Ash, et al., 2000). A common r eaction by many may be to resi st these changes (Friedman, 1999). Different categories of re sistance have been identified: resistance to environmental changes, resistance to general organizational or systems changes, general resistance to changes, and resistance to sp ecific changes (Ash, et al., 2000; Lorenzi, Riley, & Dewan, 2001). These reactions may repr esent a psychological and e ducational challenge (Andrew, 1996; Friedman, 1999). In addition, people are more likely to re sist technology that they perceive as imposed on them th an technology that is voluntary (Loren zi & Riley, 2000). Requiring workers to use new technologies may well be perceive d by the workers as behavior regulation and, as ha s been known for some time (B rehm, 1989), people generally resist the introduction of ne w technology that may require change of work habits. Furthermore, people have a te ndency to react negatively wh en their freedom of action is limited or restricted. The theory of psychological reac tance posits that on e habitual response to change is the desire to restore threatened beha vior regulation (Brehm, 1989). 40 Intentions and goal achievement Implementation research is th e scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings an d other evidence-based practices into ro utine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effect iveness of servic es (Eccles & Mittman, 2006). There is a substantial gap between pe ople's goal intenti ons and their goal achievement, because forming a goal intention does not prepare people sufficiently fo r dealing with self-regulatory problems in initiatin g, maintaining, disengaging from, or overextending oneself in goal striving. Goal striving should be regulated effectively, a nd goal achievement should thereby be facilitated. Even with goal intenti on it does not guarante e goal achievement. Understanding which factors dete rmine whether people succeed or fail in achieving desired outcomes is a fundamental conc ern in both basic and applie d psychology (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006). It is proposed that succe ssful goal achievement is faci litated by a se cond act of willing that furnishes the goal intention with an if-then plan specifying when, where, and how the person will investigat e responses that promote goal realization. These plans are termed implementation intentions (Gollwitze r & Sheeran, 2006). Howe ver, correlations between goal intentions and fu ture behavior may overestimat e the strength of intention- behavior relations because it is possible that future be havior and goal in tentions are both determined by self-perceptions of past behavior (Bem, 1972 ). The implication is that analyses should control for prev ious performance in order to determine to what extent goal intentions are associated with behavior change (Sheeran, Trafimow, & Armitage, 2003). Producing significant changes in goa l intention strength only ge nerates a modest change in goal achievement which can led to a substantial \"gap\" between pe ople's goal intentions and their subsequent attainment (G ollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006). One ca n conclude that the single act of willing involved in forming a goal intention is not sufficient to ensure goal achievement; some additional psychological co ncepts are needed. Pe ople often become inclined opponents rather than inclined actors . Developing self-regulator y strategies to help and understand how people \"bridg e\" the gap between their intentions and their behavior will be important (Gollwitze r & Sheeran, 2006). Barriers and resistance Computer implementation may lead to occupa tional stress, both dire ctly and indirectly (Smith, Conway, & Karsh, 1999). Also the st rategies used to implement computer technology may effect the level of employee stress (Smith, et al., 1999). How specific job 41 factors produce stress will pr obably vary according to type of job. Computer users in less skilled jobs have greate r amounts of stress than those in hi gher skilled jobs (Smith, et al., 1999). Understanding a work group's culture is essential to facilitate the change process (Coeling & Wilcox, 1990). Different health ca re professions will demand different approaches in the introduction programs, becau se they emcompass different cultures as well as different work tasks. Different work task may lead to different ap proaches to the same problem. Negative attitude, re sistance and behavior problems can be viewed as barriers to implementation (Brown & Coney, 1994; Lee, Teich, Spurr, 2001 ; Newton, 1995; Par\u00e9 & Elam, 1999). Studies suggest that attitude is a stable factor that is not influenced by th e implementation process. Attitude, anxiety, resistance or other behavioral prob lems are difficult to identify, establish and to measure and they can be perceived and handl ed in different ways. Barriers can be seen as u nderlying intentions that ma y have indirect effect on behavior. If the underlying intention is a negative attitude toward the us e of computers in the hospital ward, health care person nel will most likely avoid us ing them and/or focus mainly on negative implications of co mputer use. Changing underlying intentions may then produce more positive behavior. Percei ved behavioral control is mo stly connected to knowledge through the concept of self-e fficacy (Bandura, 1977, 1986). Lack of k nowledge can make people perceive less self-efficac y, which again can lead to feel ings of lack of control and resistance to change. Self-efficac y relates to the individual's c onfidence that he or she can perform a certain task an d is a sense of being competent and effective. Efficacy is an important fact or in determining individual decisions to use a computer. Efficacy beliefs may be more important than di rect experience (Hende rson, Deane, & Ward, 1995; Hill, Smith, & Mann, 1987). The assumptions are that at titudes and beliefs are major determinants of behavior; thes e models are rational reasonin g models which assume that individuals consciously deliberate about the likely consequences of behavioral alternatives that are available to them befo re engaging in action. The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) describes the components in an process of changing behavior. In this case the wanted behavior is use of CT. Perceived behavi oral control with a direct effect on behavior not meditated by intentions may be exemplified by available computers or lack of availa ble computers (Laerum, Ellings en, & Faxvaag, 2001). Such a direct effect can be ea sier to change than an indirect effect, because one can change the 42 factors that cause the effect. Problems such as lack of available comput ers or discontent with the software can be remedied. Fu rthermore, self-reported skills are an important predictor of baseline computer anxiet y and computer attitude. When people state that they have few skills, this can be an expres sion of low expectations with respect to the use of new technology. Low expectations cons titute a central component in th e social learning theory of computer aversion (Brown & C oney, 1994). Thus, low expectati ons can indirectly lead to resistance to computer technology. The role or behavior patterns may be closely related to attitude, behavioral intention, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1975). To achieve succ essful implementation of CT, it is importa nt to investigate the attitudes of hea lth care personnel (L orenzi & Riley, 2000). Newton found that the introduction of CT lead s to a shift of power from those with professional knowledge, to those with technological skills (Newton, 1995) . Health care person nel, whose power is rooted in their professional skills, may feel their power eclipsed by the need for new technological skills. The re lationship between te chnology, professional skills and caring roles must be illuminated to overcome this pr oblem, where the goal mu st be that computers should be viewed as sup port tools rather than re placements for humans. Implementation of computeriz ed tools in health care Demands for improved patient care as well as improved efficiency in the delivery of health care have increased dramatically in recent year s. New technologies, in cluding computers, are expected to play an important role in meeting these demands. The dual needs to both assess and change attitudes were identified as cr ucial factors in allowi ng for the successful implementation of these new tec hnologies (B. Andr\u00e9 et al., 2008) . The challenges for future clinical work and research will be to influence the behavior and intentio ns of health care personnel, to focus on the benefi ts of introducing computerized t ools in health care units, and to make certain that the in stitution's leadership is fu lly supportive of the change. Furthermore, if the introducti on of computerized tools is go ing to succeed, an adequate training program is imperative (B. Andr\u00e9, et al., 2008). Implementation of computerized tec hnology in palliative care units Symptom assessment is important in palliative car e. Computerized technology (CT) is available for use in such assessm ent, but barriers against implem entation of CT in health care in general are well known, but less is known about how such technology is perceived by palliative health care personnel. It has been found that the health condition of the patient is 43 important in their perception of whether the to ol is useful or not. Conflicts between the \"high-tech\" and \"hig h-touch\" were repor ted in both units. When the implementation process is conducted in such a manner that the health care pers onnel are involved, be nefits of the tool can be realized. Thus, effective implementation and use of \"high-tech\" can lead to more time release for \"high-touch\" (Andre, Ringdal, Loge, Rannestad, & Ka asa, 2009). The desire for a resource person was reported and the expectations regarding this person differed but included that this pers on had to be present at the unit, should provide quick help, should be a driving force and responsible for training and teac hing. There is a ne ed for skilled and motivated key personnel in the unit if implementation is to be successful (Beate Andr\u00e9, Ringdal, Loge, Rannesta d, & Kaasa, 2008). Conclusion Innovations in information tec hnology must actually be deploye d to have a positive impact on quality and producti vity. Yet, innovation re searchers have known for some time that a new technology may be introduced with great enthusiasm a nd enjoy widespread initial acquisition, but will ne vertheless still fail to be thoroughly depl oyed among many acquiring firms. Even if the health serv ices are increasingly in need of the benefits that information technology can promise, the capability to bri ng about these benefits is being severely compromised by inability to adeq uately address the pr oblems that organiza tions present. So, even if the organizations need the benefit that a new information system can bring, lack of people and organizational skills can hamper the impl ementation (Lorenzi, 2004). An implementation strategy, used in several organizations to im plement information technology, may not be fully applicable in health care organizations due to their complexity. The nature of the organization and its in teraction with the implementa tion strategy also brings out special issues in health ca re organizations(Southon, Sauer, & Dampney, 1999). Further on, the focus on technologies-in-practice also allows an examination of the extent to which users realize the designer's intention fo r a technology, or if it is actually user governed. It has long been recognized that technologie s are often not used as design ed or intended, but generating an adequate understanding of how, where and why the slip page between design and use occurs in practice has been di fficult (Orlikowski, 2000). There are se veral challenges in health care organizati ons concerning introduc tion of changes and new tools. The professions working in health care are not engaged in development a nd implementation of the tools or the models for organizational chan ges. Both the usefulness of these tools and how to develop an ownership to them are impor tant issues in the introduction of changes in health care 44 organizations. If this introduction is going to succeed, it is important that health care workers' experiences are included in the rese arch of developing and implementation of new tools and models for change in health care and that the social working environment is a focus when changing processes to ensu re quality of patient care. 45 References Ajzen, I.

In recent years, health promotion leadership ha s received increasing attention, especially in the Nordic countries. Some authors have atte mpted to develop a definition of health promotion leadership; however, there is presently no consensus. Further studies are needed to explore the concept of leadership and health promotion workplaces. Health promotion workplaces Health promotion programmes were first introdu ced in the workplace in the 1960s as part of occupational health schemes, primarily for safety and product quality reasons. They have since then evolved into a wide range of appr oaches to improve employees' health (Rootman et al., 2001). In recent decades there has been an increased focus on workplace health promotion, both internationally and nationally. This is furthermore authorized by th e legislation, declarations and charters of some countries. Health Promotion is defined in the Ottawa Charter as: \"Health promotion is the pr ocess of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health\" (WHO, 1986). \"According to this definition, health is not merely an absence of disease but also a reso urce for everyday life, including physical, mental and soci al well-being\" (Eriksson, 2011). In Norwa y, the Norwegian Trade Unions, the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry, the Mini stry of Labour and Government Administration and the Ministry of Health, worked up in The Lillestr\u00f8m Declaration (2002) that health -promoting workplaces are char acterised by the following: workplaces which give everyon e the opportunity to make use of his or her resources and in this way contribute to sustaina ble economic growth and healthy, viable enterprises 50 leaders who are present and act as facilitators leaders who promote broad-mi ndedness, tolerance, and fr eedom to think differently common, visible basic values wh ich create iden tity and pride openness for diversity a nd our human differences ensuring that everyone feel they master their jobs and contri bute to the results through feedback from customers and users consideration for the whole person based on individual needs a nd life situations physical surroundin gs which inspire us, ma ke us happy, and crea te arenas where we can be together opportunities for personal a nd professional developmen t and learning at the workplace (The Lillestr\u00f8m Declaration on Wo rkplace Health Promotion, 2002). \"Scandinavian work environment resear ch, by tradition, has emphasized the importance of employee job c ontrol and participation. Furthe rmore, trade unions have fought for better workin g conditions on behalf of their me mbers, realizing that a positive work climate will not only reduce employee stra in but also contribute to a more motivated workforce and, in the long run, grea ter organizational effectiveness\" (Sverke, 2009). In Norway, health promotion in th e workplace is also warrante d in the Working Environment Act as: a) to secure a working environmen t that provides a basis for a healthy and meaningful working situ ation, which affords full safety from harmfu l physical and mental influences and that has a sta ndard of welfare at all times consistent with the level of technological and social deve lopment of society, b) to ensure sound conditions of employment and equality of treatm ent at work, c) to facilitate adaptations of the individual employee's working situat ion in relation to his or her capab ilities and circum stances of life, d) to provide a basis wher eby the employer and the empl oyees of unde rtakings may themselves safeguard and de velop their working environm ent in cooperation with the employers' and employees' organiza tions and with the requisite guidance and su pervision of the public authorities, e) to foster inclusive work ing conditions (The working Environment Act, 2005). The salutogenic approach developed by Antonovsky (1987) vi ews health as a psychosocial concept an d focuses on factors th at promote and mainta in health. In recent decades, the pathogenic appro ach has been the dominating pe rspective, this view having more focus on the biomedical as pects of health. On the cont rary, health promotion focuses 51 more on socioeconomic conditi ons and shifting reso urces in order to prevent problems before they occur (Rootman et al., 2001). In Antonovs ky's article, The salutogenic model as a theory to guide health promo tion, he clarifies his theory of sense of coherence (SOC): \"These strands of thought led to the emergence of the sense of coherence (SOC ) construct, a generalized orientation towa rd the world which perceive s it, on a continuum, as comprehensible, manageable a nd meaningful\" (Antonovsky, 1996 ). Hanson (2007) builds on Antonovsky's theories of SO C, and claims that employe es who experience work as meaningful, manageable and comprehensible, wi ll experience work as a coping and health promotion workplace. He has operationalised these perspectiv es and relationships with examples from the workplace. Elements wh ich contribute to the achievement of meaningfulness are those pertai ning to conditions such as goals and rewards, human relationships, positive experi ences, accomplishing something that gives value, being included, and the concep t of fighting for and experiencing success. Conditions including knowing each other, havi ng communication, knowledg e and overview, give comprehensibility. Cooperati on, proper knowledge, influe nce in the workplace, and appropriate tools to solve the tasks, provide manageability in the daily work. Hanson (2007) believes that these dimensions must be managed, included an d accepted indivi dually, within the group and in the organization, in order to prov ide positive synergy effects. In recent years there has been some interesting rese arch on health promotion workplaces in the Nordic countries, especial ly in relation to study ing the importance of psychosocial work conditions fo r employee health and well-being . Sverke (2009) states: \"It is by now well-known that factors such as too high job demands, role c onflict, job insecurity, time pressure, violence at wo rk, poor leadership, and excessive work hours may negatively affect the individual employee. On the other hand, several benefi cial factors have also been identified, including control at work, participation in decision-making, soci al support, clear goals, relevant feedback, a nd skill utilization\". In 2008, a Swedish study examined the recovery factors in companies, and what should be done in orde r to reduce sickness absence. Based on their assessment, ther e are \"healthy\" compan ies in all industri es (Ahlberg, 2008). This indicates that the percep tion of some industries having higher sickness absence than others is not necessaril y correct. Additional findings in the study were: clear leadership and involved employees provid e greater health benefits . Sick leave is lower in firms that recruit their managers internally. Comp anies that have routines for rehabilitation have healthier employees. 52 In summary, research on work place health promotion is in a state of dynamic change. As Rootman et al., (2001) emphasi sed, the ways of m easuring the processe s and outcomes of health promotion programmes in the work place are in their infa ncy. They also point out that much can be learned from eval uations undertaken in non-healt h areas with similar complex issues, such as management approach and evaluation method s from other disciplines. Health Promotion Leadership Many definitions of leader ship have been introdu ced over the years, al though the majority of these definitions posse ss less research approval (Yukl, 20 06). Management literature and research on the topic has mainly been linked to a western indust rialized culture. Bass (2004) points out that there are almost as many definitions of leadersh ip as there are people whom have tried defining the term. Ho wever, he believes that ther e are some similarities and characteristics corresponding to the term. These characteristic s include leadership focus on group processes, an actualised influence, persuasion skills, a nd relationships, the attainment of goals, and interactions and implementation of structure. A clear and simple definition of management is therefore a challenge. The concep t of leadership is of ten used as a binary concept - \"either or ne ither thinking\" (Wittek & Kvernbekk, 2009), either a good leader or a bad leader. Such cate gorisation can be difficu lt, since there often are some overlapping similarities between them. Ther e are many descriptive definiti ons of leadership, and they have been introduced throughout hundreds of years, often be ing related to ea ch other. Even Machiavelli's book \"The Prince\", written in 1513, deals with ma nagement. His description of leadership is still relevant today, although many woul d argue that it is raw and unmasked. He portrays certainly not lead ership as it should be, but as it actually occurs (Bjartveit, Eikeset, 2008). From a historical perspective, numerous lead ership theories have been launched. In the early twentieth century, ma nagers' personality traits we re in focus, and different personality traits were prom oted as part of good leadersh ip (Northouse, 2004; Yukl, 2006). Within the last decades, the visionary and charismatic lead ership has gained increasing attention. (Avolio, Yammarino, 2002; Bass, 1990; Bass, Riggio, 2 006). In this period the \"Five-factor\" model (Costa, Mc Crae, 1985) has focused on manage rs' personality traits. The Five-factor model has al so been used to investigate th e importance of personality in connection with transformational leadership. Today th ere are several mode ls and leadership theories that are used. One is the situational leadership theory developed by Hersey & Blanchard (1969). According to this model, e ffective leadership vari es, depending on the 53 task, job or function that needs to be accompli shed, and the employees' maturity. Another is the leader - member exchange (LMX) model. This theory describes the role-making processes between a leader a nd each individual subordina te, and explains how those relationships with various memb ers can develop in unique ways and over time (Dansereau et al., 1975). Today the transforma tional leadership model has gain ed an increase in research focus (Martinsen, 2004; Yukl, 2006). The model of transformational and transact ional leaderships was first introduced by Burns (1978) and later deve loped by Bass (1985). \" The two types of lead ership were defined in terms of the component behaviours' used to influence followers a nd the effects of the leader on followers \" (Yukl, 2006). Transformational leadership increases follower motivation and performance, and generate enthusiasm and comm itment to task objectives more than transactional leadersh ip. Transformational leadership is perceived to be the form of management that inte grates parts of ear lier leadership theories (Bass, Riggio, 2006). Bass (1985) argued that transactiona l leadership was an inefficien t way to lead compared to transformational leadership. Seve ral studies have shown that the two le adership styles are complementary, and can be used by the same manager, depe nding on the situation and task. But there are a couple of cruc ial differences between the two. A number of studies indicate that transformational leadership is related to effectiveness, satisf action and commitment of employees (Bass, 1990; Ba ss, Riggio, 2006; Hetland, Sa ndal, 2003; Judge , Bono, 2002). Transformational leaders are often seen as good and effici ent, and the organizations they manage more often achieve positive economic results (Bas s, Riggio, 2006). In addition, transformationa l leadership has a positiv e and motivating effect on subordinates (Yukl, 2006). The fo llowers feel trust, loyalty, admiration and respect towards the transformational leader, and th ey achieve more than they we re originally expected to do. Bass (1999) summarizes the resear ch on the effects of transact ional versus transformational leadership. He indicates that the transforma tional leadership is more efficient on job satisfaction among employees, and empowers followers to take more initi ative in their work. Despite a large number of studie s regarding transformational lead ership, researchers have not found the specific leader characteristics th at give these positive e ffects. However, they suggest that leadership char isma, motivation, support, r ecognition, empower ment, and the consultation of employees are included in this leadership st yle (Yukl, 2006; Yukl, Lepsinger, 2004). Bass (1990) points out some personality traits such as determination, self-confidence, and understanding of su bordinate needs that characterize transformational leaders. In 54 addition, there are four vari ous types of transformationa l leadership behaviours: Idealized Leadership is the behaviour that arou ses employees to feel a pow erful identification toward the leader. Inspirational Motivation is the leader behaviour th at includes communication of an inspiring vision and promotes for the followers powerful sym bols to arouse greater effort and a feeling of belonging. Individualized Consideration is the behaviour that provides coaching, support an d encouragement . Intellectual Stimulation influences the employees to view problems from another pe rspective and with a new awareness. Ther e are today several studies indicating that part of transformational leadership can be learned (Bass, Avolio, 1994; Bass, Riggio, 2006). Yukl (2006) indicates leaders influence cognitions of empow erment. The degree of empow erment is dependent on the leaders' degree of delegati on and cooperation with their em ployees. Other benefits of empowerment are improved deci sion-making, increased sense of responsibility, initiative and skills amongst employees (Yukl, 2006). Empow erment is closely re lated to Sense of Coherence (SOC) and healthy workplaces (Hanson, 2010). Health promoting leadership has gained an increase in attention. Frick (2004) indicates that organisational work environmen t, management style a nd organisation of work tasks are important for employee health. In Norway, The Lillestr\u00f8m Declaration (2002) emphasises that the management plays a role in building hea lth promoting workplaces. The declaration states: the manage ment takes responsibility for building up commitment and understanding of the impor tance of health promot ion in the organisation, the management in collaboration with the employees creates social and professional meetin g places and settings with a view to developing a health-promoting culture, and the manage ment in collaboration with the employees paves the way for a cultu re that uses creati vity and humour. Some authors have tried to define what he alth promotion leadership is, but there is currently no common consensus on the concep t and therefore no clea r definition (Shain, Kramer, 2004). Eriksson (2011) is one who has tried to define health promotion leadership as: \"leadership that works to create a culture fo r health promoting work places and values, to inspire and motivate employee pa rticipation in such a deve lopment. Health promoting leadership can also be viewed as a critic al part of organisationa l capacity for health promotion, including manage rial knowledge and skil ls as well as organ isational policies and structures that support a health promoting workplace. Ther efore, leadership involvement in the systematic development of both the phy sical and psychos ocial work environment is important\" . Nyberg et al., (2005) point out several aspects of he alth promoting factors in 55 leadership. A health promoting leader shows consid eration towards subordinates, initiates structure when needed -especiall y in stressful situations, allo ws employees to control their work environment, gives acces s to empowerment structures, provides opportunities for participation, inspires employ ees to see a higher meaning in their work and provides intellectual stimulation. In ad dition, a good leader is often charismatic. A bad leader does not show consideration, uses only a transactional approach towa rds employees, does not respond to subordinates, does not monitor performance, and deprives employe es of participation, autonomy, and control. The auth ors thus indicate that he alth promoting leadership corresponds to different aspects of transformational behaviou r and characteristics. Hanson (2010) builds on Antonovs ky's theory of Sense of Coherenc e, and he indicat es that people who experience their work as m eaningful, manageable and compre hensible will experience a health promotion workplace. A health promo tion leader must ther efore concentrate on building an environment that focuses on comprehensibil ity, manageability, and meaningfulness in the subor dinates' daily work. Health promotion leadership is concerned wi th creating a culture for health promoting workplaces, and that the leader s are engaged in the systemat ic development of both the physical and psychosocial work environment. However, there are fe w studies that have examined the influence proces ses that account for the positiv e relationship found between leader behaviour and follower performance and health promotion work places. In addition, Eriksson (2011) points out that future research should emphasize the evaluation of the effects of a health promotion leadershi p. More research is needed to determine these relationships. 56 References Ahlberg, G., Bergman, P., Ekenvall, L., Parm sund, as a theo ry to guide health promotion.

Health Promotion among the Ill Health promotion is often associated with stra tegies to help the heal thy people stay healthy. However, more people survive former lethal di seases, often with long- term side-effects from the disease or the medical treatment, and a gr owing number of people are diagnosed with a chronic condition. Promoting health should ther efore be regarded as a reasonable strategy, also for the many defined as ill. Since 'health ' implies a bio-psycho-so cial-spiritual entity, 'health promotion' resembles well-being and qualit y of life. In this section, some parts of the phenomenon 'health promotion' and related conc epts are investigated in different patient populations. In chapter 5, a theoretical pres entation of health pr omotion among the ill is given. In chapter 6, quality of life and health promotion am ong survivors of myocardial infarct is investigated. In chapter, 7, resilience as a factor to sustain ac tivity participation is discussed. In chapter 8, benefits from support groups for cancer victims are investigated. In chapter 9, benefits from rehabilitation for patients with COPD are shown. And finally, in chapter 10, results from a study on psychos ocial health and quality of life among children/adolescents surviving cancer are given. 60 61 5. Health promotion among the ill TORIL RANNESTAD S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College, Faculty of Nursing, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion a nd Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway Abstract Health promotion is also a sensible strategy fo r the ill. Health comprises all aspects of life; physical, psychological, social and existential aspects. Health promotion should therefore be directed towards actualizing the health potentia l in all these interconnected aspects, whether a person is ill or not. Health promotion is fu rther closely linked to well-being and quality of life, with a potential positive im pact on health. Most of our health is created in what can be called society, but health and ill-health is persi stently unequally distributed. Equity becomes a highly relevant factor for heal th promotion strategies and salutogenic societies. Health services must move beyond th eir disease orientation and be re-oriented towards health promotion, not only for the heal thy but also for the ill. Introduction Recently, a growing emphasis has been paid to he alth promotion. There is a desire for more knowledge about the source s of health (salutog enesis) in addition to all the knowledge we have from the medical discipline about the sources of disease (pathogenesis ). How can health be promoted, improved, and stre ngthened? In th e public health perspect ive, health promotion is mainly viewed as activities directed at helping healthy people st ay healthy. A legitimate question is whether health promotion can be regarded as a plausible strategy also for people who are ill. In this introducto ry Chapter I will argue that h ealth promotion among the ill is important and valuable. Health and illness In modern societies public he alth has improved throughout th e last century. In Norway, infant mortality has decreased to literally zero at the same ti me as longevity has increased substantially. In contrast to earlier times, almost all babies will survive and can face a prospect of living long lives. As such, the publi c itself can be re garded as healthy. Nevertheless, more people than ever consult doctors and more people than ever are on sick leave or have a disability pension. Are Norw egians, after all, more ill than before? 62 Illness can be explained by indi vidual lifestyle factors such as tobacco use, poor diet, and physical inactivity . Disease prevention aims at chan ging the unhealthy behavior of individuals. Due to demographi c changes in most countries, the numbe r of elderly people will grow, indicating a hi gher prevalence of illn ess in the future. Tha nks to - among others - the advances in medical developm ent more people will survive former lethal diseases, living long lives with a chroni c condition or long-term side-effect s from certain ty pes of medical treatment. A disease prevention ap proach will not have any signi ficant effect on this trend. Illness can also be explained by society-related factors. Ac cording to Krokstad et al (2002), an increase in sick leav e is for the most caused by new and strenuous requirements at work, rather than a higher in cidence of diseases. Many employe d people get ill and fall out of the post-industrial working force because they cannot co pe with the high speed and multiple changes with a growing demand for co mmunicative skills and social intelligence (M\u00e6land, 2010). The main reason for sick leave and disabilit y pension in Norway is not well-known diagnosable diseases, but rather pain conditions a nd minor mental disorders. A bio-medical approach will not have any significant effe ct on these matters. Further, there is strong evidence that th e strongest and most dominant effects on health are determined by social inequality and inequity (Mackenba ch and Kunst, 1997; Mittelmark et al, 2012). Health promotion views health as create d in society, in the everyday arenas of homes, work, sc hools, and local communities, demanding politi cal action. Although disease, illness a nd health comprise concep ts embedded in different scientific paradigms, a distin ct discrimination between them is, perhaps not, a fruitful approach in health promotion. As human bei ngs, as long as there is breath in us, we have some level of health (Antonovs ky, 1988). At the same time all of us will fall ill during our lifetime, some with long-lasting/chronic disorder s. To be ill is so co mmon that it actually should be regarded as a natural part of life (Ihleb\u00e6k et al, 2002). Health and illness are intertwined and related phenomena in life rather than opposite entities. A strict line between the healthy and the ill is arbitr ary and not based in reality. Health If health is understood in bi o-statistical terms as the abse nce of disease (Boorse, 1977), health will be attribut ed to the elimination of diseases. Health promotion will then have a negative focus, defined as dise ase prevention. Health is, however, more of ten understood in a broader, bio-psycho-social-ex istential sense (Espenes and Smedslund, 2009). This holistic 63 perspective on health views these dimensions as a whole, where the elements are interconnected and one element affects the other (Glaister, 2001; Quinn, 2005). When asking lay Norwegians about th eir comprehension of health (Fuge lli and Ingstad, 2009), it becomes obvious that most people regard health in such a multidimensional, holistic way. And most people are rather pragma tic about what they consider being healthy - they proclaim that they can have a good health de spite having a disease and do not expect a utop ian, perfect health or complete well-being. \"G ood is good enough\". Holistic health (Nordenfelt, 1987) is a good thing, meaning that the person is healthy if he/she feels well and can function in his/her social co ntext (M\u00e6land, 2010). Health promotion in this tradition will go beyond elimination of \"the ho ly trinity of risk\" (Raphael, 2010), and have a positive focus, aiming at the promotion of well-being and actualizing the health potential in al l aspects of life (WHO, 1986, Pender et al, 2005). Then a distinction between the healthy and the ill becomes subsidiary a nd rather unin teresting. Health promotion If holistic health is to be pr omoted, health promoting activiti es must be regarded as more than nutrition and fitness. Furthe r, if holistic health is to be promoted among the ill, health promoting activities must be more than a bio-medical focus on th e management of the disease. Whether or not people are healthy or ill (as arbitrary as that distinction may be), health promoting activities should not be mere ly directed towards st rengthening the physical health (by nutrition and fitness), but also towa rds strengtheni ng the psychological (by stress management and career achievement), the social (by friends and family ), and the existential (by love and hope) (H odgkinson et al, 2007; Keyes, 2007; Lim and Zebrack, 2008). Since all these dimens ions are interconnect ed and one dimensi on affects the other (Glaister, 2001; Quinn, 2005), more attent ion should be paid on promoting the psycho- social-existential parts of our health when the physical heal th is impaired by disease and illness. The total \"sum\" may thus be good he alth, in spite of ha ving an illness. A strong link between mind a nd body (psyche and soma) has been postulated in different cultures at all times. As far as almost 3000 years ago, scholars wrote that \"a joyful heart helps healing, but a brok en spirit dries up the bones \" (Proverbs, 17:22). Current research gives evidence that supports such relationships (Hodgkinson et al, 2007; Keyes, 2007; Lim and Zebrack, 2008; Seligmann, 2008). Im proving the psychologi cal, social and existential health and well-b eing may be good for its own wo rth, but may also have a 64 positive effect on the physic al health, by improv ing the immune, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular systems (Ryff et al, 2004; Nelson et al, 2008) as well as being a salutogenic buffer against potential pathogenic processes. Maybe the optimal health promoting actions are to teach the children to be happy (Byrne, 201 1) and to help people live flourishing lives (Keyes, 2002)? As indicated in Figure 1, the medical disc ipline concentrates on diagnosing, treating and preventing physical and mental disease. This is fine - we need ex perts on diseases. In contrast to this, health promotion is dire cted towards promoting physical and mental health . Interesting enough, regardless wh ere a person finds her-/himself on th e disease-health- continuum, she/he may experien (Ringdal and Ri ngdal, 2000). Since \"a joyful heart helps healing\" (Proverbs, 17:22), health promotion is also directed towards promotion of QoL, and that people can have flourish ing and meaningful lives. The term \"health promotion\" is in this sense more equivalent to \"life-prom otion\" (Lindstr\u00f6m and Eriksson, 2010). Figure 1: Relationships between health, disease, quality of life (QoL) and health promotion. Health and quality of life (QoL) A broad, holistic comprehens ion of health is related to well-being (WHO, 1946; 2006), which again is related to QoL (Nordenfelt, 19 91). Whereas \"happiness \" has been described and defined throughout history from the time of the early phil osophers (Tatarkiewicz, 1976), QoL is a rather new concept, emerging from the economic and political discussions in the USA in the 1960s. The medical, nur sing and health sciences have used the con cept since the 1980s, mainly for resear ch, but also for prac tical/clinical reasons , and comprising an 65 understanding of a multidimensi onal and subjective comprehe nsion of the good life (Wahl and Hanestad, 2004). More than holistic health theories, QoL encompasses values and meaning in life - questioning 'what is importa nt to you?' Although the co ncept of QoL emerges from philosophical descriptions of happiness, the defi nitions often used nowadays comprise a notion of satisfaction. QoL is thus manifested as satisfaction with the domains of importance to you (Oleson, 1990; Ferrans and Po wers, 1992). Altho ugh inflicted with a disease, an individual may be sati sfied with other areas of life that are important to him/her. Values and expectati ons vary from person to pers on, during the course of life and after illness. Health (life) pr omoting activitie s should be directed to wards acting together with people with a chro nic illness to re-orient their values (Sprangers and Schwartz, 1999) in such a way that a good QoL a nd a meaningful, flourishing life may be reestablished and achieved. Responsible for health Who is responsible for h ealth - the individual or society? It is inevit able that the person's lifestyle has an immense impact on his/her health. Accordingly, health promotion is therefore \"the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health\" (WHO, 1986). Studies show, however, that he alth is persistently asso ciated with higher socio- economic strata, and also in socio-democratic countries (M ackenbach and Kunst, 1997). Such social inequa lities in health could be explained by determinan ts of social position. Although this rela tionship has been found fo r some marginalized groups, there is limited scientific eviden ce for such associations (Elstad, 2005). On the contrary, components of social position have been found to increasingl y determine health outco mes. The psychosocial perspective proposes that ill-health is a consequence of l ong-term stress. Lack of control (Syme, 1996) and relative deprivation (Wilkin son, 1996) may represent the key elements of this association, as both phenomen a are related to the lower levels of the social hierarchy in modern societies. According to The Ottawa Charter (WHO, 1986), health promotion focuses on: \"- achieving equity in health. Health promotion action ai ms at reducing differences in current health stat us and ensuring equa l opportunities and resources to enable all people to achieve their fullest health potential. This includes a secure foundation in a supportive environment, access to 66 information, life skills and opportunities for making healthy choices. People cannot achieve their fullest health potent ial unless they are able to take control of those things which determine their he alth. This must apply equally to women and men.\" Health promotion demands coordinated ac tion by all concerned; by governments, by health and other so cial and economic sectors, by nongovernmental and voluntary organization, by local authorit ies, by industry and by the me dia. Consequently, health promoting strategies aim at cr eating salutogenic societies w ith environments that support good health practices (Eri ksson and Lindstr\u00f6m, 2008). Health services Health is not created mainly in the health sect or, but rather in all sectors that constitute a society. Therefore, the prerequi sites and prospects fo r health cannot be en sured by the health sector alone (WHO, 1986). Recentl y, new White Papers have be en passed in Norway to ensure more attention to health promotion and public health. Al so, the health services must be re-oriented to move increasingly in a health promotion direction, beyond their responsibility for providi ng only clinical and cura tive services. Patients will be transferred earlier from specialized hospitals to health services in municipalities, where the main focus will be on health (despite th e disease), health promotion in a broad sense, functioning, coping with the illn ess, and QoL. Conclusion Health promotion is a sensible strategy also for the ill. Health comprises all aspects of life; physical, psychological, social an d existential aspects. Health promotion should therefore be directed towards actualizing th e health potential in all th ese interconnected aspects, regardless whether a person is ill or not. Further, health promotion is closely linked to well- being and QoL, with potential po sitive impacts on health. Most of our health is created in what can be called society, but he alth and ill-health are persistently uneq ually distributed. Equity becomes a highly releva nt factor for health promotio n strategies and salutogenic societies. Health services must move beyond their disease orientati on and be re-oriented towards health promotion, which include s health promotion for the ill. 67 References Antonovsky, A. (1988).

Health related quality of life among elderly Polish and Norwegian MI survivors: in search of positive bases for secondary health promotion. MAGDALENA ANNA LAZAREWICZ1,2, EVA GEIR ARILD ESPNES2,5 1 Medical University of Warsaw, Department of Medical Psychology, Warsaw, Poland 2 Research Centre for Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway 3 St. Olavs Hospital, Outpatient Clinic at th e Department of Cardiology, Trondheim, Norway 4 S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College, Faculty of Nursing, Trondheim, Norway 5 Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, Department of Social Work and Health Science, Trondheim, Norway Abstract Regardless of the vast progre ss in cardiovascular diseases' treatment, health outcomes remain poor for patients with heart diseases: morbidity rates are sti ll high, while quality of life (QoL) of those who survi ve is diminished. Therefore, an increased emphasis is being placed on QoL improvement. However, many prevention, health promotion and rehabilitation programmes remain inaccurate and ineffective. Due to th e gradual aging of societies, followed by an increasing number of persons at high risk of myocardial infarction (MI), research on the QoL in somatic disease and creating it as a coherent multivariable theoretical concept seems cruc ial for both the individual welfa re of patients and finances within the health sector. The following paper pr esents a Polish-Norwe gian research project whose main goal is to inves tigate mechanisms that connect chosen positive personality characteristics and social support with health -related QoL in elderly male and female MI survivors and, in addition, to compare those fa ctors and their interac tions in Polish and Norwegian patients. We believe that provid ing empirical data on those relations and differences will help in planni ng more efficient, gender-and cultu rally- sensitive interventions aimed at improving the MI survivors' health an d QoL.The research is in the implementation phase, therefore the purpose of this paper is only to present the project itself: its theoretical background and methodology. 72 Introduction Multi-annual medical an d psychological resear ch on coronary diseas e patients has allowed researchers to recognise a vari ety of heart disease risk fact ors and to develop a number of accurate and successful medical therapies. However, little is known about factors having the biggest influence on the level of patients' adaptation to life after cardiac events. It is known, though, that their quality of life (QoL) is dimini shed (e.g. Bosworth et al., 2000). Therefore, much emphasis is recently bei ng placed on its incr ease. For example, The European Society of Cardiology has included maintenance and impr ovement of QoL as trea tment goals in their guidelines for patients w ith different heart diseases (Fox et al., 2006; Swedberg et al., 2006). It has become an underlying go al of many rehabilitation an d health promotion programs (Bennett et al., 2001). Neverthe less, QoL is a multi-dimensiona l and complex construct with a great variety of envi ronmental and individual characteristics that influence it (Wilson & Cleary, 1995). This may be one of the r easons why many interven tions appear to be ineffective in regard to QoL (Bennett et al ., 2001). Nowadays, when - due to a dynamic medical development - we wo rk with a growing number of somatic disease survivors (Tunstall-Pedoe et al., 2000), conducting research in the area of post-di sease, it seems that QoL is even more crucial and important. Especially in countr ies where a gradual aging of society (WHO, 2007), accompanied by an increasing number of persons be ing at high risk of having an acute myocardial infarction (M I) (Aboderin et al., 2002), is observed. A majority of previous psyc hosocial studies in the MI area have mainly provided knowledge on biological, psycholo gical and social limitations experienced by working-age male MI survivors and on their correlation with QoL (Emery et al , 2004; Rankin, 2002; Wickholm & Fridlung, 2003). Little is known, however, about older adults and women's post-MI recovery period (Norekv\u00e5 l et al., 2007), whil st a gradual increase in MI inci dence in older women has been observed and a decline in cardiovascul ar diseases (CVD) death in women of a lesser magnitude has been observe d when compared with men (Rosamond et al., 1998; Tunstall-Pedoe et al., 2000). Moreover, longitudina l studies on th e mechanisms underlying changes in QoL after MI are needed. Addition ally, latest studies indicate that in order to fully understand the pr ocesses of change in QoL afte r MI, we need to look beyond a pathological approa ch, turn more attention to positiv e psychology and in vestigate positive aspects of life such as patients' resources a nd strengths in relation to adapting to cardiac disorders (Bennett et al., 2001) . Among these aspects are the so -called \"positive\" personality traits and characteristics, as well as social resources. 73 Positive personality ch aracteristics and QoL Personality factors, as one of a group of potential human re sources, can in fluence the way people approach life circumst ances or the outcomes they experience , which in turn may have a favourable or unfa vourable impact on their QoL. Thus, we may improve our understanding of pathways to Qo L by conceptualiz ing personality as part of its post-disease theoretical model (Wrosch & Scheier, 2003). Su ch an approach is in line with the recent studies mentioned above, as well as is broa dly discussed in the lit erature, including the Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) c ognitive and transactional m odel of stress, which is a general, conceptual fram ework for the project. When incorporating ideas of positive psychology into a project concentrating on health, the following three personality disp ositions will be of a special interest: (1) Antonovsky's concept of sense of coherence (1987) , (2) Bandura's self -efficacy (1977; 1997), and (3) Scheier and Carv er's dispositional optimism (1985). Sense of coherence (SOC) is defined as a global orientation that expresses th e extent to which one has a pervasive, enduri ng though dynamic feeling of confidence\" (Antonovs ky, 1987, p. 19), self- efficacy refers to assessment of personal abilities to overcome ta xing situations in the future (Bandura, 1977), while di spositional optimism denotes positive expectancies even in the face of obstacles (Scheier & Carv er, 1985). Recently, those di spositions were found to be associated with many aspects of health, wellbeing, functioni ng and QoL in a variety of somatic patients' samples (inc luding cardiac and elderly pati ents) Wright & Cullen, Guti\u00e9rrez- Do\u00f1a & Schwarzer, 2005). Even though these three co ncepts share some similarities, they also differ in many aspects and their potential overlaps have not been well investigated. Thus, it is suggested that the joint examination of those types of expecta tions is important in order to delimit interrelationships (Karad emas, Kafetsios & Sideridis, 2007). post-disease st ability in time of these conc epts has also not been well investigated. Although an increasing body of ev idence indicates positive personality dispositions - QoL associations, the pathwa ys through which they operate are sti ll unclear. It is hypothesised that SOC, se lf-efficacy and optimism might be related to enha nced outcomes through regulating behavi our and emotions or through me diating other unde rlying cognitive 74 structures and processes (Karad emas et al. 2007). Th ere is some evidence supporting such a hypothesis (Pallant & Lae, 19 99; Taylor & Armor, 1996; Bandura, 1997; Schwarzer, 1992). Recently, there is also a growing body of evid ence indicating that they may be positively related to another important pe rsonal recourse - social suppo 1997; Brissette, Scheie r & Carver, 2002). The place of social support in the per sonality dispositions - QoL relation Similarly to the concept of Qo L, social support also does not have one, coherent and commonly accepted definition. It is generally accepted, though, that it is multidimensional and complex. Thorough overviews of so cial support defi nitions, meanings, conceptualizations and classifi cations can be found in seve ral publications (e.g. Cohen, Underwood & Gottlieb, 2000; Schwarze r & Leppin, 1991; Uchino, 2004). In the context of the presen t paper it is worth mentioni ng that besides the above- mentioned positive relations between SOC, self-efficacy, op timism and social support, different dimensions of social support are also found to be sign ificantly associat ed with QoL, also in the group of ca rdiac patients (Bennett et al., 2001; Emery et al., 2004). Moreover, different dimensions of social support reduce depres sion and anxiety during times of stress, and promote psychological adjust ment to chronically stressful conditions, including coronary artery disease (Holahan et al., 1997). However, the exac t way in which th ey operate on QoL and, especially, thei r role in the po sitive personality dispositions - QoL relation remains unclear. Moreover, the re sults on the level of in fluence of different as pects of social support on QoL are inconsistent, while be ing controlled for gender and age differences (e.g. Emery et al., 2004; Glebocka & Szarz ynska, 2005). Many researcher s express a need for more research on this topic (e.g. Schwarzer & Rieckmann, 2002). Theoretical framework A literature review, accompanied by identification of areas requi ring further re search, led to building a preliminary model of associations between three positive dispositions: SOC, optimism and self-efficacy, two di mensions of social support (support seeking and perceived available support) and HRQoL in elderly MI survivors. The mode l is presented in Figure 1. 75 Figure 1. A preliminary theoretical model of associations between positive personality predispositions, (self- efficacy, optimism, sense of coherence), social support and QoL in elderly MI survivors. Aims of the study The main goal of this project is to inves tigate mechanisms connect ing positive personality characteristics (SOC, self effi cacy and optimism) and social support with HRQoL in elderly female and male MI survivors. Within the scope of that goal, the followi ng detailed aims of the study are as follows: determining the relationship between the indi vidual positive personality characteristics studied and MI survivors' HRQoL at diffe rent phases of treatment and rehabilitation; determining the re lationship of indivi dual positive persona lity characteristics studied with social support at different phases of treatment and rehabilitation; investigating a relationship between social support and MI survivors' HRQoL at different phases of treatm ent and rehabilitation; determining the role of social support in the study of th e positive personality characteristics - HRQoL re lationship (mediation versus moderation); investigating time stab ility of the explored po sitive personality ch aracteristics (after a stressful event such as MI) and investigating th e interrelations of those characteristics; investigating the importance of other bio-psychosocial characteristics in the above mentioned relations (socio -demographics, subjective health status, health behaviours and medical data as moderators of the investigated relations); analysis of differences between patients over and unde r 60 years of age, within the scope of the above-m entioned relations; 76 analysis of gender differenc es within the scope of th e above-mentio ned relations; analysis of differences with in the scope of the above- mentioned relations between Polish and Norwegian subjects. Methods Ethics and licences The study was approved by the Bi oethical Committee of Medi cal University of Warsaw, Poland (KB/104/2010) and Local Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland. In Norway, The Norwegian Data Inspectorate and The Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics approv als will be obtained. Questionnaires protected by co pyrights are ordered from li cense holders. Statistical analysis are conducted in freew are (G*Power or/and and IBM\u00aeSPSS\u00aeAmos). Sampling Six hundred patients1 after a first or subseque nt acute MI are included in the study at baseline - 300 in Norway and 300 in Po land. Each national group cons ists of 150 pa tients over 60 years old (study group; \"older peop le\" according to UN standards, WHO , 2002) and 150 under this age (control group), preferable men and wome n in an equal distribution. Primary inclusion criter ia - diagnosis of acute MI - is based on in ternational criteria introduced by European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology in 2000 and updated in 2007 (Alpert et al., 2000; Thygesen et al., 2007). Information about patients who fulfil those criteria is gi ven by doctors in charge or ta ken from the medical records. Exclusion criteria ar e a major psychiatric condition that would confound evaluation of measured variables, cognitiv e dysfunction, a serious hearing impairment disabling fluent communication, illiteracy and not being fluent in Polish or Norwegian, respectively. All patients admitted to participating cardio logy wards who meet inclusion criteria are invited to participate in the study (until the sample s reach the desired size). Registration of those cases in which patients matched the criter ia but finally did not pa rticipate in the study will be conducted in the form of general, anonymous notes on reasons for lack of 1Required sample size has been established on the basis of a priori power analysis, conducted with G*Power 3.1.2. software (Faul et al ., 2007). Occurrence of participants' dropout from the study at each wave has been taken into account and predicted at 50% level at 2nd and 3rd wave. The calculations were set for the following desired parameters: power (1- )=.95; =.05 and effect size f(V)=.27 for total of MACNEW questionnaire, see: H\u00f6fer et al., 2004), wi thin given statistical analysis design. 77 participation (e.g. lack of ag reement or missing glasses). Th e number of patients meeting particular exclusion criter ia is also controlled. Procedure A prospective longitudinal design with repeated measures is a pplied, patients being followed for 6 months after MI. In this pe riod participants are asked to fill in se ts of questionnaires three times: at the end of hos pitalization (wave 1); three mont hs (wave 2) and six months after discharge (wave 3). Baseline/Wave 1. Patients are recruited in the ho spital setting, shortly before discharge from hospital (1-2 da ys). They are informed (verba lly and in writing) about the study's background, pur pose, design, procedure, voluntary nature of participation and possibility to withdraw at any time. Those who agree to participate are asked to sign a written consent. This stage of a study is conducte d by trained nurses, whom the patients know, and takes place in a separa te room on the cardiac ward with the nurse being present throughout filling in the questionnaires. Waves 2 & 3. Three and six months after discharg e from the hospital participants receive letters containing info rmation leaflet, inst ructions, a set of questionnaires and a preaddressed and stampe d return envelope. Re searchers make phone ca lls to check if the letters reached th eir recipients. Data on patients' medical hi story includes MI severity (with complications - loss of consciousness, resuscitation; or without complicati ons) and type (NSTEMI or STEMI), left ventricular ejection fraction (L VEF), treatment (PTCA, CABG or pharmacological treatment), appearance of arrhyt hmic events during hos pitalization, length of hospital stay and patients' gender; this information is obtai ned by researchers at ba seline from the medical history. All other data is collected from patients on the bases of self-administered questionnaires. Measures Sociodemographics and Health Questionnaire . Three versio ns of a ques tionnaire are constructed to obtain data on socio-demographics (age, mari tal status, educ ation level, professional activ ity, subjective socio-ec onomic status, place and terms of permanent residence) and patient-reported health data (subjective health status, number and dates of previous MI's, comorbid ity, health behaviours, rehabilitation process). Those versions vary accordingly to each wave (e.g. at waves 2 and 3 more specific quest ions on rehabilitation 78 process and current physical f unctioning are asked, wh ile stable demogra phic questions from wave 1 are skipped). The first version consists of 19 items, version 2 and 3 - of 16 items. Sense of coherence is measured with a 13-item Sense of Coherence scale (SOC-13) - based on the original SOC-29- scale. (Anton ovsky, 1987; 1993) . The instrument has a 7-point semantic differential scal e response format with two opposite anchoring phrases (e.g. very seldom or never and very often ). The scale consists of 4 items on meanin gfulness (e.g. 'How often do you have the fe eling that there's little meaning in the things you do in your daily life?'), 5 items on comprehensib ility (e.g. 'Do you have the feeling that you are in an unfamiliar situation and don' t know what to do?') and 4 items on manageab ility (e.g. 'Has it happened that people whom you counted on disappointed you?'). The answer key allows the calculation of a total SOC score as well as separate scores for th e three above theoretical dimensions. However, as recomm ended initially by Antonovsky (1 993) and more recently by other researchers (e.g. Bernabe et al., 2009; Feldt et al., 2006; Zwolinski, 2000), only a total SOC score is calculated in th is study. After revers ing the scores on five negatively worded items, a total sum score, rang ing from 13 to 91, is obtained (with higher sc ores reflecting stronger SOC). Due to the ongoin g debate on the structure of the SOC measures (e.g. Konttinen, Haukkala & Uutela, 200 8) a confirmatory factor an alysis will be conducted. In previous studies, SOC-13 internal co nsistency calculated with Cronbach's coefficient ranks from .74 to .92 (Antonovs ky, 1993; Feldt et al., 2006; Zwolinski, 2000). For measuring self-efficacy a General Perceived Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) developed by Schwarzer & Jeruzalem (1993; 1995) is used. It consists of 10 items with a 4 point response scale ranging from 1=not at all true to 4=exactly true . A typical item is, 'Thanks to my resourcefulness, I can hand le unforeseen s ituations'. Tota l score ranges from 10 to 40, with higher scores indi cating higher self-effica cy. GSE scale has demons trated high validity and reliability (Cronbach's from .75 to .92) in many studi es across various research contexts and ethnically dive rse 2000). Optimism . The 10-item Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R) (Scheier, Carver & Bridges, 1994) is used to as sess dispositional optimism. Th e scale contains 3 questions concerning positive outcomes (e .g. 'In uncertain times, I us ually expect the best'), 3 concerning negative outcomes (e .g. 'If somethin g can go wrong for me, it will'), and 4 filler items. A 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0=strongly disagre e to 4=strongly agree is 79 used for scoring. For ca lculating a total score, responses to negative outcomes' items are reversed so that high values imply optimism. Total scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores reflecting higher level of optimism. LOT-R is inte rnationally applicable and was found to be a valid and reliab le instrument (Cronbach's =.78) in a number (see: e.g. Juczyn ski, 2007; Scheier, Carv er & Bridges, 1994). Social support is measured by two subscales from the Berlin Social Support Scales, BSSS (Schwarzer 2000; Schulz & Schwarze r, 2003); an 8-item Perceived Available Support Scale (4 items measuring em otional social support, e.g. 'There are some people who truly like me', 4 measuring instrumental soci al support, e.g. 'I know some people upon whom I can always rely') and a 5-item Support Seeking Scale (e.g. 'Whenever I am down, I look for someone to cheer me up again'). In this questionnaire , patients rate their agreement with the statements on a 4-point sc ale, with anchoring re sponses ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 4=strongly agree . Scales scores are obtai ned either by adding up items responses or by generatin g the scales' mean scores. The measure is found to be valid and reliable, with Cronbach's for its subscales ranking from .77 to .90 in previous studies (Luszczynska et al., 2006; Schulz & Schwarzer, 2003). Additionally, three items from The Nord-T r\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT 3) are used: two measuring Perceived Available Support ('Do you have friends th at can help you when you need them?', 'Do you have friends that you can speak to confidential ly?' with a Yes/No answer) and one measuring Social Participation ('How many times in th e last 6 months have you participated in the following: association or club meeting/activity ; music, singing, theatre; parish work; ou tdoor activities; dance; worked out, sports?' with answers on a 5- point scale for each ac tivity, ranging from more than once per week to never ). Those items are included in a Socio-dem ographics and Health Questio nnaire (information on HUNT Study available at: www .huntbioscences.com). Satisfaction with Life is measured with a Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) created by Diener et al. (1985). It co nsists of 5 items with a 7-poi nt Likert-type scale response format, ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree . A typical item is, 'In most ways my life is close to my ideal'. Total score ranges from 5 to 35, with higher scores indicating higher satisfac tion with life. SWLS has been ap plied in many studies and found to be a valid and reliable instrument (Cronbach's from .81 to .87) (Die ner et 2009; Pavot & Diener , 1993; Pavot et al., 1991). 80 Health Related Quality of Life is measured with the MacNew Heart Disease Health- Related Quality of Life questionnaire (MacNew) (Dixon, Lim & Ol drige, 2002; H\u00f6fer et al., 2004). It has a 2-week timeframe , contains 27 items and provid es three scales: a 13-item physical limitations scale (e.g. 'How much shortness of brea th have you experienced while doing your day-to-day acti vities?'), a 14-item emotional fu nction scale (e.g. 'How much of the time did you feel relaxed an d free of tension?') and a 13-i tem social func tion scale (e.g. 'How often have you felt unable to do your usual social ac tivities or social activities with your family?') (8 items belong to more than one sc ale). A 7-point Like rt-type scale, e.g. ranging from 1=none of the time to 7=all of the time , is used for scoring. Each scales' score is calculated as the average of the responses prov ided to items in that sc ale. If more than 50% of the items are missing, the score for that scal e is not calculated. A global HRQoL score is calculated as the average of all scored items. MacNew is a valid and hi ghly reliable instrument, with Cronbach's for its subscales ranking from .87 to .97 in previous studies (H\u00f6fer et al., 2004; Wrzesniewski, 2006). Statistics analysis Application of the above procedure allows to coll ect data suitable for cr oss-sectional analysis (age, gender and national differe nces, correlations between part icular variable s within each wave), longitudinal an alysis investigating predictors of HRQoL at further phases of treatment and rehabilitation (a t wave 2 and 3) as well as for investigating main and mediation/moderation effects of social support. Correlation anal ysis, analysis of means or analysis of variance ession analysis (including stru ctural equatio n modelling), respectively, will be conduc ted to investigate the data. What we hope to learn from the st udy and how we are planning to use this knowledge In this project, we try to c onnect the most recent theoretical trends in positive and health psychology. We hope that results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying \"positiv e personality dispositions-Q oL\" relations. Through this study we also aim at participating in synthesizing knowledge on those personality dispositions which we inve stigated , their mutual relations an d stability after MI, as well as determining gender and cultural di fferences in the investigated QoL predictors in the studied sample. 81 Although the above primary goals of the study pertai n mainly to fundamental research, we hope that the in crease of knowledge on psycholo gical mechanisms affecting HRQoL will contribute to cr eating new psycho-medi cal interventions fo r elderly cardiac patients who are undergo ing rehabilitation in which these in terventions displa y sensitivity to both gender and cultural differences. Moreover, results of the study may he lp in planning successful prevention programs and in increasing diagnostic accuracy for elde rly patients with high risk of poor QoL on further phases of treatment and rehabi litation after MI. The above practical effects are crucial for the QoL, functioni ng and health of individuals. The results also have wider social and economical implications, as improvement of patients' QoL may have a signific ant indirect effect on so cial welfare and expenses in the health sector.

Resilience mechanisms as factors to sustain activity participation in home and leisure LILLIAN REINSETH S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College, Department of Occupational Therapy, School of Health Education and Social Work, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion a nd Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway Abstract The knowledge of resilience mechanisms as facto rs to sustain the involvement in activities for home and leisure in chronic diseases is lim ited. This study aimed at examining the relationships associated with participation in committed activities (activities we are obliged to perform), discretionary activities (activitie s for recreation and pleasure), health related quality of life and self-efficacy in wo men with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The study included 233 women with RA. Their partic ipation in activities was measured by the Interest checklist, efficacy-beliefs by Arthritis self-efficacy scales and he alth related quality of life by SF-36. Related samples T-test showed a statistically significant decrease in the participation of activities during the last ten yea rs. Multivariate analyses demons trated that a high level of participation in committed activiti es were independently related to positive self-efficacy in coping with RA functions, psychological we ll-being and high educatio nal level; in addition was good physical function a significant fa ctor regarding disc retionary activities. Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive autoimmune disease with both articular- and systemic manifestations (Lee & Weinblatt, 2001). The prevalence of RA is in the region of 0.5-1% (Kvien, et al., 1997). RA occurs most often in women with a female/male proportion of 2.5/1 (Lee & Weinblatt, 2001). In a large mult inational study, RA di sease measures appear to be worse in women than in men (Sokka, et al., 2009). The burden of RA seems to be reduced during the last decade, due to better and more aggressive treatments (Uhlig, et al., 2008). In spite of better medications, remission of the most important clinical features like disease activity, pain and fatigue are only reached by 10-36% of early RA patients (Scott & Lempp, 2006) and work disability rates remain high among people with RA (Sokka, et al., 2010). 90 Occupational participation is a concept that refers to engaging in work, play, or activities of daily living that are part of an indi vidual's social and cultural context and that are desired and /or necessary to the well-being of the individual (Kielhofner, 2008). A disabling chronic disease that causes performance limitations, may change occupational participation, but not necessarily prevent it (Kielhofner, 2008). Obligatory activities include necessary activities for survival, like activities of dail y living (ADL) including eating, hygiene and dressing (Katz, et al., 2006). Committed activities contain our main social roles like household responsibilities, family care, studying or participating in paid work (Katz, et al., 2006). Discretionary activities are leisure activities like exercising, socializing, hobbies and other activities one might take on for recreation and pleasure (Katz, et al., 2006). Previous research showed a significant decrease in activity participation in women with RA over the last ten years (Reinseth & Espnes, 2007). A loss of leisure activities occurs early in RA and mainly in those who have low formal education (Wikstrom, et al., 2006). Resilience means processes that lead to well-being despite of facing significant adversity like for instance a chronic disease (Ungar, 2008). Two processes explain resilience; navigation and negotiation (Ungar, 2008). The in dividual shows ability to navigate towards resources that can sustain their well-being and shows the capacity to negotiate for these resources to be provided in culturally meaningful ways (Ungar, 2008). In a comparison between a non-resilient and a resilient group of people with chronic pa in, the resilient group reported significant higher levels of task persis tence, control perceptions and lower levels of disability beliefs (Karoly & Ruehlman, 2006). In another study of persons with chronic pain, higher levels of positive affect predicted lower levels of pain (Zautra, et al., 2005). Positive reinterpretation, active coping and acceptance coping were strongly related to resilience factors in a study regarding people with RA (Smith & Zautra, 2008). Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is a broad concept including physical, social and mental well-being and is often used to descri be the impact a chronic disease will have at quality of life (Ware, et al., 2000). In a previous study, the results showed that performing a high number of activities for home and leisure, correlated with high scores on psychological well-being, while the participation in few ac tivities correlated positively with scores on psychological distress (Reinseth & Espnes, 2007). The concept of self-efficacy can be explained as an individuals' judgement of their capabilities to achieve given levels of perf ormance and to exercise control over events (Bandura, 1997). The beliefs that persons can influe nce the course of events in their daily life 91 are strong motivators to achi eve desired results (Kielhofner, 2008). This ability can be confronted by chronic disease and impairment , which often leads to feelings of being controlled by outside factors (Kielhofner, 2008) . A recent study showed that partaking in a high amount of leisure-time physical activitie s was related to less fatigue and higher self- efficacy (Reinseth, et al., 2010). The knowledge of resilience mechanisms as factors to sustain the partaking in activities for home and leisure in chronic diseases is limited. This study aims at exploring relationships associated with participation in committed and discretionary activities in RA and also to explore resilience mechanisms as factors to sustain the participation in such activities. Materials and methods Sample and study design The study was performed using a cross-sectional and retrospective design. Participants were recruited during the autumn 2005 and spring 2006 from the files of patients examined from August 1999 until August 2005 at the Departme nt of Rheumatology, St. Olav University Hospital in Trondheim, Norway. Inclusion criter ia were RA according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (Arnett, et al., 1988), female sex, disease duration > 2yrs and age between 20 and 79. A manual search of the patient records was performed to document disease duration and rheumatoid factor (RF). The study has been approved by th e Regional Ethical Committee (REK). Measures The questionnaires comprised socio-demographic factors such as age, marital status, employment status and educational level. Marital status was recorded in five categories; widowed, divorced, single, cohabitant or marrie d. Employment status was recorded as full- time or part-time work, not working or retire d. Educational level was recorded in seven categories; from primary school to more than f our years of university where the participants recorded their highest level of education. Health status was measured with the M odified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ) (Pincus, et al., 1983) and Visual An alogue Scales (VAS) (Karoly & Jensen, 1987; Revill, et al., 1976). MHAQ is a self-reported instrument to measure the degree of difficulty in performing activities of daily living (Pincu s, et al., 1983). The instrument comprises eight 92 questions of functional ability and are scored on four levels from 0 \"with no difficulty\" to 3 \"unable to perform\". MHAQ mean - values >0.5 are considered as the persons in question having moderate functional problems and MHAQ - values higher than 1 are understood as considerable functiona l problems (Kvie n, 1996). Recen t findings specify that MHAQ are valid as measure of physical function in RA pa tients (Uhlig, et al., 2006) . Joint pain-, fatigue- , disease activity- and general pain last w eek were measured on 100-mm VAS with anchors aximum pain/fatigue/disease been extensively tested for reliability, vali dity and sensitivity an d was found to satisfy these aspects (Karoly & Jensen, 1987; Revill, et al., 1976). The Interest Checklist is a self-report instru ment that contains ordinary activities one might do on an everyday basis, including soci al and physical activities, household duties, handicrafts and other activities for home a nd leisure (Kielhofner, 2008). The Interest Checklist is used to show changes in activi ty choices over a time period and whether one currently participates in these activities (Kielh ofner, 2008). Lee (Lee, 1996) has adjusted the Interest Checklist to the population of Norw ay's most common non-vocational activities according to \"The Norwegian Central Agency for Statistics\". The Norwegian version contains 55 non-vocational activities with addition al space to fill in activities that are not already included in the list. The Interest Check lists include \"activities performed in the past ten years\", \"activities performed last year\" and \"activities performed at present\" and was applied in the current study . The scoring of the Interest Checklist is based on positive responses; participation/interest in an activity is scored by 1 and not participating is scored by 0. The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) is built upon Bandura's understanding on the concept of self (Bandura, 1997). ASES is a reliab le and valid instrument that is developed to measure self-efficacy in persons with rheumatic diseases (Lorig, et al., 1989; Marks, 2001). The questionnaire contains five items regardin g coping with pain, nine items about function and six items concerning other symptoms rela ted to RA like fatigue and depression. Each item presents a statement in which the respon dent may agree or disagree. The scores are expressed as values between 10 and 100, where a score of 10 represents the lowest possible self-efficacy level and a score of 100 represents the best pos sible level of self-efficacy. The Short-Form-36 (SF-36) was originally co nstructed for use in health policy and general population surveys to evaluate health status. Lately, this instrument has been extensively used in clinical research and practise to investigate health-related quality of life in 93 people with different chronic diseases; also with RA (Scott & Garrood, 2000; Ware, et al., 2000). The instrument has previously been used for evaluation of health related quality of life in RA-patients in Norway (Kvien, et al., 1998b; Uhlig, et al., 2007). Thirty-six items covering eight domains of quality of life com pose the SF-36; limitations in physical activities because of health problems, limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems, bodily pain, limitations in social ac tivities because of physical or emotional problems, general mental health, psychological distress and well-being, limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems, vitality, energy and fatigue, and general health perceptions. For each subscale of the SF-36 a score is calculat ed with values from 0-100, and high scores indicate good health (Ware, et al., 2000). SF-36 is a self-administered questionnaire that is well suited for postal su rveys (Bowling, 2001), has been translated into Norwegian and is validated (Kvien, et al., 1998a; Loge, et al, 1998). Data analysis and statistics Descriptive statistics for continuous data are presented as means with standard deviations (SD) and as percentages for counts. The applicat ion of parametric statistics was verified by testing variables with th e Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The focus of the present study is at committed activities; for instance household responsibilities and discretionary activities; for instance leisure time activities. The Interest Checklist was for this purpose divided into committed and discretionary activities according to previous studies (Katz, et al ., 2006; Verbrugge & Jette, 1994). Related-samples t tests were applied to test if there were statistically significant differences between the mean amount of comm itted and discretionary activities performed during the last ten years, the last year a nd activities currently being performed. Cohen's d was calculated to find the strength s of these relationships (C ohen, 2001; Cohen, 1988). Cohen's d is the difference between two means divided by a pooled estimate of the standard deviation (Cohen, 2001). To prepare for multiple linear regression analyses, Pearson's correlation coefficient were calculated between the two dependent va riables committed activities and discretionary activities; and independent variables; health related quality of life (SF-36), and demographic variables (education, work participation, marital status, disease duration and age) to explore the material and eliminate irrelevant variables. Variables that were not significantly associated with the dependent variables were not included in the regression analysis. The 94 regression equations were found to satisfy the suppositions of multiple regressions normality, linearity, and equality of variance and the nonapp earance of collinearity. The enter method of multiple linear regression analyses was applied to analyse the associations between the study variables SF-36 HRQoL as fixed factors - controlled for demographic factors, at first with \"committed activities performed at present\" and then with \"discretionary activities performed at present\" as dependent variables. Results for multiple linear regression analysis are presented as unstandardized coefficients B, standard error of the estimate (SE), standardized Beta coefficients ( ), and the t statistics with the significant value of the t added and R squared (R 2). Data analysis was carried out with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 19.0. Results were considered significant when p-values were equal to or below 0.05. The present analysis di d not assess the causal relationships between independent and dependent variables. Instead, as sociations between variables were examined to explore our main research questions. Results Of the 258 females with RA th at received the questionnaires , 238 (92.4%) answered within four weeks or after receiving a reminding lett er. Due to incompleteness of the questionnaire responses, five questionnaires were excluded, le aving 233 for the analysis. Characteristics of the study subjects are shown in Table 1. Thei r mean age was 57.1 (SD 12.1) and the mean disease duration was 14.8 years (SD 10.1). A positi ve rheumatoid factor (RF+) was present in 177 persons (76%). A total of 164 (70.4%) were living with a spouse, and 90 persons (38.6%) were still in paid employment (See table 1). MHAQ mean was 0.54, 83 (35.6%) women with RA had moderate functional prob lems, while 34 (14.6%) had considerable functional problems. VAS fatigue in the previo us week had the highest scores among the VAS scales with a mean of 44.8 (See tabl e 1). The participation in committed and discretionary activities had a significant decrease over the ten-year period, with a decrease of approximately 25% of activities performed in the past ten years compared to present performance, for both committed and discretionary activities. (See Table 1). There were no significant differences between responders and non-responders concerning age, disease durati on or proportions with RF+. Table 1. Subject characteristics and differences between rheumatoid arthritis and controls 95 The result of the paired samples t-test showed significance beyond the 0.0001 level for all four pairs; between committed/discretionary activities during the last ten years/during last year and between committed/discretionary activities during last year and presently (See Figure 1). The Cohen's d was 0.6 in the difference between participation in committed activities during the last ten years compared to the last year and 0.9 between committed activities the last year and presently, which me ans medium and high effect size respectively. The Cohen's d was respectively 0.6 and 0.7 for the diffe rence between discretionary activities during the last ten year compared to the last year and during the last year compared to presently, which was a medium effect size. In percentages, the mean participation in committed activities, as well as in discretionary activities, had decreased significantly from the last ten years to the last year and from th e last year to the present, by 16% and 17.5% respectively for committed activities, and by 12 % and 16% for discretionary activities (See figure 1). 96 Figure 1. Differences between activity participation during the last ten years, the la st year and at present According to Table 2, multiple linear regression analysis showed significant associations between hi gh participation in committed and discretionary acti vities and high efficacy beliefs in RA functions , high scores on SF-36 mental health, and a high educational level. In addition, SF-36 phys ical function was significan tly associated with high participation in discretionary activities. 97 Table 2. Summaries of the two multiple regression analysis (enter method) associated with the 2 dependent variables; Committed and discretionary activities at present. The analysis was controlled for independent variables: demographics, health vari ables, self-efficacy (ASES) and SF-36 Health related quality of life. Discussion This study explored relationships associated with participation in committed and discretionary activities and of particular intere st were resilience mechanisms as factors to sustain the participation in activities for home and leisure. One could have hoped for improved function an d higher activity participation in RA because of improved medications during the last decade, but remission is only achieved by 10-36% of early RA patients (Scott & Lempp, 20 06). In accordance with previous research (Reinseth & Espnes, 2007), the present study s howed a decrease in the participation of committed and discretionary activities during the last ten years in women with RA. The multivariate analysis in the present study showed significant associations between high participation in both committed and discretionary activities and psychological well-being, self-efficacy in functioning; i.e. effi cacy beliefs about performing common activities of daily living, and a high educational level. In spite of facing significant adversity in the form of RA, those who have been able to keep up a high participation in activities, demonstrate a high score on mental health or ps ychological well-being, which can be seen as a part of resilience processes (Ungar, 2008). C oping was a significant factor in the present study, and a study by Smith (2008) also concerning people with RA, showed that coping was strongly related to resilience factors. 98 In addition, a high participation in discreti onary activities was associated with a better physical function in the present study. Furthe rmore, those who participated in a lot of discretionary activities had a higher edu cation and the opposite was true - those who participated in few leisure time activities had lower education. These results are consistent with the findings of Wikstrom (2006), who re ported a reduction in the participation in discretionary activities early in RA, es pecially in those with low education. A limitation of this study is the cross-sectional design that do es not make it possible to conclude on cause and effect, only on associatio ns. The Interest Checklist is used by many occupational therapists on a daily basis to prov ide information on activity participation and development (Kielhofner, 2008). The checklis t has on several occasions been used in research. However, it should be furthe r tested to ensure its reliability. In conclusion, the present study highlighte d the decrease in the participation of committed and discretionary activities in women with RA during the last ten years. Those who still participate in a greater number of committed and discretionary activities also experienced psychological well-being and high self-efficacy in functioning which are both factors that could be related to resilience m echanisms. In addition, a high educational level was significantly associated with participation in many committed and discretionary activities.

Perceived benefits of support groups for cancer victims and family members GERD INGER RINGDAL Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, Department of Psychology, Trondheim, Norway Abstract In the last decades, there has been a strong gr owth in the number of voluntary support groups for cancer victims and family members, bot h in Norway and internationally. However, systematic evaluations of the benefits of these groups are u nder-reported in the literature. Therefore, the main aim was to study the eff ects of group participation on cancer victims and partners/family members. The following rese arch questions were examined: Does the participation in a support group have any beneficia l effects on cancer vi ctims' and family members' health related quality of life (H RQOL) and on coping with stress? Does the participation in a support group have persisting effects? The exi sting literature reports about the extreme psychosocial strain of cancer victims and also of the strain for family members. Such support groups may therefore be an important contribution to cancer victims and their families. Prospective, randomized studies as well as a few non-randomized studies of voluntary support groups of cancer victims and family members have reported that participation in a support group contributes to increased quality of life and coping ability, and that such benefits also continued after a follow-up period of six months. Introduction The incidence of cancer is in creasing and the number of i ndividuals who live with the disease over a longe r time period is increasing. Those w ho receive a cancer diagnosis today are expected to increa se by 20 percent as we reach 2020 (Kreftregister et, 2006). In the year 1955, the incidence of cancer wa s about the same for women and men. After the year 2000, the incidence has incr eased to double the am ount for men and as much as 70 percent for women. The risk for getting a ca ncer diagnosis during one's life time increases with age. Thus, one reason for this increase is the l onger life expectancy in th e population. Four of ten individuals in Norway will ge t cancer once in his or her life . The four most common reported cancer diagnoses include prostate , breast, colon and lung cancer and cons titute more than half of all cancer cases in No rway today. In total, one out of four pers ons in all age groups 104 will die of cancer or a cancer-related disease. About 170,000 individuals live with cancer in Norway, and the amount of fam ily members are even higher. The huge increase in the incidence of cancer shows that in most families there will be members that sooner or later will be affected by cancer or a cancer-related disease. In view of this background, bo th in terms of th e severity and the increased incidence of cancer diseases, it is no su rprise that support groups and a holistic ap proach as regards caring of cancer victims and fam ily members, has been emphasized as a priority area in the last decades. Important tasks for such support groups are to contribute with information and knowledge both about the disease and treatment, and to give cancer victims and family members the opportunity to meet others in a sim ilar life situation and to exchange experiences with each other. Group identification may be va luable in increasing self- confidence, coping ability and quality of lif e. Belonging to a gr oup may also stimulate solidarity and social sup port among the participants. Many find it very stressful to receive a cancer diagnosis and to have to go through demanding treatments. In additi on, the uncertainty whether on e will recover from the cancer disease and the worries about one 's family members and one's future may be a strain in itself. In this new life situation, one's own earlier life e xperiences and copi ng strategies may not always be sufficien t to understand and cope with wh at has happened. The existing literature has repor ted about the extreme psyc hosocial strain Hanestad, 1998) and also of family members both be fore and after the de ath of the loved one (Ringdal, et al., 2004; Ringdal, et al., 2001a; 2001b ). Thus, such support gro ups may contribute to an increasing ability to 'learn to live with the can cer disease' and to ad apt and cope with the situation. Support groups Support groups for cancer victims are not of new date. As early as in the seventies, studies were published about social support groups fo r cancer victims. About the same point in time, quality of life research emerged in combination with the firs t prospective popu lation studies about people's subjective well -being, satisfaction with life and quality of life (Andrews, & Whitey, 1976; Campbell, Converce, & Rodgers , 1976) and with the first published study focusing on the importance of ps ychosocial aspects of termin al (breast) cancer disease (Priestman, & Baum, 1976). At the same time th e earliest prospectiv e population studies 105 about the importanc e of social support for health a nd survival length were published (Berkman, & Syme, 1979). Repli cation studies 20 years later confirmed the findings that lack of social support may have a negative influence on both physic al and psychological health, while access of social support may have a positive influence on health (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). The development from the biomedical to the bio-psychosocial model meant an emphasis on an overall or holist ic approach to he alth and disease. It obtained great importance based on the views of health care personnel a nd researchers that not only biological, but also psychosoc ial factors are important for people's health and survival (Engel, 1979; Suls, & Rothman, 2004). The importance of including psychos ocial factors in the treatment of diseases and thereafter, in the follow-up bo th of patients and family members, resulted in a strong gr owth in research. This resear ch focused on both in the area of quality of life and psychos ocial interventions of cancer victims and family members. Prospective, randomized studies have reported that those who have pa rticipated in such groups have better psychosocial ad aptation to the diseas e after the course of treatment ended, compared to those in control- groups without such support (K oopman, et al 1998; Fawzy, et al 1996, Goodwin, et al 2001). Th e most common kinds of trea tment in such psychosocial intervention groups consist of psychotherapy, cognitive ther apy, psycho- e ducative and supporting techniques, and relaxation trainin g, often taking place in group conversation, chaired by a psychologist or psychiatrist. Furthermore, this also in volved a strong growth in th e amount of support groups for cancer victims and family members as they func tion in their real lives, from the so-called voluntary support group s, both in Norway and internati onally. It is, however, not easy to make exact conclusions about how valuable thes e groups are, neither as regards general benefits nor as to the content of the groups since there is, with the exception of a couple of studies (Cella, et al 1993; Ri ngdal, & Dulin, 2004), a of publ ished studies with systematic data collec tion. The results from the non-random ized studies that evaluate such voluntary support group s for cancer victims in one American county (Cella, et al 1993) and in the counties in the middle part of Norway (Ringdal, & Du lin, 2004), were in agreement with those from randomized st udies and showed improvement in adjustment and coping, connected with reciprocal support from others in a similar life si tuation in a trusting environment. 106 The benefits of support groups The Norwegian study (Ri ngdal, & Dulin, 2004) s howed that participa tion in such a support group contributed to incr eased quality of life and coping abil ity, and that such benefits also continued according to a follow- up study six months la ter. Each of these groups was led by a female nurse with several years of work experience and further education within cancer care and group work. As many as 85-90% of both the cancer victims and the family members experienced their particip ation as useful and they also reported satisf action with the support group they had participated in, both in terms of its conten t, composition of the participants, and with the group leaders' cont ribution. Almost no one (zero to one percent) reported to be 'very dissatisfied' with the gr oup in which he or sh e had participated. This is also in agreement with earlier findings from the American study (Cella , et al 2003) showing that nearly all (90%) reported to be very satisfied with the su pport group in which he or she had participated. The resu lts from both studies (Cella, et al 2003, Ringdal, & Dulin, 2004) showed that the possibilities to give and receive re ciprocal support from other participants attributed significant importance. Furthermore, the lead ers of the suppo rt groups also evaluated the partic ipation in such groups as very high both for ca ncer victims and family members (Dulin, & Ringdal, 2004). The liter ature is, however, less convincing on the question of whether psychosocial treatment may contribute to l onger survival time for cancer victims (Smedslund, & Ringdal, 2004). Shortcomings The ideal design in examining th e effects of participation in social support groups is a randomized trial with control groups. However, this was im possible to carry out in the voluntary support group s, due to both practical and ethica l reasons. The only possibility for a 'control group in both the Norwegian study and in the Am erican study was to let the participants be their own control through a pret est - posttest and foll ow-up design. Use of a control group of cancer victims not participating in a support group might only have a limited value because the participation in the groups was based on self-selection , and not on a random selection of cancer vi ctims. Moreover, it would have been hard to succeed in establishing such a control group, since the participan ts in the support gr oups usually were decided just shortly before th e first meeting. The strength of our non-randomized design was the examination of the support groups as they naturally function. This gave us the possibility to examine the situation as it is in real life. 107 Conclusion Participation in support groups contributes to an increased quality of li fe and coping ability. Such benefits also continue and are presen t after a follow-up peri od of six months. The number of individuals that get cancer or a cancer-related disease is increasing and the number of individuals living with cancer over a longer period of time is also increasing. On the other hand, the time a patient is in a hospital become s shorter and shor ter which means that the need for voluntary support groups of ca ncer victims and family members is increasing. Thus, this only underl ines the support groups as an important priority area for the future. 108 References Andrews, F.M., & Withey, S.B. (1976). Social indicators of Eell-Being . New York: Plenum.

Rehabilitation in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) OLA BRAT\u00c5S S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College, Faculty of Nursing, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway Abstract Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may lead to reduction of health related quality of life (HRQL) caused by impairmen ts in physical, psychological and social functioning. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recomme nded as one of the main nondrug treatments for COPD. The aims of this study were to identify and compare obj ective and self -perceived characteristics in COPD patients who do and do not choose rehabil itation, and to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes of rehabilitati on on HRQL, exercise capacity, anxiety and depression. COPD patients w ho choose rehabilitation had si gnificant poorer HRQL and enhanced levels of anxiety and depression t han medical outpatients. Four weeks after rehabilitation, improvements in HRQL, exerci se capacity and depression level were found. Six months after discharge, however, short-term benefits from rehabilitation did not sustain. Maintenance of short-term effects may be enhan ced through integrated care of the COPD patients and establishment of low-threshold reha bilitation services in primary health care. Introduction Chronic obstructive pulm onary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Acco rding to World Bank/World He alth Organization (WHO), COPD is expected to rank fifth as cause of death in 2020 worldwide (Jeppesen et al, 2011). COPD is a local and systemic inflammatory disease involving airflow limitation, intrinsic airway narrowing and with potential da mage of several other organs outside the resp iratory track, e.g. heart failure, osteoporosis and skeletal muscle dysfuncti on (Monninkhof et al, 2002). In addition to physiological impa irments and breathle ssness, COPD patients may experience symptoms such as pain, fatigue and sleep problems (Andenaes, 2005; Rabe et al, 2007). It has also been found that they experience signi ficantly more psychological distress, such as anxiety and depression, than th e general population (S chneider et al, 201 0; Wagena et al, 2005). Moreover, compared to pati ents with other chronic diseas es such as epilepsy, angina 112 pectoris, and rheumatoid arthri tis, COPD patients perceive larger impairments in health related quality of life (HRQL) areas of physical and social functioning (S tavem et al, 2000). An established and we ll documented non-pharmacologic treatment for COPD patients is the rehabilitation regimen. Pulmonary reha bilitation is administ rated in inpatient, outpatient or home settings, or a variety of combinations of these. The primary goals of pulmonary rehabilitation are to (1) alleviate symptoms, (2) rest ore functional ca pabilities as much as possible and (3) reduce handicap, thus enhanc ing overall quality of life (Hill, 2006). All types of rehabilitation have proven to be effectiv e treatments that enhance exercise capacity and quality of life and reduce psychological distress in COPD patients (Erg\u00fcn et al, 2011; Hill, 2006; 2006; Pirragli a et al, 2011; Skumlien et al, 2007). Despite favourable effects, no t all COPD patients use reha bilitation services. This is thought to be caused by lack of motivation, signifi cant cognitive impair ment, inability to attend the program cons istently, unstable medi cal condition that may pos e risk or inadequate financial resources (Hi ll, 2006). However, charac teristics of COPD pati ents who choose to participate in reha bilitation are less st udied, with subsequently few comparisons on potential clinical, socio-demographica l or psychosocial differenc es between those who use rehabilitation services and thos e who do not use these services. Most studies of rehabilitation have been performed in ou tpatient settings (Derom, Marchand & Troosters, 2007; La casse et al, 2006) , with only 10% of all pulmonary rehabilitation literature referring to effects obtained in inpatient settings (Clini & Romagnoli, 2005). Although maintenance of th e short-term effects of pu lmonary rehabilitation is essential (Hill, 2006; Nici et al, 2006), clinical studies on long-term effect s of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation progra ms in COPD patients are ev en more scarce. Hence, the overall aims of the present study were: To obtain knowledge about potential diffe rences between COPD patients who use and do not use reha bilitation services. To obtain knowledge about short- and l ong-term effects of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients. This knowledge may be useful to further underst and patients' incent ives for choosing or not choosing rehabilitation, wh ich in turn could help clin icians motivate and encourage their COPD patients to participate in rehab ilitation programs. Furt her, new knowledge of 113 short and long-term effects may be useful in order to s how potential benefits from inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation across all levels of COPD, and for re habilitation centres to adjust their rehabilitation serv ices where necessary. Material and methods Design The present study has a prospect ive, quasi-experimental, and longitudinal desi gn. Short and long-term effects of re habilitation were assessed through a One-Group Pretest-Posttest design, with measurements at baseline (t1), 4 we eks (t2) and 6-m onth follow-up (t3). Participants Participants in the study sample consisted of 2 05 eligible COPD patients who were aged over 40 years with COPD stages I-IV and with no exacerbations. Prior to this study, they all have been encouraged to participate in a rehabi litation programme by thei r physician. Of their own accord, they selected in patient rehabilitation (n=161) or ordinary outpatient consultations (n=44). Participants in the re habilitation group were recruited from three rehabilitation centres in mid and eastern No rway comprising consec utive cases of COPD patients attending a four week inpatient rehabi litation program during th e period from March 2007 till December 2007. Participants in the outpatient group, reviewed rou tinely as medical outpatients, were recru ited by three pneumologists at two hos pitals and one private practise centre in Mid-Norway comprisi ng consecutive cases of outpa tients with COPD during the period from April 2007 till Apri l 2008. The response-rate was 67% in the rehabilitation group and 42 % in the outpatient group. Between t1 and t2, 25 patients in the re habilitation group droppe d out from the study because of withdrawal, deat h, discontinued stay or an unknown reason, which left 136 eligible patients at t2, a re sponse-rate of 84%. Between t2 and t3, 25 patients dropped out because of withdrawal, deat h or an unknown reason, which left 111 patients at t3, a response-rate of 82%. Data collection procedure The potential participants in the rehabilitation group were give n oral and writ ten information about the study a few days after attending the rehabilitation centr e. The patients who wanted to participate returned the que stionnaires and the si gned written consent form in a postage- paid envelope to the re searcher. The potential pa rticipants in the outpa tient group were orally 114 informed about the study by th e pneumologists during ordinary outpatient consultation. The information they were to give the patients was based on a written and or al presentation from the principal researcher to all three pneumologists. The patients who wanted to participate were also given written inform ation about the study wh en they received the questionnaires. Pulmonary rehabilitation program In the present study, the durati on and the vocational content of the reha bilitation program was in accordance with the European Respirat ory Society (ERS) and The American Thoracic Society (ATS) requirements re garding pulmonary re habilitation (Nici et al, 2006). The program timetable was structured as 7.5 hours a day, fi ve days per week fo r four weeks, and participation was mandatory. After initial eval uation by a physician, a mu ltidisciplinary team (consisting of physician, nurses, physiotherapists, as sistant occupational therapists, social workers and ergonomists) assessed the pa tient and formulated an individualized rehabilitation plan, in cluding training intens ity based on patient's me dical condition. The rehabilitation program comprised medical, physical, educationa l, psychosocial and practical/technical ac tivities, which were organized bo th as group based treatment and individual counselling. Classification of severity and stages of COPD Lung function, expressed by post -bronchodilator forced expi ratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), was assessed by spirometric tests carrie d out by trained personn el. Classification of severity and COPD stages (I-IV ) was carried out in accordance wi th the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Guidelines (Rabe et al, 2007). Assessment of exercise capacity Exercise capacity was measured at commencem ent of the rehabilita tion program and at discharge by a six-minute walk ing distance test (6MWD). All tests were conducted indoors, on flat, straight corridors and performed in accordance with published guidelines (American Thoracic Society, 2002). The re sults on the 6MWD we re reported in me tres: higher 6MWD scores indicate a better result. Assessment of health relate d quality of life (HRQL) The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is a di sease-specific instrument designed to measure three domai ns of HRQL in patients w ith chronic lung disease: a symptom score that measures th e frequency and severity of resp iratory symptoms, an activity 115 score that measures activities that are limited by breathlessness, and an impact score that measures aspects of social functioning and psyc hosocial disturbances caused by airway disease (Jones, Qu irk & Baveystock, 1991). The score rang es from 0 to 1 00 for each domain, and high values reflect decreased HRQL. The scores for the three domains can be added together for a total score. A chan ge in score of four units is considered clinically significant (ibid.). Assessment of anxiety and depression The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess symptoms of depression and general anxiet y. Anxiety (HADS-A) and depres sion (HADS-D) are assessed as separate components, each wi th seven items that are rated on a four point scale: 0 (not present) to 3 (signifi cant symptoms) (Zigmond & Snaith, 1 983). The scores range from 0 to 21 for anxiety and 0 to 21 for depression. Scores fo r the two components can also be added together to give a composite anxiety-depression score with a maximum of 42 points (total score). Higher scores indicate more severe symptomatology. Socio-demography and co-morbidity The questionnaire also containe d items about socio-demographi c characteristics and on self- reported co-morbidity. Co-morbi dity was defined as specific diseases and di sorders in the past twelve months, with \"yes/no\" response to different diseases listed in the form, e.g. heart diseases, allergy, ulce r, diabetes, constipation, migraine, cancer, arthritis, kidney failure and metabolic diseases. were categorised in no co-mor bidity, 1-4 and 5-8 additional diseases. Ethical considerations The study was approved by the Regional Commit tee for Medical Research Ethics, Health Region IV, Norway and the Parl iamentary Commissioner for privacy in research, supervised by the Norwegian Social Science Data Servi ces. The participants were informed that participation in the study w ould not hinder their present or future medical treatment. Additionally, they were assured confidentiality. Results As shown in Table 1, the di fference in mean age betwee n the groups (6 5.0 in the rehabilitation group an d 67.2 in the outpatient group) was no t statistical sign ificant. Men and women were nearly equally re presented in the rehabilita tion group (49% men vs. 51% 116 women), while the majority of patients in the outpatient group were men (70.5% men vs. 29.5% women). This observed gender differenc e between the total groups wa s significant (p=0.012). More pati ents in the rehabilitati on group were diagnosed with very severe COPD (34.2% vs. 15.9%, p=0.020), whereas more out patients were diagnosed with severe COPD (40.9% vs. 25.5%, p=0.045). The prevalence of co-morbid ity was equally di stributed in the groups (Table I). More patients in the outpatient group were ma rried/partner (81.8%) compared to the rehabi litation group (63.4%) ( p=0.021), while more patients in the rehabilitation group were di vorced/separated (21 .7%) than in the out patient group (6.8%) (p=0.024). The outpatient s received more psychological su pport from spouse/partner than patients in the rehabili tation group (70.5% vs. 49.1%, p=0.012).

Psychological distress in COPD patients at rehabilitation and outpatient clinics After rehabilitation exercise capacity was improved with a mean score difference of + 44 metres ( p =0.000) (Brat\u00e5s et al , 2010 b). All scores on the SGRQ, except from the activity score, improved significantly fr om t1 to t2 with a change of -4.0 for the symptom score (p=0.012), -3.6 for th e impact score ( p=0.009) and -2.8 fo r the total score ( p=0.012). Between t2 and t3, however, all SGRQ scores deteriorated, with significant differences for SGRQ impact score (+3.5, p=0.016) and SGRQ total score (+2.5, p=0.029) (Figure 3). The anxiety score did not change si gnificantly after rehabilitation (-0.2, p=0.381), though there was a t3 scores deteriorated, di fferences for anxiety (+1.1, p=0.000), HADS HADS to tal score (+1.7, p=0.000) (Figure 4). There were no differences on SGRQ and HADS scores between t1 and t3, except for HADS anxiety score (+0.9, p=0.003) (Figures 3 and 4). 118 Figur 3. HRQL in COPD patients before and after rehab ilitation (high scores indi cate decreased HRQL). Figur 4. Psychological distress in COPD pati ents before and after rehabilitation Adjusted for gender, age, co-m orbidity, anxiety and depressi on, patients with mild to moderate COPD (FEV 1 50% predicted) were more likely to have a clinically significant improved HRQL at 4 weeks follow-up compared to patients with seve re and very severe COPD (FEV 1 < 50% predicted) (O R 4.2, 95% CI 1.7 - 10.3, p =0.002) (Brat\u00e5s et al, 2010 b). After adjustment for gender, age, disease severity, co-mor bidity, education and social participation, patients who live d alone were more likely to have an unaltered or improved HRQL 6 months after rehabilitation compared to patients who lived with someone (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8, p=0.039) (Brat\u00e5s et al, 2011). Clinical implications and future directions The findings from the present study show that the incen tives for choosing pulmonary rehabilitation may be determined by impaired HRQL, psychological distress, being divorced or separated and lack of psyc hological support from a significan t other rather than disease severity alone. Hence, to identify physical an d psychological health, as well as psychosocial factors are important when assessing the ne ed for and encouragi ng participation in 119 rehabilitation. Despite the same level of disease severity and co-morbidity , COPD patients who did not choose to partic ipate in a rehabilitation pr ogram had better HRQL and psychological health compared to those who were admitted, s uggesting stronger resilience to COPD through protective socio- demographical and psychosocial factors. Our findings show that COPD patients admitted to inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation may have composite needs, which underpin the need for an overall inpatient reha bilitation model where physical, educational, practical, psychosocial and recreati onal activities are tail ored to a variety of individual needs and goal s of the COPD patients (Brat\u00e5s et al, 2010 a). The 4-week multidisciplinary inpatient rehabi litation program resulted in short-term benefits comprising improvements in HRQL and exercise capacity and reduced depression in COPD patients. Patients with mild or mode rate COPD were more likely to achieve a clinically improved HRQL after rehabilitation than patients w ith severe or very severe COPD. Referral to pulmonary reha bilitation at an earl y stage of the disease may therefore be beneficial as it allo ws for greater emphasis on promoti ng health rather than regaining function. Our results showed th at also patients with majo r disease severity achieved beneficial results from pulmona ry rehabilitation, suggesting th at inpatient programs should not be restricted only to a small fraction of relatively stable COPD patients with minor disease (Brat\u00e5s et al , 2010 b). The general decline in psycho logical health together w ith relapse of HRQL at 6 month follow-up calls for effort s in order to maintain shor t-term effects. One way to optimize maintenance of short-term eff ects may be by incorporating pulmonary rehabilitation into an integrated care of the COPD patients. In integrated care plans for COPD patients, maintaining effects from pulmonary reha bilitation may be provided by collaboration, communication and coordination among primar y and speciality healthcare professionals, rehabilitation servi ces, patients and their families (Nici et al, 2007; Nici et al, 2009). and psyc hological health after rehabi litation may be related to decline in physical, as well as in social and recreational activities. In some COPD patients, follow-up intervention by primary care and community care professionals may therefore be necessary in order to motivate and faci litate for these kinds of ac tivities after rehabilitation. An important assumption, however , is that domestic conditions and environmental resources of the patients should be detected by prof essionals in the rehabi litation services and communicated to the primary car e, which requires close coll aboration among professionals in rehabilitation services and prim ary care (Nici et al, 2009). 120 A target area in future health service in Norway is the establishment of low-threshold rehabilitation services in primary health ca re (Helse- og Omsorgsdep artementet, 2010). The purpose of this priority is to promote access to rehabilita tion where people live; implying enhanced For COPD patients, decentralised rehabilitation servi ces may be beneficial in order to prevent decline in physical and social activities after i npatient pulmonary rehabilitation. For instance, easily accessible training facilities in the local community may increase COPD patients' motivation and possibilities to continue with physical activities le arned at rehab ilitation, which in turn may enhance the likelihood of maintaining positive ef fects. In addition, ac cess to rehabilitation facilities in proximity of patients' home comm unity may lead to str onger integration of physical and social activities into everyday life of COPD patients, which may contribute to maintenance of positive changes. In order to su cceed with future post rehabilitation care of COPD patients, enhanced co-o rdination and collabor ation between instit utional and based rehabilitation services is considered nece ssary (ibid.). Our results indicate that pati ents living alone were more lik ely to maintain or improve their HRQL after discharge than patients livi ng with someone, suggesti ng that living alone may enforce both self-care and se lf-responsibility, which is fa vourable for HRQL (Brat\u00e5s et al, 2011). This finding may seem rather contradictory to the protective role of a spouse/partner through care, sup port and encouragement, lead ing to improved compliance with therapies and better disease self-managemen t for the patient (Crockett et al, 2002). On the other hand, a life partne r may also be too protec tive and careful in his or her care in such a way that necessary efforts to maintain or improve the positive effects of rehabilitation are hindered (Halding, Wahl & Heggdal, 2010). In other words, implementation of family participation in the re habilitation program may enable spouse or partner to motivate and support activities that are co nsidered necessary to maintain or improve effects obtained through rehabilitation. Conclusions Choosing pulmonary rehabilitati on may be determined by the patient's perc eption of low HRQL together with enhanced levels of anxi ety and depression. This study demonstrated that short-term benefits from inpatient rehabilitation across all levels of COPD did not sustain after 6 months. Maintenance of sh ort-term effects may be enhanced through integrated care of the COPD patients, implementation of family participation in the 121 rehabilitation program, and establishment of lo w-threshold rehab ilitation services in primary health care. 122 References American Thoracic Society (2002).

Children and Adolescent s Surviving Cancer: Psychosocial Health and Quality of Life MARY-ELIZABETH BRADLEY EILERTSEN S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College, Faculty of Nursing, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion a nd Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway Abstract Childhood cancer involves a crisis for the ch ild and their family where they face many challenges to achieve normality after diagnosis, even after successful treatment. The present chapter focuses on psychosocial health and QoL for children and adolescents surviving cancer at least 3 years after their cancer diagnosis, compared with a healthy control group. This was a case-control study including 50 children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer between 1993-2003. To impro ve the child's psychosoc ial health and QoL our results indicate the need to develop pertinent and adequate supportive interventions and programs when planning and implementing long-term follow-up care and rehabilitation of children and adolescents surviving cancer, espe cially for survivors with brai n tumours, and those with late effects. Our results also indicate the need to take into account subjectively perceived and proxy reported psychosocial health and QoL for children surviving cancer. General Introduction In Norway, approximately 120-150 children and adolescents unde r the age of 15 are diagnosed with cancer each ye ar (annual incidenc e 16.2/100,000) and approximately 40 children die yearly of their cancer illness (Can cer Registry, 2009). The most common type of malignancy in children is leukaemia; acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), accounting for ap proximately 1/3 of childhood cancers (Bringager et al., 2003). The sec ond most frequent malignancy in children is tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) (figure 1). 126 Figure 1 : Distribution of childhood cancer in the Nordic countries (NOPHO Annual Report, 2009) (Used with kind permission from the author, B. Lund from a lecture 14.12.2010). Generally, cancer is one of the most common diseases in both genders and in all age groups in the Western world (Bai der et al., 1996). Nevertheless, childhood cancer is rare and accounts for less than one percent of all cancer in i ndustrialized countries (Stiller et al., 2005). Since childhood cancer is uncommon, professionals ar e dependent upon collaboration both nationally and internationally to gain the necessary knowledge for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation (Bring ager et al., 2003). Survival rates for childhood cancer have improved dramatically through the past years, resulting in a growing pop ulation of chil dhood cancer survivors. With the help of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy, radi ation, surgery and im proved supportive care (both somatic and psychosocial) nearly 80 % of children curren tly treated for cancer will become long-term survivor s (Meadows, 2006; Oeffinger et al., 2006; Landier, 2007; Shepherd, 2010). Even though childhood cancer to day is no longer considered a terminal illness, but viewed as a chronic, life-threatening illne ss (Hoekstra-Weebers, 1 996; Stiller & Eatock, 1999; Last et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2007), the diagnosis of childhood cancer is still a crisis for both the child and its family (Hage doorn et al., 2011). Intensive medical treatment together with its side effects and prolonged periods of uncertainty about the outcome can result in psychosocial problems fo r parents and child, and affect their QoL seve ral years after diagnosis and treatmen t (Koocher & O'Malley, 1981; Sp K upst, 2005). As su rvival rates for childhood cancer have increased , research has therefore focu sed on QoL issues ALL 1%127 Wallander, 2001) as well as on psychological adjust ment and late effects (Patenaude & Kupst, 2005) among survivors. Aim The present chapter focuses on psychosocial health and QoL for chil dren and adolescents surviving cancer at least three years after th eir cancer diagnosis, co mpared with a healthy control group, includ ing a multi-informa nt perspective. Material and methods This population-base d, case-control study was carried out between April 2007 and May 2008 and included children and adolesce nts in Central Norway from th e ages of six to 20 years who were diagnosed with can cer between 1.1.1993 and 1.1.2003. Eligible for participation were children who had completed their cancer treatment at the Department of Pediatrics, St. Olavs University Hospital, Trond heim, and survived at least th ree years after diagnosis. Data was collected by using questionnaires mailed to the respective families and the invited child's teacher, and by reviewi ng the child's medica l records. A contro l group was recruited by asking children and a dolescents in the study gr oup to invite one friend of the same gender and age (+ one year) to participate, as well as one of the friend' s parents and teacher. Questionnaires were sent to th ese invited families and teache rs. One reminder was sent to those who did not answer the first invitation. For children surviving cancer there were a total of 50 (4 6%) children (of 109 eligible children) who participated, as we ll as one of their parents. Of these 50 children, 29 (58%) were males and 21 (42%) female s, aged 6-20 year s and born in the period of 1987 to 2001. The median age was 12.5 year s (interquartile range: 10.0- 16.0), with 29 (58%) being adolescents (12-20 years) . The children took part in this study 4-16 years (median: 7.5; interquartile range: 6.0 6.0; interquartile range: 4.0 -7.2) after in cluded children with leukaemia (n=20), malignant brain tumour (n =5) and other cancer tumours (n=12) (paper III and IV). Of the 50 parents, 45 consented to further contact the child's teacher, whereof 36 teachers responded. Control children were recruited by asking the 50 families in the study group to give written consent to contact one friend to particip ate as a control in the study, 40 families gave written consent, and 29 ( 73%) peers (friend) and one of their parents agreed to participate. Of these 29 peers, were 15 (52%) males and 14 (48%) females, aged 6-20 years and born in the 128 period between 1987 to 2001. The median age wa s 12.0 years (10-14.5), with 21 of the 29 (73 %) being adolescents. Of the 29 parents, 24 gave writte n consent to further contact the child's teacher and 19 teachers responded. There were no significant di fferences between children surviving cancer and the control group regarding the children's age and gender or in the parents' educational and economical status. Mean sosioe conomic status (SES) score wa s 3.8 (SD: 1.1) fo r parents of children with cancer, compared to 3.7 (SD: 1.2) in the control group (p = 0.8). Twelve (24%) children with cancer lived with single parents compared to two (7%) children in the control group (p= 0.07). Standardized questionnaires for data collection were used and administered to children and adolescents , their parents, and teachers (P sychosocial health and academic performance: Strengths and Difficultie s Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman & Goodman, 2009) and The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessme nt (ASEBA) (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001); Quality of Life (QoL): The Inventory of Life Quality in Children and Adolescents (ILC) (Mattejat & Remschmidt, 2006) and The Kinder Lebensqualit\u00e4t Fragebogen (KINDL) (Ravens-Sieberer & Bullinge r, 2000) questionnaires). In addition, diverse background data was re corded, parents were aske d to give information about demographic data (where and whom they lived with, number of children and marital status), and for children surviving cancer, their chil d's diagnosis, as well as their child's health status and late effects at the time of this study. Based upon these quest ions we defined a variable called late effects which included so matic health problems th at could probably be related to the cancer diagnosis or its treatment. Somatic diagnoses and any psychological problems were collected from th e child's medical records. Pa rents' socioec onomic status (SES) were calculated according to Hollingshead's two factor in dex of social po sition scaled one (low) to five (high), based on a combination of parent s' education and occupation (Hollingshead, 1958). Parents also evaluated their economical situation as \"poor\", \"average\" or \"good\". When comparing the control group with an extensive represen tative sample of children and parents from the general population in the same geographical area there were no significant differences shown in the total sum sc ores of the parent repo rt for either the or KINDL (N=1742). Fu rthermore, no significant diffe rences were shown in the adolescent report for the ILC questionnaire (N=1032). However, a signifi cant difference was found in the child re port for the KINDL Total quality of life (N=1966) , when comparing our 129 control group with the general population (Mean (SD) : 75.3 (8.2) and 70.6 (12.4) respectively; p=0.011). Ethical considerations Ethical approval was obtained from the Regional Committ ee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Central Norway (Ref.nr. 4.2006.2610), ensuri ng that the project did not violate the UN Convention of th e Rights of the Child (CRC) (1991). Approval was given for a single written reminder, whereas permission was not given to get in touch with the individual families by telephone. Wr itten consent to participate in the study, as well as access to the medical records of children surviving ca ncer, was given by the part icipant or by one of the child's parents, if the chil d was younger than 16 years of ag e. Families also gave written consent to contact the child's teacher and a friend of the same gender a nd age. Approval by the Norwegian Social Science Da ta Services (Ref.nr. 15372/JE) was obtaine d for a license to maintain a register containing personal data. Results and discussion of psychosocia l health and quality of life for children and adolescen ts surviving cancer In this study, children survivin g cancer had more emotional symptoms, higher total problem scores and poorer academic pe rformance, than healthy contro ls. Emotional problems were consistently reported by pare nts, teachers and adolescents themselves, in particular for childhood survivors with brain tumours and late effects. Ye t we found that adolescents surviving cancer on the whole reported equal QoL compared with healthy controls, while only adolescents survivi ng brain tumours and survivors with late effects reported a lower QoL and an increased number of QoL domains perceived as prob lematic, when assessed with the ILC. Parents however, repo rted an overall lower QoL an d a greater number of QoL domains perceived as problematic for their children surviving cancer. Our findings of lower QoL and higher emotional problem scores are co nsistent with a number of previous studies and reviews of psychosocial functioning and QoL studies in childhood cancer survivors (Upton & Eiser, 2006; et al., Reinfjell et al., 2009; et al., 2006; Speech ley et al., 2006; Zeltze r et al., 2009). Results are discussed in detail in Eilertsen et al. (2011 a & b). Parent proxy and teacher proxy reports on psychosocial health There were some notable differen ces in our findings between the parent a nd teacher report in the SDQ findings. While parents reported no difference in pro-so cial behaviour for survivors 130 compared with controls, teachers suggeste d an abnormal pro-soci al behaviour for all survivors as well as survivors of brain tumours and leukaemia. Parent and teacher ratings in the present study are somewhat in contrast to the study by Upton & Eiser (2006) where parent ratings showed a significant difference in pro-social behaviour, whil e teacher ratings showed no significant difference. Upton & Eise r (2006) studied children with brain tumours exclusively and used British no rms for comparison. The lower me an score on the pro-social scale in our study may reflect be ing less helpful and more unwilling to share with others, a possible and understandable consequence foll owing the intense and long-term cancer treatment, which might be emphasized more by teachers than parents. In addition, cancer treatment can contribute to long absences from normal soci al and school ac tivities, and consequently impair interact ion with others. An adverse psychosocial development could have more impact and thus be more evident in a school setting than at home. Psychosocial support is therefore essential to promote optimal adjustment fo r the child and its family both at home and at school (Eilertsen et al., 2009). Child, adolescent and parent proxy r eports on psychosocial health and QoL In general and when compared to the parent and adol escent control gr oup, adolescents surviving cancer in our study reported fe wer psychosocial problems when assessed by the SDQ than their parents did. Th ese results are consistent w ith other studie s of childhood cancer comparing parent and chil d ratings on the same measures (Eiser et al., 2000; Reinfjell et al., 2009). There was a strong correlation between the ILC (total) QoL scores reported by parents and by their adolescent child, whic h was also consistent with othe r studies (Eiser et al., 1995; Sawyer et al., 1999; De Clercq et al., 2004; Russell et al., 2006; Upton et al., 2008), possibly suggesting that in the case of cancer, parents and adolescen ts share much of the same perspective. Moreover, our find ing of lower QoL among children with brain tumours and late effects compared with controls were found for both parent pr oxy report and adolescent self- report. These results emphasize the need for a ddressing the issue of diagnosis and presence of late effects in QoL studies in childhood cancer su rvivors. Our results are consistent with other studies of reduc ed QoL among children surviving br ain tumours (Upton et al., 2005; Cardarelli et al., 2006; Varni et al., 2007; Penn et al., 2009; Yoo et al., 2010) , as well as with studies and reviews of late effects and Qo L of childhood cancer (Pemberger et al., 2005; Calaminus et al., 2007; Eiser et al., 2007; Ishi da et al., 2010, 2010). 131 Nevertheless, there were some considerable differences be tween the results obtained from parents and adolescents when compared with healthy contro ls, especially when assessed by the ILC. In genera l in this study, and in keeping with other QoL studies of childhood cancer comparing pare nt and child ratings with co ntrols (Sawyer et al., 1999; Russell et al., 2006; Varni et al., 2007), a dolescents as a group repo rted a QoL similar to controls, while parents repor ted an overall poorer QoL fo r both their children and adolescents surviving cancer compared to controls. The subjective and objective perspectives of QoL has been the sour ce for discussions, suggesting that parents a nd other adults can prov ide relevant and valid information on behalf of their children's em otional and behavioural problems a nd other aspects such as QoL. Earlier, were younger children seen as unreliable respondents, lacking both cognitive and linguistic skills to answer que stionnaires (Jozefiak et al., 2009a; Eiser & Morse, 2001) however, the child and adolesce nt's subjective perception on QoL has been emphasized in the later years (Eiser & Morse, 2001). The discrepancy on psychosocial health and QoL between the child and parent report for children surviving ca ncer compared with controls is most likely a cons equence of the different perspectives about the child's health and well-b eing and not a question of which perspective is right or wrong (V arni et al., 2005; Upton et al., 2008; Jo zefiak et al., 2008). Parents may vary in their awaren ess, sensitivity and tolerance of children 's health concerns (Upton et al., 2008). In additio n, the impact of the child's di sease and actual problems may have an influence on the total burden of their pa rents' experience of st ress (Angold et al., 1998; Jozefiak, 2004; Davies et al., 2008) and thus, thei r perception of the child's psychosocial health and QoL. On the other hand, children livi ng with a chronic illness may assess their own psychosocial health, QoL and possible prob lems differently, dependent upon their subjective experience of how they feel mentally and physically. Fi ndings of good QoL in some survivors with late effects could be related to changes in the survi vors' outlook on life resulting from the cancer experience (Apa jasalo et al., 1996; Gr ay et al., 1992), a negative coping style resultin g in compensating a nd overcompensating existing late effects (Apajasalo et al., 1996) or the existence of repr essive coping in childr en (Phipps et al., 2001). Furthermore, younger child ren have a limited co gnitive capacity (Eiser & Morse, 2001) and tend to live more in the presen t on a \"here and now\" level, not having the same sense of time as adults, consequently effectin g their experience of how they feel mentally and physically. Many children may respond to st ressors by repressing their own issues as an important 132 defence mechanism for coping and possibly resulting in poorer ps ychosocial health and QoL, whereas other children and adolescents may show resilience and positi ve coping strategies (Woodgate, 1999a,b; Borge, 2010), which can resu lt in increased growth and the potential for enhanced psychosocial heal th and QoL to improved resilience to stressors (Woodgate, 1999a,b; Haase, 2004). Therefore as stated by both Parsons (1999) and Up ton et al. (2008), the main question is not essentially, \"most important question may be \"how then can the information we receive from both the parent proxy and self-repor t about psychosocial health and QoL be used to guide and improve in terventions enhanci ng the child's total functioning and well- being?\" the difference in childr en and adolescent's perspect ives in this study also support emphasizing the need for obtaining information fr om both parent s and children (Eiser & Morse, 2001; Klassen et al., 2006; Wilson-Genderson et al., 2007). Obtaining information about psychosocial health and QoL provided by ch ildren and thei r parents is therefore important in cont ributing to a compre hensive understanding from different informant perspectives. Our results are in accordance with othe r studies reporting a discrepancy between the self-r eport and proxy- report in different cl inical and general population studies (Theunissen et al., 1998; Chang & Yeh, 2005; Yeh & Chang, 2005; Jozefiak et al., 2008, 2009a,b & 2010). However, our study sh owed that comparing both psychosocial health and QoL child vs. proxy report directly in studies of children surviving cancer could be misleading with out including a cont rol group because of the discrepancies found between the different pers pectives. With the use of bo th the child self-report and parent proxy report ou r results suggest that especially adolescents surviv ing brain tumours and survivors of late effects have more psyc hosocial problems and an overall poorer QoL compared with a hea lthy control group. More psychosocial problems, poorer acade mic performance and a lower QoL score and an increased number of domai ns perceived as problematic, were found among almost all survivors with physical late effects than healthy controls. We can therefore not disregard the physical and psychological conseq uences of the cancer disease an d its treatment. In various other studies suggesting that childhood cancer surv ivors function well psychologically (Zeltzer et al., 2009; Gray et al., 1992; Langeveld et al., 2002 ) despite a seemingly traumatic childhood experience, it wa s uncertain if these su rvivors suffered from la te effects or not. 133 Implications for clinical pr actice and further research To improve the child's psychosoci al health and QoL our results indicate the need to develop pertinent and adequa te supportive interventions a nd programs when planning and implementing long-term follow- up care and rehabi litation (Rosenbaum, 2009) of children and adolescents surviving cancer, especially for survivors w ith brain tumours, and those with late effects. Our results also indicate the need to particularly take into acc ount subjectively perceived and proxy reported QoL, in addition to children a nd adolescents' psychological problems and psychos ocial functioning. Further research is needed to obtain an even more co mprehensive understanding of psychosocial health and QoL in survivors of childhood cancer . Based on our results we suggest that focus be given to potential factors in he alth promotion, such as resilience that can contribute to the experien ce of good psychosocial health a nd QoL, as well as more in- depth studies using both self and proxy reports in addition to quantit ative and qualitative methods. Results can therefore be used to guide interventions and improve strategies to enhance the child's total functioning and well-being. Conclusion In conclusion, our study shows that adolescents surviving cancer on th e whole reported equal QoL compared with healthy controls. Howeve r, adolescents surviving brain tumours and survivors with late effects reported a lower QoL and an increased number of QoL domains perceived as problematic, as well as more emotional sympto ms and higher total problem scores when compared with healthy controls, even many years after diagnosis and treatment. To gain a richer underst anding our results show the need to particular ly take into account subjectively perceived and pro xy reported QoL, in addition to children and adolescents' psychological problems and psychosocial functioning. 134 References Achenbach, T., & Rescorla, L.A.

Global Health Promotion Initiative Health development is a concep t that goes beyond borders. Incr easing numbers of researchers around the world are reacting toward a single si ded concentration on disease avoidance in health work and health research. The Research Centre for Health Promotion and Resources, together with our partners, are working at globa l, regional and country levels to improve the effectiveness and preciseness of health promotion action. In the Global Health Research Initiative we work to strengthen an individual's health resources, collective capacities and assets, and al so to give results that can impact national systems and strategies for health promoting act ion. The challenges and possibilities in health promotion show similarities but also important differences in all se ttings and ecological environments. At all levels we and our pa rtners jointly assess and anal yse information, prioritize the interventions, build an evidence-based action pl an, monitor the health situation and the health sector response. Thus, we work with in a number of countries and regions. In this book we present two such research init iatives.The first example is from Papua, New Guinea. The example is a resear ch initiative which is carried through to get information on female health in the capital - Port Moresby. The research is planned to be the first part of a long lasting engagement for health promotion in Papua, New Guinea. The second example, which is research in Uga nda is still on the planning stage - but in the phase just before the project is expected to begin. The projec t describes how both the teaching institutions and the authorities in Uganda can have direct access to information from research that can direct better health promotion strategi es and action. 144 145 11. A theoretical assessment of the state of preparedness for Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) in Uganda and a suggestion for health promotion research to guide positive health policy and action JAMES MUGISHA 1 & GEIR ARILD ESPNES 2, 3 1Principle Behavioral Scientists Uganda Ministry of Health and Makerere University Kampala, Uganda 2 Research Centre for Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway 3 Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, Department of Social Work and Health Science, Trondheim, Norway Abstract The intention of this paper is twofold. First, we shall theoretically assess the level of preparedness of Uganda to deal with lifestyl e related diseases, NCDs, and second, we shall assess how to introduce health promotion rese arch as a knowledge basis for developing a positive national health policy and health practice. These assessments indicate that there is a lack of both political and t echnical preparedness in Uganda. The political preparedness largely stems from the lack of policy direction, and this affects the coun try's ability to plan and mobilize resources required to address the burde n of lifestyle diseases in the country. In addition to the above, the paper focuses on the l evel of technical capacity in the country. There seems to be lack of adequa te human resources in terms of skills and competencies to respond to the burden of lifestyle diseases in the country and this co mes with a number of dilemmas. In the second part of the paper we argue for the need to introduce health promotion research in order to guide positive health poli cy and practice. Introduction In Africa, the state of preparedness with which countries have to addres s life style diseases can best be described as in both a politica l and technical slumber . It is in a political slumber because most countries in Africa, Uganda inclusive, lack documented policies about how to address life style di seases, despite the fact th at politicians are supposed to lead the country in the policy making process (Jas son, 2011). And, this slumbe r is technical because the government departments responsible for leading the stru ggle against life st yle diseases lack technical capacity and ot her forms of preparedness to addr ess the increasing magnitude of 146 life style diseases, now more often known under the term N on Communicable Diseases (NCDs,) in Uganda. There are several statements wi thin Uganda Ministry of H ealth Reports that seem to indicate that the country has a great deal of conc ern about the links be tween ill-health and impoverishment, and this has placed health at the center of deve lopment (Russell, 2004). Despite the pronouncements in these reports, much of the attention in Africa has been put on malaria and HIV/AIDS and how these two conditions (mal aria and HIV/AIDS) have contributed to poverty in Uganda . This means that the country has a narrow defi nition of ill- health which is la rgely limited only to the two conditions (malar ia and HIV/AIDS). Though the two diseases are given priority because they are the major sources of morbidity and mortality in developing countrie s, the drastic rise of NCDs cannot be ignored anymore. The life style diseases under focus include hyperten sion, diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma, stroke, cardiovascular di seases, sickle cell disease, cancer and HIV/AIDS. In addition to this narrow focus in defining ill-health, the focus ha s to be framed in such a way that good health is the end product instea d of seeing the absence of disease as the so le outcome variable (Brundtland 2002). Because of this lacuna, there are no strategic/sy stematic programs geared towards enhancing healt h. Hence, Public Health pract ice in Uganda lacks efforts aimed at improving welfare a nd quality-of-life a nd disease prevention. The main focus within the public health domain is promoting curative options/int erventions. Yet, there is a need for people to change their focus, as well as have more control of their own health and therefore find themselves enabled to do more wi th their life-style dise ases: this is a strong and growing concern today. Due to the biased focus on malaria and HIV/AIDS, Uga nda projected to spend $35 million for the FY 2011(USAID, 2010) on malari a treatment and management and US $ 75 million per year is spent on HIV and AIDS subsector annually. Despite this resource commitment to malaria and HIV/AIDS, there seem s to be no direct resource allotment to NCDs as a subsector. However, the resources av ailable are those that are routinely allocated to heath facilities for management of ailmen ts (including those related to lifestyle). In addition, there are no direct allocations within th e health facility budge ts that are meant for prevention of life style diseases. Even without reliable statistics on the magn itude of NCDs in the country, there seems to be growing consensus that this problem has assumed the st atus of a public health concern. One of the largest stud ies that have ever b een conducted in Uganda that is known to the 147 authors is that of Park in et al. (2006) which focused on cancer incidence in the period 1991- 2006. This study indicated that ther e was an overall increase in the risk of ca ncer in both sexes in Kyadondo County. Among other cancers, th is study revealed that the incidence rates of cancers of the breast and prostate increased 4. 5% annually within th e study period. The study concluded that overal l, there was an increase in the case s of cancer in th e review period in both men and women particularly those co mmon in the \"Western\" world (lung, prostate, large bowel and breast). Despite its limitati ons - since the study me thodology was a review of records at the Uganda can cer registry and not a populat ion based study - this study indicates that cancer is a growing problem in th e country. In terms of diabetes, in 2003, at Mulago hospital (the country's national referral hos pital) there were 300,000 recorded cases of diabetic patients alone (Adome, 2007). Just as in the first study, this st udy was also a hospital-based study. However, de spite its limitations, the study provides some evidence that diabetes is currently a public health issue in the country. With respect to cardiovascular diseases, a prevalence rate of 23.7 of cardiovascular di seases among the patients attending the Out Patient Department (OPD ) was also established (ibid) . The same report indicates a prevalence rate of 10.6 % of heart related problem s among secondary school children in Kampala, the capital city of Ug anda. Adome (2007) al so noted that over a period of 6 years, the cases of hypertension in Mulago hospital increased from 2,777 in 2001 to 4,780 in 2006. And, in 2005, 109 patients were admitted to Mu lago hospital with a clinical stroke as compared to only 60 admitted in the sa me period in 1999 (Adome, 2007). Discussion Political and Policy inadequacies and the possible dilemmas Midgley et al. (2009 ) argues that government s should be in a position to enact policies that enhance people's welfare and heal th, and this includes medical care. This implies that policy formulation is largely the responsibility of government. While Uganda has been credited for having quite extensive HIV/ AIDS and malaria control policies, there is apparently no policy on NCDs in the country. Jansson (2011) argues that policies should he lp to define problems and show the extent of the problem. Without any policy in place as regard s this problem, it is not surprising that the extent and magnitude of life styles di seases in Uga nda is unknown. The country relies on the few statistics from hos pital-based studies but th ese cannot be relied upon to understand the magnitude and complexity connected to the increasing development of lifestyle diseases in the country. 148 The second dilemma is how to plan and respond to the incr ease of life style diseases in the Uganda. Is it possible to plan withou t policy? Such an approach to a challenge is normally defined as muddling through (Parsons, 2002 ). Service programs should be created and based on a well-defined ne ed and methodologies which addr ess them should be done so on a clearly defined goal found in the policy document s (Midgley, 2009). So, in the absence of clear policies, the country ca nnot claim that it has either clear service programs or clear methodologies to address life st yle diseases in the country. Policies normally define resources needed for service delivery in any particular field. In the absence of a polic y on life style diseases , Uganda cannot know th e cost of this burden to the population and ne ither can the country know the amount of funds and other resources required to respond to the challenge posed by life style dis eases - not today, not in the short term, and not in the l ong term. And, it is possible that by the time Uganda hears the wakeup call and eventually arises from its slumber, th is subsector (life styl e diseases) will have become a bottomless pit . Technical The key issues here are, a) ha ving the rights skills to handle the emer ging challenges across relevant disciplines and, b) having the right number of peop le to address the burden of life style diseases. Skills gap: Just as in all other deve loping countries, Uganda still lacks staff in the specialized fields in medicine and public health. This also applies to the work with life style diseases. Th e cancer and heart institutes in Mulago (the only specialized units in the country) are not only underf unded but also lack key personnel and competences. Other region al referral hospitals face the same challenge. Number of relevant cadres to h andle lifestyle re lated conditions : Based on the Annual Health Sector Perfor mance Report 2010/2 011, the doctor- patient ratio in Uganda is 0.036/1000 people in the population. The sa me report indica tes that there are 1.49 core health worker s per 1,000 people in the population. Th is is far below the WHO recommended minimum of 2.3 per 1,000. In addition to the above, other relevant cadres in the field are lacking at bo th national, regional and district levels. For example, even the cancer and heart in stitute, which are sp ecialized units, do not have psychologists. They depend on psychologists who also are employed elsewhere, primarily at Makerere Universi ty. In addition to this, public health 149 training at both the diploma and degree le vels has not been ex tended to improving knowledge on prevention of life style diseases at the community level. A review of the Ministry of Health Strategic Plan 2005/6 - 2009/10 indicates that non-communicable diseases appear in that strategic plan. The main focus of this strategic plan includes a) establ ishing the financial, me dical, and human burden of disease and main risk factors for Non-Communicable Disease co nditions (NCDs) in Uganda by the end 2005, b) increasing the level of awareness in the population by 80 %, c) social mobilization in 100% of districts implementi ng the prevention and control of NCD/conditions, d) integration of NCD prevention and management within the functions of 100% of Health Centre IVs Core interventions, e) formulat ion of the national pol icy and medium-term strategic plan for NCD (by the end of 2006) , f) building co mmunity awareness on prevention and control of NC Ds using a multi-sectoral appr oach, g) development and implementation of an information and advocac y strategy on the public health importance of NCD, and finally h) strengtheni ng the capacity at all HC IVs to correctly manage NCDs so as to prevent avoida ble complications. Despite the pr onouncements above in the National Health strategic Plan, most of the items listed in the National H ealth strategic Plan are still lying on the table of both the technical staff and other poli cy implementers. And, this strategic plan has now expired w ithout even beginning to formul ate a policy on how to fight NCDs. As a consequence, resour ces (both financial and human) are largely not within reach to respond to health threat of life style diseases re presented in the coun try - which mostly would have to be accomplished in terms of health promotion. Building a case for a Life Style Change Research Project As noted earlier, almost all at tention has been given to HIV- and AIDS prevention and little has been accorded to life style diseases, which is the fastest gr owing group of diseases in the poorer countries in Africa. This has been ne cessary given the number of and threats from communicable diseases to countri es in Mid-and Southern Africa. But in the sh adow of this, new health problems and chal lenges have emerged. If we focus on what has happened throughout the last years it has become increasingly evident th at third world countries are facing, and will continue to face, other health threats of great magnitude in the years to come (life style diseases largely due to change in life style). Given the \"threat\" from life style diseases, there is a ne ed - through research and health promotion efforts - to s eek options that enable people take charge of thei r own health. 150 This implies that there is a need for more health promotion resear ch in Uganda in the years to come in order to face not only general health challenges but also chal lenges connected to a growing incidence of lif e style diseases. We need this fo cus in order to identify options through which people could streng then their health, to build on what is good and works in the society (best practices). It is of importance to investig ate what are effective health- promoting behaviors on a societal level, as well as how to build societies that act in accordance with this. In summary, it is now of great importance to begin a project in three areas. These areas are (1) to map the knowledge about the cause s of diseases/and causes of good health in the populations in the country, and (2) thereafter, to map the health situation in these populations, not only by de ath statistics, or statistics from general practitioners or health authorities, but through factual knowledg e via epidemiological data on health, since most health statistics are on disease incidence and prevalence rather than on health, and through studies on both nega tive and positive health factors. The third part of the project is to educate health workers and to bui ld and test interventions for life style changes and evaluate both the interventions an d their success in terms of how th e implementations that the project tried actually responded to po or health and non-communicable diseases. The following is a description of the factua l organization and plan for such a project. The Project This project will be the African Chapter for the Research Centre fo r Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU. Research Cent re for Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU is a research unit co-owned by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU and The S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8nde lag University College, HiST. 151 Figure 1: A model showing how the knowledge in the project among the different partners will become shared knowledge and become a part of the common knowledge base. The scope of the project is to establish both new know ledge on health status and health promotion indica tors through research an d to establish strong li nks aiming at bringing new knowledge from the research fi eld faster to the pr actitioners and thus, directly into use. This will be achieved by estab lishing research that is dire ctly linked to the Makarere University health educat ion units and to the prac tice field (see Figure 1).The practice field will also be a cr itical mass by first bringing knowledge ab out the experience in the practice field as background for formulating accurate an d adequate research questions and second, by bringing the newly accumulated knowledge directly in to use. The project will therefore make both the researchers and the practitioners expert s about the health situ ation and how to deal with the challenges. Th e international i nvolvement also ensures qu ality control since the research results will be publis hed in interna tional research journals and these will be reviewed in the publ ication process. The implementation will be done in four steps: Research on life st yle health status and heal th promotion is conducted. The research results are fed directly into the health education system at Makarere University. The students go to differe nt practise fields and appl y the new research-based practise and the new results then immediately become a part of the practise field Evaluations of the new pract ise and new research questi ons that are fed into the research team.

Comparison of self-rated health, well-being, anxiety and depression in young female populations in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea and Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag, 1 Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, Trondheim, Norway 2 HUNT Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, No rwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway 3 Research Centre for Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway 4 Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, Trondheim, Norway Abstract The objective of this pilot study was twofold; (1) to assess self-rated health, well-being, anxiety and depression and compare two samples of women from Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Norway and (2) to investigat e the applicability of the No rth-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Survey (HUNT) Questionnaire, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), in the PNG-sample. Respondents in the PNG sample re ported better health, but poorer well-being compared to the HUNT sample. Adjusted for vari ous health measures, we found that site have an effect on self-reported health and well-being. The structure of self-rated health did not to differ significantly, whereas the structure of well-being did show differences. As for the HADS, the study demonstrated considerately high er scores for both anxie ty and depression in the PNG sample compared to HUNT. There we re slight discrepancie s in the psychometric properties of the HADS between the two samples as well as slight differences in the symptom pattern of anxiety and depression. In total, the HADS demonstrated sati sfactory psychometric properties in both countries, and shows promise as a valid instrument for assessing anxiety and depression in PNG. Introduction Promotion of women's health ha s been on the health policy agenda for several years (WHO, 2003). Still, outcomes and access to care for women have been found to vary widely both within and between co untries (WHO, 2008b). By compari ng the health situation in two countries with great socio-ec onomical differences such as Norway and Papua New Guinea 154 (PNG), the areas in need of at tention for improving health promotion may be brought to a head. Norway and PNG differ widely in health ch allenges as well as in demographic and socio-economic conditions. In the 2009 Huma n Development Report the two countries ranked 1 and 148, respectively, on the Huma n Development Index (HDI) (UNDP/UN, 2009). Communicable diseases dominate the burden of disease in PNG, and there are great challenges in women's health in cluding reproductive health and domestic violence (Amnesty International, 2006; UNAI DS/WHO, 2008; WPRO/WHO, 2009) . In panorama is charac terized by non-communicable di seases, many of which are influenced by unhealthy lifesty le, and neuropsychiat ric and stress-relat ed psychosomatic disorders have come to domin ate the burden of di sease, accounting fo r most disability- adjusted life-years (DAL Ys) (WHO/Europe, 2006). Self-rated health has been used as a pr edictor for health fo r many decades and is found to be a strong predictor of mortality, independent of ob jective health status (Idler, Russell, & Davis, 2000 ; Mossey & Shapiro, 1982). More dimensions are included in a subjective health assessment than in objective health measures such as chronic diseases and impairments (Miilunpalo, Vuori, Oja, Pasanen, & Urponen, 1997) , making it a more stable, more sensitive and therefore a better indicator of heal th and health development (Manderbacka, 1998). Self-rated health measures have show n good test-retest reliability, content and construct validit y across ethnic undberg & Manderbacka, 1996). General we ll-being and quality of life, are culturally constructed experiences influenced by culture due to differences in perceptions of health an d illness, different und erstandings of symptoms and expectations of care (Kagawa-Singer, Padilla, & Ashing-Giwa, 2010). Four dime nsions have been included into the concept of he alth-related quality of life: physical, mental and social health and global perceptions of func tion and well-being (Berzon, Hays, & Shumaker, 1993). As for negative health e xperiences, anxiety and depr ession are two major public health challenges worldwid e with high incide nce in the Western Pacific region (PIMHNet/WHO, 2010). PNG is one of the Western Pacific coun tries struggling with acute challenges in the mental health sector (WHO, 2008a). Mental health re search conducted in PNG is very limited and there are no official statistics on the prevalen ce of mental illness in the country. However, the few studies to date indicate th at women in PNG are worse off than 155 men and have poor psychosocia l health (Hinton & Earnest, 2010a; McManus, 2006). PNG women may be particularly vul nerable to anxiety and depr ession due to high rates of domestic violence, incest and rape (Amnesty International, 2006). Psychosocial health problems, such as anxiety a nd depression, reflect the power lessness and challenges women encounter (Hinton & Earnest, 2010a). Outcomes of anxiety a nd depression include increased morbidity and disability (WHO, 2010), and re duced quality of life (Pedersen, 2010). In order to tackle the major challenges of mental health it is important to have good instruments for screening mental illness and identifying individuals in need of treatment. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is widely used as a self-administered instrument to measure presence and severity of symptoms of anxi ety and depression in somatic and psychiatric patients as well as in general p opulations. The H ADS has been extensively validated in a variety of populations includi ng clinical and community samples (Bjelland, Dahl, Haug, & Neck elmann, 2002; Herrmann, 1997). The good validity of the HADS has been demonstrated acro ss culturally diverse groups in versions incl uding Arabic, Chinese, Iranian and Japanese (B jelland, Matsudaira et al., 2009; Montazeri, Vahdaninia, Ebrahimi, & Jarvandi, 2003). The objective of this pilot study was to in vestigate how two sa mples of women in Norway and PNG report their self-perception of health, general well- being, anxiety and depression, and to what exte nt the questions in the HUNT data collection instrument, including the HADS, are appr opriate for intern ational comparative studies. Methods Study design and participants. This study is a cross-sectiona l survey. Data from two indepe ndent samples were compared: (1) PNG and (2) HUNT. We used a sample from the most recent HUNT3 in this study. In PNG, the data was collected in 2007 as part of collaboration between th e University of Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby (UPNG), the HUNT-st udy and the Centre for Health Promotion and Resources Research HiST/NTN. A two-way translation according to standards for both semantic and conceptual equivalence of the tran slations was carried out (Fumimoto et al., 2001; Prince, 2008; Zinke, La m, Harden, & Fogg, 2010). Basic data in the PNG sample consists of results fr om a general health qu estionnaire completed by wo men associated with UPNG. Respondents were recruite d using a snowball strategy. Inclusion crit eria for both samples were: (a) female gende r and (b) age 20 to 29. In PN G a third criterion was (c) 156 resided in PNG at one year of age. For the analyses of self-r ated health and general well- being we applied a fourth cr iterion (d) being a student. The level of English proficiency in academic circles in PNG is high and an English version was therefore used. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Research Ethics in Norway. Measures Demographic variables include age, occupation, civil status and ha ving had at least one child. Living with a spouse or partner was ad ded to examine the possible correlation with well-being in PNG. The self-r ated health measure consisted of the question \"How is your health at the moment?\" with the categories 1) poor to 4) excellent. The measure of general well-being consisted of the que stion \"Thinking about your life at the moment, would you say that you by and large are happy/satisfied w ith life, or ar e you generally unhappy/unsatisfied?\" and the catego ries were 1) extr emely happy/satisfied 7) extremely unhappy/unsatisfied. Other health measures incl uded self-reports on long-term illness (at least one year), pain or stiffnes s in the last year (at least th ree consecutive months), general feeling, physical activity, anxi ety, depression and ever seeki ng help for mental problems. The variables meeting cr iteria for confounding (e .g. significantly associ ated with self-rated health or general well being in both samples) were in cluded in the initial analysis. The HADS includes an anxi ety sub-scale (HADS-A) a nd a depression sub-scale (HADS-D), each containing seven in termingled items (Table 1). It ems are scored from 0 to 3 (0= absence of symptoms, 3= maximum symp tom intensity). Item scores are summed resulting in maximum scores of 21 on each of the re spective sub-scales. In the majority of studies 8 is considered optimal cut-off for cas eness on both sub- scales, providing satisfactory levels of sensitiv ity and specificity of anxiety and depressive disorders (Bjelland, et al., 2002), and was also applied in this study. 157 Table 1: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Item number Item text Anxiety sub-scale Item 1 I feel tense or 'wound up Item 3 I get a sort of frightened feeling as if something awful is about to happen Item 5 Worrying thoughts go through my mind Item 7 I can sit at ease and feel relaxed Item 9 I get a sort of frightened feeling like 'butterflies' in the stomach Item 11 I feel restless as if I have to be on the move Item 13 I get sudden feelings of panic Depression sub-scale Item 2 I still enjoy the things I used to enjoy Item 4 I can laugh and see the funny side of things Item 6 I feel cheerful Item 8 I feel as if I'm slowed down Item 10 I have lost interest in my appearance Item 12 I look forward with enjoyment to things Item 14 I can enjoy a good book or radio or TV program Statistical analyses Analyses were conducted with SPSS/PASW Version 18. Demogra phic variables were analyzed for each sample using frequency distributions and sa mple means were calculated and tested for significance with independent-samples t-test and Chi-square independence test, respectively. Fisher's test of significance was pe rformed to sort out the variables that had significant associati ons with the outcome variables. Th ese were then included in the logistical regression an alysis. Bivariate logist ic regression was conduc ted to evaluate the correlational structure of self-r ated health and general wellbe ing in both cultures. Breslow- Day Test for Homogenicity of Od ds Ratios was applie d to analyze whether the odds ratios of the dependent variables we re significantly differen t between the samples. Mean scores on each HAD sub-scale were calculated and compared using i ndependent-samples t-test. A cut-158 off of 8 was applied to dichotomiz e the anxiety and depression subscales and to calculate the prevalence of both disorders. The samples were then compared with Chi-square test of independence. The factor st ructure of the HADS was inve stigated with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The relationship be tween the sub-scales wa s investigated using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Shared variances were estimated by square- rooting the correlation coeffi cients. The internal consis tency of the HADS and HAD sub- scales was measured with Cr onbach coefficient alpha. Results Demographics The HUNT sample consisted of 2501 responden ts. In PNG the questio nnaire was completed by 489 women aged 18 to 56. 39 0 respondents met inclusion cr iteria for th e current study, out of which 359 were students. As seen in Table 2 ther e were evident demographic differences between the groups. In the PNG sample, the mean age was 2.2 years lower, the proportion of students was highe r and the numbers of respondents living with a partner or having had at least one child was lower compared to the HUNT sample.

In spite of this, they reported being less happy with life than students in HUNT. The majority of students in PNG reported being fairly happy with life, as opposed to the majority in HUNT, who stated they were very happy with li fe. There was statistical signif icance between the samples in self-ratings of health (p= 0,014) and general well-being (p=0 ,000) as well as the other variables used in the analyses (p=0,000) , except for long-term illness (p=0,197). Comparison of the structure of se lf-rated health in PNG and HUNT Of the odds ratios of the outcome variable ad justed for predictor vari ables, the onl y one that differed significantly between the samples was \"general feeling\" (T able 4). OR of poor health for female PNG students compared to HUNT students were adjust ed for all covariates. Before adjustment, PNG students were less likely to report poor self-rated health (OR=0.43; CI 0,24-0,75) compared to HUNT (OR=1). The adjusted odds-ra tio was even lower (OR=0.21; CI 0.09-0.53). Th e models that mostly affected the likelihood of poor health for students in PNG, were anxiet y (OR=0.20; CI 0,11-0,3 8) and low physical activity (OR=0.23; 0,11-0,45). 160 Table 4: Bivariate logistic regression models showing the unadju sted odds of poor self-rated health with major predictor variables among female student s in Port Moresby and Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag PNG HUNT Sig.b OR 95% CI OR 95% CI Presence of long-term illness No - 1.00 - Yes 6.78* 2.59-22.35 6.90* 4.28-11.13 of - Yes 4.75* more h/week activity None 1.26** 0.14-11.41 9.23* 1.47-57.79 - Mental health problems p>0.05 ***All respondents in PNG reporting poor health, scored 8 or more on the anxiety part of the HADS, resulting in the value 1.15E8. a.

Breslow-Day Test of Homogenicity of Odds Ratio 161 Comparison of the structure of well-being in PNG and HUNT Table 4 shows that several of th e odds ratios of the outcome va riable adjusted for predictor variables differed significantly between the sa mples; including long-term illness, feeling tired or worn out, low physical activity and living w ith a spouse or part ner. Respondents in PNG were more likely to repo rt being unhappy than in HUNT (OR=1,61; CI 1,17-2,22). This changed when adjusted for all variables (OR= 0,84; CI 0,45-1,58), but the results were not significant. The model which best explained the differe nce was anxiety, i.e. had the greatest positive effect on the OR, by solely reducing the OR to 0,81 (CI 0,53-1,24).

As we see there were striking differences between th e samples, with anxiety bein g more than three times as prevalent and depression close to four times as prevalent in PNG as in HUNT. The mean score on both HADS-A and HADS-D was ap proximately twice as high in PNG. Table 5 Prevalence of anxiety and depression defined by cut-off score 8 PNG (n=390) HUNT (n=2501) p Anxiety 69.9% 19.2% (338) 19.0% 4.9% (86) <0.000 Mean score 9.0 4.9 Factor structur e of the HADS The factor structure of the HADS was firs t investigated in the PNG sample. When performing PCA a two-factor solution emerged in which eleven of fourteen items loaded highest on their respective sub- scales. Item 7, however, load ed on the depression scale and item 8 on the anxiety scale. It em 10 did not load on either sub-scale. In the HUNT sample PCA produced a three-fact or solution. The first factor, representing an xiety, contained items 1, 3, 5, 9 and 13. The second fa ctor contained items 2, 4, 6, 10 and 12, which are depression items. The third factor comprised the mixed it ems 7, 11 and 14. Item 8 di d not load on either sub-scale. The study findings s howed that two of the items did not load on any factor, namely item 10 in PNG and item 8 in HUNT. 163 Inter-correlation of the sub-sc ales and internal consistency There was a strong, posi tive correlation between the two su bscales, 0.565 and 0.570, in PNG and HUNT respectively, produci ng shared variances of 3 1.9% in PNG and 32.5% in HUNT. The internal consistency of the HADS was sa tisfactory for both sa mples (values of 0.66- 0.83), although slightly lower in PNG compared to HUNT.

Still these students report ed less satisfaction with life. Adjusted for 164 various health measures and e ffects of size, we found that si te had a signif icant effect on self-reported health and well -being. Students in PNG were less likely to report being unhappy than students in HUNT. A nxiety was the factor that most affected the odds ratio of poor health and reduced well-b eing when comparing the tw o samples. Th e correlation between the objective health measures and self-rated health did not differ significantly between the two samples, strengthening the constr uct validity in PNG. The construct validity of general well-being, however, was weaker. The results of our study are consistent with previous fi ndings in terms of linking poor self-rated health to the presen ce of reduced objectiv e health (Jylha, et al., 1998), long-term illness (Goldstein, Sieg el, & Boyer, 1984; Pope, 1988), pain or stiffness in mu scles or joints (Fylkesnes & Forde, 1991), re duced life (Zubara Persch, Tarso, Ioppi, & Mezzich, 2008), physical activity (Miilunpalo, et al., 1997) and negative fe elings (Shetterly, Baxter, Mason, & Hamman, 1996). In line with other st udies, we found th at well-being is associated with long-term illnes s (Alonso et al., 2004; Caldwell, Baxter, Mitchell, Shetterly, & Hamman, 1998), chronic pain (Gureje, Von Korff, Simon, & Gater, 1998), mental health symptoms (Bowling, 2010), a nd physical (Ekela nd, Heian, 2005; Stathopoulou, Powers, Berry, Smits, & Otto, 2006). The contrast of lower self-rated health but higher qua lity of life ratings in one group compared to another has been f ound in other cross-cultu ral studies as well (Caldwell, et al., 1998 ; Shetterly, et al., 1996). In th ese studies, the le ss privileged group report poorer health bu t better well-being. One of the key elements concerning the find ings on self-rated he alth and well-being was to determine whether the results could repr esent objective differences in health status. According to Shetterly et al. ( 1996), it is necessary to fully ex amine the dispar ities in self- rated health between ethn ic groups before it is assumed th at the findings reflect differences in objective health stat us. The comparability of self-rated he alth across cultures is considered challenged if differences in the correlational stru cture of self-rated heal th are found (Jylha, et al., 1998). For our study, this implies that the measure of se lf-rated health is applicable in PNG, but raises a question to whether general well-being is. Although PNG is considered less devel oped that Norway, our sample from PNG consists of a group of women that are more privileged than the rest of PNG's female population, perhaps even more than the sample from HUNT. Socio-economic status was unfortunately not assessed in th is study due to methodol ogical difficulties wi th the variables. 165 Young women's experiences of health in PNG are highly ba sed on social and cultural experiences, such as social support, workload demands, economi c constraints, gender roles, responsibility, independ ence and educatio n (Hinton & Earnest, 2 009, 2010a). Students in PNG may be more independent, experience more modern gender roles, have less economic constraints and less ( physical) workload than the ge neral PNG woman. The discrepancy between the sample and the gene ral population is greater in PNG than in HUNT. This could have a positive effect on self-rated health for the social group in our PNG sample. This view is supported by an earlier study (Espnes & Mellam, 1999) and could explain why PNG students, despite a higher burden of disease in th eir country, reported be tter health. It could also be that Norwegian students rate thei r health as poo rer than one would expect. In the PNG sample the mean scores of both HADS-A and HADS-D were approximately twice as high as in the samp le from HUNT. When applying cut-off score 8 in both samples levels of anxi ety were more than 3 times as high and levels of depression close to 4 times as high in P NG as in HUNT. As for the factor analysis, results indicated that the HADS had satisfactory psyc hometric properties with adequa te internal consistency and moderate sub-scale intercor relation in both samples. Considering the lack of resear ch and concurrent statistics on mental health in PNG, the results need to be take n with caution. However, seve ral other studie s have found relatively high mean scores in general populations, especially with HADS-A (Caci et al., 2003; Chan, Leung, Fong, Leung, & Lee, 2010; Matsudaira, et al., 2009). As for cut-off scores, these values diffe r widely (Bjelland, et al., 2002). In Norway, 8 is considered the optimal cut-off on both HADS (A a nd D) sub-scales (Bje lland, et al., 2002), and it is likely that further research on the HADS in Papua New Guinea will pr ovide cut-off va lues slightly higher than the ones applied in Norway. In the PNG sample we obtained a two-fa ctor structure of the HADS supported by Zigmond and Snaith's original pr esentation as well as a seri ous of studies over the last decades (Herrmann, 1997) . The three-dimensional structure obtained in the HUNT sample is in accordance with a long list of previous studies (Caci, et al., 2003; Dunbar, Ford, Hunt, & Der, 2000; Martin, Thompson, & Barth, 2008; Mykletun, Stor dal, & Dahl, 2001; White, Leach, Sims, Atkinson, & Cottrell , 1999) with the third factor i nvolving \"restlessness\" (Caci, et al., 2003), \"psychomotor agitation\" (Barth 2005; Friedman, Samuelian, Lancrenon, Chia relli, 2001) or \"negat ive affectivity\"(Dunbar , et al., 2000). 166 In PNG item 8 (\"I feel as if I'm slowed down\"), originally belonging to the depression sub-scale, loads on the a nxiety component. In HUNT, howev er, item 8 does not load on either sub-scale. This suggests that in PNG the item might be interprete d differently than in HUNT. Aspects of time are often culturally base d and might be distinct in the two countries. In PNG the item might be inte rpreted as the external environmental factors slowing them down and not an intrinsic factor, as was the original intention w ith this question. As for the results in HUNT, psychomotor retardation is a symptom of severe depressi on (Association, 2000). In a general population samp le prevalence of severe depr ession is marginal and could be a plausible reason for why this item does not load on th e depression component in the HUNT sample and is in accordanc e with a tendency seen in se veral other studies where this item 8 has reached only borderlin e values (Chan, et al., 2010; Matsudaira, et al., 2009). Item 10 (\"I have lost interest in my appearance\") did not load on either sub-scale in PNG. In previous studies this item ha s shown high variability. In mo st studies it loads on the depression sub-scale (Bjelland, et al., 2002), however, it ha s shown to be the one item contributing the least and some st udies have even proposed it be discarded in future revisions (Caci, et al., 2003; Chan, et ., 2009; Montazeri, et al., 2003). As for cultural differences, image consciousness might be less important in PNG than in Norway, where studies have shown strong lo adings of this item on the depression component (Mykl etun, et al., 2001). The satisfactory inte rnal consistency and the strength of the f actor components should leave little doubt that the HADS shows promise as a reliab le and valid inst rument in PNG, and that it does measure the two components intended, depressi on and anxiety. The results of this study showed distur bingly high prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in PNG compared to HUNT. The findings could very well be a credible indicator of the level of symptoms in women in accordance with their own perception of their lives with relatively high levels of stressors. In addition to showing very high prevalence in PNG, a nxiety turned out being the single most associated factor with low well-b eing and one of the most important factors to influence self-rated health. Port Moresby is a city with high degree of social disturbance, crime and violence (God dard, 2005). Female PNG students have been found to report more fear of assault or rape than Norwegian students, whose wo rst fear is losing a family member (Espnes & Mellam, 1999). Acco rding to Amnesty Internationa l women and girls in PNG are victims of widespread and pervasive violence both in the home and in the community 167 (Amnesty International, 2006). Women in PNG are marginalized and impoverished (Hinton & Earnest, 2010a, 2 010b). They have little control of their own lives and few opportunities to achieve personal and econom ic independence (Hinton & Earnest, 2009, 2010b). For many university students the years away from home offer relief from abuse at home, but preoccupation with family members who ar e still suffering act as a major stressor (McManus, 2006). Female students might also live under ins ecure conditions being away from their closest family and supportive networks. Generalizability and limitations. It is important to bear in mi nd that PNG is a culturally dive rse country with approximately 1000 different languages and dialects. Developi ng universal instrume nts for screening under these circumstances is close to impossible. Hen ce, the results cannot wi thout further research be generalized to the broade r female population. As for th e limitations, the study included only female respondents' ages of 20 through 29. In addition, in PNG th e questionnaire was only distributed among women cu rrently residing in Port Moresby and only among women associated with the university. These women are not necessarily represen tative of the general female population. Respondents we re recruited with the \"sno wball-strategy\" which could represent a bias. Conclusion This study analyzed the struct ures and validity of self-rated health, well-be ing and the HADS among women aged 20 to 29 in Port More sby, Papua New Guinea and the HUNT-study. Students in the PNG sample report ed better health, but poorer well-being th an the students in the HUNT sample. Adjusted for various health m easures, we found that si te had an effect on self-reported health and well-being. The structure of self-related he alth was found not to differ significantly, whereas the st ructure of well-being did. This indicates that the self-rated health measure is applicable in PNG, while well-being needs more research before being considered a valid instrument in PNG. As for the HADS, the le vel of anxiety and depression symptoms was considerately higher in the sample from PNG compared to HUNT. There were slight discrepancies in the psychometric properties of the scale as well as in the symptom pattern of anxiety and depressi on. However, the HADS did demonstrate satisfactory psychometric prop erties in both countries, and shows promise as a valid instrument for assessing anxi ety and depression in PNG. Ul timately, it is warranted to conduct further qualitative re search to verify how many respondents fill criteria for 168 depression and anxiety diagnoses, before appropriate cut-off scores can be secured and the HADS completely validated for use in PNG.

It results from an on-going process and interaction with the individuals' socio-eco logical environment throughout the whole life course. In this context, we all have to function as active partic ipating subjects in our own life, making use of resources in order to maintain and improve he alth. Thus, health can be seen as a lifelong learning process where we reflect on what will cr eate health and what are the options for life and quality of life. Health is perceived and evaluated differently by the individual across th e age span, and highly depends on factors within the individual, but al so on factors in the in dividuals' close and distant environment. Health and well-being is si gnificantly influenced by the circumstances of our lives, access to services, work and income and by the communities where we live as well as our own lives. Therefore, the knowledge base of health promotion, as well as strategies to promote health, must be seen in a life course perspective. The five following chapters focus on different asp ects relevant to the life course perspective. Chapters 13 and 17 focuses on the role of health promoting resources in relation to stress, health and school well-being in children and adolescents. Chap ter 14 presents opportunities for health promotion research and knowle dge based on public health through the HUNT Study Norway. In Chapter 15, focus is devoted to the role of self-transcendence, well-being and nurse-patient-interaction in cognitively intact nursing home patients. And finally, Chapter 16 focuses on religion and mental health in the elderly. 176 177 13. The role of resources and prot ective factors in relation to stress and health outcomes in adolescence UNNI KARIN MOKSNES S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College, Faculty of Nursing, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion a nd Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway Abstract Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by multiple changes in virtually every aspect of an individual's life, calling for ne w psychological adaptations. Exposure to different stressors caused by these change s represents a central and nor mal part of the process of growth and development durin g adolescence. The present c hapter focuses on the role and nature of adolescent stressors and the association between st ress and psychological health outcomes. Meanwhile, when faced with identica l stressors, the stress process and the health outcomes of stress vary individually; the outcome depends on the role of different vulnerabilities and protect ive factors, in the individual as well as in the environment. The chapter considers the role of three potential protective factor s with importance for stress and coping processes, as well as for health and well-being during adolescence; leisure time physical activity, self-esteem and sense of coherence (SOC). Adolescence is concep tualized as a life phase, which be gins with the onset of puberty and ends with the acceptance of adult roles and responsibilities. Of all life-stages, except childhood, adolescence is the one most marked by rapid and potentially tumultuous transition (Steinberg, 2008). This is to be seen in the domain of bi ological development where the changes are physically externally manifest as well as in the progression of bot h cognitive and psychosocial maturity from that of childhood to that of the fully functioning adult (Byrne, Davenport, & Mazanov, 2007; Moksnes, Byrn e, Mazanov, & Espnes, 2010). While the transition through adolescence is inevitable the speed and magni tude of these changes may overtax the capacity of many young people to cope and th e resulting ph enomenon of adolescent stress is now well re cognized (Byrne, et al., 2007). Adolescence has historically been a life stage of relative neglect with respect to research on both mental and phy sical health interventions an d outcomes, although research on growth and development during adolescence has expanded during th e past years (Compas 178 & Reeslund, 2009). Perhaps such neglect has occurred because most adolescents compared with other developmental peri ods are healthy when assessed by traditio nal medical markers such as the presence or absence of chronic disease, use of health care services and hospitalization (Ozer, & Irwin, 2009). Howeve r, adolescence is a pivotal period of development with respect to health and il lness. Most adolescents transverse this developmental period succe ssfully resolving the ch allenges they face to become competent, productive adult members of soci ety. Meanwhile, adolescence also marks the increase in the incidence of a number of mental health problems and threats to physical hea lth (Compas & Reeslund, 2009, pp. 561 ). Many health habits and behaviou rs are consolidated, and important health risk behaviours are first evident during this life st age. These patterns affect not only the immediate health of adoles cents, but lay the foundation fo r health throughou t the lifespan (Ozer, & Irwin, 2009). Understanding the role and na ture of stressors in the lives of adolescents, how experience of stress is associ ated with different health out comes, as well as identifying potential protective fact ors in this context is crucial for helping adolescents capitalize on the many changes taking place in their lives, and eq uip them with tools to make their journey through adolescence a po sitive growth-oriented experi ence (Grant et al., 2006). Understanding the role of stress is also important to the identification of those adolescents most in need of early interven tion, whereas clarificat ion of factors that promotes health and well-being and moderate the negative health effects of stress can be used to form interventions to strengthen adol escent development in general, as well as to support those with potential risk (C ompas & Reeslund, 2009). Conceptualization of stress and stressors Stress has traditionally been conceptualized in three wa ys; as a stimulus (an event or accumulation of events); as a response (a psyc hophysiological reaction); or as a transactional process, in which a pers on and the environment interact to produce an appraisal of threat or loss (Caltabiano, Sarafino, & Byrne, 2008). The present ch apter has focus on perceived stress . Thus, \"stress\" is used to describe the subjective experi ence of pressure, implying an evaluation of the outcome of a pro cess. This is in line with the transactional view of stress as a relationship between environm ental events or c onditions, and th e individual' s cognitive appraisals of the degr ee and type of challenge , threat, harm or lo ss (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). The most widely accepted de finition of stress is the tran sactional definition offered by Lazarus and Folkman (1984): \"Psychological stress involv es a particular relationship 179 between the person and th e environment that is appraise d by the person as taxing or exceeding his or her re sources and endangering his or her well-being\" (p. 19). According to this definition, stress is subjec tive by nature, since it involves an apprai sal of individual experiences. Exposure to stressful events (stressors) repr esents signifi cant sources of risk to the healthy development of adolescent s, and stressors are experience d in different intensities and durations of Moksnes Stressors of both an acute and ch ronic nature are important in th e course of normal as well as disrupted development during ad olescence. Stressors are define d according to Grant et al. (2003, p. 449) as: \"Environmental events or chronic conditions that objectively th reaten the physical and/or psychological he alth or well-being of individuals of a pa rticular age in a particular society.\" Stress and health in adolescence A number of models may be relevant in ex plaining the associatio n between stress and different negative psyc hological outcomes through the li fe span (Graber & Sontag, 2009). Models of cumulative and simult aneous events posit that when individuals experience major stressful events or transitions given the nature of adolescent development (e.g. academical demands or change in social relationships) either in clos e sequence (cum ulatively) or simultaneously, they are more likely to have negative behavioural a nd emotional outcomes as a result of the confluence of events (Graber & S ontag, 2009). Cumulative events may also be characterized by in creasing numbers of stressful even ts that occur for adolescents commensurate with changes in peer groups, friendships, parent al relationships, and school demands. Coping resources may be overwhelmed by the experience of multiple changes in close proximity, which lead to negative health outcomes. In essenc e, the individual's assessments of the importance of the stressful events and thei r timing, and whether the event is controllable or not are all factors affecting whet her stressful events are associated with negative health outcome s in this model (Gra ber & Sontag, 2009). Research has established that the overall number of stressors te nd to increase from preadolescence to adol escence (Compas & Reeslund, 2009). Girls tend to perceive higher levels of stress than boys, especi ally in relation to interpersonal stressors, e.g. pe ers, romantic partners, and family relationship (C harbonneau Mezuli s, & Brennan, 2006). 180 Relations between stress ors, especially those in an in terpersonal context (e.g. peers, family, romantic relationships) and symptoms of depression and anxi ety in childhood and adolescence have been well established in cross-sectiona l and prospective longitudinal studies (Bouma, Ormel, Verhul st, Oldehinkel, 2008; & Byrne 2010b). In this regard, girls appear to be more vulnerable to the negative psychological e ffects of interpersonal stress, than boys (Bouma et al., 2008 ; Charbonneau et al., 2009; Hankin et al., 2007; Shih et al., 2006). The role of potentia l stress moderators Stress alone is not sufficient to explain individual differences in people's health. When faced with the same stressor(s), the stress process and the impact fr om stress vary individually and lead to different health outcomes; this depends on individua l and environmental vulnerabilities and resources, as well as the ability to cope effectively with the stressors (Compas & Reeslund, 2009). Physical activity Previous studies have shown th at daily physical activity, regu lar exercise and a sufficient level of physical f itness protect agains t a variety of negative physic al (Sundblad et al., 2008) and psychological conditions (Hallal, Victoria, Azevedo, & Wells, 2006; Piko & Keresztes, 2006), and promote positive perceived health, an d well-being during ad olescence (Edwards, 2006). Physical activity has show n to be beneficial in rela tion to depression (Jerstad, Boutelle, Ness, & 2007). In the review of Gerber & P\u00fchse Stressors Normative events , Adolescent Health Outcomes Moderator Risk factors 181 (2009) which summarizes the literature from 1982 to 2008, 16 st udies fully supported the validity of an exercise-bas ed stress-buffer hypo thesis, where six st udies were based on adolescent samples. In contrast, 15 investig ations (five in adolescent samples) did not support the stress-buffe ring hypothesis. Gerber & P\u00fchse (2009) suggest several mechanisms that may explain how physic al activity alleviates the effects of stress. First, it can be assumed that physical activity results in reduced arousal (m ood enhancement due to cognitive distraction or biochemi cal changes) or more positive hea lth behaviours during periods of high stress (i.e. decreased smoki ng, healthier eating ha bits). Second, physi cal activity may bring about higher levels of fitness and - as an indirect consequence - a more efficient physiological and psychological stress regulation (i .e. reduced secret ion of hormones, lowered blood pressure) or e nhanced recovery processes. Besides preventive effects, physical activity may strengthen other protective personal re sources (i.e. self-esteem) (Ekeland et al., 2005; Schmalz et al., 2007) and social resources (i.e. social support), which in turn have the potential to influence the stress-h ealth relationship (G erber & P\u00fchse, 2009). Sense of coherence The medical sociologist Aron Antonovsky introduced the sa lutogenic perspective which focuses on what are the source s for people's resources and capacity to create health (Salutogenesis) rather than the classic focus on risk, ill health and disease (Pathogenesis). Antonovsky tried to find the solution to the sa lutogenic question why some people, regardless of major stressful si tuations stay healthy, while ot hers do not. Th e answer was formulated in terms of Sense of Coherence (SOC) and Genera l Resistance Resources (GRR) (Antonovsky, 1979; Eriksson, 2007). SOC is defined as \"a global orientati on that expresses the extent to which one has a pe rvasive, enduring though dynamic feeling of confidence that 1) the stimuli deriving from one 's internal and exter nal environments in the course of living are structured, predicta ble and explicable, 2) th e resources are availabl e to one to meet the demands posed by these stimuli; and 3) these demands are challenges, worthy of investment and engagement\" (Antonovsky, 1987 p. 107). This combination of cognitive, behavioural and motivational aspects form the concept of SOC and the three components are named comprehensibility, manage ability and meaningfulness . The other key fact ors are the general resistance resources (GRR) available to make such a movement towa rds health possible. The GRRs can be found within people as resources bound to their person and capacity but also to their immediat e and distant environment as of both material and non-material qualities from the person to the whole society. The key factor is not what is available but to 182 be able to use and re-use them for the inte nded purpose. The GRRs provide a person with sets of meaningful and coherent life experiences thanks to the resources at the person's disposal (Eriksson, 2007). Antonovsky (1987) claimed th at a person`s SOC devel ops throughout childhood into the latter stages of adolescence and becomes more or less stabil ized in the period of early adulthood. During this time, people are repeatedly exposed to tension states requiring that they actively respond to stress ors by mobilizing appropriate re sources. However, findings have shown that development of a person's SOC is a life long process (Eriksson, 2007; Lindstr\u00f6m & Eriksson, 2010), making it importa nt to investigate SOC in adolescent populations more thoroughly. A strong SOC is associated with good ment al health and qualit y of life, among adult and adolescent samples (Lindstr \u00f6m & Eriksson, 2010; Neuner et al., Tezer, 2009). SOC is strongly and invers ely associated with anxiety and depressi on; the st ronger the SOC, the lesser are symptoms of emotional problem (Blom, Serlachius, & Helenius, 2008). Moreover, boys seem to report stronger SOC than girls (Natvi g, Hanestad, & Samdal, 2006; Moksnes, Rannestad, Espnes, & Byrne, 2011). People with strong SOC seem to be more resilient unde r stress than people with weak SOC (Eriksson & Lindstr\u00f6m, 2005; Lindstr\u00f6m & Eriksson, 2010). Individuals with a strong SOC, it is postulated, will ha ve a general confidence that resources are available to meet the demands pos ed by stressful situations, and wi ll thus consider a stressor more as a challenge th an as a threat. This confidence increases the likelihood of positive coping expectancies, which will prevent stress from turning into potentially harmful tension (Antonovsky, 1987). In adolescent s, SOC is found to moderate the association between stress and self-reported health status (Richardson & Ratner, 20 05) and the association between stress and recent illness (Nielsen & Hansso n, 2007). Moksnes & Espnes (paper submitted) also found that SOC moderated the associat ion between stress an d state depression. However, inconsistent findings regarding the mo derating role of SOC in relation to stress and subjective health complaints have be en found (Moksnes, Ra nnestad et al., 2011; Torsheim, Aaroe, & Wold, Self-esteem is a large part of self-under standing & Hoffman, 2002; R\u00e4ty, Larsson, S\u00f6derfeldt, & La rsson, 2005). Rosenberg (1965) defined self-esteem as an individual's set of thoughts and feelings about hi s or her own worth a nd importance. This definition reflects the notion of \"global\" or \"g eneral\" self-esteem or self-worth. The importance of self-esteem for the well -being of adolesce nts is underscored by decades of theory and research supporting its link with psyc hological health and well-being during adolescence (Green 2005; Muris, Meesters, & Fijen, 2003; Trzesniewski et the numerous biological, psycholo gical and cognitiv e changes that occur during adolescence highlight the importa nce of examining self-esteem during this period (Boden, Fer gusson, & Horwood, 2008 ; Cote, 2009). Low self-esteem has been considered as an important factor in relation to symptoms of depression (Bos, Huijding, Muris, Vogel, & Schmitt, 2009), and anxiety (Boden et al., 2008; Bos, et al., 20 10). Especially in the face of stressful events, adolescents with low self-esteem is considered to have fewer coping resources a nd are therefore more vulnerable for the development of psychological symptoms, wh ereas those with high self- esteem are buffered against this effect (A bela, Webb, Wagner, Ho, & Adams, 2006; Orth, Robins, & Meier, 2009). Orth, Ro bins, & Meier (2 009) state that \"follo wing stressful events, protective factors such as high self-esteem, may preven t the outcome of depressive symptoms by decreasing the negative impact of depressogenic thoug hts on the affective, cognitive, behavioural, and of depr ession\" (p. 308). The self-esteem buffering hypothesis has been test ed in numerous studie s; however, previous research testing the moderating role of self-est eem has yielded inconsistent re sults (see Abela et al., 2006; Orth, Robins, & Meier, 2009). The study by Moksnes et al. (2010b) found a weak moderating role of self-esteem on the association betw een stress of peer pressure and the outcome of state depression a nd anxiety, as well as betwee n each of stress of school performance and romantic rela tionships in associ ation with state anxiety. This finding supports the protective role of self-esteem in associat ion with adolescent stress and emotional health outcomes a nd the importance of strengthening self-esteem during the adolescent years. 184 Implications The identification of the link between stressful life events and negative health outcomes represents an important step toward developing interventions for children a nd adolescents. One target for preventive interventions could ce rtainly be to reduce the burden on children and adolescents by decreasing thei r exposure to stress. These might include efforts to reduce stressors in the family environment as well as in the school environmen t. However, given the limited control that can be gained over young people's expo sure to many forms of stressful situations, an even more impor tant focus for intervention is to increase children's and adolescents' abilities to cope with stress (Grant, Be hling, Gipson, & Ford, 2005). An important target for the prevention of negative health outcomes, as well as for positive adolescent development, is to increase adolescents' awareness of their potential, their internal and external gene ral resistance resources, and thei r ability to use the resources available. This may promote a dolescents' ability to handle the challenges that one may experience during the adolesce nt period, and make their journey through adolescence a positive growth-oriented expe rience (Compas, Champion, & Reeslund, 2005). Previous studies suggest that effective health promotion is multifaceted, and is most successful when integrated into several arenas such as schools, families, school-health services as well as organisations where adolescents meet with peers to provide a s upportive context which facilitate development of a number of protective factor s in adolescents (Haugland, 2001; Natvig et al., 2006). One way of promoting a good school environment is to focus on positive class environment and engagement in school - bot h social and academically. Furthermore, pedagogical methods might be used to improve notions of support among students (Joronen, Rankin, & \u00c5stedt-Kuri, 2008; Natvig et al., 2006). An equall y important aspect is to include parents, family and afte rschool programs to integrate all environments that adolescents are part of. Parents need to be in close dialog with their child and to be seen as crucial actors in relation to their children's healthy development through ad olescence (Compas et al., 2005; Laursen & Collins, 2009) . After-school programs are also im portant as supportive and health promoting arenas where adolescent s can form and develop a set of protective reso urces. It is important however, if successful, that the ty pe of activity is in accordance with the adolescents' individual intere sts and preferences, and that th e environment is adjusted for different activities. The discussion above shows that within health promotion among adolescents lay both pers onal, social and environmental c onditions. A system atic approach 185 that aims to reduce high levels of negative st ress and to develop a dolescent resources may facilitate positive developmen tal outcomes in adolescence. 186 References Abela, J.R.Z., Webb, C.A., Wagner, C., Ho, M.R., & Adams, P.

Knowledge based health promotion in Public Health, the HUNT Study, Norway Opportunities for health promotion research STEINAR KROKSTAD HUNT Research Centre, Deptartment of Public He alth and General Practice, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway Abstract Health promotion needs to be based on several types of knowledge, not at least data on the public health development. The HUNT Study constitutes a large population database for medical and health related research in Norway. So far three large health surveys of the total adult population in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County, also been invited to the Young-HUNT Study from 1995-97. Hea lth promotion researchers have proposed a quality of life model relevant for health promotion research. Nine domains are described, for understanding how personal and community factors influence health and well-being. All of these domains are more or less covered by the HUNT Study. New initiatives in health promotion research should take advantage of established populatio n based longitudinal health studies like HUNT, look ing for factors contributing to positive health development and well-being. Need for knowledge Health promotion needs to be based on several types of k nowledge (1986; Marmot, 1998): The public health deve lopment populati on to be served, ba ckground contextual information about the po litical situation, historical, cult ural and economic conditions, and knowledge relevant for implementation of health promotion measures. This chapter is primarily about obtaining knowledge of public health development. We need to know what people are exposed to, their health related behaviour and the prevalence of good healt h, quality of life, health compla ints and diseases. Humans have historically often been exposed to life th reatening surroundings and di seases. This is still the case for large popu lations, suffering from famine, disast er and war. However, an increasing share of the world's population benefit from improved living c onditions and modern medical 194 treatment. This contributes to reduced mortalit y and increasing life ex pectancy. The need to study the causes of premature de ath is increasingly be ing superseded by the need to study what contributes to quality of li fe and good health. This also reflects what has been the focus of the HUNT Study, from the 1980s until today. The HUNT Study, Norway The HUNT Study (an abbreviation of the Norwegian name: \" Helseunders\u00f8kelsen i Nord- Tr\u00f8ndelag) constitutes a large population database for medical and health related research (www.ntnu.edu/hunt). So far three large health survey s of the general ad ult population in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County, Norw ay (Figure 1) have been completed, HUNT1 1984-86, HUNT2 in 1995-97, and HUNT3 in 2006-08 (Krokstad et al, 2012). At the time of HUNT2 and HUNT3, adolescents aged 13 -19 years also were invi ted to the Young-HUNT Study, with partly overlapping scie ntific program. All questionnaires are published on our web- page: http://www.nt nu.edu/hunt/data/que. Figure 1. The HUNT Study research area, the Nord-Tr\u00f8nd elag County, the 24 municipalities, Norway. Setting Norway is a North-European country characteri zed as a social democratic welfare state, (Esping-Andersen, 1990) with generous universal public health insurance coverage, and predominately public health serv ices. The average life expectan cy (2009) is 83 years in women and 79 in men. Nord-Tr \u00f8ndelag constitutes one of 19 counties, geographically situated in the mid part of th e country. The populati on size is relatively stable and increased slowly in size from HUNT1 (125 835 in 19 81) to HUNT3 (128 694 in 2006), and except for 195 young adults moving out to get e ducation and other re asons, the in and out migration has been low. HUNT1 (1984-86), based in primary care , was designed to address arterial hypertension, diabetes and chest X-ray screening of t uberculosis. These we re central health topics in the 1980ies, the mortal ity of cardiovascular diseases was still high, the treatment programmes for diabetes was under development an d the health authorities were still occupied with tuberculosis control. However, data on health related behaviour and quality of live were also include d, highly relevant fo r health promotion research. (Moum, Naess, Sorensen, Tambs, & Holmen, 1990) The scope of HUNT has since then expanded over time and contributed to important knowledge regarding health prom oting factors, heal th related life styl e, prevalence and incidence of good health, illness and disease, ca usal relationships and associations between disease phenotypes and genotypes. The surveys have been set up by the HUNT Research Ce ntre, organized under the Norwegian Institute of Public Health until 2001, and thereafter The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). HUNT has largely been publicly funde d. HUNT3 was mainly funded by The Norwegian Ministry of Health, NTNU, The Norwegian Research Council (the FUGE programme), Central Norway Regional Heal th Authority, The Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County Council and The Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Funding also ha s been given by some commercial enterprises. The HUNT1 Survey, adults aged 20+ (established 1984-86) In 1984-86 every citizen of Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County being 20 years or older (or turning 20 years during the year of survey ) were invited. Totally 77 212 persons participated (89% of those invited). Questionnaires and clinical measurements were applied. Participants with findings indicating pathol ogy were advised to see their family doctor. The design applied in HUNT1 was largely repeated in HUNT2 and HUNT3. The materi al is in epidemiological terminology considered be ing a cohort, because the participan ts may be followed up in later surveys and other he alth registers de scribed below. 196 The HUNT2 Survey, adults aged 20 + (established 1995-97) HUNT2 constituted both a new cross sectional survey and a follow-up of HUNT1.(Holmen et al., 2003) The scient ific programme was exte nded to include severa l large public health issues in accordance with curr ent national health priorities . These were in addition to cardiovascular diseases , and diabetes, obstruc tive lung disease, os teoporosis, headache, mental health, chronic musculoskeletal pain and urinary incontin ence. In addition to questionnaires, interviews and clinical ex aminations, the participan ts contributed with blood samples for instant analysis and storage. A total of 65 237 pa rticipated in HUNT2 (70% of those invited). The HUNT3 Survey, adults aged 20+ (established 2006-08) The scientific programme of HUNT3 included se veral main public he alth issues as in HUNT2, but included also topics like culture participation an d religious affiliation. Data on health related behaviou r like alcohol use, to bacco use, diet and physical activity was collected as in all surveys. For traditional medical research, optimal hand ling and storage of blood and urine samples were give n high priority, as part of the establishment of a new up- to-date biobank (Krokstad et al, 2012). The Young-HUNT1 Survey, adolescents aged 13-19 years (established 1995-97) The Young-HUNT Study was decided to includ e adolescents aged 13 - 19 years in HUNT, starting from HUNT 2 in 1995-97, form ing the Young-HUNT1 Survey. The Young-HUNT Study was designed to cover a broad scale of topics in relation to major public health issues in adolescents. The main focus of somatic heal th problems has been re spiratory and allergic diseases, subjective he alth problems, different types of headaches and eating problems including overweight and obesity. Mental health focus includes anxiety and depr ession, self esteem, personality and well be ing. Health behaviours focus on alcohol use, tobacco use, diet, regularity of meals, dieting and physical activity. Puberty, school problems and leisure time activity were also in cluded. The Young-HUNT questi onnaires are adolesc ents aged 16-19 s (2000-2001) This survey was a four years follow-up of the youngest partic ipants aged 13-16 years in Young-HUNT1, thus following the lower second ary school cohort into upper secondary school. 197 The Young-HUNT3 Survey, adolescents aged 13-19 years (established 2006-08) A new total cohort, the Young-HUNT 3 survey was in cluded in HUNT3 (2006-08). The topics from Young-HUNT1 were largely contin ued, but questions abou t resilience were included. The participa tion rates have been high in Young -HUNT, not at least because data are collected at sc hools (all secondary schools and vocationa l schools in the c ounty, a total of about 60 schools). HUNT-data are being linked to national comple te high quality registers in several studies Researchers always receive de-ide ntified data for research pur pose. However, all HUNT data are stored in HUNT databank lin ked to the unique personal identification number (PIN) enabled every Norwegian citizen at birth. This makes it possible to link da ta between surveys and study parts for each partic ipant in HUNT, to link data fr om Young-HUNT to the adult part of HUNT for each participant, enabling family and longitudinal studie s. It also makes it possible to link HUNT data to regional and National health registers with very few individual data missing. All re gisters are based on the Norweg ian PIN. Data has in several studies been linked to the Norwegian Birth Re gister and the Norwegia n Family Register, the National Cancer Register, the Ca uses of Death Register, the Pr escription Register, the Social Security Registers (FD-try gd), the National Educ ation Database, the Income- and tax Register, and local hospita l disease registers. Data relevant for health promot ion research in the HUNT Study Raphael et al have proposed a quality of lif e model relevant for heal th promotion research. Nine domains are described, and might serve as means of understandi ng how personal and community factors influence health and well-being (Table 1). (2010) 198 Table 1. Quality of life domains (2010) Physical being Physical health, m obility, nutrition, fitness, appearance Psychological being Independence, autonomy, self-acceptance, freedom from stress Spiritual being Values and st andards, spiritual beliefs Physical belonging Physical asp ects of the immediate environment Social belonging Relationships with family, friends and acquaintances Community belonging Availability of societal resources and services Practical becoming Home, school and work activities Leisure becoming Indoor and outdoor activities, recreational resources Growth becoming Learning, improving skills and relationships, adapting All of these domains are mo re or less covered by th e HUNT Study, not necessary all in one survey, but many domains have often been covered and mi ght be studied together. All questionnaire data are presented at our web-site: http://www.nt nu.edu/hunt/data/que. All the HUNT surveys cover demographic da ta, sex and marital st atus, and families may be clustered with the Fam ily Register, now also being integrated in the HUNT Databank from 2012. Thus, for adolescents for example, a lot of info rmation on health and socio- economic conditions in their families is regi stered in the data from their parents. Physical being (table 1) is covered by all surveys, physical health and mobility are carefully described, and nutriti on is covered by clinical m easurements of body mass index (BMI) and some diet questions . Fitness are partly covered, questionnaires for people aged 70+ cover activities of daily life (ADL). Psychological being is covered to some extent in all surveys by questions about personality traits, loneliness, and symptoms of anxiety a nd depression, quality of life, psychosocial factors at ho me and at work. In Young-HUNT 3 data on resilience was included. 199 Spiritual being was included in the latest survey for adults, HUNT3, with questions of life philosophy, religious attend ance and seeki ng God's help. Physical belonging and physical aspects of the imm ediate environment might be analysed. By linking individua l data from HUNT to geogra phic information about the municipality of living, residential circuit, or GIS (geographic information systems)-data, multi-level and other designs might be utilized. Social belonging is quite extensively covered in all surveys, not at least in Young- HUNT. In HUNT3, data on seriou s events and childhood experien ces are covered, including questions that might indicate post traumatic stress. In HUNT 2 and HUNT3 data on social capital in the nei ghbourhood is covered in questionnaire 2. Community and practical belonging , regarding availability of societal resources and services, is partly covered by data on social capital in the neighbourhood in HUNT2 and HUNT3. More data is availabl e by linkage to GIS-data in the county and in the municipalities. The im portance of distances between hom e and the resour ces of society might be analyzed. Leisure becoming is quite extensively cove red by all the HUNT su rveys. In the latest survey (HUNT3), several questi ons on active and passive cu lture and leis ure activity participation are covered. Growth becoming might be analysed in the HUNT Study, not at least by the opportunities in the long itudinal cohort design, and life co urse approaches. Data on physical health at birth might be linked from the Na tional Birth Register , data on education achievement from HUNT data or from the Nati onal Education Database (Statistics Norway), data on occupational st atus from HUNT data and data on need for public social services might be linked from the Nation al Social Security Database (FD-Trygd) form Statistics Norway. Quality of life rese arch opportunities Integration of quality of life data in HUNT1 (1984-86), made re search in this area possible from the very beginning. (Moum et al., 19 90) A recent study has compared in-patients quality of life with the HUNT-population, util izing HUNT as a refere nce (Helvik, Engedal, Krokstad, & Selbaek, 2011) Derdikman-Eiron et al have looked at gender differences in subjecti ve well-being, self-esteem and psychosocial functioning in adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and de pression. (Derdikman-E iron et al., 2011) 200 The culture and health initiative Highly relevant for health prom otion, the HUNT Research Cent re has cooperated with the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County Council, The Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag University Collage and municipalities in the county on a pub lic health culture and health in itiative (http://www.folk2.no/). The main aim has been to exploit the possible effects of stimulat ing cultural participation in public health, not at least among vulnerable groups. (Knudtsen, Holm en, & Hapnes, 2005; Knudtsen, Holmen, & Hapnes, 2005) From a public health point of vi ew, the motivation has been the constraints seen in traditional methods in health care and in public health efforts to influence health-related behaviour. (Ill ich, 1975; Rose, 2001) Howe ver, a recent published overview shows that the scientific basis for utiliz ing culture participation in public health is still scarce. (Cuypers et al., 2011) Thus, this collaboration has resulted in the inclusion of questions on active and passive cultural participati on in the questionnaires in the HUNT3 Survey (2006-08). Behaviour in the popula tion based on these da ta has been mapped ge ographically, and has been used in the culture strategic work in the county. (2011) The first international scientific paper based on these data was published in 2011, (Cuypers et al., 2011) and attracted considerable international attention. Religion and health re search opportunities Population-based research on th e relationship between religion and health is now possible using HUNT3-data. Several scient ific papers have recently b een published regarding the association between re ligious attendance a nd blood pressure. (S\u00f8r ensen, Danbolt, Lien, Koenig, & Holmen, 2011). The opportunities for hea lth promotion research by using data from HUNT are excellent New initiatives in health promotion research s hould obviously take a dvantage of established population based longitudinal he alth studies like HUNT, looking for factors contributing to positive health development and well-being. The HUNT Study has seve ral strengths: It covers a total population aged 20 to 100 years within a specif ic geographical area, including coastal and inland municipalities with different characteristic s. HUNT has a wide age range, thereby covering groups of people with different cohort exposure s. Data in each survey has been collected over a two years period, giving opportun ity for studies of seasonal variations in health. HUNT databank includ es data on an extensive rang e of topics. To follow an 201 unselected population in a well defined geograph ically area in North- Europe during decades, allows for a wealth of opportunities. So far, data from HUNT have been the basis for 80 PhDs (http://www.ntnu.no/hunt/ doktorgradsavhandlinger). The Norwegian Research Counc il has just stated that \"Norway has succeeded in creating large, important and very impressive longitudinal population-based databases, which, together with national health registries and the pe rsonal identification number, constitute unique possibi lities to do excellent research in an international perspective\".(2011) The Research Council recommends strongly that the databases are used in new areas of research. Data from the HUNT Study are available fo r researchers who sa tisfy some basic requirements (www.ntnu.e du/hunt), whether affili ated in Norway or ab road. To provide the researcher or research group ex clusive rights, the HUNT Resear ch Centre signs a contract with the research institution in charge. The exclus ive rights are connect ed to a specific publication plan based on an a pplication form, a scie ntific protocol, an ethical approval, other necessary ap provals (if any), and a vari able specification list. More details about the contents of the questi onnaire and clinical measurements can be found on our website ( www.ntnu.edu/hunt ). The HUNT Study and health promotio n in the Nord-T r\u00f8ndelag County, Norway The researchers behind the HUNT Study have alwa ys cooperated with th e health authorities in the county, municipalities an d the health services on public health issues, and located the research centre in the middle of the county. Th e cooperation has been formalized through the establishment of an adviso ry group for HUNT, through mee tings and conferences. This has been important for the development of a relevant content in the health surveys, attendance among the invited population, assessme nt of the health study's impact on workload in the health serv ice and cooperation on prevention and he alth promotion. HUNT Research Centre has atta ched great importance to sa feguard the le gal, privacy and ethical aspects of th e study, and compiled hea lth statistics based on the collected data to be used in public health. ( 2011) This \"locally pr esent - reinvestment approach\" has been termed a sustainable population-base d research strategy. 202 References Ottawa charter for health pr omotion. (1986). Ottawa, WHO.

Self-transcendence, well-being, and nurse-patient- interaction in cognitively intact nursing home patients G\u00d8RILL HAUGAN S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College, Faculty of Nursing, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion a nd Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway Abstract Within the overal l trends towards older populations wo rldwide, the most rapidly growing segment is that of people over 80. Because of the characteristic patterns of gains and losses seen in the \"young old\" and the \"old old\", the last part of the life-span have been divided into two separate phases. For many of the \"old old\" (80+) physical illness, disabilities and multiple losses necessitate the need for long-term care in nursing homes. Finding new and alternative approaches to e nhance wellbeing among nursing home patients is highly warranted. Research indicates that self-transcendence can be such a positive approach, revealing significant influence of self-tr anscendence on physical, emotional, social, functional, and spiritual wellbeing in nursing home patients. Self -transcendence is described as a dynamic process involving adaption to pas t physical, emotional, a nd spiritual distress, and a powerful coping mechanism encountering d ifficulties and significant life experiences. Involvement and interpersonal and intrapers onal connectedness is the core of self- transcendence. While most nursing home patie nts have few relationships left to provide dialogue, self-reflection, and meaningful communication, the nurse-patient interaction appears to be a vital resource to promote self-transcendence, and thus multidimensional wellbeing. Introduction The document An Aging World (Kinsella & He, 2009) highlights a huge shift to an older population and its conse quences. In the next 30 years, the number of people over 65 worldwide will almost double to 1.3 billion, and in 10 years' time, older people will outnumber children for the first time. Within the overall trends towa rds older populations, the most rapidly growing se gment is that of people over 80 years old: by 2050, the percentage of those 80 and ol der will be 31%, up from 18% in 1980 (OECD 1988). These changes have given rise to th e notions of the \"third\" and \"f ourth\" ages in the life-span developmental literature (Baltes and Smith 2003). This differentiati on of the final part of the 206 life-span into two separate phases is important because of the ch aracteristic patterns of gains (growth) and losses (decline) s een in the \"young old\" and th e \"old old\" (Kirkevold 2010). For many of the \"old old\" (80+), issues such as illness, disabiliti es, and experiences of loss of bodily functions and social relationships necessitate the need for long-term care in nursing homes. The medical status of patien ts admitted there are often complex, with multiple diagnoses; they require different type s of medical treatment, not to cure their illnesses, but for palliation. Be cause of the numbers of elderl y requiring advanced care and treatment, knowledge about qu ality-of-life and wellbeing in nursing homes is becoming more important in research an d practice. Disabilitie s, experiencing lo ss of functions and social relations, and approaching mortality lead to vulnerability and distres: in particular, loneliness and depression are identified as risks to emotiona l wellbeing of older people (Savikko 2008, Routasal o et al. 2006). Rates of depression in nursing homes ar e three to four times higher than in community -dwellings for older adults (Jongenelis et al. 2004). Older people lacking social and emo tional support te nd to be more depres sed (Grav et al. 2012). Simultaneously, nursing home care increasingly targets those elderly with the greatest needs in terms of personal daily ac tivities, while serv ices supporting thei r psychosocial and spiritual needs tend to be ig nored (Vaarama and Tiit 2007). Additionally, the in-house nursing home daily life t ypically brings about loss of indepe ndence and privacy, feelings of isolation and loneliness, lack of meaningful in -house activities, which are all identified as risk factors for depression a nd thereby affect wellbeing (Konn ert et al. 2009, Meeks et al. 2009, Namkee et al. 2008). Thus, to promote wellbeing is a fundamental and a major nursing concern in long- term care (Drageset et al. 2009, Na krem et al. 2011). Finding ne w and alternative approaches to increase wellbeing is hi ghly warranted. Sel f-transcendence is a vital resource for wellbeing that could offer a po sitive approach am ong vulnerable populatio ns and at the end of life (Ellerman and Reed 2001 , Reed 2009a, Baker 2008, Hosh i 2008). Hence, efforts to extend knowledge about the measurement of self-transcendence, an d the relationships between self-transcendence and multidimensional wellbeing are needed to assist nurses in promoting wellbeing. Self-transcendence - a resource for wellbeing The concept of self-transcendence has been studied in various disc iplines, but is of particular interest to nursing. Themes of self-transcende nce are evident in founda tional nursing theories 207 (Reed 1996); internationally ac knowledged nursing theories su ch as Watson (1988), Parse (1992), and Newman (1994) outl ine transcendence integral to understanding the essence of patients' health, wellbe ing, and nursing. Holistic nursing ca re focuses on healing the whole person through the un ity of body, mind, emotion, spirit, and environment. Within the framework of body-mind-spirit as a whole, self-trans cendence has been c onsidered a central aspect of humans' spirituality (Quinn 2005, Wang 2011), and has be en related to spiritual as well as non-spiritual factors. Self-transcendence is a dynamic process i nvolving adaption to past physical, emotional, and spiritual distress, and as su ch, is a powerful coping mechanism: it is a correlate to and an explanat ory factor of pati ents' wellbeing. When experiencing difficultie s and significant challenges, self-transcendence can lead to personal transformation and provide wellbeing and improve d quality-of-l ife (Teixera 2008, Runquist and Reed 2007, Re ed 1992). The concept of vulnerability is one of the self- transcendence theory's basic concepts and refl ects awareness of personal mortality, which is an existential experience. Nursing home patient s are considered a particular vulnerable population, while transce nding many losses, illnesses, and facing death. The self-transcendence theory addresses an enhanced understandi ng of wellbeing in vulnerable populations (Reed 200 8). Wellbeing, vulnerability, and self-transcendence are the basic concepts, followed by thr ee major propositions. Th e first is that, due of vulnerability, self-transcendence is greater in persons facing end-of -own-life issues th an in persons not facing such issues. End-of-own- life issues are interpreted broa dly, as they arise with life events, illness, aging, and other experiences that increa se the awareness of personal mortality. The second proposition is that conceptual boundarie s are related to wellbeing (Reed 1991b). And thirdly, pers onal and environmental factor s function as correlates, moderators, or mediators of th e relationships between vulnerability, sel f-transcendence, and wellbeing (Reed 2008). Self-transcendence is defined as a \"characteristic of deve lopmental maturity wherein there is enhanced awareness of the environm ent and an orientati on towards broader life perspectives\" (Reed 2008, p.107). Hence, Reed (2008) presen ts self-transcendence as a major psychosocial resource of developmental maturity which allows one to overcome ego concerns and search for new pe rspectives and deeper understa ndings of life, death, oneself, meaning, and acceptance of the self, others and one's life situation, a nd thus wellbeing (Reed 2008). This idea is insp ired by human developmental theo ry emphasizing maturity as the developmental task in later life (Erikson 1950). In accord ance with this theory the 208 developmental crisis in old ag e entails integrity ve rsus despair, and is resolved by the development of inner re sources such as personal maturity and wisdom, whic h are qualities providing wellbeing. Consequently , the developmental process of self-transcendent maturity is stimulated by the challenges of aging a nd coming to terms with death (Dalby 2006). The central core of self-tra nscendence is expans ion of the self- boundaries through multi-level connectedness; intrapersonal connectedness (i nwardly; within the person through self-acceptance and meaning in life), interpersonal connectedness (out wardly/between; by reaching out to others or connecting with nature), transpersonal connectedness (upwardly; beyond the person by re aching out to a hi gher entity), and temporality (by integrating one's past and future into the present) all of wh ich positively influence healing and wellbeing (Reed 1997, Reed 2008, Coward an d Reed 1996).

Research on self-trans cendence and wellbeing Early studies by Reed (1986, 1991a , 1989) involving people aged 80-100 years indicate a significant invers e relationship between se lf-transcendence and depr ession, resu lts supported in later and recent studies (Klaas 1998, Hsu 2009, Haugan a nd interpersonal expr essions of self-trans cendence are positively related to emotional wellbeing, health, and function ing in adults confronting pe rsonal mortality because of advanced age and/or chroni c illness (Coward and Reed 1996, Ne ill 2002, Baker 2008, Nygren et al. 2005, Mellors et al. 1997, Upchurch and Muller 2005). Self-transcendence is 209 linked to wellbeing in a variety of populations (Reed 1991a , Mellors et al. 1997, Ellerman and Reed 2001, Hunnibell et al . 2008, Bickerstaff et al. 2003 ), and has been previously examined among vulnerable groups, particularly those who have experienced a life-changing diagnosis, such as AIDS (Mel lors et al. 1997, Kausch an d Amer 2007), cancer (Coward 1990c, Coward and Kahn 2005, Carpenter et al. 1999, Coward 199 0b, Coward 1990a, Coward 1991) stem cell transp lantation (Williams 2008), and in the homeless (Runquist and Reed 2007). Self-transcendence has also been explored in healthy popula tions (Coward 1996, Baker 2008) and in olde r adults (Reed 1991a, Up church 1999, Hoshi 2008). Still, research on self-tra nscendence and wellbeing among nursing home patients is in its infancy, as well as research exploring th e plausible causal relatio nships between self- transcendence and multidimensiona l wellbeing. A recent study of the factor structure of the self-transcendence measurement among cognitively intact nursing home pa tients, revealed a two-factor construct comprisi ng interpersonal and intrapersonal f-transcendence, as psychometrically superior to th e one-factor-construct (Hauga n et al. 2011). Interpersonal self-transcendence involves vari ables such as reaching outwardl y toward awareness of others and the environment by involv ing, sharing wisdom, helping, learning, and engaging in hobbies/interests. Th e interpersonal self-transcendence fa ctor explained the greatest amount of the variance in self-transcendence (ibid.). In accordance with empiri cal research in nursing homes, this is an interesting finding. Nursing home patients re port that rela tions to other people, in particular th e staff nurses, family, a nd friends, as well as being capable of helping others in the nursing home, are fundamental to their experience of me aning in the in-house daily life (Haugan Hovdenes vdenes 1998, et 2011). intrapersonal self-trans cendence factor covers the intrawork of self- acceptance, adjusting to one's li fe situation, physical disabilities and one's slower pace of life, letting others help and finding meaning in past experience s. This two-fact or construct of self-transcendence provides a mo re complex investigation of th e associations between self- transcendence and other essential human aspects. Self-transcendence and multidimensio nal wellbeing - interrelationships By utilizing advanced statistica l analysis such as Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), the plausible causal relati onships between self-tra nscendence and wellbeing have been examined et al. 2012a, Haugan et al. 2012b). The two-factor cons truct of self-transcendence demonstrates direct influence of interpersonal self -transcendence on social and emotional wellbeing, while intrap ersonal self-transcend ence relates directiona lly to functional 210 wellbeing. Moreover, intrapersona l self-transcendence demonstrat es total effects on physical, emotional, and functional wellb eing in cognitively intact nu rsing home patients (Haugan et al. 2012a). This finding is no teworthy, implying that self-t ranscendence not only affects nursing home patients' emotional and social wellbein g, but their phy sical wellbeing as well, mediated by functional a nd emotional wellbeing. A separate investigation (Haugan et al. 2012b) was und ertaken focusing on the interrelationships between se lf-transcendence and a three-fa ctor construct of spiritual wellbeing comprising meaning, peace, and faith (Canada et al. 2008). Directional relations were found between interpers onal self-transcendence and m eaning, peace, and faith, while intrapersonal self-transcendence related directly to peace, and signif icantly influenced on meaning, mediated by peac e (Haugan et al. 2012b). Additional ly, significant di rect effect of self-transcendence on depression is recently demonstrated in c ognitively intact nursing home patients (Haugan & Innstrand 2012). Thus, self-transcendence a ffects all dimensions of wellbeing, demonstrating significant implications for promoting mu ltidimensional wellbei ng among nursing home patients. Consequently, the pot ential for self-transcendence - and thus wellbeing - are important considerations in nursing home care. Nurses may promote self-transcendence by facilitating patients' connecti ons with others, family, a nd friends, and by stimulating reflections and connections to patients' inner th oughts and emotions. Fa cilitating hobbies, helping others, learning, and sharing wisdom could increase meaning in life, self-acceptance, supporting the individual to ad just and accept his or her situation, pace of life, and the forthcoming death. Self-accep tance and adjustment seem necessary for wellbeing and thriving (Haugan et al. 2012a). Because length of stay in nursing homes is long, much time is available to enter into meaningful relationshi ps and communication with patients, pursuing appropriate interventions to promote self-transcendence an d thus wellbeing. Hence, the nurse-patient-interacti on is a potential re source for connect edness, supporting nursing home patients' self-acceptance, ad justment, and facilitating mean ing, peace, and wellbeing. Self-transcendence and the nurse-patient interaction The nursing discip line's understanding of how a nursing process is manifested has shifted. Throughout the previous deca des, the importance of esta blishing the nurse-patient- relationship as an integral component of nursing prac tice has been well documented (Rchaidia et al. 2009, and Eriksson 2004, N\u00e5den and teren 2006, Appleton 1993). 211 Internationally recognized nursi ng theorists describe nursing as a participator y process that transcends the boundaries betw een patient and nurse and can be learned and knowingly deployed to facilitate we llbeing (Watson 1995, Watson 1988, Travelbee 1979, Eriksson 2001). The mid-20th century's rather mechanistic conception of nursing as a pr ocess external to patients and conducted by the nurse has been replaced by the view of nursing as a re lational process and practice (Reed 2009b). Reed (2009b) argues that good nursing i nvolves a process that is developmental, progressive, a nd sustaining, and a proces th rough which wellbeing occurs. Insight into the quality-of-life in institutio nalized older adults is provided, following a symbolic-interactionistic approac h. The perceptions of people li ving in care homes clustered around four main interrelated themes: sense of self, the care en vironments, relationships, and activities (Tester et al. 2004) . The sense of self, meaning in li fe, and emotional and spiritual wellbeing is influenced by re lationships, connectedness, and the caring environment. Wellbeing is influenced by communication with others, self-reflection of responsibilities, inner dialogue, and by comple ting unfinished bu siness (Mok et al. 2010, Haugan Hovdenes 2002, Dwyer et al. 2008, Buck et al. 2009). Most nursing home patients have few relationships left which prov ide dialogue, self-ref lection, and connectedness. The social climate in a nursing home environm ent is largely determined by the staff-patient-interactions that take place within it (Zar it et al. 1998). The nur sing home daily life is institutionalized, representing loss of social relationships, privac y, self-determinati on, and connectedness. Additionally, rates of depression in nursing hom e patients are three to four times higher than in community-dwelling older adul ts (Jongenelis et al. 2004), a nd the elderly w ho lack social and emotional support report mo re depression (Grav et al. 2012). Hence, the nurse-patient- relationship might serve as a vital resource of human involvement, interaction, connectedness, and facilitator of meaningful in-house activit ies for nursing home patients (Haugan Hovdenes 2002). Excellence in nursing care Nursing home patients are in general extremely vulnerabl e, characterized by frailty, mortality, disability, powerlessn ess, and dependency. Accordingl y, the interaction with staff nurses is critical to their self-respect, feeli ngs of self-worth, dign ity, and thus wellbeing (Clarke et al. 2003, Pipe et al . 2010, Heliker 2009). Nursing practice co mprises interwoven relational, moral, and prac tical aspects (Mar tinsen 1989, Watson 2007 a,b) where nursing care encompasses the patient's fundamental need s, as well as the patient's values and 212 experiences. Excellent nursing ca re is characterized by a holist ic view with inherent human and moral values. Thus, exclud ing the patient as a unique human bei ng is regarded as noncaring and amoral practi ce and 2004, Haugan Hovdenes 2002). Caring nurses engage in person-to-person relationships with patients as unique individuals. Profession al nursing care is defined by th e nurses' way of \"being-in-caring- healing-relation\" (Watson, 2007), all the while perfor ming nursing activit ies, in which attitudes and competences are inseparably connected. The caring nur se is present and respectful, sincere, friendly, sensitive, and responsive to the patient's feelings of vulnerability; she/he understands the patient's needs, is compas sionate to patients' different sufferings, and provides emo tional-social support and confirmation (R chaidia et al. 2009, Appleton 1993, N\u00e5den and Eriksson 2004, Haug an Hovdenes 2002, As muth 2004, Watson 1979, Watson 2007a,b, Watson 2005). Thus, nursing care as a moral relationa l practice increases patients' wellbeing (R chaidia et al. 2009, Gastmans et al. 1998, Hollinger-Samson and Pearson 2000, Nakrem et al.). Nurse-patient-in teraction can help patie nts to gain a sense of trust, comfort, safety, a nd enhanced wellbeing. Patients who are listened to feel good, satisfied and cared about (Finch 2006, Finch 2005). If nursing home patients experience not being attended to or treated w ith indifference then these patients describe suffering (Finch 2005, Finch 2006, Haugan Hovdenes 2002). Recent researches provide evidence that th e nurse-patient-interaction positively and significantly a ffects intrapersonal and in terpersonal self-transcende nce (Haugan et al. 2012c), hope (Haugan et al 2012d), and anxiety and depression (Haugan et al 2012e). Consequently, the nurse-patient-interac tion ourages both interperso nal and intrapersonal self-transcendence and hope among nursing home patients. Th e excellence in the staff nurses' interaction with the pati ents has a great impact on pati ents' self-transcendence, hope, anxiety, and depression and thus on their wellbeing. Summing up and Implications In summary, research indicate s that self-transcendence is significantly related to all dimensions of wellbeing among co gnitively intact nursing home patients, and also to their physical wellbeing. In the presen t sample about 55% reported fatigue, whilst about 50% had pain. Thus, to promote wellbe ing, knowledge about how to deal with physical conditions such as fatigue and pain are essential in nursing home care (Haugan et al 2012d). Moreover, 213 the nurse-patient-inter action exerts significant influence on both interpersonal and intrapersonal self-transcenden ce, hope, anxiety a nd depression meaning that the nurse- patient-relationship is a funda mental resource to enhance wellbeing among nursing home patients. Facilitating nursing interventions to enhance self-trans cendence possibly will promote integrity and wellbei ng, and prevent despai r, frustration, and suffering. Figure 2 portrays a summary of the above described significant interrelat ionships that are documented in recent research on self -transcendence among cognititely intact nursing home patients (Haugan et al 2011, Haugan 20 12, Haugan et al. Haugan et 2012d, Ha ugan & Innstr and 2012): Figure 2 puts together the significant relationships found by means of three different SEM-models illustrated as direct and mediated influences: = direct, = mediated influence. 214 Nurses and professional caregive rs are increasingly aware that good nursing care consists of more than the competent performance of a num ber of nursing activities. However, for many professional caregivers it is much less clear what this \"more\" means and what importance it has in nursing, wellbein g, and health. Research points out th at staff contribu te to nursing home patients' self-trans cendence when listening interestingly to the patient, communicating, and treating the patients with respect, by empathic understandi ng, and acknowledging the patient as an individua l who should be taken seriously, and whose n eeds are attended to. Since self-transcendence signifi cantly relates to all dimensions of we llbeing, and the nurse- patient-interaction relates to self-transcendenc e - it is reasonable to assume that nurse- patient-interaction affects multidimensional sense of wellbeing, mediated by self- transcendence. Consequently, educational nurs ing curricula should unde rline and facilitate caregivers' excellence in nurse-p atient-interaction and caring nur sing behaviour. In order to develop a more comprehensive and practice-based view on g ood nursing care, that really inspires nursing home sta ff nurses as they perform their daily care practice, more attention should be paid to nurs ing home patient's' perceptions of wellbeing and good nursing care. Further research to explor e these relationships among nur sing home patients and other vulnerable populations as well as chronically ill persons is warr anted, as is an exploration of possible self-transcendence base d nursing interventi ons aimed at incr easing wellbeing. As the number of older people incr eases globally and increases most rapi dly among those over 80, the importance of finding ne w and alternative approaches to enhance wellbeing in vulnerable populations is high ly warranted. Self-transcend ence appears as just such a positive approach. 215 References Appleton, C. (1993). The art of nursing: th e experience of patients and nurses. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 18, 892-899.

Religion and mental health in the elderly: An exploration of possible associations MARIANNE NILSEN KVANDE 1,2 & TORGEIR S\u00d8RENSEN 3,4 1 Research Centre for Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway 2 Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, Department of Social Work and Health Science, Trondheim, Norway 3MF Norwegian School of Theology, Oslo, Norway 4Center for Psychology of Religion, Innl andet Hospital Trust, Ottestad, Norway Abstract Even though cohorts and contexts might have so me influence on an indi vidual's religiosity, there are also strong reasons to believe that individuals tend to gain an interest in religion and spirituality as they gr ow older. The spiritual and religious aspects of life have been of interest to several theoreticians of devel opmental psychology and have also shown to be important for a healthy development in old age . Church- based social support and religious coping are important domains in the link between religion and mental health. In gerontological research, church-based social support and religious copi ng are found to be a unique facilitator for development of good ment al health. In Norway and Scandinavia in general, research on the rela tionship between religion and health is particularly sparse, and even more so for the older age groups. In the final part of this chapter we look at some of the \"ongoing\" projects on religion/sp irituality and health: we argue that new knowledge on the subject will influence how we care for those in the process of aging. Introduction Empirical studies on the associ ation between religion and ment al health is a large field within the psychology of religion. Since 1980, research on religion and health has grown extensively (Koenig, King, & Ca rson, 2012). The large body of evidence suppo rting a valid association between religion a nd mental health, bot h positive and nega tive, should however be further studied for two reason s. First, knowing that religiosity might se rve as an important coping mechanism for some people experiencing great challenges in li fe (hospita lizations, injuries, loss of loved ones) could help advanc ing the health care syst em from a mere focus on a person's physical as pects to include also existential co ncerns that might be of importance to the individual. Second, the re search performed to explore a possible link 224 between religion and health is, fo r the most part, conducted in USA in the Christian tradition (Koenig, et al., 2012). To implement research on the connection be tween religiosity and mental health in other parts of the world such as Europe an d Asia, and in other religious traditions, e.g. Islam and Buddhism , would consequently develop the knowledge base within this field to be re levant for more th an one culture. The objective with this pape r is to explore why religi on is perceived to be an important part of life in older age groups, and to discus s possible mechanisms between religiosity and mental health. A task of great difficulty but nevertheless of great importanc e is, of course, to define religion and spirituality. The two concepts tr aditionally associate diffe rently in terms of qualitative meaning. Relig ion is more often understood as organized an d collective and where formal doctrines are empha sized (Koenig, et al., 2012). Spirituality, on the other hand, represents the private sphere and less characterized by the o bvious, formal and systematic aspects. It is more emoti onal and emphasizes re lationships with fa mily, friends, work, religion, God, and oneself. Spirituality is addressed inward with little or no emphasize on authorities (Edwards, Pa ng, Shiu, & Chan, 2010). In the definition of religi on proposed by Harold Koenig and colleagues (2012), both the subjective and private versus the objective and social are cons idered. It is stated that \"religion involves beliefs, pr actices and rituals related to the transcendent, where the transcendent is God, Allah, HaSh em, or a Higher Power in Wester n religious traditions, or to Brahman, manifestations of Br ahman, Buddha, Dao, or ultimate truth/realit y in eastern traditions\" (Koenig, et al., 2012, p. 45). The mystical and supern atural are ofte n involved as are beliefs about life after deat h and rules on how to behave in social groups. The beliefs, behaviors, rituals and ceremoni es may be performed or held both within private and public framing, but is derived from tradit ions that has b een established over time . \"Religion is also an organized system of beliefs, practices, and symbols designed (a) to facilitate closeness to the transcendent, and (b) to fo ster an understanding of one's relationship and responsibility to others in living together in a community\" (Koenig, et al., 2012, p. 45). The concept of spirituality is defined in cl ose association with religion, whereas the key point for both religion and spirituality is the relationship to the transcendent where the difference between the two is that spirituality ex tends beyond but also begins before organized religion (Koenig, et al., 2012). 225 It is argued that the concept of spirituality sometimes - and maybe too often - overlaps with secular concepts and posit ive mental health concepts (Koenig, et al., 2012). If the concepts overlap, re search is difficult to carry out sinc e the effect on the dependent variable might be due to some aspect s of the dependent variable itself. The relationship is predetermined by how spirituality is defined since it overlaps with posit ive mental health (e.g. meaning, purpose, peace, ex istential well-being). If meas urements overlap, a risk of producing circular and tautologica l research increases. Consequently, it is important to be aware of this problem when defining spirituality . Spirituality and religi osity is thus defined close to each other and with the common feature of the transcendent wh ereas spirituality is termed by a search for the tr anscendent as well as having discovered the transcendent. Koenig and colleagues (2012) di stinguish between those who ar e spiritual but not religious, religious but not spiritual , religious and spiritua l, and those who are secular. The mechanisms associating religiosity and heal th may be different dependin g on which group one identifies with. The existence of a specific association also depends on wh ich groups are being referred to. Even though an interest in re ligious matters is not limited to those of a specific age group, it is often shown that there is a positive correlation between age and religiosity (Argue, Johnson, & White, 1999; Wink & Dillon, 2001). The reasons for this are, however, not clear. Where some argue th at developmental changes thr ough the lifespan are associated with increased religiosity (Wink & Dillon, 2001), others hold th at differences in cohorts and periode effects have th e greatest impact on the correlat ion between age and religiosity (Schwadel, 2011). To distinguish between period and cohort e ffect, one can think of period effect as being changes related to specific cult ural and social events that affects everyone regardless of someone's year of birth. Cohorts are influenced by a part icular process of socialization, being unique for their time of birth. A three wave panel study was conducted to compare the e ffects of age, periods and cohorts (Argue, et al., 1999). The results from the study showed stronger evidence to support a simple age effect rather than both cohort and period effects. A prospective study followed a group of respondents over a 40-year period. Religiosity was found to be important early in life, declined in the 30- 40s, and inclined in the 50- 60s (Wink & Dillon, 2001). Some psychologists have be en especially interested in the development of religion/spirituality in late life, and the role that it plays. Erik Eriksson and his theory of psychosocial development suggest eight stages, each represen ting a conflict that must be 226 resolved for the individual to develop a particular strength (Erikson & Erikson, 1998). Joan and Erik Erikson developed a nint h stage of development with an onset in the last period of an individual's life, the 80s and 90s (Erikson & Eriks on, 1998). The ninth stage is indissolubly linked to th e changes in the physical body in which the phys ical body's strength is starting to diminish. Through loss of autonomy, th e eight stages from infancy to old age once again becomes a ch allenge for the oldest old. For ex ample, Erikson (1998) explains how basic trust is important for developing hope in the first stage of life. Everyone develops some degree of hope. Fo r our own protection we also depend on mistrust which is a counterbalance to hope. On the ot her hand, mistrust may obstruct one's ability to engage in loving relationships with othe rs (Erikson & Eriks on, 1998). The physical challenges of the oldest old are the sour ce of frequent mistrust of own cap abilities, and hope is challenged by despair. A healthy developmen t throughout the fi nal ninth stage is, ac cording to Erikson (1998), believed to result in gerotranscendence. Tornstam (1989) shows gerotransc endence to be a ch aracteristic in sa tisfied elders. It is a developmental state recogni zed by a shift in attention fr om materialisti c and physical aspects of life towards a mere internal focus. This may incl ude the following as stated by Tornstam (1989, p. 60) \"An increa sing feeling of a cosmic comm union with the spirit of the universe; a redefinition of the perception of life and death and a decrease in fear of death; an increased feeling of affinity wi th past and future generations ; a decrease in interest in superfluous social interaction; a decrease in inte rest in material things; a decrease in self- centeredness; more time spent in \"meditation\" . The theory of gerotr anscendence is also supported by empirical finding s. A review study was conduct ed in order to investigate empirical findings on spiritua l development associated with aging. The researchers concluded that despite the lim ited number of the studies revi ewed there seems to be some evidence of a development towards gerotranscendence in old age (Dalby, 2006). Parts of the holistic approach to development towards ge rotranscendence in old age are the aspects of religion and spirituality. Even though Erikson (Eri kson & Erikson, 1998) does not explicitly mention aspect s of religiosity, she speaks of \"faith\" as a way to cope. Concerning the ninth stage, sh e explains that faith and hum ility are important when coping with the hope and trust that can no longer be taken fo r granted in old age (Erikson & Erikson, 1998). According to both empirical fi ndings and developmental th eories it seems plausible that religiosity/spiritu ality becomes increasingly important with age. The bodily change that 227 follows ageing challenge a development toward s positive health for the ageing individual. Since religion/spirituality and health has shown to be asso ciated (Koenig, et al., 2012; Koenig & Larson, 2001; Miller & Kelley, 2005), it may be that, for some individual's, religion/spirituality may facilitate positive mental health in old age a nd further increase his or her quality of life and well-being. Relationships between re ligion and mental health This area of research is subject to great contro versy for several reasons. As we have seen the phenomenon is challenged as bei ng too individualistic, with great differenc es in how religion and spirituality is de fined for each individual. Also, th ere are those who believe that the connections between religion and health can never be studied scientifically, and the major reason for this is the gr eat number of confounding va riables and methodological shortcomings within the field of research (Sloan, Bagiella, & Powell, 1999). On the other hand, it is extensively argued that the accumulati ng evidence of an association between religion and health does indeed exist; both associated with negati ve and positive health outcomes (Koenig, et al., 2012; Koenig, Mc Cullough, & Larson, 2001 ; Miller & Kelley, 2005). Religiosity is a highly complex and multid imensional phenomenon. This is shown in several important books within the field (Hill & Hood, 1999; Hood, Sp ilka, & Hill, 2009; Koenig, 1998; Koenig, et al., 2012 ). Even in their definition of religion, Harold Koenig and colleagues list 23 major dimens ions (Koenig, et al., 2012), and in the book \"Measures of Religiosity\"(Hill & Hoo d, 1999) over 120 inst ruments grouped in 17 Ch apters are listed and reviewed. There are also several paths where religiosit y is believed to in fluence both positive and negative mental hea lth outcomes. The dimensions of church-based soci al support and religious coping res ponses will be elaborated here within a life course perspective. These dimensions are probably closes t to a mainstream understanding on how religion can facilitate positive health and prevent negative he alth outcomes. Since the terms spiritual and religious are used interchangeably in empirical studies, we choose to use the term relig ious when explaining associations to account for both terms. Although the distinction betwee n the two sometimes becomes obvious (when, for instance, empirical research on church-bas ed social support is explaine d), at other times the paths 228 would be common for all categorie s of people (spiritual , but not religious etc.) as long as they share a relationship with the transcendent. Mental health and church -based social support Social relationships are impor tant to both mental and phy sical health (Cohen, 2004). Religion can be a provide r of social relationshi ps that are somewhat heterogeneous in terms of religious beliefs and values, a nd are also able of pr oviding a feeling of social cohesion. It may also create a sense of affiliation with a caring group (Moreira-Almeida, Lotufo Neto, & Koenig, 2006). Although we know little about how and if church-based social support changes in the course of aging, we have some knowledge on how social suppor t in congregations might be unique or similar, compared to secular social support. Some sc ientists claim that the support in church-based communities is especially close a nd supportive (E llison & Levin, 1998). In a study on the stress-buffering e ffects of social support on heal th, two types of social support networks were compared; religious and secular (N = 786) (Krause, 200 6a). The main object of the study was to in vestigate if church-bas ed social support (ver sus secular) would reduce the effects of financial strain on self-rated health. The result s from the study showed that people receiving social support from people in ch urch reduced the impact of financial strain on self-rated health, whereas no such effects were found for s ecular emotional support. The results were moderated by ethni city, whereas no buffering eff ect of church-based social support was found for Whites compared to African Americ ans (Krause, 2006a). Another study found that mental health benefits (lower scores on depression) from religious institutional participation was mediated by church-based social support (Nooney & Woodrum, 2002). Both negative and positive mental health outcom es have been empirically associated with church attend ance (Mitchell & Weatherly, 2000). It can be speculated that previous studies showing positive associations between church attendanc e and mental health outcomes is largely due to the intervening variable of church -based social support. At the very least, empirical findings as well as theoretical expl anations together support the significance of church-b ased social support. Neal Krause (Krause, 2006b) explains how a theoretical perspective presen ted by Trice & Wallace (2003) on the reflected self might contribute to the field by show ing how church-based social s upport might affect health. He explains that in the process of forming a sense of self, signific ant others are im portant. As a component of the self, the ideal self is formed through internal izing appraisals from others. This is effective when these appraisals are cong ruent with the ideal self . Also, we strive to 229 behave in ways that reflects the appraised ideal self (Kraus e, 2006b). Furthermore, Krause (2006b) argues that religion can pr ovide a set of values and defi ne goals to lif e that people perceive as ideal. Religion thus becomes functional in the search for, and in the attainment of, the ideal self (Krause, 2006b). Even though an increasing am ount of research has been accumulated which supports the significance of church-based social support to be unique and qualitative ly different when compared to secular social s upport, there are stud ies that have found no difference between religious and secular so cial support. In a study on older adults aged 60-93 years (n=93), the researchers aimed to investigat e differences in social support and emotional comfort. Both congregational and secu lar friendships were compared for the same individuals, and no difference on social or emotional support and comfort were found betw een groups of friends (McFadden, Knepple, & Arms trong, 2003). Since the sample contained largely White females, McFadden and colleague s argued that this could have influenced the results, knowing that research has show n that older Whites experience less spiritual and emotional support from a congregat ion than older African American s (Krause, 2002). However, the great advantage of this study is that the same indi viduals were compare d. This reduces the risk of possible c onfounding variables when comp aring two different groups. As individuals develop into old age, the need for deeper and less superficial friendship with fewer individuals increase (T ornstam, 1997). Since so me studies have shown that the congregation might be an important source to attain support ch aracterized by close ties, the elders who are part of social groups th at genuinely cares about others might undoubtedly receive great benefit from those gr oups. According to Krau se (2006b) there is little empirical resear ch on age-related change s in church-based soci al support, and more studies are needed. Mental health and religious coping responses Together with social support, religious copi ng responses are probabl y the most widespread conceptual understanding of how religion and mental health is associated. The two concepts are closely related, wher eas church-based social support might be view ed as a resource to individual coping responses. Kenneth Pargament is probably the best known researcher within the field of religious coping, and founder of that conc ept (Pargament, 1997). Religious coping invo lves drawing on one's religious beliefs and pr actices to understand and deal with stressors in life (chronic disease, impairment, loss of love d ones, divorce etc.). 230 Kenneth Pargament and colleagues (Pargament , Koenig, & Perez, 2000) defined five functions of religi on that serve a pur pose in everyday life, as well as in crisis. They are meaning, control, comfort, intim acy and life transformation. This indicates that religion may be a key role in the search for meaning, providing the indi vidual with a framework to interpret and understand experiences in life. Religion may o ffer a sense of control in times where individual resources are challenged. Religion offers a wa y to connect with something greater than oneself to experience comfort. It also serves as a pos sibility to experience social cohesiveness, and finally it ma y guide people that seek chan ge and new significance in life (Pargament, et al., 2000). The c oping responses may be facilita ting and effective as well as ineffective and potentially dysf unctional (Pargament , et al., 2000). Pos itive religious coping reflects a relationship with God that is secure; it reflects feelings of connectedness with others and a belief that life has great meaning. Negative reli gious coping reflects on the other hand an unsecure atta chment to God where significance in life is less established, and a view of the world as unstable. The coping strategies may be expressed in various forms. It is shown that discontent a nd pleading is more associated wi th distress than are religious support- seeking and spiritual connection (Pargament, et al., 2000). In a study conducted on 577 elderly hospital patients, po sitive religious coping was asso ciated with posttraumatic growth (Koenig, Pargament, & Nielsen, 1998). Being an active agent in solving conflicting issues made it easier for the pa tients to accept their situati on (Koenig, et al., 1998). Several other studies have also tied positive and secure religious coping to various health outcomes. A study on nursing home resi dents (N = 140) showed that those who viewed religion as very important to them and applied positive religious copi ng strategies, had be tter psychological well-being than those who view ed religion as less important or applied negative religious coping (Scandrett & Mitc hell, 2009). Also, a st udy on the relationshi p between religious coping and well-being among th ree groups of Pres byterians where one of the groups consisted of 823 elders , showed that positive religious co ping was associated with higher levels of well-being (Pargament, Tara keshwar, Ellison, & Wulff, 2001). The body of research on the relationship betwee n religious coping a nd positive mental health outcomes seems persuasi ve, both in terms of empiri cal findings an d theoretical perspectives. However, in comparing religiou s coping across age group s there seems to be little research on the subjec t matter. One study c onducted by Derks a nd colleagues (2005) found that olde r patients ( 70 years) with head and neck cancer relied more heavily on religious coping st rategies than their younge r (45-60 years) counterp arts. This study used 231 \"The Utrecht Coping Li st\" (Radloff, 1977) whic h separates between fi ve different coping styles; active problem- solving, avoidance copi ng, palliative coping, religious coping and seeking support. The study showed that the younger patients relied more heavily on active coping strategies and experienced more internal cont rol over their dise ase than did older patients (Derks, et al., 2005). Conclusions Both theoretical perspectives and empirical res earch show that religion and spirituality may facilitate healthy deve lopment. Church-based social support and reli gious coping responses may be a unique resource in both dealing with difficulties and enhancing positive health outcomes. We have shown that so cial support in a re ligious/spiritual cont ext may be unique compared to other secular sour ces to social support (Ellison & Levin, 1998; Krause, 2006a; Moreira-Almeida, et al., 2006), and that positive religious coping may be important for psychological well-being (Parga ment, et al., 2001; Scandrett & Mitchell, 2009). We have also shown that little is known about church - based social support an d religious coping for the elderly compared to younger counterparts and the extent of age specific mechanisms. However, there are reasons to believe that, with age, comes an increase d interest in religion and spirituality (Ar gue, et al., 1999; Wink & Dillon, 2001 ) which illustrates that the spiritual/religious life of older individuals is an importa nt area upon which to focus. Older individuals are faced with stressors that may be experienced as great in both magnitude and intensity. The challenges they face are closely linked to physical decline as well as other stressors that is more common with age (e.g. loss of loved ones). This is why it is important to become aware of any subjective potential th e individual might possess that can help him or her to cope and to facilitate positive mental health in term s of greater quality of life and well-being. Unfortunately, there has been little or no research on the relationship between religion and health in Norway, and conseq uently the knowledge on this as sociation is also lacking for some specific age groups. The ps ychology of religion in Norway has been carried out mainly by qualitative research methods, but for the last five years or so seve ral research projects have been initiated using qua ntitative methods as well. When the No rd-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT) was performed for the third time in 2006-2008 (HUNT , 2012), it included items on religion together with a large number of variables li nked to physical and mental health, blood samples a nd clinical measures as height, weight, blood pre ssure etc. The variables of re ligion in HUNT 3 has been described and assessed for research in relation to 232 health (S\u00f8rensen, Lien, Holm en, & Danbolt, 2011). The fi rst study from HUNT 3 which investigated religion and physical health showed a signifi cant inverse rela tionship between attendance at church and bl ood pressure (S\u00f8rensen, Danbo lt, Lien, Koenig, & Holmen, 2011). Corresponding findings betw een attendance and depressive symptoms moderated by death of a close rela tive is also reported (S\u00f8rensen, Danbolt, Holmen, Koenig, & Lien, 2012). Likewise, at the Centre for Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU there are two ongoing projects on religion/spirituality an d health. One study investigates self- transcendence and well-being among nursing home patients. Th e other study also has great potential in exploring diverse hypotheses on religion and self-reported health/mental health. This study may also explore ag e-specific groups like the younger olds from retirement at 64 years to those turning 75 years. Results from these studies are already avai lable, and will accumulate in the future. They will also give more in-depth knowledge on how this research should be focused in a Norwegia n context, both conc erning the oldest p opulation and from a broader age-perspective. Even though hypotheses are stat ed and research que stions are framed in reference to a large body of research, it is important to acknowledge that this large body of research is mainly based on USA samples from Christian congregations. There ar e great differences between Norway (and other Scan dinavian countries) a nd the USA with regard to cultural and religious contexts as well as to medical tr eatment contexts (S\u00f8ren sen, Lien, Holmen, & Danbolt, 2011). For example, 40% of the USA population attends church weekly or more often, while the corresponding fi gure in Norway is 3-4%. However, it can be argued that despite great cultural differences in the scope of religion, the psychology of religion might be similar for those who do hold religious beliefs even though the magnitude of the phenomenon in Norway cannot be compared to USA. It is not about enforcing anyone to relate to a deity, but rather being ab le to recognize possible individual resources, and to take those into account in our care fo r others. 233 References Argue, A., Johnson, D.

School wellbeing among children: The dialogue and possibilities AUDHILD L\u00d8HRE Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, Department of Social Work and Health Science, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion a nd Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway Abstract Children's wellbeing is of great public conc ern and schools may provide an essential impact on children's welfare. Generally, risk factors ha ve received a lot of attention, whereas the promotion of children's wellbeing has been le ss emphasized. In this chapter, I illuminate factors that may promote children's wellbeing in schools, and I put forward a question on the significance of agreement in perception of a ch ild's life at school. To exemplify, I picture some children, use data provid ed by teachers, parents, and 419 children in grades 1-10, and lean on existing literature. Previous research i ndicates that the teac her may be the most important key in promoting the child's scho ol wellbeing. In Norway, we have scarce empirical data on interventi ons that aim to support the teacher in promoting school wellbeing, and therefore such interventions and related research are highly appreciated. Introduction What creates children's wellbei ng in school? That wa s the main question that I kept coming back to during my many years as a school ps ychologist. We observe d many factors that adversely influenced the chil dren, and the literature c onfirmed our observations. But knowledge related to protective processes, i.e. mechanisms that protect against adverse outcomes (Rutter, 1987) was sparse , as was the case for promoting processes as illustrated by Bengt Lindstr\u00f6m's Health in the River of Life (Eriksson & Lindstr\u00f6m, 2008). Therefore, I kept asking myself: Are we doing the right thing? Do we promot e a practice in school that stimulates the children in the right direction? And how can we best facilitate children's wellbeing in school? To search for answers, I gathered data on primary and secondar y (grades 1-10) school children (L\u00f8hre, 2011). In the following, I briefly outline the concept of school wellbeing, measurements, and relations to subjective health. Ne xt, I present a study to illustrate the 238 match and mismatch in reports of school wellbe ing provided by the children, their teachers, and their parents. Fina lly, I look at the addre ssed problems through heal th promotion glasses (Lindstr\u00f6m & Eriksson, 2010; Ra phael, 2010) and point to some possible roads to promote school wellbeing and h ealth among children. School wellbeing In the 1970s, there was an incipient wave of interest in children's wellbeing at school. Epstein and colleagues initiate d research on the quality of life among school children (Epstein & Mcpartland, 1976), and in Norway, the term \"s koletrivsel\" was discussed and studied (Hauge, 1974). The Norweg ian word \"trivsel\" has no ex act synonym in English, but 2009). Befring argued that the term included qualities linked to experiences like satisfaction (\"tilfredshet\") and wellbeing (\"velv\u00e6r e\"), and in addition, an active aspe ct (Befring, 1972). Here, I will use the term \"school wellbeing\" to describe \"skoletrivsel\". There is no general co nsensus as to how to identify the concept of school wellbeing (or \"skoletrivsel\"), and c onsequently, the wellbeing am ong school children has been measured by different instruments (St Lege r, 2000). A Finish team constructed an instrument to evaluate impr ovements on different domains in schools (Konu & Lintonen, 2006; Konu & Rimpela, 2002), but their model does not provid e a global schoo l wellbeing score for each child. Further, Opdenakker and coll eagues used a questi onnaire with eight indicators of students ' wellbeing (Opdenakker & Van Damme , 2000). Five of the indicators were related to academic issues (including learning tasks, atte ntiveness, and academic self- concept), two were devoted to re lational issues (social integration and relationships), and one indicator included general we llbeing at school. On the other hand, children's school wellbeing has also been meas ured by one single question (L\u00f8hre, L ydersen, & Vatten, 2010b). In addition, scales have been developed to explore the closely related concept of \"school satisfaction\" ngas, & Ruokamo, 2009). These scales have a minimum of three items, and like the measurements on well being in school, the sa tisfaction scales also differ in their thematic profiles. The construc ts of school wellbeing and school satisfaction have received general in terest, and it has been suggested th at students' satisf action with their 239 school experiences s hould regularly be include d in assessment protocol s of students' general wellbeing, academic achieveme nt, and behavior (Zullig, Koopman, & Huebner, 2009). School wellbeing and health Self-reported health is strongly related to life ex periences and this ma y be an important indicator in measuring the effects of stra tegies aimed to promote wellbeing among the children. It is well document ed that ill health in childhoo d and adolescence may lead to restrictions in daily li fe, including absence from school as well as sl eep and eating disorders (Roth-Isigkeit, Thyen, Stove n, Schwarzenberger, & Schmuc ker, 2005; Zhang, Li, & Liu, 2010). Moreover, children's perceptions of ill health may be linked to problem s later in life. It has, for example, been repo rted that somatic symptoms in adolescence may be associated with medically unexplained symptoms in adulthood (Hotopf, Mayou, Wadsworth, & Wessely, 1999) and also w ith depression and panic at tacks (Campo et al., 2004; Zwaigenbaum, Szatmari, Boyle, & Offord, 1999). Health sympto ms are often categorized as emotional (internalized) or so matic symptoms, and these symp toms have shown a high co- morbidity (Anttila et al., 2004; Brady & Kendall, 1992; Dufton, McGuire, & Balluz, 2006). One illustrating study The first aim was to assess th e association of child ren's self-reported sc hool wellbeing with their reports on health symptoms (sadness, anxiety, stomach ach e, and headache). Secondly, this study explored the concor dance among children, teachers, and parent s in reports of school wellbeing. Methods In this cross-sectional popul ation study, I used the self-re ported data of 230 boys and 189 girls in grades 1-10 from five schools. Also the children's teachers an d parents participated by providing information related to each child . The survey, from which the data were extracted, is described in more detail elsewhere (L\u00f8hre, 2011 ; L\u00f8hre, Lydersen, & Vatten, 2010a). addre ssed by one global question: \"How do you like it at school?\" with four response opti ons; very bad (1), not so good (2), good (3), and excellent (4). The significant adults, te achers and parent s, reported their per ceptions of the child's school wellbeing on a co rresponding four-level ordinal scale. 240 Children's health symptoms were measured by four questions: \"Lately, how often have you felt: 1) sadnes s, 2) anxiety, 3) stom ach ache, or 4) headac he?\" Each question had five response options; never (1), seldom (2), sometimes (3), often (4), and always (5). Sadness and anxiety were deno ted as emotional symptoms; st omach ache and headache were denoted as somatic symptoms. The associations were analyzed with propo rtional odds logi stic regression (Ananth & Kleinbaum, 1997) using sadness, anxiety, stomach ache and headache as dependent variables. Precision of the associations (odds ratios) were assessed using 95% confidence intervals. Correlations were analyzed by Spearman's rho. Test s for statistical significance were two-sided, and p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Results For boys as well as for girls, self-reported school we llbeing was related to a lower degree of health symptoms (Table 1). Among girls, school wellbeing was negatively associated with all the four health symptoms; odds rati os ranged from 0.48 to 0.37. For boys, school wellbeing demonstrated statistically significan t associations with em otional problems and headaches, with odds ratios from 0.67 to 0.59 (a ll p-values < 0.05). Table 1.

But the concordance between inform ants was low to moderate. The estimated 241 correlations, Spearman's rho (p-value), among responses were 0.15 (0.003) for children and teachers, 0.34 (<0.001) fo r children and parents, and 0.23 (<0.001) for te achers and parents. Table 2.

Furthe r, in dichotom izing the school wellbeing scale into bad (ver y bad/not so good) a nd good (good/excellent) school wellbeing, it became obvious that the agreement between children and signific ant adults was quite different for those with bad and those with good school wellbeing. Children who reported their school wellbeing to be bad showed high disagreem ent with significant adults and correspondingly low agreement; only 26% had an agreement w ith their teachers and 27% had an agreement with their parents. For childr en who reported their sc hool wellbeing to be good, the match and mismatch w ith significan t adults was revers ed, and among those children, 94% had an agreement with teacher s and 97% had an agre ement with parents. Separate gender analyses of the dichotomized school well being scale de monstrated a lower concordance for boys than for girls with bad school well being (Table 3). Only 20% of the boys with bad school wellbe ing showed an agreement with teachers, and 23% indicated an agreement with parents. Among girls with bad school wellbeing, 36% had an agreement with teachers and 37% had an ag reement with parents. For bo th genders repo rting positive 242 school wellbeing, the ag reement with teachers and parents was hi gh, ranging from 93 to 98%. Table 3.

Girls reporting good sch ool wellbeing had a lower prev alence of sadness, anxiety, stomach aches and headaches. B oys demonstrated similar str ong and negative associations, except for stomach aches. Further, for more th an 90% of the childre n, school wellbeing was perceived to be good or excellent either by teachers, parent s, and the childre n. However, the concordance in reports on scho ol wellbeing was generally low to modest and examined more thoroughly; children who repo rted good school we llbeing had an ex ceptionally high agreement with significant adults whereas children who reported bad school wellbeing showed low agreement. Strengths of the study includ e the population-based info rmation and reports from three sources. However, it is not reasonable to conc lude on causality b ecause of the cross- sectional nature of the data. It is uncertain as to whet her children's perceived school wellbeing, agreement with significant adul ts, or both have an impa ct on health symptoms or whether children's health sy mptoms influence the inform ant's perceptions on school wellbeing. The findings of strong re lations between school wellbe ing and perceived health correspond to well established a ssociations of school satisfac tion or belongi ngness to school health a lack of knowledge exists rega rding concordance in 243 reports of school wellbe ing. Hauge (1974) suggeste d that parents genera lly estimated better school wellbeing than their ch ildren, and moreover, children with bad school wellbeing might show lower agreement with their parents than other children. But to my awareness, no previous study has aimed to assess the agreemen t in teacher-, parent-, and self-reports of children's school wellbeing. Th e low to moderate concordan ce is, however, in line with findings from other domains, e.g. children's quality of life (Jozef iak, Larsson, Wichstrom, Mattejat, & Vatten, 2011). It has been argued that a combination of reports from multi-informants may enrich the perspective on child ren's adjustments (Ach enbach, McConaughy, & Ho Kochenderf er-Ladd, onally, proposals ha ve been presented on modifying the measurement instruments to achieve better agreem ent (De Los Reyes & Kazdin, 2005). Others have propo sed informant-specific reports to make the large variations in the different report s visible (Munkvold, Lundervold, Li e, & Manger, 2009; Offord et al., 1996). Our results may suppor t this latter view. Further in this chapter, the problems addressed by this st udy will be discussed from the perspective of health promotion (L indstr\u00f6m & Eriksson, 2010; Raphael, 2010). Promoting school wellbeing and health One research path has b een to study children's wellbeing in relation to th eir perception of belongingness to school, or their connection/bonding to school (Blum & Libbey, 2004). School connectedness may be define d as \"...the belief by studen ts that adults in the school care about their learning as we ll as about them as individuals\" (\"Wings pread Declaration on School Connections,\" 2004). Othe rs have defined \"school bo nding\" as the presence of attachment (an emotional link to school) and commitment (an investment in a group) (Libbey, 2004). Connection to school may have long term consequences (Bond et al., 2007). In an intervention program aimed at increasing th e students' school bond ing, Catalono and colleagues found that intervention was associated with higher levels of academic success and with reductions in school and social problems, incl uding violence, alcohol abuse, and risky sexual behavior measured six and nine years after the inte rvention (Catalano, Haggerty, Oesterle, Fleming, & Hawkins, 2004). Also, the influence of belongingness on health status 244 has been studied; school belongi ngness predicted health status one year later, but health status at baseline was not a ssociated with school belongin gness the following year (Shochet et al., 2006). Support from teachers may be of great impor tance in children's bonding to school (Catalano et al., 2004). Perc eived support from teachers has also shown str ong associations with children's school wellbe ing (L\u00f8hre et 2010b), 2005; Verkuyten & Thijs, 2002), and with later health behavior (McNeely & Falci, 2004). What happens in the classroom seems, therefore, to be more important to percei ved school wellbeing th an relationships among students in recess (L\u00f8h re et al., 2010b; Samd al et al., 1998). Typically, teacher support may comprise an academic compone nt related to the children's school work and an emotional component related to caring. In one study, the teacher's academic support appeared to be more strongly associ ated with emotional problems and somatic pain than was the teacher's emotional suppo rt (Bru, Boyesen, Munthe, & Roland, 1998). However, in most studies the two dimensions of teacher support are included in the same explaining variable , for example in stud ies of school satisf action (Samdal et al., 1998; Takakura et al., 2005). The need for dialogue The unsatisfying concorda nce in reports of scho ol wellbeing makes us focus on channels of information. Through ob servation, teachers le arn a lot about their students, and parents believe that they are well orie nted about essential aspects in the child' s life. Our results, however, tell other stories. Bo th in questions on school wellbe ing and in the perception of adverse experiences like being victimized by bullying (L\u00f8hre et al., 2011) the concordance among informants is surprisingly low. How then, might the child's message reac h the teacher or the parent? One answer may be through dialogue. Sitting face to face or side by side in confident surroundings, the child will have the possibility to tell about pleasu res and provocations, about feelings and thoughts. At times, small interventions may be helpful in lessening heavy burdens from a child's mind. 245 The school health services Employees in the school health services have unique opportunities to work with health promotion, and accordi ng to laws and regulat ions in Norway (Hel sedirektoratet, 2010a, 2010b) they are supposed to do so. In some di stricts, the school nu rses were trained to interview children by using a sc hool wellbeing questio nnaire (L\u00f8hre, 2011) , and the nurses met individually with all student s at school or all students in selected classes. Here we experienced that minor interventi ons were significant to some ch ildren. Sitting together with the school nurse in a de dicated room, a child told about his feelings of loneliness at school, and the nurse was in position to search for solutions. After a few sessions, the situation changed and the child reported that the feelings of loneliness had di sappeared. This example is meant to illustrate the importance of promo ting programs that reach out to everyone. The pain of loneliness was not seen in class, but in the dialogue with a trustwor thy adult, the child felt able to express his hurtful feelings. The anxious boy Working as a school psychologist I had the opportunity to help teachers promote wellbeing in their classes, which typica lly ranged from 15-30 children. In on e of those classes, I met him - the anxious boy. At fi rst, I did not really see him because he was hidden behind a haze of noise and trouble brought abou t by other students. After seve ral observations in class, I decided to do a half st ructured interview (L\u00f8hre , 2003) with each of the students . There, in a quiet room, he told me: He used to cry in the evenings. It was di fficult to fall asleep and he often woke up during the night becau se he feared the next day at school. He was afraid. What would happen in the classroom? Would someone hit him? He did not feel victimized by bullying; rather it was the uncertainty related to impulsive movements. It was December, and almost every day since A ugust he had experienced th e pain of a headache. One of the changes brought about by the intervention was to restructure the classroom. The anxious boy was now pleased to sit with his back against the wa ll so that nobody could hit him from behind. Vi siting the class a couple of weeks later I saw a smile on his face, and during the springtime, he sat confidently in his place. By th e end of May, most of the other students also re ported better wellbeing in lessons together with reduced loneliness and bullyi ng (L\u00f8hre, 2003). 246 Summary and implications We have seen that good schoo l wellbeing is rela ted to lower odds of ill health, and furthermore, our data indicate s that the concordance in repo rts of school wellbeing may be related to the child's self-reported level of sc hool wellbeing. Fo r more than nine out of ten children reporting good or exce llent school well being, teachers or pa rents had the same opinion, and among those childre n, the prevalence of health problems was low. On the contrary, for those children re porting very bad or not so good school wellbein g, more than seven in ten teachers or pa rents disagreed and judged thei r school wellbeing as good or excellent, and among those chil dren, a high prevalence of he alth problems was shown. To face the inequalities it seems necessary to promote strategies that include every child at school, and by adding pe rsonal stories, my intention wa s to demonstrat e the power of trustful dialogues in in terventions. Based on existing knowledge (Bond et al., 2007; L\u00f8hre et al., 2010b; McNeely & Falci, 2004; Samdal et al., 1998), it appears that the role of teachers shou ld be central in the promoting strategies. One challe nge will be to model interven tions to support teachers in their core activities so that every child is seen, and the teachers can execute fair treatment, caring, and academic backing. The other challenge will be to plan and link research to the suggested interventions. In Norway, as in other European countries, empiri cal knowledge is scarce on interventions th at aim to promote childr en's school we llbeing. In addi tion, it seems reasonable to further explore th e significance of concordance in reports of school wellbeing in relation to children's current and future health. 247 References Aar\u00f8, L.

Best Practice in Health Promotion The ability to gather and use relevant evid ence of 'what works', commonly known as best practices, is a key component to promote he alth and healthy livi ng conditions. There is increasing demand in all sectors across the rese arch, policy, practice continuum for evidence- based decision-making and accountability. Evidence in health promotion is important because society pays a high cost when interventions that yield the highest health returns are not implemented. Evidence is also important because practitioners need ju stifications for the decisions they make. Ideally, practitioners shou ld always incorporate evidence in selecting and implementing programs, developing polic y, and evaluating progress. This section provides both theoretical and prac tical examples within best pr actice in health promotion. In chapter 18, Lillefjell, Knudtsen , and Wist pr esents a pilot study that describes existing knowledge, research, and development needs, as well as the skills requ ired for counties and municipalities to put evidence-ba sed health promotion strategies into practice. In chapter 19, Lindstr\u00f6m presents views and reflections on co ncepts for health promotion practice - plotting a roadmap towards New Health and the Salutogeni c Society. In chapter 20, Jaastad presents two research studies concerning leisure activities, focusing on cu ltural participation and health among seniors in Trondheim municipality. We hope that this section of be st practice in health promotion is a useful contribution to the debate on the concepts and principles for health promotion practice. 254 255 18. Evidence-based health promotion - getting evidence into practice Experiences from a Norwegian study MONICA LILLEFJELL1, 2, MARGUNN SKEI KNUDTSEN3 & GURI WIST 3 1 S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag University College, Faculty of Health Education and Social Work, Department of Occupational Therapy, Trondheim, Norway 2 Research Centre for Health Promotion and Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim Norway 3 Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County Counsil, Steinkjer, Norway Abstract County and local governments are required to implement evidence-based public health programs. The need for municipalities to become skilled in implementing policies and translating plans into effective ac tions has been highlighted in political visions , international directives and agreements, as well as in national policies. Based on qualitative and quantitative data, this pilot study describes ex isting knowledge, research, and development needs, as well as the skills required for c ounties and municipalities to put evidence-based health promotion strategies into practice. Introduction Public health research and prac tice are credited with several notable achievements, including gains in life expectancy (The Norwegian Directorate of Health, 2010). A la rge part of this increase is the result of sa fer water and food supplies, se wage treatment and disposal, discouragement of tobacco use, injury prevention, co ntrol of infectious disease, and other population based interventions (The Norwegian Directorate of Healt h, 2010). Despite these successes, many additional opportuni ties to improve public health remain. With better living conditions and economic growt h, we see a changed clinical picture with more complex problems that require a diffe rent approach in practice as well as in research. Political visions and principl es of health promotion as outlined in WHO directives, international agreements, and national policies , suggest that increase d efforts in health promotion move from a 'repai r' to 'prevention' model (W HO, 1986; Tones & Green, 2004; Barry, Allegrante, Lamarre et al ., 2009). The adoption of evidence-based strategies has been recommended in order to achie ve international and national objectives for improvements in 256 population health, (WHO 1986, To nes & Green, 2004: Ba rry, Allegrante, Lamarre et al., 2009; White paper nr 20, 2006-2007). Due to the new public h ealth act (Prop 90L, 2010 -2011), county and local governments are now required to implement evidence-based publ ic health programs. County governments are given the task of ensuring the overall the health and living cond itions of the population as well as the re lated factors and tr ends in the envi ronment and local communities, while municipalities are given gr eater responsibility for solving local health problems. There is a particular focus on the role that commun ity structures such as local services, public transp ortation, healthy food, a ffordable housing, and community activities promoting health play in the promotion of health (Mittelmark & Hauge, 2003; White paper nr 20, 2006-2007; White pa per nr 47, 2008-2009). Based on these political vi sions and principles of he alth promotion (WHO 1986; Barry et al., 2009; Prop 90L, 2010-2 011), there is a need for municipalities to become skilled in implementing policies and translating plans in to effective actions ta ilored to the social, cultural, economic, and political context and realitie s of local population groups and settings (Mittelmark & Hauge, 2003; White paper nr 47, 2008- 2009). Ideally, public health practitioners should always in corporate evidence in select ing and implementing programs, developing policy, and evalua ting progress (Brownson, Gurney & Land, 1999; Brownson, Fielding & Mayl ahn, 2009). The question of evidence in public health and health promotion The concept of health pr omotion is based on the assumption th at human nature is heterostatic rather than homeostatic, a statement that is in accordance with the salutogenic orientation (Antonovsky, 1979; 198 7; 1996). Its practice involves not only the question of which individual factors lead to poor health, but also a strong focu s on the interactions between people and the societal structures in whic h they function (Mackenb ach, Van Den Bos, Van De Mheen et al., 1994; Marmot 2000; 2011; Wilkinson & Ma rmot, 2005). Besides focusing on human resources, the c ontextual conditions of living situations are al so addressed (Davis, Nutley & Smith, 2000; Speller, Wimbush & Mo rgan, 2005; Brownson et al., 2009; Raphael, 2010). The ability to gather and us e relevant evidence of 'what works', commonly known as best practices, is a key com ponent of a municipality's capa city to promote healthy living conditions (Davies et al., 2000). There is increasing dema nd in all sectors across the 257 research, policy, practi ce continuum for evidence-based decision-making and accountability. However, the question of what constitutes appropriate ev idence in health promotion and public health is an ongoing debate . Evidence in its broadest sens e includes everything that is used to determine or dem onstrate the truth of an as sertion (www.wikipedia.no). Some might argue that the origins of evidence based health promo tion and public health lie in the evidence-bas ed movement in health care. Unlike evidence- based public health, evidence-based medicine has been well defined and it s processes developed in the last decades (Egger, Davey, Sm ith, & Altman, 2001). Primary re search based on randomized controlled trails (RCT) is ba sed on the assumption that the stronger the evidence, the more powerful its influence on practice should be (Speller et al., 2005). This has created a hierarchy of research designs. However the pre-eminence of RCT method is controversial when applied to health promotion and wide r public health interv ention. Although RCT is recognized for providing the best possible information about e ffectiveness when the research design is appropriate to the intervention type (M acIntyre, Chalmers, Horton et al., 2001), RCT has been found to be an inappropriate research de sign for evaluating complex community-based public health intervention s (Nutbeam, 1998). There have been several attempts to define evidence-based public he alth. At the moment, there appears to be a consensus among investigators a nd public health leaders that a combination of scientific evidence and values, resources, and contextual factors should be taken into account in decision-making processes (Spe ller et al., 2005; Browni ng, 2009; Raphael, 2010). Evidence in health promoti on is important because soci ety pays a high cost when interventions that yield the hi ghest health returns are not im plemented (Brownson et al., 2009). Evidence is also important because practi tioners need justificat ions for the decisions they make (Raphael, 2000). Ac cording to the third elemen t in The Population Health Template Working Tool (Strateg ic Policy Directorate of the Population and Public Health Branch, Canada, 2001; Raphael 2010), evidence-based de cisions should: 1. Use the best evidence available at all st ages of policy and program development 2. Explain criteria for including or excluding specific evidence 3. Draw on a variety of data 4. Generate data through mixed research methods 5. Identify and assess interv entions for effectiveness 6. Disseminate research findings and facilitate policy uptake 258 Therefore, evidence on health status, the dete rminants of health, and the effectiveness of intervention should be used to assess health, identify priorities, and develop strategies to improve health (Strategic Poli cy Directorate of the Populati on and Public Health Branch, Canada, 2001; Ra phael, 2010). Aim The study described here aimed to identify existing knowledg e as well as the research, development needs, and skills needed for counties and municipa lities to put evidence-based health promotion into practice. Methods The study was carried out in coll aboration between rese arch institutions a nd county and local governments. Databases and regional/local initiatives In order to identify existing knowledge, research, and develo pment needs, as well as the skills needed in county and municipal agen cies, available data fr om databases on public health, regional and local init iatives in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Count y, and opportunities related to the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag he alth survey (HUNT) were identified and systemized (Holmen, Midthjell, Kr\u00fcger, et al., 2003). Focus group discussions In addition, focus group discussi ons (Kreuger & Casey, 2009) wi th public health leaders and/or leaders with or ganizational and policy responsibilities were pe rformed in order to clarify and illuminate the subject area. The participants in the fo cus group discussions were asked about their knowledge, op inions, beliefs, and attitu des towards the concept of evidence-based public health. Questions were as ked in an interactive group setting in which participants were free to talk with other gr oup members. A semi-str uctured interview guide was used to promote di scussions related to th e following themes: Perspectives on the concep t of public health and public health practice Perspectives on the concept of evidence-based public health Required competencies in evidence-bas ed public health development Four focus group discussions wi th 5 to 6 participants per discussion were performed, for a total of 22 partic ipants. The durations of the focus group discussions ranged from one to two hours. The participants represented the following de partments/agencies: culture, 259 health, community planning /structures, research, and policy. The participants were invited in order to provide a cross-secti on of interdisciplinar y expertise. Particip ation was voluntary, and data was anonymized. Al l interviews were transcri bed and coded. Analysis was empirically driven (Charmaz, 2006). Keywords were used to iden tify concurrent themes that emerged in the focus group disc ussions (Babour, 2007). Data were then organized in order to clarify similarities and differences in the da ta between the informants and across focus groups. Results Available public health data - regional and local initiatives In the county or municipal contex t, access to health data is not characterized as a barrier to health promotion. Rather, lack of competency in selecting what data is most relevant to the public health context re presents the largest ba rrier. There is, however, a need for data that illuminate the relationship between various health indicators and other in fluencing factors. In addition, the study shows that emphasis is placed on disease indicators rather than on indicators that promote health. Data from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Survey (HUNT) prov ides an overview of the health of the population and health trends over time. HUNT data make it possi ble to develop municipal profiles and examine trends in the development of each municipality in Nord- Tr\u00f8ndelag County. HUNT data also point out specific health-promoting factors as well as health challenges within municipa lities. Such data indicate poten tial areas that may be better targeted by policy. Moreover, this study shows that regional and local init iatives, as well as both structural and general prio rities, have knowledge-based prof iles with the clear goals of competence building and in ter-agency and cross-sect oral collaboration. Focus group discussions The following themes emerged from the an alyses of the focus group discussions as particularly relevant when translating eviden ce into public health: Stakeholders and settings; Competencies: From knowledge to action - how to make it work; Interaction between stakeholders and de cision makers. The focus group discussions highlighted the need for, as well as the potential challenges related to, interdiscipl inary and cross-sectoral expertise in public health practices. A forum across sectors was proposed as a potentially effectiv e means to promote 260 collaboration in developing a nd implementing evidence-based health promotion and public health strategies. In the focus group discussions there was a consensus among the participants that evidence-based practice combines the use of the best available scientific evidence, the experience and expertise of the practitioners, as we ll as users' competence. The importance of taking into account va lues, resources, and situational co ntexts in decisi on-making was also discussed. The participants in the focus groups pointed out that there is considerable knowledge about risk factors, but less knowledge about health-p romoting factors and how to convert such knowledge in to targeted measures. Some of the participants argued that we lack knowledge about the causes of health and disease as well as knowle dge of effective intervention and implementation strategies. Lack of knowledge about politi cal processes and how to get pol iticians to use evidence in policy decisions was raised as another potential barrier to progress. The focus group discussions additionally concentr ated on the challenges related to progressing from obtaining knowledge to intervention desi gn, implementation, and adap tion. Political challenges, funding challenges, and challenge s related to competencies, as well as the need for work- force training, were all themes discussed as critical in the im plementation of evidence-based practices in public health. The following strengths and barriers suppo rting or hindering th e implementation of evidence-based practices in health promotion and public h ealth emerged from the focus group discussions: Strengths: Strong regional and local political foundation Availability of health data (national, regi onal, and local) Availability of necessary skills in counties and research sectors to support municipalities Considerable expertis e of practitioners Barriers: Lack of knowledge about effective interventions a nd how to impl ement these interventions - How to best interpret the results Scientific skills Using data and informati on systems systematically 261 Systematic planning Conducting sound evaluations Cross-sectoral communication Workforce training needs - competencies required Demonstrating to decision make rs that health promotion works and is an effective strategy in public health Making policy makers awar e of research results In other words, clearly defi ned access to data gives a good overview of the health of the population. However, knowledge about the eff ects of interventions and the measurement processes used, as well as know ledge of the political proce sses guiding decision-making were described as inadequate . Progressing from knowledge to the use of ev idence-based approaches was described as particularly challenging. Discussion This study aimed to identify ex isting knowledge, research, and development needs, as well as the skills needed by counties and municipa lities to implement ev idence-based health promotion. Within the health promotion field ther e is an understandi ng of the complex relationship between context a nd behaviour, and the necessity of influencing systems and structures as well as individuals to promote ch ange (Davis et al., 2000 ; Speller et al., 2005; Brownson et al., 2009; Ra phael, 2010). This study shows, in line with political visions and principles of health promoti on as outlined in di rectives, international agreements, and national policies (WHO, 1986; Prop 90L, 2010-2011), th at increased effo rts in evidence- based health promotion is nece ssary for regional and local in itiatives. The political vision and principles of heal th promotion require skilled employe es on the municipa l level capable of implementing policies and tr anslating plans into effective actions (Brownson et al., 2009). The present study highlight ed several points of f acilitation as well as barriers to making use of the best available evidence in a public health context. Among the strengths recognized in the present study were first and foremost the accesses to national, regional, a nd local data on public health, as well as a strong political foundation. Moreover, the expert ise of public health practi tioners was mentioned as a regional and local strength. Ac cording to Brownson et al., 20 09, public health practitioners should always incorporate evid ence in selecting and impl ementing programs, developing 262 policies, and evaluating progress . This requires scientific skills, which are not necessary competences that practitioners pos sess (Speller et al., 2005). Collaboration with the research sector is therefore necessary to meet the requirements of evidence -based public health practice, indicating th at the relationship between research and practice needs to be mediated. Several barriers to the implem entation of evidence- based public health were identified in the present study. These are the political e nvironment, the competen cies required, cross- sectoral collaboration, systematic planning, implementati on strategies, and decision-making. These barriers indicate the need for a national initiative to facilitate kno wledge exchanges among practitioners, policy-maker s, and researchers about evid ence-based health promotion and public health. There appears, however, to be a consensus am ong researchers and public health leaders that a combination of scientific evidence and values, re sources, and contexts should be taken into account in decision making (Speller et al., 2005; Browning, 2009; Raphael, 2010), as well as in evaluating complex commun ity-based public health interventions (Nutbeam, 1998; Pa wson, 2006; Gray & Ison, 2009). It is therefore of great importance to develop and publish national consensus guidelines (including evidence-b ased criteria, values, beliefs, and practical experience) for the implementation of evidence-based practices so that the existing evidence base can be transferred into practice. Such a consensus would also contribu te by giving practitioners the justifications they need for the decisions they make (Raphael, 2000). It is, however, important to remember that be st practice approaches, models , and available evidence are dynamic and ever-changing. Evidence on health status, the determinants of health, and the effectiveness of intervention should be used to assess health, identify prioriti es, and develop strategies to improve health (Strategic Poli cy Directorate of the Populati on and Public Health Branch, Canada, 2001; Raphael, 2010). Th is requires, according to th e participants in the focus discussions, enhanced communicatio n and collaboration among key stakeholders involved in evidence-based practices like research, policy, and practice, in or der to provide a standardized approach fo r identifying and classi fying best practices. In order to move from intervention decisions based on short-term oppor tunities and lack of systematic planning, greater review of the best evid ence regarding effective interventions in the implementation of best practices must occur, a nd increased cooperation between the research and public health management sectors is require d (Tones & Green, 2004; Davis et al., 2000; The Norwegian Directorate of Health, 2010). 263 Limitations of this study The selection of partic ipants for the focus group discussion s may have affect ed the type of information that emerged. The participants repr esented a strategic samp le selected on the basis that the informants posse ssed broad cross-sectoral expe rtise in the fi eld of public health. The question of whether those who were selected were those wh o were best suited to participate in the discussions can of course be problematized . A different group composition could have given different results. The number of participants in each group might also have influenced the results. Some of the particip ants might have taken too much of the time available for discussions, meani ng that other participants had less time available to express their opinions. Furthermore, th e design of the interview guide probably influenced the type of information that emerged. Conclusion Regional and local initiatives have sufficien t data to make evidence-based decisions. Decisions about program and pol icy interventions/approaches s hould include ev idence-based criteria, but must al so be based upon valu es, beliefs, and pr actical experiences. Communication and collaborati on among key stakeholders i nvolved in evidence-based practices like research, poli cy, and practice should be e nhanced. Moreove r, enhanced knowledge of political processes is recommen ded in order to promote evidence-based decision-making. 264 References Antonovsky, A. (1979). Health, Stress and Coping .

A journey to the Center of Health - some views and reflections on concepts for health promotion practice - plotting a roadmap towards New Health and the Salutogenic Society BENGT LINDSTR\u00d6M Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, Department of Social Work and Health Science, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion a nd Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway IUHPE Global Working Group on Salutogenesis Abstract The Ottawa Charter gave health promotion both a value and principle base, further five main action areas were described. However, the charter was not theory driven which has created many problems as of effecti veness and comrehensability. In this presen tation health promotion is contextualized in a salutogenic framework. Its central principles and concepts are commented on in a salutogenic perspective. Further the Health for All Policy and the expected outcomes of the Ottawa Charter Actio n areas are presented in terms of the global evidence base on salutoge nesis. The intention is to pres ent a salutogenic roadmap to health promotion as a guidance for future debate and more effective health promotion interventions. Introduction Health promotion faces many chal lenges both externally and internally. Being the \"new kid on the block\" both public health and medicine initially reacted rather bluntly to this new movement, adopted some of the ideas but continued to operate as before but their view of health did not change. Internally health promotion is a rather disperse phenomenon trying to cover all and everything, making it difficult to find a definite core for health promotion especially since it wa s not initially theory driven. No doubt are the principles in its key policy document, The Ottawa Charter, approp riate but demanding: st arting off with the activation and involvem ent of the population in health issues th rough empowerment. From there moving on to changing the environment and reorient the fo cus of health services to primary health, further, shifting from the in dividual to a contextual population approach, finally, setting up policies for overall health, health y public policies, re aching far beyond the 268 health sector in inter-sectorial action. Howeve r, it seems health prom otion never really got this act together into a full comprehensive ap proach. One reason is that initially health promotion was only based on values and principles and lack ed a strong theo retical basis. This has continued to be the Ac hilles heel of health promoti on making it utterly vulnerable and making it difficult to model, evaluate and find a focus for action. Indeed, on e of the most highly celebrated persons in contemporary International He alth, Sir Michael Marmot, was firm in his critique of health promotion in the last WHO Global Health Promotion Conference (Nairobi 20 09). He said: \"Having read th e background documentation on the values, objectives and intenti ons of health promotion, ther e is no doubt it carries a good argument for how contemporary hea lth activities should be de veloped - but looking at the practice of health promotio n, I say, \"Why on Earth are you not doing what y ou are supposed to do!!??\" So let me take the challenge and respond to a ll of this and put th e scene together in line with the original intentions of health promotion and touch upon some difficulties while trying to demonstrate how this c ould be carried out in practice to create a health promoting or Salutogeni c Society. First the issue of health. \"Health is not bought with the do ctor\u00b4s pills or the cut of the surgeon\u00b4s knife. Health is not only the absence of il ls but the fight for the fullness of life.\" (P.Hein, WHO 40th Anniversary 1988) Officially \"health\" has thre e dimensions: the physical, psychological and social (WHO 1948). This means th ere is a dimension for medicine (physical) one for public health (social) and one for ps ychology and behavioral science. However, th ere are good arguments to include a fourth dimension, the spiritual/existential, as suggested in 1987 by the former WHO Director General Ha lfdan Mahler. Some claim spiritual ity should be incorporated in the psychological dimension. My argument is that psychology mainly deals with psycho- emotional issues. The spiritual/existential di mension in my opinion is different than the psychological, and a wider a nd more substantial concept th an \"religion\", touching on meaningfulness a nd existentiality and the driving force behi nd a state like psycho- emotionality. This argument is supported by th e contemporary evidence base on the salutogenic approach to health. In health promotion it is important to find what motivates people, what issues are importa nt to understand what people m ean with quality of life. Here 269 meaningfulness is central as is known from salutogenic researc h. All health dimensions are of course interlinked therefor e discussions and inte rventions on health s hould consider them all - \"the whole\". Relating back to the Ottawa charter health is no longer the outcome or objective, it is the pro cess that supports people\u00b4s ability to lead a goo d life or enjoy a high quality of life. In a sense it is a change of direct ion health is here linke d to life and conditions that led to a good life again s upportive to a different directio n than if we focus only on disease and risks. It still seems the dominant unders tanding of health is strong ly related to disease and risks for ill health having the consequence that most interven tions and actions are directed toward disease and risks. Health as a resource for wellbeing is largely a neglected issue. We could talk of two directions fo r research and practice : a risk-disease appr oach and on the one hand a resource approach (see fi gure below). Michael Marmots re search that forms the basis for the WHO global efforts to reduce inequity in health focusing on social determinants of health is in its implementations in practice misinterpreted and by large only based on the reduction of risks for disease. As such, there is noth ing wrong with this, but the \"whole\" becomes skewed forming a classic risk-reduction and disease-prevention approach rather far from the objectives of health promotion. We need a synergy of both to create the framework for \"Next Health\" but the present strategies are still rather truncated not using health as a resource concept. What would be the conseq uences of putting mo re emphasis on the resource/asset approach ? It is noteworthy that Antonovs ky in his original salutogenic approach does not desc ribe the nature of health he de scribes what makes us move in a healthy or health prom oting direction on the he alth continuum and pr ovides his answer, the Sense of Coherence, the ability to use one\u00b4s health resources the GRRs. 270 Figure 1. The main activities and directions of health inte rventions vew health to the opposite of causes of death and disease (pathology) and prevention of risks for ill health. The other direction where health is directly related to resources and assets and directed towards lif e (salutogenesis), developing wellbeing, quality of life is much less explored. Participation Citing the Ottawa Charter \"the process to gain control over one\u00b4s health dete rminants\". This is the question of empowerment , getting the population invo lved in health initiating processes that lead to a hea lthy development. The origin of the empowerment concept stems from Paolo Freire who successfully mobilized wh at he called \"the ignorant and oppressed \" i.e the illiterate with new pedago gic methods in Brazil. He was successful to the extent he became a threat to the Government and was expelled from the country. Since then the concept has travelled a long wa y through different di sciplines landed in sociology and also found a central platform in health promoti on. Many strategies are needed to address populations because there are so many different ways of und erstanding and learning - ranging from an individu al perspective to cultur al, education, group and organization/community perspect ive or a mix of it all when addressing a society. Therefore the practice of empowerment needs many approaches where pr ofessionals humbly have to learn and consider how people, cultures, groups and organizations think, feel and act. There is sometimes a need to mix part icipatory and directed learning methods - it is not a question of one or the other. Learning is a lifelong proc ess starting in infancy th at should be based on people being regarded as active participating subjects (according to th e UN Declaration on Death and Disease 271 Human Rights). It is a dialogue between the envi ronment and the target group - be it an individual or a system (such as an organization) or th e big challenge, society. The role of the facilitator/teacher is to be th e \"enabler\" who abides to the above principles and makes it possible for the subject to build competence in a coherent learning process based on life experiences. The learning proces s itself needs to be conducive to constructive interpretations of experiences - one could sa y it should induce wellbeing a nd serve as a \"healthy learning process (For further details see for instan ce The Hitchhiker\u00b4s Guide to Salutogenesis ) The heart of the Ottawa Charte r - its values and principles. The Ottawa Charter (OC) contains both the values an d basic principles of health promotion. Basically it is built on what is said in the above text about participation - seeing the human being in context as an active participating s ubject involved in a pr ocess of understanding what factors and processes are c onducive to health and learn how to use these to improve not only the individual but the contextual quality of life a nd life competence. The role of the professional is to motiv ate and enable and point to constructs that ca n lead to improvement of health where the \"learners\"/systems ultimatel y can lead an active and productive life i.e a good life or enjoy a good quality of life. Thus \"lear ning health\" is of key importance here and should be conducive to life. Further the OC includes five central action areas: improving indi vidual skills/building the community approach, the envi ronment/ecology approach , reorientation of health services and building he althy public policy. Most of th e time these action areas are dealt with as sepa rate entities, howev er, in a population health promotion/ salutogenic and coherent approach it would be im portant to consider all at the same time in other words to work on a healthy public policy level in coordinated action shifting from the individual to a population approach, focu sing on creating health promoti ng contexts/environments, shifting from health care only to a community approach involving al l sectors and di sciplines and finally directing the actions to wards capacity building - developi ng health assets ultimately improving the QoL of the populati on. Can this be done? \". In terms of Antonovsky\u00b4s Se nse of Coherence theory (S OC) and the Ottawa Charter (OC) we have many similarities to the degree it is rather surprising nobody thought of salutogenesis when the Ottawa Char ter was written and constituted. 272 Figure 2. Comparison of the core concepts of the Ottawa Charter and the SOC theory As a summary the following points are made explicit: 1. The OC talks about health determinants while the SOC th eory talks about General Resistance Resources (GRRs) are available. 2. The OC talks about gaining control over one\u00b4 s health determinants while the SOC theory talks about manageability how to deal with a si tuation utilizing ones GRRs 3. The OC aims at creating conditions for an active and productive life i.e a good life or high Qo L while the SOC th eory talks about what makes life meaningful and what motivates people. 4. The OC is focused on 5 action areas as stated earlier where Healthy Public Policy binds it all together the SOC theory again talks about Coherence. The synergy between individual grou p and society/organizati on level is essential. 5. Both underline a contextual structural un derstanding of \"grasping the whole\" - a holistic contextual view of the OC acti on areas that create health promoting environments while the SOC theory aims at constructing a Salutogenic Society An important difference i s the fact that because the OC was developed by a UN agency (i.e. WHO) it also automatically includes an ethical code, based on the UN Declaration on Human Rights, wh ile \"good health\" or a\" str ong SOC\" can develop without any moral or ethical basis. Therefore the SOC theory needs to be combined with an ethical code ensuring nobody has the mora l right to develop good health or a strong SOC at the cost of other human beings or by de stroying the ecology of our World. If health promotion based 273 on the OC is built on a salu togenic basis one always have to remember this aspect and can be expressed in a simp le logic formula. HP oc = (SAL+QoL) HR H R = H u m a n R i g h t s The added value of the SOC theory and the salutogenic approach to health in terms of the four health dimensions, in term of the Ottawa Charter and in terms of the Health for All Polcy Most research articles describing salutogene sis and Antonovsky\u00b4s theo ry on SOC include the now classical descriptions of the characteristics of Antonovsky\u00b4 s two core concepts SOC and GRR. Because Antonovsky died in 1994 he ne ver had the opportunity to know what we know today almost 20 years later when salutogenic research has been carried ou t all over the globe for more than 30 years. It is now time to synthetize and look forward and describe the concepts in terms of what they can achieve in respect to hea lth promotion and the production of health. The first results of a large scale systematic analysis of this research area was published in 2005 (Eriks son and Lindstr\u00f6m) and later was defended as and academic dissertation (Erikss on 2007). The same year th e IUHPE Global Workng Group on Salutogenesis was esta blished and the web database was started (www.salu togenesis.fi converted to www.salu togenesis.hv.se in 2011). This means we now have rich data source on salutogenesis easily accessible. Therefore it is much easier today to make conclusions on overall and specific deta ils of studies with a sa lutogenic research perspective. I will here try to describe the SOC theory in terms of its outcomes as a response to Marmots statement mentioned earlier: \"What happens when we do what we are suppo sed to do in health promotion!!\" SOC as described through its outcomes This will be a first de scription. We do not have all needed data available, many areas have not been penetrated thoroughly enough while others have yet to be explored. However, this is an attempt to show the potential the saluto genic approach to health by looking at overall outcomes. To make this comprehensible I will use the objectives of the WHO Health for All Policy (HFA, historically proba bly the most important global public health policy). The Ottawa Charter on Health Promotion with its five Action Areas can in this context be seen as instrumental becoming the tool for how WHO wa nted to implement its HFA Policy. In the HFA policy document the objectiv es of health acti on was described in terms of: addling 274 years to life (AYL making it po ssible to improve life expectan cy) adding life to years (ALY to improve quality of life). Fu rther goals were sustainability , equity achieved through inter- sectorial and interdisciplinary action. SOC and age (Adding years to life and Sustainability (HFA; OC). Still lacking the evidence of a longitudinal st udy following SOC from bi rth to death we have as an alternative compiled rese arch made on various age groups over the globe and put them together. Understandi ng the limitations of this operation we still ca n say the mean SOC in general increases over age and we see the high est mean SOC values in old age. At present there are longitudinal studies of about 15 years that also dem onstrate mean SOC increases. This gives us two indications of the characteri stics of SOC: 1) On a population level the SOC grows stronger over th e life span it is sust ainable and 2) Atta ining a strong SOC is something we learn over time. According to the theory SOC develops through the way we deal with our life experiences and integrate them in our overall knowledge. The better we get at this the stronger the SOC. SOC related to the physical dimension of health (responding to Medicine, Public Health and the Health Concept: H). There is some research that indicates there is a weak correlation between SOC and physical/somatic health. We ca nnot discern these results. Ho wever, I find overwhelming results speaking in favor of th e opposite. This is the abundant research on various specific diseases and SOC. We can see that a strong SOC is positively related to peop le\u00b4s ability to deal with disease i.e doing better even when ill. In other words people manage most conditions of disease better if they have a strong SOC. My interpretation is that SOC is strongly and positively correlated to health as related to somatic disease. We can take almost any disease, even the major NCDs (diabetes, ca ncer, heart disease, ch ronic lung disease and mental disorders), and find that a strong SOC makes it possible for people to manage disease better than if the SOC is weak. This evidence base is convinci ngly strong wherever it has been undertaken. SOC related to the Psychological Dimension of Health (mental health, wellbeing and Quality of Life); (Adding life to years; OC, HFA, H). A strong SOC is strongly and positively correlat ed to wellbeing, qualit y of life and mental health. The same results are f ound all over the worl d, be the stud ies based on l ongitudinal, cross sectional or qual itative research. The strongest an d most convincing evidence comes 275 out of this psycho emotional di mension of health. A strong SOC is thus related to mental health, perceived he alth, quality of li fe and wellbeing. SOC and the Social Dimension of Health (Equity; HFA, H). Trying to get hold of Marmots health gap and studies of so cial position and health the evidence base regarding SOC is not strong enough. At presen t the structural political approach has a strong posi tion in public health wh ere one has always been trying to relate ill health to social posi tion. Vital and national statistics are collected and analyzed on this basis. What we completely lack are the statistics of wellbeing. We know that people with a lower social position are exposed to more risks and in many ways have fewer resources available (also such GRRs) that are related to socio economic conditions. However these groups are seldom described in terms of their resources. Thes e could be decisive for their health outcome. This ot her questions what to do with this knowle dge, how to promote change should be much more a question of health promoti on action. The SOC theory could in a sense be the software that for the socioeco nomic weak mobilizes health resources. It is evident we need to look at this mobiliza tion-empowerment much more carefully in the future. In terms of Paolo Frei re we do have an answ er and other recent frameworks, such as Bruun Jensen\u00b4s concept \"ac tion competence\" speak in favor of this. In re spect to gender and equity there is a general trend of males having a slightly st ronger SOC than women. Further, SOC seems to be more related to psycho-emotio nality than to socio- economic conditions but this means also you do not have to be rich to feel well and have a strong SOC. As a conclusion, this his means SO C operates beyond gender and socioeconomic position as an independent process if it is activated properl y. Further exploration is much needed in the future. Overall these issues have to be addres sed both from a social political public health perspective, we need the political will to allocate resources just as the Marmot recommendations suggest and in addition a salutogenic/health promotion perspective. Let public health and social polic y build the structures and le t the mobilizatio n of the less advantageous groups in so ciety with less resources a nd GRRs happen through health promotion and sa lutogenesis. SOC related to existentia l/spiritual health (OC,H). According to Antonovsky th e SOC construct as such had a strong foundation in meaningfulness which he regarded as the most important dime nsion of SOC. I touched upon this issue in the introduction on the health dimensions. The existential dimension is as 276 discussed earlier lin ked to quality of life and mental health research. At present there is an explosion of research focusing on how to achi eve happiness, positive health, mental health promotion, mindfulness heal thy learning wellbeing QoL thr ough existential questions and meaningfulness. SOC related iors and improvement of \"per sonal skills\" (OC Action). It was rather surprising when th e analysis of the international SOC review data indicated that people who had develope d a strong SOC also were more in clined to develo p constructive health behaviors. There also s eems to be a trans-generational function since children having parents with a strong SOC were mo re likely to develop positive health behaviors too. The same can be seen in many compliance studies on medical treatment a nd interventions. This means the appearance of classic negative behaviors such as of bad food habits, low physical activity, high use of al cohol, tobacco and drugs is more common when the SOC is weak and on the other hand a strong SOC is conducive to constructive behaviors. SOC and health promotion is mainly focusing on behavior s on group, population and co ntextual levels. SOC related to social netwo rks, the environment, like wo rkplace, organizations (OC Action). Semantically sense of cohere nce means intera ction and communication between at least two agents be it individuals, systems or organizati ons. Research into sy stems and organizations, communities and societies where social capital a nd cultural capital are seen as GRRs is still largely lacking. However the system approach is a merging research area also when focus is put on the salutogenic approach such as positive aspect s of workplaces. People who develop a strong SOC are more likely to adjust to tran sitions such as returning to working life after sick leaves aso. 277 Figure 3 . Outcomes of SOC related to Health For All Policy Next Health - Building the Salutogenic Society. I have in this text tried to discuss several ma tters relevant to the future of health practice and research. I have given it a name : the NEXT HEALTH meaning we have to take the full step into the paradigm shift of health promotion through the salut ogenic framework. We have had too many halfhearted \"new publ ic health\" and \"hea lth-renewal\" discussions ending up in much the same old perspectives . I am waiting for the \"new hea lth promotion\"?! ! Therefore, I have tried to show a direction, point out a nd penetrated some of the existing problems and touched upon some of the untapp ed potential to create the Next Health. The direction is to connect health to life rather than to death, disease and risk s. Starting exploring the health concept itself, explaining the core of principles , values and objectives of public he alth policy and health promotion thereaft er moved on to the salutogenic framewor k and analyze the scenery in a salutogenic perspective. I feel by no means I have been ab le to cover the whole area. We should be much more focused on seeing the similarities, call on the strengths of the various perspectives rather than only point at the differences. This is a much more salutogenic way of thinking, what makes thin gs work together in synergy to be more productive and effect ive and last and not least br ing more quality to life. To be able to carry on this work we need good research for practice and vise versa. We need to shift focus to constructive framew orks aiming at solutions. We need to use the science and art of interdisci plinarity to find synergies an d strengths in and between disciplines and systems. We still lack a pr oper vocabulary and scie ntific framework for 278 wellbeing and health. We need to build vital statistics based on population assets and resources and build contexts structures and institutions based on this knowledge. We shall never forget the fundament of human capital and human ri ghts, the noti on that the UN Declaration of 1948 is mainly focusing on the individual while the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child also focusing on strength ening the context of the child, in that sense much more in line with health promotion and salutogenesis. Vital to the success will be a constructive communication with Public Health and Medicine , to draw on each other strengths, the deep know ledge of pathogene sis in medicine combined with the system and structured risk approaches of Public Health and integrate thes e in the health promotion and salutogenesis frameworks. We need to trav el beyond these sectors and create synergy and strengths regarding human assets to make a Ro admap for the New Health. Figure 4 . The New Health Scenery: Medicine, Public Health and Health Promotion and Salutogenesis swim in the River of Life The Global Working Gr oup on Salutogenesis We are pleased IUHPE has set up a Global Wo rking Group on Salutogene sis that now has a core group of 10 research centers developing differen t aspects of the salutogenic framework in theory and practice. Some of the achievem ents today are: the systematic analysis of salutogenic research and the open access databa se on our website now run by the Trollh\u00e4ttan Center; the initiative of the HEMIL Senter to prepare a framework for an IC-Wellbeing to complement the existing WHO IC-Disease an d IC-Function. We need practice based institutions like the RCHPR and Wagningen Health and Soci ety Chair developing practice based research. We need the pioneering job on Mental Health and Flou rishing at Newcastle 279 and Emery and the shift towa rds organization development based on salu togenesis as developed in Zurich. We need li fe course studies a nd research on specific age groups like adolescents by Ben Gurion Univ and the Asset Approach group at NICE in London. We need good learning models and tool s like the ones developed at the STENO Center. 280 References Antonovsky, A. (1979). Health, Stress and Coping. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. Antonovsky, A.

Cultural activities as health promotional strategy LISE JAASTAD Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology Management, Department of Social Work and Health Science, Trondheim, Norway Research Centre for Health Promotion a nd Resources HiST/NTNU, Trondheim, Norway Abstract This article gives a short pres entation of two research studie s concerning leisure activities, especially focusing on cultu ral participation and health among seniors in Trondheim municipality. Both studies that will be presented in this pa per are part of an investigation which aims to reveal information that may be used to invigorate the number of pensioners participating in cultural activi ties on a regular basis. The obj ectives were to map knowledge about cultural- and spare time- interests and activities among seniors in the Trondheim Municipality. Access to inspiring cultural- and ot her leisure activities is considered a tool for individual and social health promotion, c ontributing to better life quality and sense of coherence. Results: These surveys should be in terpreted with caution. Nonetheless, they fall in line with larger national and international studies, pointing at enriched environments, participation and association in me aningful cultural- and social ac tivities as significant life quality and health promotional factors. A growing number of observations and re search studies point to the correlation between participation in cultural activities and a sense of wellbei ng (Cohen, Perlstein, Chapline, Kelly, Firth, Simmens, 2006). A num ber of Swedish stud ies have strongly contributed to putting culture and he alth on the public health agenda (Bygren, 2009, Bygren, et al., 2009) as well as creating a demand in resear ch and health settings for clarification of the possibilitie s of using culture ac tivities as part of effective health promotion programs (Knudtsen, Holmen , H\u00e5pnes, 2005). Major multid isciplinary research programs on health benefits from cultural ac tivities are currently being carried out at Gothenburg University/Sahlgrenska Institute (Bjursell, 2009). Although randomized population studies concerning the impact on health from cultura l activities have not been carried out in Norway, results from a broad long-term public health research program (HUNT) strongly indicate that the role of cultural participati on may be of great importance, 284 and deserves serious attention in the development for future soci o-political health strategies. In May 2009, an amendment was passed by the Norwegian parliament aiming to implement the development of research me thods on how to measure quality of life on a national scale as a supplement to GNP. Internat ionally, the poli tical interest for developing methods to measure national QOL is growing. Embedded is the acknowledgment that good quality of life prerequisite a healthy nation. Seniors are the fastest growing po pulation in the world. We live longer and women live longer than men. Differences in lifespan, self-reported health , age difference in marriages, (as elderly men te nd to live with significan tly younger wives), are among perspectives actualizing the n eed for more gender specific research. Global ly, in 2000, approximately 605 million people were 60 years or above. For the first time in history it is expected that the number of seniors out number children (up to 14), by 2050. By 2020 the number of \"single ladies 90+\", living in Oslo is expected to be 6 times highe r than the same group of men (Vangen, Jenum, Gra ff-Iversen, Idland, 2009). Men represent a minority in the senior population, in cultura l participation, and in research surveys. As a total, many elders do not participate in research surveys. We are far from having sufficient k nowledge about the senior population in our society, and most information incl udes both gender s. In surveys based on voluntary participati on, there is reason to believe that more women than men participate and the majority of all participants will be recruited among th e most resourceful, active, and most heal thy elders. This is also the case in these two surv eys, with a total of 308 informants. 91 (35%) are men, the majority aged 70+. The cultural activity program for seniors offered by Trondheim M unicipality Section for Culture, includes around 250 arrangements per ye ar including: concer ts, theater plays, film, literature, fine art exhibiti ons, as well as opportunities to actively participate in: these include choir, drama- group, danc ing, physical work ou t, trips, travels and nature walks. Activities are organized in cooperation with volunt eer groups, a variety of organizations/NGOs, public health care, and seve ral public and private cultural arenas. The Studies Study 1 In 2010, RCHPR carried out a survey concerni ng cultural participation and self-reported health status among elde rs (most of them pensioners) li ving within Trondheim (Jaastad, 2011). Informants were recruited among participants in Tr ondheim County's Senior Culture 285 program: recruitment to ok place from different practical performing activity, (drama, choir, dance and physical work out), and audiences (at concerts, art exhibitions, museums etc.). Our aim was to prepare the ground for a larger study examin ing possible links concerning cultural participat ion and health. Methods Participants Out of 600 approached with questio nnaries188 women and 48 men responded (265 respondents, response rate 42%). 20 failed to report gender . The mean age was 73 years. The highest education level showed an equal division within four main categories: primary school, secondary sc hool, university/college: 3 years and 5 years. Civil status was reported as 42% married/living with a partner and 56% livi ng alone. A vast majori ty reported social support as \"to have friends w ho would support if n eeded.\" Most responden ts commonly used public health services, composed of regula r, single appointments with a medical doctor/specialist and dentist. Administration With reference to demographical information, fr equency level and meani ngfulness in cultural participation, and basic inform ation on self-reported health status, QOL/SOC was in focus. The methodological approach wa s both quantitative and qual itative. A ques tionnaire was supplemented by six interviews and observati ons from choir- and drama- activities. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 18, incl uding Frequency- and cross- tabs, Spearman correlation test and Kruskal-Wallis H test for significance (a t 0.01 and 0.05). All information was co llected between August and November 2010. Results Within the group of informants the level of particip ation was generally hi gh for all activities included in the survey. The hi ghest attendance score was fou nd for those atte nding concerts, cinema and theater plays (88%). The sec ond highest attendance sc ore was for nature walks/mountain hiking (86%), fo llowed by physical work out/s ports (75%). These findings are in accordance with other national survey s with wider age- and time spans. Next in popularity was organization work (68%), followed by visiting museums and art exhibitions (65%). 59% participated in da ncing, playing music, singing and/or acting (drama group). Attending church se rvices involved 51%, sport arrangeme nts 35% and last, church member's 286 congregational activiti es 19%. The most commonly report ed frequency level (by 47%) was for going to concerts, cinema a nd theatre; this was 1-6 times during the last 6 months. Those engaged in physical work out/ sports (37%) train more th an once a week . For nature walks/mountain hiking, 33% reported to participate more than once a week. 32% of those involved with dancing particip ated more than once a week. 25% of all informants reported not active in any s port activity. Educational background seemed of little significance for most activities with a few exceptions. In acco rdance with other nati onal surveys (Vaage, 2010) visiting museums and art ex hibitions may seem more popul ar among those with higher education, and dance, seemingly more popular among those with lower education. Table 1 . Frequency rate for participation in cult ural activities included in the survey Activity % Consert, cinema, theater 88% Nature walks/mountain hiking 65% Dance 59% Music, singing or theatre 59% Going to church 51% Sports arrangements 35% Congregational work 19% Meaningfullness and self-reported health status; QOL/SOC. Of the respondents, 94% rated cultural activities as being currently important. On a 5 level Likert scale, 77% rated cultural activities as being \" very important\" or \"important\" in their lives for the time being. \"Since when/for how long\" has cultural acti vities been of importance to you, gave th e following results: \" Yes, since childhood:\" 36%, \"Yes, since I was a teenager\", 10%, \" since I became an adult\", 31%, \" since I became pensioner,\" 16%. The aspect of meaningfulness was a popular topic at coffee-break conversations during rehearsals and in interviews. On the question of what is most important, th e cultural activity itself or the social activity, both dimensions rece ived a high score, s uggesting reciprocal links. Although a clea r significance between le vel of cultural particip ation and health status was not found, results indi cate that cultural ac tivities stand out as po ssible health resource promotional factors strongly conn ected to good life quality (QOL) (Rapha el, 2010) and sense of coherence (SOC ) (Antonovsky, 1987). 287 Study 2 The cultural programs for seniors offered by the Trondheim municipality seem to engage far more women than men, the differe nce in participation being 3: 1 in our first survey. As a result an additional survey was initiated ex clusively focusing on me n. Our aim was to learn more about men's cultural and le isure activities, inte rests and preferences, whether or not the communal culture program is well known, and what coul d be done to increas e an interest in cultural participation among senior men (J aastad, 2012). Methods Participants Informants were recruited by the municipality Cultural Host, and thro ugh an advertisement in a magazine which is se nt to every citizen above 70 years within the Trondheim municipality. The total number of male informants aged 70+ is 43, out of which 15 participated in focus-group interviews. The age span is 70-86 years. All 43 are, or have been married; of these, 7 are widowers, living alone. Pr ofessional background: The majority came from different kinds of practical la bor and 6 hold a higher academ ic degree . Administration A questionnaire was desi gned for telephone- and fo cus group interviews. The only statistical analysis performed ( with SPSS18) was Frequency tabs. Three focus group in terviews, with 4, 5, and 6 participants, were taken. In one group all ar e members of a volunteer organization. For the other tw o groups, the participants re present two different local suburban areas. Due to challenges trying to find men willing to participate in interviews, the cultural hosts urged them to share their experiences. A dditional interviews were made with the 6 Culture Hosts (focus-gr oup interview), the C oordinator for Trondhe im municipality Culture Hosts, and with one representative from Trondheim Senior's Information Office. All interviews were c onducted in October and November 2011. Results The information gathered includes leisure time activities and interests, frequency level, and meaningfulness. The most popul ar leisure activities are care taking of residential- and domestic properties, pe rsonal hobbies, tasks and duties co ncerning other needs within the circle of near family and friends. Participat ion in a variety of soci eties and organizations, sport- and physical activi ties, a variety of musical activities as well as going to concerts, also 288 show a high attendance score. Out of 43 respondents: 33 answ ered \"yes\" to whether or not they know some cultural activitie s offered in their local area. 22 answered \"nev er\" or \"less then ones a week\" participate in such activities. The Trondheim Munici pality's cultural program for seniors is known to 34 respondent s in this survey. A lthough these cultural programs are given a hi gh quality ranking by many, th ey are also considered \"more attractive to women\". When asked: \"What is needed for you to want to join a cultural activity\" the core message in most answers wa s: Cultural programs (like other leisure activities), must be interesting, engaging and chal lenging and of high quality. \"Watching the TV-sports\", \"hanging around su permarkets\" \"sitting idle\" as well as being more or less forced to take part in \"empty coffee-tab le conversations\" was considered the worse scenario among most informants. Lectures and semina rs within history, politics, economy, new technology, (communication technology in particula r) nature, and culture, along with courses in wood carving, cookin g, and nearby lawns for \"Bocca\", were considered particularly attractive to men. To some, \"having an appointment\" seems pivotal for so cial- or cultural participation. Access to near parking is another important factor, along with individual priorities. Many claim to be \"too busy doing other things.\" Stimulating locations and environment was mentioned by many as a cruc ial factor for participation. Geriatric institutions and othe r locations known as \"meeting arenas for the elderly\" were considered \"not attractive\" arenas for social- an d cultural activit ies among healthy elderly men. Although some had attended cultur al events at geriatric instit utions, others claimed they avoid such places because it makes them feel depressed. Discussion Is aging a taboo of our time and culture? Thes e surveys and Study 2 in particular, raised several questions concerning how our society deals with aging. In spite of being well known, the interest to participate in senior's cultural pr ograms appears low, even among those who often participate in a wide range of other activities. Th eir current label: \"The Cultural Walking Stick\", is a name easily connected to \"old age\". Irrespective of age, many did not consider themselves representative of the target group for these programs. According to the Coordinator of Cu ltural Hosts, to be a pensioner, \"free from work\" is considered positive, whereas to be counted among \"elders\" is not. In general people se em to dislike age related identity marks beyond \"adult\". Labels like old, elderly and senior seem loaded with associations such as being out dated, weak, useless and of no inte rest to anybody. Could it be 289 that many, and men in particular, out of fear of losing personal identi ty, value and purpose, avoid taking part in any activity that bare mark of old age? How to advertise cultur al and other leisure ac tivities for seniors? To which degree does society recognize seni ors - individually a nd collectively - as resources? To what degree is variet y and quality made a priority when designing cultural programs and other le isure activities for elde rly men and women? \"Good-life factors\" The majority of informants from both survey s coincide with the theoretical model for measuring Quality of Life fa ctors from the University in Toronto (Raphael, 2010). Both surveys describe a group of 70- 80 years old \"super elders\". Thus group is active, well fit, with comfortable economy, and a joyous urge to keep explori ng all good things life has to offer. These are resourceful people, eager to le arn, to share, and active ly make use of their experience and knowledge in everyday challenges . Creative- and social stimulation is sought with engagement thro ugh membership and participat ion in various organizations/ fellowships, cultural- spor t and other leisure activities. All ac tivities contribute (individually and collectively) to a ph ysically and mentally enriched environment. Family, freedom and fellowship During the focus-group in terviews in Study 2, ev ery group, and in fact every participant, ranked family activities as most important, meaningful and giving. This was more important than several wealth indicators such as spouse, offspring, priv ate properties (house, garden, cottages, boat and car), as well as personal and economic freedom . Not to be a burden, to be independent and able to manage every day challenges are empha sized by many as crucial life quality factors, along with access and ability to drive one's own car. Driving seems strongly connected to male ident ity, to freedom, independency, and to still being in control of daily duties. In Norway 87% of men aged 65-69 and 72% of men aged 80+ have access to a car at any time (Hjorthol, Nordbakke, 2008). The impor tance of friendship is strongly emphasized. Within this circle, of family members and frien d-associated fellowships, is the comfort zone for giving and receiving he lp and support when needed. 290 Social integration, cultur al participation and health Growing divorce rates increases the number of elders living in single households. This may lead to lack of social partic ipation, loneliness, weaker ec onomy and negative stress, all factors that affect so cial, psychological and Sund, is needed concerning the interplay of socio-economic conditi ons and health risk factors in a life span perspective. Still there are indications pointing to social support as a considerab le buffer against diseases and psychological stress (Cohen, S. & Wills, 1985, George,1996) L oneliness and lack of social participation have recently b een given more academic atte ntion (Bauman, 2000, Barstad, 2000, Barstad, 2004). Alt hough results are not clear , there are strong indi cations that the risk for experiencing unwanted l oneliness increas es with age (Halvo rsen, 2005, Holmen, & Furukawa, 2002, Thorsen, 2005). An interesting gender differenc e is found, as elderly men tend to live with signific antly younger women (Nolen-Hoe ksema, & Rusting, 2000). Being single, feeling lonely may be a barrier difficult to break, a ccording to our informants. In focus-group-interviews, mo st participants more or less \"confessed\" th at they are not good at welcoming or even speaking to newcomers. Some had experience d how difficult it may be to \"join in\" among strangers by go ing to a dance activity. Old friends had fun. Newcomers remained outsiders. According to our inform ants, men put restricti ons on themselves by demanding some basic skills or knowledge prior to pa rticipation, and as result, many prefer to stay at home. Other given re asons for not attending cultural- and other leisure activities, is a lack of interest in earlie r years, and a notion that most activities are run \"on women's terms.\" Activities must be cons idered interesting and challe nging, and preferably involve some kind of pre-established frie nd- or family-based fellowship. Today's pensioners represent a pol itical \u00e9poque where socio-democratic egalitarianism and development of a strong national welfare state has had first priority. Norwegian citizens have enjoyed solid predictability and s ecurity at the job marked. Access to work, a decent income, material goods, educ ation, individual and colloquial security are also considered important nati onal health factors (S trand, Kunst, 2006). Over the past few decades we have seen a tend ency of higher cu ltural participatio n among working class groups, especially among women (Loga, 2010, Vaage, 2010). In ou r studies, the majority of informants are culturally and socially active, with small demands for health care services. Current interests and activities seem to have followed even since childhood. Over the past 30 years, social inequality has be en on the rise, and with it, a growing tendency towards socio-291 economic exclusion. The most reso urceful groups tend to keep th emselves busy with friends- and family-based activities as well as part icipation in various activities according to individual interests (Wilhelms en, 2009). Among repercussions of the \"globalized\" market economy are pressures on democracy and na tional sovereignty (Smedshaug, 2011, Brox, 1994). A continuous growth in so cio-economic differences is a fu ture threat to public health standards. In this perspectiv e, common access to stimulating and inclusive cu ltural arenas may be of crucial importance for fu ture public health strategies. Closing comments Although results from these surveys should be interpreted with caution, they fall in line with results from larger national and international studies, highlighting the importance of enriched environments, participation and association in meani ngful cultural and so cial activities as major life quality and health promotional factors. The cultural programs offered by Trondheim Municipality seem to be of great significance fo r its participan ts. The vast majority of informants live an active life w ith little hindrance from pr actical, economical as well as physical and psychologi cal health related matters. The opportunity to pick up on old interests after retirement seems to have contributed to more j oy, growth, social participation, meaning and purpose in life. Du ring the survey period for St udy 1, several conc erts and the like were arranged at nu rsing homes, health cente rs, and other geriatri c institutions. These arrangements have become quite popular, both among staff and se niors. In accordance with the \"Culture Law Regula tion\" passed by the Parliament in 2007 (Stortingsme lding Nr. 48), giving every citizen the legal right to a culturally enrich ed environment and access to cultural participation irrespective of social- or health-conditions , a great effort is being made to maintain these types of activities. More knowledge conc erning the use of cultural activities in health promotion may turn out to be of great value fo r future public health, environmental and socio-economic developmen t strategies. More re search is needed, including longitudinal p opulation studies, focusing on quality of life as we ll as on biomedical effects. 292 References Antonovsky, A. (1987).
