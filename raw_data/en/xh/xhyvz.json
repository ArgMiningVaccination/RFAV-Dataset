For many underserved communities - whether rural or urban - such care can make a world of difference. At Bastyr, we believe that everyone deserves access to high-quality natural medical care. Our dream of a nationally accepted natural approach to health care is not yet a reality for everyone, but every day , those in Bastyr's natural medicine community find opportunities to create a more healthful world for all. Be it through the influence of our innovative students, our altruistic alumni, or our experienced faculty , our reach in our global community is truly astounding. In this edition of Inside Bastyr, I'd like to share with you the stories of just a few of the individuals who are making Bastyr's dream a reality: Our Department of Midwifery faculty and students, whose progressive research project challenges the status quo in order to open doors to women of color in the birthing world A Bastyr naturopathic medicine/acupuncture student, 1 of 11 selected to participate in University of Washington's (UW's) Area Health Education Center (AHEC) program A distinguished acupuncture alumnus, who is blazing the trail for acupuncture care in the UW Osher Center for Integrative Medicine A guest at Bastyr's Mary's Place Women's Shelter Clinic, who has received life-saving health benefits through naturopathic medical care, and who is simultaneously helping to educate our students. Health care resources such as midwifery , acupuncture, nutrition and naturopathic medical care must continue to be available to all people and all communities. Thank you for the support you give Bastyr University , and thank you for reading our stories. Yours in Health, Harlan Patterson | Bastyr University PresidentS 2With health care disparities on the rise in the United States, the need for trained providers committed to improving patient outcomes is growing. Eleven naturopathic medical (ND) students are now the first cohort from Bastyr University to join the University of Washington's (UW's) two-year Area Health Education Center (AHEC) program. Open to students from all health care disciplines, AHEC is an \"interdisciplinary educational and training program that focuses on a diverse, culturally competent healthcare workforce that specializes in rural and underserved areas.\" A career path with unanticipated twists, turns and roadblocks One of these Bastyr students, Liqaa Essam Naser, ND and AOM student ('21), began her journey in her home country of Iraq, where she studied medicine at the University of Mosul. Shortly after graduating with her doctoral degree (MBChB) in medicine and surgery in 2004, growing tensions in Iraq influenced Naser's decision to begin her medical career in Bahrain, where she completed a clinical internship, a rotation and board certification over the span of 10 years. Her plan was to finish her neonatal intensive care subspecialty in Australia or Canada, but family circumstances directed her path to the U.S. It was here that Naser hit a stumbling block - in order to finish her subspecialty , she would have to submit her original diploma. In the years since her graduation, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had taken over the city of Mosul. The University of Mosul had been turned into an ISIL training facility , several of the buildings had been reduced to rubble, and many official documents had been destroyed, including Naser's original diploma. During this period of uncertainty , Naser began to suffer from some debilitating symptoms. Frustrating diagnoses and a lack of clarification ultimately brought her to a naturopathic doctor, under whose care the symptoms began to dissipate after two weeks. After this experience, Naser's plans changed: She enrolled at Bastyr and began attending classes while waiting for the paperwork that would allow her to prove her prior education. After three years, the required documentation arrived, but by then Naser was already forging a different career path. She now looks forward to graduating from Bastyr with a dual degree in naturopathic medicine and acupuncture and aims to practice as a pediatric naturopathic physician and acupuncturist. Reaching people who don't know where to go for help Naser joined AHEC in part because of the culture shock she experienced coming to the U.S. She hopes to help other immigrants adjust and gain access to quality health care. \"When [immigrants] come to the U.S., they don't know where to go for help and often don't speak English,\" Naser explains. Her AHEC clinical hours take place at the Muslim Association of Puget Sound, which hosts a monthly public clinic. Because of her training as a medical doctor (MD), Naser is able to practice as a medical assistant (MA) alongside a cardiologist and general practitioner. She is also studying craniosacral therapy , a healing modality she hopes to bring to the clinic once she completes her certificate program. \"These immigrant communities - if you work with them and make them stronger, what's going to happen to the whole country? They will be a building block,\" says Naser. AHEC attracts students who are looking for a \"team-based approach to addressing health disparities,\" recognizing that the path to optimal wellness often has many guides along the way . Upon finishing at AHEC, Naser and her fellow Bastyr students will have completed an important service learning community project, and will have gained a richer understanding of how to serve the underserved effectively .

STUDENT SPOTLIGHT Spring 2019 Student Spotlight Student Liqaa Esaam Naser is pictured with the rest of the Bastyr cohort, top row, second student from the left.STUDENT SPOTLIGHT Spring 2019Every Tuesday morning, a team of Bastyr Center for Natural Health providers and Bastyr University students sets up clinic space at Mary's Place in downtown Seattle. At appointments that are often back-to-back, guests receive free naturopathic care for a variety of health conditions, including colds, digestive issues, diabetes, arthritis and menstrual complaints. This essential access to naturopathic medical care keeps patients like Betty coming back to Bastyr's Mary's Place clinic, sometimes for years. Admiration from a grateful patient Betty has received assistance from Mary's Place since 1995, and Bastyr providers joined her health care team in the early 2000s. The Bastyr appointment model at Mary's Place differs from a typical wellness visit: Student clinicians intake the patient's medical history , then present a diagnosis and treatment plan to the supervising physician for approval before sharing it with the patient. Appointments with Bastyr clinicians help Betty manage her diabetes and hepatitis. \"When I say thank you, I really mean it,\" she says. \"Mary's Place saved my life. [It] supports these women in a very sacred way . They don't discriminate.\" Patients with conditions such as those seen at Mary's Place are often managed by a primary care provider, but limitations on cost or the number of covered visits often create large gaps when people are unable to receive much needed treatment. Bastyr physicians provide the adjunctive care needed in such situations, where prevention can be key - something as simple as a weekly checkup can mean the difference between wellness and a visit to the emergency room. At the end of an appointment with Bastyr at Mary's Place, patients walk away with a course of action: from diet and lifestyle modifications to specially formulated blends of herbs and supplements. \"We provide a certain amount of stability in an otherwise chaotic living situation. We are another intervention for them to get the care that BASTYR IN THE COMMUNITY Spring 2019 3Partnering with Mary's Place: A Look Insidethey really need,\" says Jen Johnson, ND, Bastyr supervising physician at Mary's Place. In response to the homelessness crisis Shelters such as Mary's Place provide resources for the steps toward optimal wellness and housing security . In 1999, a group of dedicated individuals saw a growing need in Seattle. The number of women and children who, like Betty , were experiencing homelessness was continuing to rise and with it, the challenge of creating a daily structure that included meeting basic physical needs. Thanks to the hard work of a committed staff, Mary's Place opened the first of its many locations in the greater Seattle area that year. Now in its 20th year, Mary's Place continues to serve women and children experiencing homelessness, providing two meals a day , clean clothing and other essential support services. Bastyr has proudly provided naturopathic medical care at Mary's Place since the partnership began in 2003. Enhancing students' educational experience Community care sites like Mary's Place are essential to Bastyr's vision to transform the health and well-being of the human community , and they are vital to humanizing those experiencing homelessness. An important step in improving health outcomes is ensuring that future providers graduate well equipped to care for those who are underserved. Naturopathic medical student Francisco Miranda speaks of his experience at Mary's Place: \"Mary's Place has been an absolute blessing to both me and the many women it serves. I and other Bastyr clinicians have had the pleasure of getting to know many of the women who count on Bastyr. Without our presence at Mary's Place, naturopathic care, supplements and vitamins would be unattainable. I have been able to assess and help patients manage a wide range of acute and chronic conditions such as diabetes, skin disorders, hypertension, glaucoma, fatigue and GI complaints, which are key to my comprehensive medical training. I'm grateful for all the women at Mary's Place Downtown who have taught me through our conversations, prayers and laughter.\" Resources such as naturopathic medical care must continue to be provided for people at all income levels.

PD Summer School students learn strategies designed to improve their health outcomes, and the immersive experience includes personalized labs and 20 hours of classroom education. Improving Life for Those with Parkinson's Disease Letters to Dr. Laurie Mischley Dear Dr. Laurie, PD Summer School last year was a life-changing week for myself and my husband. We felt for the first time that we had some control over the progression of my Parkinson's by implementing your suggestions for diet, exercise, alternative therapies and supplements based on the extensive knowledge of my personal health from all the lab work included in the program. We are forever thankful for all the work you do towards helping us deal with this disease. Warmest Regards, Cristiane Hendrickson Dr. Laurie, PDSS was an amazing experience and I am so glad I went. Both my neurologist and movement disorder doctor only told me about medication. Nothing else was discussed. Being an active person I sought out physical therapy on my own. The week-long event at PDSS taught me about so many more things I can do to slow down and even reverse the progression of my disease. Nutrition is very important, I learned what to eat and more importantly what not to eat based on Dr. Laurie Mischley's latest research. I also learned about supplements I could take that would help me. I participated in several labs that included cardiovascular health, gut health and toxins. I learned what toxins to avoid and to remove from my environment. I have probably had PD for 14 years, misdiagnosed in 2014, officially diagnosed and started medication in spring of 2016, but it was not until I took toxins out of my environment, started eating properly , added the supplements and continued with my exercise regimen that I have had great results. I move better now, and feel better now ... didn't think it was possible. I suffered for 20 years, just trying to function each day . Now, I am very active and have tried a lot of new activities I couldn't do before such as hiking, pickle ball, yoga, and improv. The school changed my life, it saved me. Sincerely , Kathryn RileyParkinson's Disease Summer School is facilitated by Laurie Mischley , ND, MPH, PhD, in collaboration with Bastyr University . Dr. Mischley has dedicated her life's work to improving health outcomes for patients with Parkinson's. The focus of her work lies in defining conditionally essential nutrients in Parkinson's disease, and attempting to define the nutritional status and requirements unique to individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. To attend Parkinson's Disease Summer School at Bastyr, visit Bastyrpdschool.org. To donate to this life-changing cause, visit bastyr.edu/PDresearch. 4 Dear Dr. Laurie, Ten years post-diagnosis, I had the opportunity to participate in PD Summer School. I thought I knew pretty much everything there was to know in order to manage my disease as best as possible. What I discovered was that there was so much more to learn than any neurologist or book ever taught me. The idea that nutrition could play a role in the treatment of Parkinson's was somewhat foreign to me, but I thought it would be a good experience to learn about something new. It turned out to be a great experience that has helped me refocus my energy on new, different ways to manage my symptoms and I believe it has put me on a better path to getting the most out of my body . All of this accomplished in one week with the guidance of some great teachers! Dr. Laurie Mischley is a beacon of hope for so many people with Parkinson's. To feel empowered instead of scared (which is the typical feeling I get when attending PD trainings) was amazing. Life changing. Sincerely , Laura AngelucciBBASTYR BUZZ Spring 2019 5Bastyr Buzz Bastyr Nutrition Student Wins Diversity Award Congratulations to master's degree student (Master of Science in Nutrition/ Didactic Program in Dietetics) Tek Fong \"Steven\" Ho ('19)! Ho received this year's Dietitians in Integrative and Functional Medicine (DIFM) Diversity Award for his authorship of a handout featuring customized content for Somali refugees. The handout will be used by DIFM to inform providers and assist them in providing high-quality , culturally sensitive nutritional care. Ho also works as a diet aide at Bayview Retirement Community , and he has developed resources for DIFM on the health and nutrition of Somali refugees in Minnesota. Annual Panel Discussion a Success! In January , Bastyr's Kenmore Naturopathic Medical Student Association (NMSA) Chapter hosted its annual career panel and mixer at Hale's Ales in Seattle. The theme for this year's event was \"opportunity ,\" and it featured a panel of naturopathic doctors that included Jill ND. Student-gathered questions prompted the panelists to remark on the formative experiences that shaped their careers and the small steps that students can take now to achieve success in the future. Themes threaded throughout their responses included: finding and being guided by a passion, and creating your own opportunities. Professor Emerita Brings Free Yoga to Bastyr Bettelinn Brown, affectionately referred to as \"Bastyr's fifth founder,\" has been here since the beginning of Bastyr. Bettelinn returned to campus once again in January to teach yoga to a cohort of students! Between working directly with the late Dr. Bill Mitchell as the school was being established, to teaching yoga classes to students in the basement of Bastyr's first location at Seattle Community College, Bettelinn has been an ardent enthusiast in the growth of Bastyr's history , medicine and philosophy . A true pioneer in the ways of natural living, Bettelinn has touched many lives practicing massage therapy and Jin Shin Jyutsu. And, at 81, still retains a few regular clients. She has been making veggie burgers before they were called that, keeps the tea kettle warm daily with herbal concoctions and still does her morning yoga poses. Seattle Health Care System Virginia Mason Partners with Bastyr Center Local health care and hospital system Virginia Mason recognizes the importance of whole-person health care, and in November 2018, launched its Center for Integrative Medicine, seeking partnership with Bastyr Center for Natural Health for its clinical expertise in natural medicine. Chief of Primary Care Ingrid Gerbino, MD, at Virginia Mason, states: The Center for Integrative Medicine is staffed by Astrid M. Pujari, MD, of Virginia Mason, and Kevin Connor, ND, LAc, of Bastyr Center for Natural Health. The two Seattle clinics offer naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, mind-body techniques and other holistic treatment options in a coordinated manner to benefit patients. The partnership demonstrates one of the numerous ways to answer the growing patient demand for natural remedies in an integrative setting. We've always understood the importance of caring for the whole person. The addition of the mind-body-spirit therapies of integrative medicine builds on that understanding and will elevate the quality of the overall patient experience.\" Bastyr Kenmore's Naturopathic Medical Student Association (NMSA) invites Bettelinn teach yoga.Bettelinn pictured with ND student Olivia Froehlich ('19). G Generous GrantsGENEROUS GRANTS Spring 2019 6U.S. Bank Foundation Grant Improves Access to Midwifery Education Bastyr University received a grant from the U.S. Bank Foundation in support of access to midwifery education opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds. The funding will help create a pipeline of support for doulas with prior training who wish to complete the program. The project goals are: (1) Attract and retain students from diverse backgrounds, and (2) Help educate these students as culturally versatile maternity care providers who will offer services to diverse populations. The mission is: Appreciation of the impact of health disparities on perinatal outcomes, and the development of tools to help address these problems. Program activities will include: Student focus groups to identify areas in need of support and barriers to enrollment, the creation of digital and print outreach materials, the design of a new student orientation, and the establishment of the structure for a student mentorship program - all of which are aimed at engaging and supporting students of color from low income backgrounds so that they can successfully serve as midwives in the communities they reflect. The proposed project is directly aligned with the U.S. Bank Foundation's guidelines, fitting within the Work category for Workforce Education and Economic Prosperity . More specifically , the project will assess the needs of these students and the obstacles they face to enrolling and earning a master's degree through Bastyr's a three-year midwifery program. Norcliffe Foundation Grant Supports Elder Care Bastyr is the grateful recipient of a generous grant from the Norcliffe Foundation. This $30,000 grant is especially welcome because of its primary focus on elder care services at both Bastyr Center for Natural Health and at our external community clinic sites. Double the amount that was initially proposed, these funds will be extremely valuable in advancing one of Bastyr University's four core themes - Clinical Training and Community Health - since many of our senior patients are seen through senior center partnerships in the Puget Sound area. The Norcliffe Foundation, based in Seattle, Wash., is a family-run organization, headed by the Pigott family of PACCAR fame. Bastyr Center was also a successful grant applicant in 2016, when we received another Norcliffe Foundation grant for $15,000, bringing the total awards to date to $45,000. Sunflower Foundation Funds Sacred Seeds Ethnobotanical Trail Project The Sacred Seeds Project was recently awarded a new grant in the amount of $10,000 from the Starflower Foundation. The Foundation's director, Peter Kuyper, is the brother of Ann Lennartz, who was a great supporter of Bastyr University and the Washington Native Plant Society , and previously remembered Bastyr in her estate plans. I'm thrilled that our Sacred Seeds garden has the opportunity and resources to grow in community , education and healing directions on many levels, all of which will support our Herb and Food Fair theme this year of 'Sustaining Cultural Traditions.' I am hopeful that the work we do can also build and deepen relations between Bastyr and our surrounding Salish Sea Tribal Nations.\" - Katie Vincent, Bastyr's Botanical Garden Supervisor RResearch SpotlightRESEARCH SPOTLIGHT Spring 2019 As more people in the U.S. become aware of the overuse of cesarean sections and other birth interventions, the midwifery profession is experiencing a revival. Historically , most American women gave birth at home with the aid of a midwife, until a burgeoning medical industry wrested American birthing away from midwives. Today , despite spending more on health care than any other country in the world, maternal and infant mortality rates are significantly higher in the U.S. than in Europe, Australia, Japan and other nations where midwifery is still the norm. Such mortality rates are even higher for some groups of American women of color, including African American women (American-born women of African descent). Regardless of education or socioeconomic status, African American women are up to four times more likely than white women to die of pregnancy-related complications, and infants born to African American mothers die at twice the rate of infants born to white mothers. A profession grounded in the natural process of giving birth Midwifery care, a client-centered approach to maternity care, emphasizes emotional support and a physiologic approach to childbirth, and could be part of the solution to these maternal infant health inequities. However, families of color often do not access midwifery care, nor do they seek education to become midwives. It is estimated that just two percent of today's midwives are African American. Nancy Anderson, MD, MPH, faculty member in Bastyr University's Department of Midwifery and program director for the Maternal-Child Health Systems (MCHS) program, believes that more women of color will access midwifery care when more midwives of color join the profession. A need for midwives of color Dr. Anderson's research project, \"Women of Color Entering Midwifery: An Assessment of Unmet Needs,\" examines why people of color are underrepresented in the field of midwifery , and was sponsored by the National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM). Dr. Anderson interviewed 25 women of color, including women who were on the path to midwifery , those who had left the profession before completing their studies, and those who had become midwives. Their most frequently cited challenge was financial hardship. Interviewees shared that it is extremely difficult to support midwifery schooling with a part-time job because the clinical practicum, essential for learning the profession, involves attending births that can occur at any time of the day or night. Another frequently cited challenge was that of being a student of color among mostly white students, and having instructors who lack cross-cultural competence. Student research and a plan forward Shira Jacobs recently completed her master's degree in Bastyr's MCHS program. Her research \u2014 and her \"a midwife for everyone\" goal \u2014 builds upon Dr. Anderson's work. The aim of Jacobs' project is to support Facing Challenges Midwifery Research Helps To Grow a Culturally Representative Profession 7 \"The midwifery profession is experiencing a revival.\"RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT Spring 2019 8Bastyr Master's Degree Programs Founded in 2016, Bastyr's Maternal-Child Health Systems (MCHS) program offers a one-year non- clinical master's degree focusing on maternal health systems change, advocacy and policy through a social justice lens. The program features a nine-week class on power, privilege and the consequences of injustice for maternal health. While the MCHS program and the clinical Midwifery program function independently of one another, they share the same mission and goals to create a learning environment free from institutionalized racism and dedicated to social justice and a culturally versatile approach to maternal health care. Several Bastyr faculty members teach courses in both programs.and expand the Department's strategic goal to attract, retain and graduate scholars from diverse, underrepresented and underserved communities. Among Dr. Anderson's and Jacobs' top priorities for creating a culturally responsive and inclusive midwifery program at Bastyr are: Scholarships for students of color to support tuition, transportation, books, student services and childcare expenses A mentoring program featuring practicing midwives of color to guide and support students of color in fulfilling their potential Ongoing training for all faculty , staff, preceptors and students on understanding interpersonal and systemic racism. Though the research uncovered unfavorable findings, Dr. Anderson and Jacobs feel confident that their work can contribute to reversing these findings, thereby improving birth outcomes. Bastyr's Midwifery department has recognized the challenges that must be faced, and department leadership has adopted practices that are vital to ensure that people of color have the chance to become midwives. An anti-racism course is required for all Midwifery and MCHS students, faculty and staff (since 2011). Faculty undergo quarterly professional development to incorporate inclusive curriculum tools and culturally responsive teaching into their coursework. The department hosts monthly Restorative Justice Community circles for students to foster a more inclusive learning community (since 2016). Although Bastyr's Department of Midwifery is leading by example in these efforts - both at the University and in the profession - much work remains to be done before the U.S. has a truly representative workforce that meets the needs of all childbearing families.

Volunteers provide treatments based on the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) ear protocol, which has proved to be effective in assisting patients with alleviating the symptoms of stress and trauma. Alumna Tara Mudaliar-Lawal, MS Midwifery ('15) Tara Mudaliar-Lawal founded the Rainier Valley Community Clinic, a first-of-its-kind maternal-child health clinic. A licensed midwife herself, Mudaliar-Lawal set out to establish this clinic for local women of color and immigrant families in response to the Seattle Metro community's high rates of preterm birth and adverse health outcomes. She is but one more Bastyr pioneer using her education to make a healthier world for all - delivering individualized perinatal care and family medicine within this traditionally underserved community , as well as creating health care jobs for local women. Bastyr providers are opening the door to wellness! Our annual Spring for Health Luncheon was held on May 9th at the Fairmont Hotel, with generous donations given in support of expanding access to natural health care in underserved communities. As health care costs continue to rise in the United States, it becomes even more important to ensure that all have access to quality , affordable treatments. Funds raised at the Luncheon will help bring natural medicine to groups with little or no access. \"Key\" Bastyr alumni, faculty and students who make it their mission to expand access: Alumni Brendan Smith, ND ('09) and Sarah Acosta Smith, ND ('06) Drs.

Alumni SpotlightA Bastyr University alumnus Iman Majd, MD, LAc ('05), routinely integrates acupuncture and conventional medicine to ensure maximum patient benefit, making him something of a rarity among MDs. Through a 2018 endowment from The Bernard Osher Foundation, the University of Washington (UW) joined the Osher Collaborative for Integrative Medicine to establish the UW Osher Center. Dr. Majd was immediately tapped to head the Center, where he now practices acupuncture along with conventional medicine. Medicine for the doctor Dr. Majd earned his MD at Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran. After exhausting conventional medical options for his own back pain, he finally found relief in acupuncture, inspiring him to integrate this ancient Chinese discipline into his practice. To that end, Dr. Majd earned his Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine from Bastyr. How patients benefit How acupuncture works: Tiny needles release the body's own pain relief hormone, providing respite from acute or chronic pain associated with numerous conditions. Because patients often reduce their use of pain medication after beginning acupuncture, Dr. Majd believes acupuncture to be part of the solution to the opioid crisis. Yet acupuncture can do more than relieve pain. Dr. Majd recently worked with a traumatic brain injury patient to restore his sense of smell. While it took some time (30 sessions), they were able to restore the patient's sense of smell, much to his delight! Access for all While some health insurance programs do cover the cost of acupuncture, many do not. Fortunately , some of Dr. Majd's patients qualify for Charity Care through a relationship with UW Harborview Hospital. Additionally , the U.S. Department of Labor and Industry recently began covering acupuncture for back pain; Dr. Majd optimistically expects Medicare to begin covering acupuncture for low back pain within the next two years. Integration sparks interest The Osher endowment currently funds Dr. Majd's practice at the UW Neighborhood Ballard Clinic in Seattle, a full- spectrum primary care clinic. Dr. Majd's vision for the future includes an independent Osher Clinic facility that will offer a full range of health care services by integrative health providers, including naturopathic doctors, chiropractors, mind- body/movement practitioners and massage therapists. Such a clinic would also provide Bastyr students with the opportunity to treat Osher Clinic patients as part of their clinical training. \"I'm very excited to have come from Bastyr and to be working with UW ,\" says Dr. Majd. \"I've spent my whole life building bridges. Now I'm building the bridge between acupuncture and conventional medicine. We are moving past the concept of alternative medicine toward integrated medicine. It is all good medicine,\" he adds, crediting Bastyr as a driving force for this shift. \"Bastyr offers an extraordinary education and produces highly competent graduates. Its great reputation makes this relationship with UW valuable for both schools,\" he notes. Paradigm shift: from symptoms to well-being \"Neither Bastyr nor UW could do this alone,\" Dr. Majd says. \" All the disciplines, knowledge bases and systems have to work together to shift the paradigm from fixing symptoms to supporting well-being. The national movement has started, and it's only a matter of time until integration happens. I am so happy to be in a position of leadership in this movement, and so appreciative of the support from Bastyr, UW and Osher - we are training the next generation of providers!\" Access for All How Acupuncture Made its Way Into One Doctor's Practice, Then Into Many Patients' Lives Now I'm building the bridge between acupuncture and conventional medicine. We are moving past the concept of alternative medicine toward integrated medicine. It is all good medicine.\"ALUMNI SPOTLIGHT Spring 2019 15MMINDFUL EATING Spring 2019 16The internet abounds with lists of healthful foods to eat while sticking to a budget. However, many such lists don't address the mind-body-spirit aspects of eating when financial resources are limited. Consider these tips to nourish and satisfy hunger: Practice mindful eating. Budget worries can be stressful. Mindfulness can help create a sense of calm, which can help improve digestion to achieve satiety. Try taking deep breaths before each meal and focus on the pleasures of the colors, textures and flavors of the food. Connect with your loved ones around the table, and with those in your heart. Create a spirit of gratitude and appreciation for all whose labors have made the food available. Remember that the food you are eating is becoming part of you. Practicing mindfulness increases the capacity to feel nourished. Listen to your body and not to food fads. Diet fad and \"super food\" promises result in pricey, processed food products that become obsolete when the next fad bursts forth. Ignore the buzz! Don't waste your money on food products that come with \"guarantees.\" Instead, practice listening to your body. Choose foods that make you feel full, energized, well and vibrant. Avoid buying foods that leave you tired, uncomfortable or craving more.Mindful Eating 4 Mindful Eating Tips 1 2Include a variety of flavors and textures in each meal. We've all experienced that feeling of needing yet one more crispy chip or sweet candy, even when we're not hungry. Such foods carry one dominant flavor, such as salty or sweet, which still leaves us wanting despite the pleasure they bring, because our palates crave a range of flavors to be satiated. In the practice of Ayurveda, each meal is to include all six flavors \u2014 sweet, sour, salty, bitter, astringent and pungent \u2014 to be fully balanced and satisfying. Follow this practice when planning meals and include multiple flavors to achieve satiety. Think about texture too. Is there something crunchy , something chewy , and something smooth to fully engage the senses? Stay well-hydrated. Don't forget a liquid, since thirst can be disguised as hunger.

GOLD HealthPointSILVERPREMIERPLATINUM BRONZE FEATURED SPONSORS DiagnosTechs - A Company That Has Revolutionized Medical Testing DiagnosTechs is a clinical and research laboratory located in Kent, Wash., where many (if not most) of the staff are Bastyr University alumni. Since 1987, they have pursued noninvasive testing options for health care providers and their patients. According to the DiagnosTechs website, theirs was the first laboratory to introduce saliva testing for cortisol into routine practice. They now provide noninvasive saliva and stool test panels to detect a range of hormones, food sensitivities, microbes, pathogens and parasites. Measuring levels of clinical biomarkers is only part of the function of a clinical laboratory: Knowing when and what substances to measure and then interpreting what the measurements mean is equally important. The human body is a complex organism with inter-relating processes. Measurements of multiple analytes, carried out over a set time period, may be necessary to paint a comprehensive clinical picture of an individual.The physicians employed by DiagnosTechs collectively represent decades of experience spanning a wide range of medical specialties. Emphasis is placed on researching current medical topics and evidence-based materials that support testing in order to enhance provider relations and enable better patient outcomes. In addition to their work interpreting laboratory test results, the staff create and share educational materials specifically tailored to both medical providers and the public. Recently, Eric Semsak, ND ('09), and Katie Disharoon ('06), gave Bastyr students a Lunch-and-Learn opportunity, where they spoke about their work and the work of DiagnosTechs, led by CEO Maroun El Koury, MD.
