Services This was the first time I had an appointment with my counselor in person. The space was nice and welcoming. The environment and appointment were excellent at creating a safe space and a calming feeling. I also feel the same way via telehealth appointments, but it was nice to experience this kind of space in the RUSH campus. In our counseling appointment, my counselor addressed exactly what I wanted to talk about and provided many options to cope with stress. I appreciated her starting with a meditation exercise that I have used since our session. She was especially kind and encouraging. I appreciated her depth of knowledge and perspective. She brought up resources I could use after the session. I look forward to working with her again! My counselor has been extremely helpful to me. She is an exceptional listener and validates the way I am feeling and the important decisions on my mind. She is encouraging and supportive and provides the perfect outlet which I needed at the time of my counseling. I will certainly return to her if I need additional help and would recommend her to any student or staff who is thinking about counseling.

COVID-19 Response RUSH has been uniquely organized and innovative during the COVID-19 pandemic. A critical element to RUSH's success was a strong focus on employee wellness. RUSH developed direct, proactive and empathic strategies to promote ongoing staff well-being. These interventions received national support as a best practice by the American Medical Association and the New England Journal of Medicine. A wellness toolkit for health systems Early in RUSH's evolving response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a multidisciplinary Wellness Task Force was created to coordinate the institution's efforts. Based on the collective expertise of an interdisciplinary team of psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurse liaisons, licensed clinical social workers and chaplains, four evidence-based mitigation tactics were implemented, which we believe all health care organizations should incorporate into their crisis response. These interventions work to preserve the emotional and physical well-being of front line employees during the COVID-19 crisis. Self Care Video Series Wellness is a journey.
