Acupuncture detoxification, also commonly referred to as Acudetox or the NADA protocol, was initially introduced in the 1970's at the Lincoln Hospital, Bronx NY, as part of their substance abuse detoxification program. In 1985, the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) was established to promote education, oversee training and encourage community wellness through the use of the standardized five-point auricular (ear) acupuncture protocol for addiction and behavioural health treatment. Since its development, further research has shown the NADA protocol to be an effective complementary treatment that has been easily integrated into a variety of different settings worldwide including: addiction and mental health treatment facilities, prisons, military, corporate wellness programs, cancer care recovery and as humanitarian aid during trauma and disaster relief efforts. Acudetox treatment involves the gentle placement of five small, sterilized, disposable needles into specific acupoints on each ear. The needles are retained for up to 45 minutes while the recipients sit quietly in a group setting. Treatment is a non-verbal process that does not require an initial assessment to be effective and there is no requirement to discuss one's personal history. It is a safe, effective, drug-free approach with few complications or adverse reactions. Each acupoint used in the protocol has several specific functions that help to rebalance the 'whole' person - mind, body and spirit. Recipients often experience an immediate sense of relaxation, calmness and centering feeling. Additional benefits include: - Reduced pain - Reduced stress, anxiety and depression - Mental clarity - Increased sense of purpose and wellbeing - Improved sleep and energy levels - Improved relationship with oneself and others - Relief from emotional/psychological trauma - Support with addiction treatment (nicotine, alcohol, drugs, food, gambling etc.) including reduced cravings and withdrawal symptoms and relapse prevention Acudetox treatment is deeply restorative and allows one to experience exactly what they need to in the present moment. Recipients are able to let go of tensions and apprehensions in a supportive group environment with others who are also in the process of healing.
