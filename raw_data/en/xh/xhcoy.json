It is becoming very common now a days and is distressing too. Increased intake of processed food, growing mental tension, improper sleep, long working hours especially sedentary lifestyle and suppressing natural urges especially that of urination and defecation is increasing the incidence of Haemorrhoids now a days. There are many types of haemorrhoids and cause many complications. Haemorrhoids are enlarged veins in the wall of the anus commonly occurring in three main points equidistant around the circumference of anus. Haemorrhoids are often described as the varicose veins of the anus and rectum. Haemorrhoids are described in all Ayurveda classics. Acharya Susrutha has even mentioned it as one of the eight grave diseases. Understanding Haemorrhoids in Ayurveda Improper functioning of digestive fire is the main cause of most of the digestive system disorders. Irregularity in Digestive fire is the cause of most of the problems related to the digestive system. Disturbed digestive fire or low digestive fire known as Mandagni leads to constipation. Improper diet and irregular bowel habits disrupts the normal digestive process affecting proper digestion and absorption of nutrients in the body further leading to constipation. A person suffering from constipation will develop habit of straining during defecation to evacuate the bowels which increases back pressure into the haemorrhoidal veins and produces haemorrhoids. The perianal skin is one of the most pain sensitive region in the body because of rich nerve endings. Hence even a small amount of pain causes great discomfort to the patient. The problem worsens with age and time. Haemorrhoids, Sprue syndrome and Diarrhoea are causative factors for each other due to imbalance of digestive fire. There is a simile in Ayurveda stating that just like an enemy trouble a person, inflamed and swollen veins in the anus obstructs the anal canal and troubles the person in haemorrhoids. Different stages of Haemorrhoids In first degree haemorrhoids, bleeding is the main symptom and there is no enlargement of veins at the anus. In second degree haemorrhoids, the pile mass protrudes beyond the anus but returns spontaneously after defecation and in third degree haemorrhoids, the pile mass remains outside the anus and needs to be pushed back by pressure. Understanding Guda (Ano-Rectum) Haemorrhoids occur in the Guda (Ano-Rectum) which is a Mamsa Marma that is vital points of the muscle tissue of the body where Prana (vital) energy flows. It is a Sadhya Pranahara Marma that is an important vital organ the damage to which will cause immediate death. It is one of the seats of life, known as Pranayatana in Ayurveda because proper action of it is necessary for functioning of the body. The main function of Guda is the elimination of faecal matter and flatus. Ano-rectum is a soft part derived from the maternal factor and formed from the essence of blood tissue and Kapha Dosha. The hollow or tubular structure is because of the Pitta and Vata Dosha manifestation. Guda is the distal part of the large intestine and is 4 and half angula (approx. 7.5 cm) in length, formed with 3 vali or folds, each one about 2.5 cm in length and namely Pravahini, Visarjini and Samvarani. They are like spiral grooves of a conch shell and like the palate of an elephant in colour. Pravahini is the first and inner most fold of Guda which is attached to the rectum and it initiates the sensation of pulsation and pushes the faecal matter downwards. Visarjini is the second or middle part of the anal canal which helps in moving the faecal matter forward by its expansion and aids in its expulsion. Samvarini is the third and distal part just above the opening of the anus which opens when the faecal matter comes from above and closes after its expulsion. Gudaoushta is the outer most part of the anus attached to the Samvarini. It is about 1 cm in length and width of the size of half barley. Arshas occurs in any of these folds, the deeper the occurrence of Arshas, the more time it takes to treat. Causative Factors of Arsha Aharaja: Diet factors - Heavy food items like black lentil, kidney beans - As they are difficult to digest. - Cold foods and drinks - As they cause restriction of movement. - Spicy food like pickles, sauce and food that causes burning sensation - These aggravates Pitta Dosha and causes irritation of body tissues. - Incompatible food or mutually contradictory food (like cold drink while taking hot meal) - They do not nourish the tissues and reduces immunity. - Over eating or eating good meal while having indigestion or no appetite - This will hamper the normal digestive process leading to impairment in digestion and elimination of stools. - Excess intake of liquids of water - It dilutes the digestive fire, thereby affecting digestion - Food which is not freshly prepared, having abnormal smell, dry. - Grains and food those are putrefied or denatured. - Taking food of single taste in diet regularly - Diet taken after proper time - Insufficient diet - Food prepared by mixing various contradictory properties. - Meat of cow, buffalo, goat, sheep, pig - Sweet potato, mango, dates, milk, tubers, green leafy vegetables - Fresh grains - Raw vegetables especially carom seeds, ginger and garlic. - Food substances prepared from rice, jaggery, milk, wheat - Excess Sour and salty food items Viharaja: Lifestyle factors - Lack of physical activity or excessive physical activity or exercise in abnormal times of the day. - Excessive indulgence in sexual intercourse or abnormal sex - Straining at stools, urine or flatus - Suppression of the urge to defecate or urinate - Frequently washing rectum with cold water - Frequent or excess use of laxatives or purgatives, enema - Injury to the rectum while administering therapeutic enema - Repeated abortion, preterm labour, pressure exerted by the growing foetus during pregnancy especially in the last trimester, straining to push the foetus during normal delivery, abnormal position of foetus, complications in delivery - Riding on animals like horse, camel, etc. or travelling in two wheelers or bikes for long hours - Sitting on uneven surfaces - Prolonged sitting - Excess intake of alcohol - Sleeping immediately after meals, Day sleep Other factors include hereditary or familial tendencies, congenital factors, local abnormalities like boils, tumour, abscess or cancer. Pathogenesis of Arsha Indulgence in the above-mentioned causative factors will lead to low digestive fire, imbalance in Apana Vata, one of the 5 types of Vata Dosha which is mainly present in the rectum and constipation. This in turn leads to vitiation of other Doshas along with the involvement of blood tissue. These vitiated Doshas and blood tissue then enters into the passage of Dhamani (veins) affecting the folds of the anal canal, and involving the muscle, fat and skin representing the anal cushions leading to haemorrhoids. (Reference 1) The factors involved in pathogenesis of haemorrhoids are summarised in the below table. | | DOSHAS | | | | TISSUES | | - Skin - Blood - Muscle - Fat tissue | | CIRCULATORY CHANNELS | | - Raktavaha (Blood carrying channels) - Mamsavaha (Muscle tissue carrying channels) | | TYPE OF AFFLICTION IN CIRCULATORY CHANNELS | | Siragranthi (Venous Swelling) | | SITE OF MANIFESTATION | | Three folds of the anal canal | | PATHWAY OF DISEASE | | | | STATUS OF DIGESTIVE FIRE | | Low Types of Haemorrhoids Haemorrhoids are classified into different types based on various factors. Two types based on origin - - Sahaja - Congenital - Janmottaraja - Acquired, that which develops after birth. Acquired type is again classified into the further subtypes which are as follows. Two types based on nature - - Sushka - Dry or non-bleeding, due to the predominance of Vata / Kapha Dosha - Ardra - Moist or bleeding, to the predominance of Pitta Dosha / Rakta Dhatu Bleeding type is further classified into the below types - - Associated with Vata - Associated with Kapha Two types based on site - - Bahya - External haemorrhoids - Abhyantara - Internal haemorrhoids Six types based on Dosha Predominance - - Vataja Pittaja of Arsha - gets digested with difficulty - Antra Kujana: Gurgling noise in the intestine - Udgara Bahulya: Increased belching - Amlika: Sour taste in the mouth - Aruchi: Disinterest in taking food - Atopa: Expulsion of flatus with great difficulty and sound - Guda Parikartanam: Pain in anus - Balahani: Weakness - Mandagni: Low digestive fire - Pipasa: Thirst - Anna Vishtambi: Delayed digestion of food - Alpa Mala Pravritti: Scanty stools Symptoms of Piles Main symptoms are - Bleeding per rectum - Pile mass - Painful defaecation - Anal itching - Constipation Other symptoms include indigestion, constipation, low digestive fire, anal fissure, prolapsed rectum. Symptoms of different types of haemorrhoids are as follows. Congenital Haemorrhoids The pile mass is yellowish in colour, hard, strong, visible with difficulty and painful. Acquired Haemorrhoids Symptoms of acquired haemorrhoids are different based on Dosha predominance and is summarized below. - Vataja Arshas - In this type, Vata Dosha is predominant and the pile mass will be dry, hard, Rough, irregular surface or shape, various shapes, variegated colours, blackish appearance mostly and frequently associated with constipation or painful defecation. - Pittaja Arshas - Because of Pitta Dosha predominance, the pile mass will be small in size and may cause burning sensation while defecation, also leading to thirst, fainting and shock, etc. There could be passage of blood mixed with stools. - Kaphaja Arshas - As Kapha Dosha is predominant, the pile mass will be wide, smooth come on fleshy, fixtured or stable and generally there will be no bleeding or suppuration but severe itching and mucus discharge will be experienced. - Samsargaja (From the combination of two Doshas - Vata Pittaja, Pitta Kaphaja and Vata Kaphaja) - This type will have mixed features of the two Doshas according to the predominance. - Sannipataja (From the combination of all three Doshas - Vata Pitta Kaphaja) - Features of all three Dosha imbalance will be seen in this type. - Raktaja - Predominance of Rakta Dhatu causes fleshy nature of the pile mass. There will be immense blood loss during defecation. Bleeding Haemorrhoids Natural Management - Bleeding haemorrhoids with association of Vata will lead to dry stools, flatulence, pain in the thighs, lumbar region and perianal region, and extreme weakness. The haemorrhoids will be grey in colour and blood exudation from the haemorrhoids will be thin, reddish and frothy. Hence unctuous and cold comforts are beneficial for its treatment. - Bleeding haemorrhoids associated with Kapha will lead to unctuous stools which are semi-solid, heavy and whitish in colour, numbness in the anus and exudation of slimy material or mucus. Blood exudation from the haemorrhoids will be dense and slimy. Dry and cold comforts are suggested for its treatment. Ayurveda Management of Piles Ayurveda treatment aims to help to fibrose the haemorrhoidal tissue onto the underlying anal sphincter, thus restoring support for these vascular cushions and thereby preventing complications. Although haemorrhoids are a local disease, it starts from the gastrointestinal system. Improper functioning of Agni, that is low digestive fire leads to malformation of stools which become difficult to excrete, hence the person starts straining unconsciously to eliminate the stools from the body. Hence first line of treatment should be to correct the digestive fire using digestives and carminatives thereby restoring normal digestive process. The usage of Vata Anulomana herbs will help in downward movement of stools thereby expelling them easily. The line of treatment of dry haemorrhoids and bleeding haemorrhoids are different.
