The nine actions under this GDA issue are concerned with C&I architecture and related matters. GDA Issue Action EDF and AREVA to provide a comprehensive ju stification of diversity and independence between NCSS/PS, NCSS/SAS-PAS and PS/SAS-PAS co mmensurate with the level of design for a pre-construction safety report. One of the C&I architectural changes introduce s in response to RI02 was the addition of a Non-Computerised Safety System as a backu p to the computer- based Safety Automation System/Process Automation System and t he Protection System. The EDF and AREVA safety case claims diversity and independence between each of these systems, however, this claim has not been fully substantiated. The regulator expects that this detailed diversity analysis will draw on appropriate standards and guidance. It is also expected that this analysis will be rigorous and ensure all common components are identified together with argumentation as to why any such components identified do not hav e the potential to induce Common Cause Failure of the identified systems. Where final detailed design information is not available, but which is identified has having a potential impact on the diversity analysis , this should be noted and ONR will use the vehicle of an assessment finding to track the gathering of this evidence from a future licensee.

The response should include consideration of systematic and hardware failures, and compliance with appropriate guidance and standards. The EDF and AREVA safety case makes a claim of 1x10-4 probability of failure on demand (pfd) for the Class 1 Protection System (PS), 1x10-2 pfd for the Safety Automation System (SAS) and 1x10-3 pfd for the Non-Computerised Safety System (NCSS). However, a justification for each of these figures needs to be provided, for example, drawing on appropriate inter national standards (covering random and systematic failures). In addition, for the claims to be used in a way which allows their multiplication, additional argumentation will be required (e.g. claims of independence and diversity which will need to be substa ntiated) - see GI-UKEPR-CI-06.A1.

SAP ESS.27 requires that where a safety syst em's reliability is significantly dependent upon the performance of computer software, the establishment of and compliance with appropriate standards and practices thr oughout the software development life-cycle should be made, commensurate with the level of reliability required, by a demonstration of 'production excellence' and 'confidence-building' measures.

The assessed revision of NLN-F DC 193 does not reflect agreed architectural changes and does not provide justification for all the hardwired links from lower class systems to the Class 1 Protection System (noting that there may be detailed implementation issues which cannot be fully addressed under GDA).

A Basis of Safety Case for the Class 1 control and display system to be provided and also a justification in terms of the functional coverage of this system. In response to our assessment a number of C&I architectural changes were introduced to eliminate network communications from lowe r class systems to the Class 1 protection system, and one such change was the introduction of Class 1 control and display panels in the Main Control Room and t he Remote Shutdown Station. EDF and AREVA has indicated that the arrangements will be enhanced by provision of a Qualified Display System (QDS). However, the proposed technical solution, and the scope of the displays/controls needs to be confirmed.

Normal control is through use of the PICS controls with a switch mechanism used to activate the SICS controls on detection of PICS failure. EDF and AREVA is to describe the arrangements used for this changeover incl uding detection of PICS failure. The SICS displays remain active but the audible alarms are muted. The description to be provided by EDF and AREVA will include an argument as to why leaving the SICS controls inactive until needed following PICS failure is preferable to having them active.
