Some people call SIDS \"crib death\" because many babies who die of SIDS are found in their cribs. But, cribs do not cause SIDS. Even though the cause of SIDS remains unknown, scientific efforts have eliminated various misleading theories. In the belief that every child should live, North Dakota enacted legislation in 1977 that prompted the development of the North Dakota SIDS Management Program. Operated through the North Dakota Health and Human Services Agency, Family Health and Wellness Unit, the SIDS Management Program provides the following services: SIDS Management Program Services: A system of reporting suspected SIDS cases to ND Health and Human Services. Support and counseling to families of SIDS victims. Distribution of SIDS information to healthcare providers and the public.
