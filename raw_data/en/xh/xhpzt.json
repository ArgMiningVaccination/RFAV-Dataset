WCB MTG Ligament NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 6 A. General Guideline Principles The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG) and are applicable to all Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines. A.1 Medical Care Medical care and treatme nt required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities with a focus on a return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre -injury s tatus in so far as is feasible. A.2 Rendering Of Medical Services Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work -related injuries and/or illnesses. A.3 Positive Patient Response Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of moti on, strength, endurance, activities of daily living (ADL), cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function may be considered and given relative weight when the pain has an atomic and physiologic correlation in proportion to the injury. A.4 Re-Evaluate Treatment If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results within a well - defined timeframe , the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter . These timeframes may be slightly longer in the context of conditions that are in herently mental health issues , and shorter for other non -musculoskeletal medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary, dermatologic etc.). Recognition that treatment failure is at times attributable to an incorrect diagnosis a failure to respond should prompt the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis in the event of an unexpected poor response to an otherwise rational intervention. A.5 Education Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the community should be a primary emphasis in the treatment of work -related injury or illness. Practitioners should develop and implement effective educational strategies and skills. An education -based paradigm should always start with communicatio n providing reassuring information to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self -management of symptoms and prevention of future injury. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 7 Time Frames A.6 Acuity Acute, Subacute and Chronic are generally defined as timeframes for disease stages: Acute - Less than one month Subacute - One to three month, and Chronic - greater than three months. A.7 Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation refers to the acute timeframe following an injury and is not used to define when a given physician first evaluates an injured worker (initial encounter) in an office or clinical setting. A.8 Diagnostic Time Frames Diagnostic time frames for conducting diagnostic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.9 Treatment Time Frames Treatment time frames for specific interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on the date of injury. It is recognized that treatment duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as availa bility of services. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.10 Delayed Recovery For those patients who fail to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after a n injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis and re -evaluation of the treatment program should be performed. When addressing a clinical issue that is not inherently a mental health issue, assessment for potential barriers to recovery (yellow flags/psychological issues) should be ongoing throughout the care of the patient . At 6-12 weeks, alternate treatment programs, including formal psychological or p sychosocial evaluation should be considered. Clinicians must be vigilant for any pre -existing mental health issues or subsequent, consequential mental health issues that may be impacting recovery. For issues that are clearly and inherently mental health is sues from the outset (i.e. when it is evident that there is an underlying, work -related, mental health disorder as part of the claim at issue), r eferral to a mental health provider can and should occur much sooner . Referrals to mental health providers for the evaluation and management of delayed recovery do not indicate or require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological condition. The evaluation and management of delayed recovery does not require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychologic al claim. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 8 Treatment Approaches A.11 Active Interventions Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are vie wed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.12 Active Therapeutic Exercise Program Active therapeutic exercise program g oals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, sensory integration, coordination, cognition and behavior (when at issue) and education as clinically indicated. This includes functional application in vocational or commun ity settings. A.13 Diagnostic Imaging And Testing Procedures Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection of imaging procedures and interpretation of results. All diagnostic procedures have cha racteristic specificities and sensitivities for various diagnoses. Usually, selection of one procedure over others depends upon various factors, which may include: relative diagnostic value; risk/benefit profile of the procedure; availability of technology ; a patient's tolerance; and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, a second diagnostic procedure is not required. However, a subsequent diagnostic procedure including a repeat of the original (same) procedure can be performed, when the specialty physician (e.g., physiatrist, sports medicine physician or other app ropriate specialist ) radiologist or surgeon documents that the initial study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. Therefore, in such circumstances, a repeat or complementary diagnostic procedure is permissible under the MTG. It is recognized that repeat imaging stu dies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and/or to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the pathology w hen there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and/or therapeutic injections when clinically indicated, and post -operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding serial imaging, (including x -rays, but particularly CT scans), it must be recognized that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. A given diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as obtained by other procedures. Therefore, prudent choice of procedures(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedur es(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize the likelihood of adverse effect on patients, and promote efficiency by avoiding duplication or redundancy. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 9 A.14 Surgical Interventions Consideration of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course and imaging and other diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat pain, there must be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause. In all cases, shared decision making with the patient is advised. The patient should be given the opportunity to understand the pros and cons of surgery, potential for rehabilitation as an alternative where applicable, evidence -based outcomes, and specific surgical experience. A.15 Pre-Authorization All diagnostic imaging, testing procedures, non -surgical and surg ical therapeutic procedures, and other therapeutics within the criteria of the Medical Treatment Guidelines and based on a correct application of the Medical Treatment Guidelines are considered authorized, with the exception of the procedures listed in sec tion 324.3(1)(a) of Title 12 NYCRR. These are not included on the list of pre-authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure . Second or subsequ ent procedures (the repeat performance of a surgical procedure due to failure of, or incomplete success from the same surgical procedure performed earlier, if the Medical Treatment Guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures) also require pr e-authorization. A.16 Psychological/Psychiatric Evaluations In select patients, mental health evaluations are essential to make, secure or confirm a diagnosis. Of course, the extent and duration o f evaluations and/or interventions by mental health professionals may vary, particularly based on whether: the underlying clinical issue in the claim is inherently a mental health issue; or there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question ; or there is a pre - existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question . Tests of psychological function or psychometric testing, when indicated, can be a valuable component of the ps ychological evaluation in identifying associated psychological, personality and psychosocial issues . Although these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis should only b e made after careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. A professional fluent in the primary language of the patient is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a profe ssional language interpreter must be provided. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 10 Frequency: When assessing for a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) a work - related, medical injury or illness, then a o ne-time visit for initial psychiatric/psychological encounter should be sufficient, as care would normally be continued by the prior treating provider . If psychometric testing is indicated by findings in the initial encounter, time for such testing should not exce ed an additional three hours of professional time. For conditions in which a mental health issue is a central part of the initial claim , or in which there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the work -related, medical injury or il lness, that is part of the claim in question, then more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be clinically indicated, and are discussed in detail in the Medical Treatment Guidelines for such mental health conditions. A.17 Personality/Psyc hological/Psychosocial Intervention Following psychosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, such intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral goals, time frames and specific interventions planned . Time to produce effect: two to eight weeks. Optimum duration: six weeks to three months. Maximum duration: three to six months. Counseling is not intended to delay but rather to enhance functional recovery. For PTSD Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: nine to twelve months. For select patients, longer supervision and treatment may be required, and if further treatment is indicated, documentation of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authorized treating practitioner every four weeks during the first six months of treatment. For treatment expected to last six to twelve months, such documentation should be provided every four to eight weeks. For long -term treatment beyond twelve months, such documentation should be provided every eight to twelve weeks. All parties should strive for ongoing and continuous communications, in order to fac ilitate seamless , continuous and uninterrupted treatment. A.18 Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of fun ction as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as endurance, lifting (dynamic and static), postural tolerance, specific range -of-motion, coordination and strength, worker habits, employability, as well as psychosocial, cognitiv e, and sensory perceptual aspects of NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 11 competitive employment may be evaluated. Components of this evaluation may include: (a) musculoskeletal screen; (b) cardiovascular job (f) maximum voluntary effort; (g) pain assessment/psychological screening; (h) non - material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive and behavioral ; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In most cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. An FCE may be considered at time of MMI, following reasonable prior attempts to return to full duty throughout course of treatment, when the treating physician is unable to make a clear determination on work status on case closure. An FCE is not indicated early during a treatment regime for any reason including one to support a therapeutic plan. When an FCE is being used to determine return to a specific job site, the treating physician is responsible for understanding and considering the job duties. FCEs cannot be used in isolation to determine work restrictions. The authorized treating physician must interpret the FCE in light of the individual patient's presentation and medical and personal perceptions. FCEs should not be used as the sole criteria to diagnose malingering. A.19 Return To Work For purposes of these guideli nes, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of medical care , and should be included in the treat ment and rehabilitation plan. It is normally addressed at every outpatient visit. A description of the patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan and should provide the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime goal in treating occupational injuries. The emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work, since the prognosis of returning an injured worker to work drops progressively the longer the worker has been out of work. A.20 Job Site Evaluation The treating physician may communicate with the employer or employer's designee, either in person, by video conference, or by telephone, to obtain information regarding the individual or specific demands of the patient's pre - injury job. This may include a description of the exertional demands of the job, the need for repetitive activities, load lifting, static or awkward postures, environmental expos ures, psychological stressors and other factors that would pose a barrier to re -entry, risk of re -injury or disrupt convalescence. When returning to work at the patient's previous job task s or setting is not feasible, given the clinically determined restri ctions on the patient's activities, inquiry should be made about modified duty work settings that align with, the patient's condition in view of proposed work activities/demands in modified duty jobs. It should be noted, that under certain circumstances, m ore than one job site evaluation may be indicated . NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 12 Ideally, the physician would gain the most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activities; but it is recognized that this may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the employer, these can contribute valuable information , as can video conferences, conducted from the worksite and ideally workstation or work area . Frequency: One or two c ontacts 1st c ontact : Patient is in a functiona l state where the patient can perform some work. 2nd c ontact : Patient has advanced to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment. The physician shall document the conversation. Other A.21 Guideline Recommendat ions And Medical Evidence The Workers' Compensation Board and its Medical Advisory Committee have not independently evaluated or vetted the scientific medical literature used in support of the guideli nes, but have relied on the methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and referenced in these Guidelines. A.22 Experimental/Investigational Treatment Medical treatment that is experimental/investigational and not approved for any purpose, application or indication by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. A.23 Injured Workers As Patients In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients recognizing that in certain circumstances there is no doctor -patient relationship. A.24 Scope Of Practice These Guidelines do not address scope of practice or change the scope of practice. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 13 Knee Injury Effective date will coincide with the launch of OnBoard: Limited Release B. Introduction to Knee Injury B.1 History Taking and Physical Examination History taking and physical examination establish the foundation/basis for and dictate subsequent stages of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. When findings of clinical evaluations and those of other diagnostic procedures are not consistent with each other, the objectiv e clinical findings should have preference. The medical records should reasonably document the following: B.1.a History of Present Injury B.1.a.i Mechanism of injury: This includes details of symptom onset and progression, and symptoms that may arise from postural or functional accommodation to the knee injury; B.1.a.ii Relationship to work: This includes a statement of the probability that the illness or injury is work -related; B.1.a.iii Prior occupational and non -occupational injuries to the same area including specific prior treatment and any prior bracing devices; B.1.a.iv History of locking, clicking, giving way, crepitation, popping, swelling (is present description of onset and volume) and presence or absence of pain while ascending or descending stairs; B.1.a.v Ability to perform job duties and activities of daily living; and B.1.a.vi Exacerbating and alleviating factors for symptoms; not limited to the knee. B.1.b Past History B.1.b.i Past medical history includes, but is not limite d to, neoplasm (or recurrence), gout/pseudogout, infections, significant knee femur and/or leg trauma, arthritis, and diabetes; B.1.b.ii A review of systems should be conducted, the elements of which may include signs or symptoms related to the following systems: constitutional symptoms; eyes; endocrine; hematologic/lymphatic; allergic/immunologic. Based on the underlying condition being addressed, and clinical judgement, the breadth and focus of the review of systems can be tailored on a case by case basis. B.1.b.iii Smoking history; B.1.b.iv Vocational, military service, and recreational pursuits; B.1.b.v Prior imaging studies; and B.1.b.vi Past surgical history. B.1.c Physical Examination Examination of a joint should include the joint above and below the affected area. Physical examinations should include accepted tests and exam techniques applicable to the joint or area being examined, including: B.1.c.i Visual Strength with attention given to for atrophy and muscle fasciculations; B.1.c.v Joint stability; displaced displaceable patella; B.1.c.vii If applicable to injury, integri ty of distal circulation, sensory, and motor function; and B.1.c.viii If applicable, full neurological exam including muscle atrophy and gait abnormality. B.1.d Red Flags Certain findings, \"red flags\", raise suspicion of potentially serious medical conditions. Assessment (history and physical examination) should include evaluation for red flags. In the knee these findings or indicators may include: fracture, dislocations, a nd ligamentous tears; infection or inflammation; neurological or vascular compromise including compartment syndrome ; and history of trauma, including but not necessarily limited to serious motor vehicle crashes, crush injuries, or falls from heights . Furth er evaluation/consultation or urgent/emergency intervention may be indicated, and the New York Knee Injury Medical Treatment NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 15 Guidelines incorporate changes in clinical management triggered by the presence of \"red flags.\" B.2 Radiographic Imaging (X -Ray) Recommended - In select patients. Indications : B.2.a Inability to transfer weight for four steps at the time of the initial visit, regardless of limping; B.2.b History of significant trauma, especially blunt trauma or fall from a height; B.2.c Age over 55 years; B.2.d Unexplained or persistent pain over two weeks. (Occult fractures, especially stress fractures, may not be visible on initial x -ray. A follow -up radiograph and/or bone scan may be required to make the diagnosis); B.2.e History or exam suggestive of intravenous drug abuse or osteomyelitis; and B.2.f Pain with swelling and/or range of motion (ROM) limitation localizing to an area of prior fracture, internal fixation, or joint prosthesis. Presence of deformity at time of injury that may or may not have reduced with knee extension B.3 Laboratory Testing Laboratory tests are rarely indicated at the time of initial evaluation, unless there is suspicion of systemic illness, infection, neoplasia, connective tissue disorder, or underlying arthritis or rheumatologic disorder based on history and/or physical examination. Laboratory tests can provide useful diagnostic information. Tests include, but are not limited to: B.3.a Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential Recommende d - for patients with suspicion of infection, blood dyscrasias, and medication side effects. B.3.b Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti - nuclear antigen (ANA), human leukocyte antigen (HLA), C -reactive protein (CRP) and if indicated by activity history, Lyme serology . NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 16 Recommended - To detect evidence of a rheumatologic, infection, or connective tissue disorder. B.3.c mended - In select patients with suspicion of metabolic bone disease. B.3.d Liver and Kidney Function Recommended - In select patients with prolonged anti -inflammatory use or other medications requiring monitoring . B.3.e Joint Aspiration Recommended - to evaluate joint effusion for bacteria, white cell count, red cell count , fat globules, crystalline birefringence and chemistry. B.4 Diagnostic Testing and Procedures As outlined in detail in General Principles section A -13, the selection of diagnostic imaging studies depends on the case -specific clinical presentation, as well as clinical judgment. In addition, there may be instances where repeat or alternate diagnostic imaging may be clinically indicated. Such instances include, but are not necessarily limited to when: a prior test is of poor quality and/or nondiagnostic; the clinical situation changes (e.g. , new or worsening symptoms, preparing for surgery or therapeut ic injections, etc.); it is necessary to monitor clinical progress (e.g. , post-operatively) or deterioration over time. Prudent choice of procedure(s) or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize ad verse effect to patients and promote clinical efficiency. Repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. Diagnostic imaging procedures have varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity for any diagnosis. Clini cal history, physical examination and clinical judgment should be the basis for selection and interpretation of imaging studies. Generally, plain X -rays are a useful starting point, but they are not always sufficient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a rthrography, or computed axial tomography (CT) scanning following arthrography may provide useful information for many knee disorders. In certain circumstances as stated above, repeat or alternate imaging may be warranted. Usually, selection of one procedu re over others depends upon multiple factors. When indicated, the following additional imaging studies can be utilized for further evaluation of the lower extremity, based upon the mechanism of injury, symptoms, and patient history. The studies below ar e listed in frequency of use, not importance. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 17 B.4.a Imaging Studies B.4.a.i Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Recommended - in select patients. Indications: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a more definitive visualization of soft tissue structures, including ligaments, tendons, joint capsule, menisci and joint cartilage structures, than x -ray or Computed Axial Tomography in the evaluation of traumati c or degenerative injuries. The addition of intravenous or intra -articular contrast can enhance definition of selected pathologies. In general, the high field, conventional, MRI provides better resolution than that of a lower field scan (open field MRI). A lower field scan may be indicated when a patient cannot fit into a high field scanner or is too claustrophobic despite sedation. Inadequate resolution on a first scan may require a second MRI using a different technique. A subsequent diagnostic MRI may b e a repeat of the same procedure, when the rehabilitation physician, radiologist or surgeon says the study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. All questions in this regard should be discussed with the MRI center and/or radiologist. Ferrous material/metallic objects present in the tissues is a contraindication for the performance of an MRI. B.4.a.ii Computed Tomography Tomography (CT) provides excellent visualizati on of bone and is used to further evaluate bony masses and suspected fractures not clearly identified on radiographic window evaluation. Instrument scatter -reduction software provides better resolution when metallic artifact is of concern. When ferrous/me tallic materials are present in the tissues, CT should be ordered rather than MRI. CT examinations entail exposure to ionizing radiation, with associated radiation - related risks. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 18 B.4.a.iii Lineal Tomography Not Recommended B.4.a.iv Bone Scan (Radioisotope Bone Scanning) Recommended - in select patients. Indications : 99MTechnecium diphosphonate uptake reflects osteoblastic activity and may be useful in trauma, metastatic or primary bone tumors, stress fractures, occult fractures osteomyelitis, and inflammatory lesions, but cannot distinguish among these entities. B.4.a.v Other Radionuclide Scanning Recommended - in select patients. Indications : Indium and gallium scans are procedures usually used to help diagnose lesions seen on other diagnostic imaging studies. 67Gallium citrate scans are used to localize tumor, infection, and abscesses. 111Indium -labeled leukocyte scanning is utilized for localization of infection or inflammation. B.4.a.vi Arthrograms Recommended - in select patients Indications: Arthograms may be useful in the evaluation of internal derangement of a joint, only when MRI or other tests are contraindicated, are not considered diagnostic or not available. This testing may be indicated in select patients for whom the clinical benefits outweigh the risks, and for whom MRI is either non-diagnostic, or not clinically indicated or clinically contraindicated. Note: Potential complications of this more invasive technique include pain, infectio n, and allergic reactions. B.4.a.vii Diagnostic Arthroscopy Refer to Table 1. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 19 Table 1. IF the diagnosis is supported by AND this has been done (if recommended) The following may be appropriate CLINICAL FINDINGS SUBJECTIVE OBJECTIVE IMAGING CONSERVATIVE CARE PROCEDURE Pain and functional limitations continue despite conservative care Imaging is inconclusive Medications AND / OR Physical Therapy Diagnostic Arthroscopy B.4.b Other Tests The studies below are listed by frequency of use, not importance. B.4.b.i Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Velocity Studies (NCV) Recommended - in select patients. Indications: Electrodiagnostic studies have limited use with knee disorders. It is recommended and preferred that EDX in the out -patient setting be performed and interpreted by physicians board - certified in Neurology or Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. B.4.b.ii Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP) Not Recommended B.4.b.iii Doppler Ultrasonography/Plethysmography Recommended - in select patients Indications : Doppler Ultrasonography/Plethysmography is useful in establishing the diagnosis of arterial and venous disease in the lower extremity and should be considered prior to the more invasive venogram or arteriogram study. Doppler is less sensitive in detecting deep -vein thrombosis in the calf muscle area. If the test is initially negative, an ultrasound should be repeated 7 days post initial symp toms to rule out popliteal thrombosis. It is also useful for the diagnosis of popliteal mass when MRI is not available or contraindicated. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 20 Note: A Doppler study is useful in the investigation of the popliteal space for masses. Ultrasound may be used by s ome physicians to guide diagnostic procedures and aspirations of loculated fluid collections. B.4.b.iv Venogram/Arteriogram Recommended - in select patients Indications: Venogram/Arteriogram is useful for investigation of vascular injuries or disease, including deep -venous thrombosis. Potential complications may include pain, allergic reaction, and deep -vein thrombosis. B.5 Other Procedures B.5.a Joint Aspiration Joint Aspiration is a procedure used when specifically indicated and performed by individuals properly trained in these techniques. Recommended - in select patients. Indications: When history and/or physical examination are of concern for a septic joint, massive joint effusion or bursitis (even at the initial evaluation). Aspiration should not be performed through an infected area. Aspiration of a large knee effusion can help to de crease pain and speed functional recovery. Persistent or unexplained effusions may be examined for evidence of infection, rheumatologic, or inflammatory processes. The presence of blood and fat globules in the effusion strongly suggests occult fracture. A large hemorrhagic effusion should prompt suspicion that a fracture or ligament tear may be present. C. Specific Knee Injury Diagnoses, Testing and Treatment C.1 Chondral Defects (Cartilage or Cartilage and Bone Defects) C.1.a Description/ Definition Cartilage or cartilage and bone defect at the articular or meniscal surface of a joint. C.1.b Mechanism of Injury Usually caused by a traumatic knee injury, particularly as a result of NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 21 contusion. C.1.c Specific Physical Findings Knee effusion, pain in joint. C.1.d Testing Procedures MRI, Radiographs, CT Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : MRI may show bone bruising, osteochondral lesion, or possibly articular cartilage injury. Radiographs and CT may also be used. Following an acute injury an MRI usually shows bone bruising. C.1.e Non-Operative Treatment Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Rest/restricted activity, off -loading with crutches or cane, ice, elevation, bracing, active and/or passive therapy, NSAIDs, APAP therapeutic injections, which may at a late date include hyaluronate therapy. C.1.f Surgical Indications / Operative Treatment Osteochondral Autograft and Autologous Chrondrocyte Implantation (ACI) are not included on the list of pre - authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must reque st pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Refer to Table 3 for criteria. If a non -operative treatment approach is initially recommended, surgery may be indicated after the failure of conservative management. The patient must c ontinue to exhibit the designated objective findings, subjective symptoms and (where applicable) imaging findings. Refer to Table 3. C.1.g Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) Exclusion Criteria ACI is not a covered procedure in any of the followin g circumstances: i. Lesion that involves any portion of the patellofemoral articular cartilage, bone, or is due to osteochondritis dissecans. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 22 ii. A \"kissing lesion\" or Modified Outerbridge Grade II, III, or IV exists on the opposite tibial surface. iii. Mild to severe localized or diffuse arthritic condition that appears on standing x -ray as joint space narrowing, osteophytes, or changes in the underlying bone. iv. Unhealthy cartilage border; the synovial membrane in the joint may be used as a substitute border for up to \u00bc of the total circumference. v.

C.6.d Diagnostic Testing Procedures Radiographs, MRI Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 32 Indications: Radiographs including standing Posterior/Anterior (PA), lateral, tunnel, and skyline views. MRI is the definitive imaging test. MRI is sensitive and specific for meniscal tear. However, meniscal MRI is frequently abnormal in asymptomatic injuries. Clinica l correlation with history and physical exam findings specific for meniscus injury is critically important. Providers planning treatment should therefore consider the patient's complaints and presence of arthritis on MRI carefully, knowing that not all meniscus tears in the middle aged and older population are related to the patients' complaints of pain. Note: MRI arthrograms may be appropriate to diagnose recurrent meniscal tears, particularly after previous surgery.

Indications : bursa excision after failure of conservative therapy C.11. h Post -Operative Therapy Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. D. Therapeutic Procedures: Non-Operative Before initiation of any therapeutic procedure, the authorized treating provider, employer and insurer must consider these important issues in the care of the injured worker. First, patients undergoing therapeutic p rocedure(s) should be released or returned to modified, restricted, or full duty during their rehabilitation at the earliest appropriate time. Second, cessation and/or review of treatment modalities should be undertaken when no further significant subject ive or objective improvement in the patient's condition is noted. If patients are not responding within the recommended duration periods, alternative treatment interventions, further diagnostic studies or consultations should be pursued. Third, providers should provide and document education to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self -management of symptoms. In unusual cases where a patient is unable t o attend an outpatient center, home therapy may be necessary. Home therapy may include active and passive therapeutic procedures as well as other modalities to assist in alleviating pain, swelling, and abnormal muscle tone. Home therapy is usually of short duration. The following procedures are listed in alphabetical order. D.1 Acupuncture Recommended - in select patients as an adjunct to physical rehabilitation and/or surgical intervention to hasten the return of functional activity. Indications : Include joint pain, joint stiffness, soft tissue pain and inflammation, paresthesia, post -surgical pain relief, muscle spasm, and scar tissue pain. Frequency: Typically, one to three times per week with three to six treatments needed to produce effect and a m aximum of ten treatments as clinically indicated. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 43 Note: Total Time Frames for Acupuncture and Acupuncture with Electrical Stimulation ; time frames are not meant to be applied to each of the above sections separately. The time frames are to be applied to all acupuncture treatments regardless of the type or combination of therapies being provided. D.2 Biofeedback Not Recommended D.3 Injections: Therapeutic Therapeutic injections involve the delivery of anesthetic and/or anti-inflammatory medications to the painful structure. Therapeutic injections have many potential benefits. Ideally, a therapeutic injection will : (a) reduce inflammation in a specific target area; (b) relieve secondary muscle spasm; (c) allow a break fro m pain; and (d) support therapy directed to functional recovery. Diagnostic and therapeutic injections should be used early and selectively to establish a diagnosis and support rehabilitation. If injections are overused or used outside the context of a monitored rehabilitation program, they may be of significantly less value. Contraindications : General contraindications include local or systemic infection, bleeding disorders, allergy to medications used and patient refusal. Specific contraindications may a pply to individual injections. D.3.a Soft Tissue Joint Injections Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: Soft tissue and joint injections may be performed as analgesic or anti - inflammatory procedures. Injections into the tendon are not recommended. Frequency: Not more than two to three times annually. Usually one or two injections adequate. Time to produ ce effect : Immediate with local anesthetic, or within three days with corticosteroids. Optimum/maximum duration: Limited to three injections annually to the same site Note: A minimum of three weeks interval between injections is recommended. D.3.b Trigger Point Injections Not Recommended NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 44 D.3.c Prolotherapy (also known as sclerotherapy) Not Recommended D.3.d Protein Rich Plasma (PRP) Not Recommended D.3.e Intra -Capsular Acid Salts - Viscosupplementation A form of treatment for osteoarthritis or degenerative changes in the knee joint. Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: It is recommended that these injections be considered a therapeutic alternative in patients who hav e failed non - pharmacological and analgesic treatment, and particularly, if non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drug treatment is contraindicated or surgery is not an option. The utility of viscosupplementation in severe osteoarthritis and its efficacy beyond six months is not well known. Frequency: One series of injections, per product instructions. If the first use is associated with decreased symptoms and increased function, repeat use may be considered after six months if symptoms recur. Optimum duration varies. Efficacy beyond six months is not well known. D.4 Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs, although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. D.4.a Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Knee pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic knee pain Indications : For acute, subacute, or chronic knee pain, NSAIDs are recommended f or treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms, lack of efficacy, or development of adve rse effects, that necessitate discontinuation. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 45 D.4.b NSAIDs for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - for concominent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and pro ton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treat ment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. D.4.c NSAIDs for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain d iscussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse effects. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients re ceiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or eight hours before the daily aspirin. D.4.d Acetaminophen Recommended - for treatment of knee pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with knee pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 46 Rationale for Recommendations : For most patients, generic ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Second -line medications should include one of the other generic medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative for these patients, although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective for arthrosis patients. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (and tramadol) and less impairing. D.4.e Topical Medications Recommended - In select patients for treatment of pain associated with acute, subacute, or chronic knee pain, including topical creams, ointments, and lidocaine patches Rationale for Recommendation : TOPICAL DRUG DELIVERY (e.g., capsaicin, topical lidocaine, topica l NSAIDs and topical salicylates and nonsalicylates) may be an acceptable form of treatment in selected patients. A topical agent should be prescribed with strict instructions for application and maximum number of applications per day to obtain the desired benefit and avoid potential toxicity. For most patients, the effects of long -term use are unknown and thus may be better used episodically. These agents may be used in those patients who prefer topical treatments over oral medications. Localized skin reac tions may occur, depending on the medication agent used. Prescribers should consider that topical medication can result in toxic blood levels. Capsaicin offers a safe and effective alternative to systemic NSAIDs, although its use is limited by local sting ing or burning sensation that typically disappears with regular use. Patients should be advised to apply the cream on the affected area with a plastic glove or cotton applicator to avoid inadvertent contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Long -term use of capsaicin is not recommended. Topical Lidocaine is only indicated when there is documentation of a diagnosis of neuropathic pain. In this instance, a trial for a period of not greater than four weeks can be considered, with the need for documentation of f unctional gains as criteria for additional use. Topical NSAIDs (e.g., diclofenac gel) may achieve tissue levels that are potentially therapeutic. Overall the low level of systemic absorption can be advantageous, allowing the topical use of these medicatio ns when systemic administration is relatively contraindicated (such as patients with hypertension, cardiac failure, peptic ulcer disease or renal insufficiency). Topical Salicylates or Nonsalicylates (e.g., methyl salicylate) overall do not appear to be more effective than topical NSAIDs. May be used for a short -term course especially in patients with chronic conditions in whom NYS WCB MTG - Knee Injury 47 systemic medication is relatively contraindicated or as an adjuvant to systemic m edication . D.4.f Opioids Not Recommended - for acute, subacute, or chronic knee pain. Recommended - for limited use (not more than seven days) for post - operative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications : For post -operative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatmen ts (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen) is often required, especially nocturnally. Frequency/Duration : Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. Rationale for Recommendation : Some patients have insu fficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use in post -operative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep post-operatively. D.4.g Minor Tranquilizer / Muscle Relaxants Not Recommended and Prosthetics D.5.a Fabrication / Modification of Orthotics Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : Used when there is need to normalize weight -bearing, facilitate better motion response, stabilize a joint with insufficient muscle or proprioceptive/reflex competencies, to protect subacute conditions as needed during movement, and correct biomechanical problems.
