GLOBE: ZOONAR RF/GETTY IMAGESThe European Commission, the Brussels-based European Union executive, mentioned in a strategy document (1) in 2015 possible changes in the system under which research- based pharmaceutical companies h ave been able to extend their patents on their new medicines through the granting of five-year supplementary protection certificates (SPCs). Among the alterations to the SPC rules suggested by the commission was one that would provide a waiver for generic and other drug producers to allow them to make, but not market, medicines covered by the extended patents. The commission, however, in October 2017, put forward for public consultation a list of proposed SPC improvements, including a manufacturing waiver. After the consultation ends early next year, the commission has indicated that it would then start work on drawing up firm proposals to include possible amendments to existing EU legislation. \"The commission has been a little bit slow in doing something about this issue, but now the process for making changes has started,\" says Adrian van den Hoven, director general of Medicines for Europe, a lobby group representing generic drug and biosimilar medicine manufacturers. \"We are hoping that if everything goes smoothly, the changes will come into force in one and half to two years, with the manufacturing waiver being the priority for us.\" The organization wants new rules that will enable large quantities of a drug to be manufactured during its SPC protection period to take advantage of the expiry or non-existence of the protection certificates in non-EU markets. The waiver should also be applicable in the EU itself so that generic-drug or biosimilar producers can launch their products immediately in European markets as soon as the certificates expire. \"There is a relatively large number of blockbuster drugs, many of them biopharmaceutica ls, whose SPCs are expiring in Europe over the next few years,\" van der Hoven told Pharmaceutical Technology Europe. \"That is an opportunity we want to take full advantage of.\" Furthermore, manufacturingwaivers would help to make the European generic drugs and biosimilars sector more competitive internationally, attract investment in EU drug manufacturing capacity, and help create thousands of new jobs in the industry, according to Medicines for Europe (2). Opposition from drug innovator s Manufacturing waivers for bulk production of medicines during the SPC period is, however, being opposed by many drug innovators on the grounds that it is weakening their intellectual property rights. Rather than strengthening the European pharmaceutical sector, it would undermine its R&D capabilities. \"[We] believe that the introduction of an SPC manufacturing exemption would be detrimental to medical innovation and Europe's knowledge-based economy,\" a spokesman for the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), representing the research- based sector, told Pharmaceutical Technology Europe. SPCs were first introduced in Europe in the early 1990s as a means of compensating drug originators for the lengthy testing and clinical trials that their products needed to gain marketing authorizations. Because of stricter regulatory requirements, the 20-year protection period for drugs was effectively being reduced to 10 years or less. By 2015, the number of SPCs issued in Europe had reached 20,000, a figure that the European Commission said showed how importantthey were to medicine developers. Generic-drug and biosimilar producers and small medium- sized enterprise (SME) innovators, particularly small biotech companies, h ave long complained that the rules on SPCs have restricted the quantities of SPC drugs they can manufacture during the five-year protection period. Bolar exemptions first introduced in the EU legislation (3) in 2001 allow manufacturingof SPC-covered drugs for research or testing purposes to provide data for marketing and other regulatory approvals. But like SPCs themselves, the Bolar exemptions are granted on a national basis by the 28 EU member states, which has led to variations in their scope. Some only apply to development work for national or EU marketing authorizations and others for approvals outside Europe and anywhere in the world. The generic-drug and biosimilar producers in Europe are focusing on achieving legislative changes that will enable them to manufacture sufficient quantities of a drug during the SPC period to supply markets that do not have SPC regulations or where the certificate on a medicine has expired. Their major target is the right to stockpile a medicine so that they can immediately launch it on the EU market as soon as its SPCexpires. The commission's eventual proposals for alterations to the SPC system in the EU may fall short of what the generic- drugs and biosimilars sector wants. Impact of the SPC manufacturing waiver and a broadened Bolar exemptio n The proposals (4) listed by the commission for the public consultation include, among three options, one of no change. The other two are the use of non-legislative instrumentsDisputes Over Manufacturing Waiver and Other SPC Exemptions The European Commission's effort to relax supplementary protection certificates to help generic-drug makers and biosimilars producers has sparked strong opposition from the research-based pharmaceutical sector.Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 9 REGULATION & COMPLIANCE EUROPEAN REGULATORY WATCH to improve the implementation of existing rules and the introduction of amendments to existing EU legislation to allow manufacturing waivers for stockpiling purposes. At the same time, as it launched the consultation, the commission published a study (5) by the UK-based consultancy Charles River Associates (CRA) on the economic impact of the SPC manufacturing waiver and a broadening of the Bolar research exemptions. The study, which was funded by the commission, was completed in 2016. The CRA report (5) concludes that the manufacturing waiver would pose minor threats to the innovative sector while boosting sales, investment, and jobs in the generic-drugs and biosimilars segment. Among the main benefits would be more investment in pharmaceutical R&D and in manufacturing, \u20ac9.5 billion (US$11 billion) additional net sales for the EU pharmaceutical industry, and the creation of 25,000 direct jobs and 100,000 indirect ones. For the EU generic-drug makers and biosimilar producers, the biggest gain would be from an exemption on their manufacturing SPC drugs for export to third, mainly non- European, countries where SPC protection had expired or does not exist. Export generic-drug sales would go up by an additional \u20ac7.6 billion while sales of branded medicines are expected to fall by only up to \u20ac278 million. The net sales rise would be equivalent to an increase in EU pharmaceutical exports of up to 18%, according to CRA. Biosimilar export sales would increase by nearly \u20ac3 billion. A significant bonus from the broadening of the Bolar exemption would be the likely benefit to EU-based suppliers of APIs at a time when the vast majority of APIs in the European market are being imported from Asia. The CRA study estimated that sales by third-party European generic-API producers could increase by up to 29%, equivalent to an additional \u20ac180 million in annual sales by 2030. Disputes from EFPIA and other consultancies The combined effects of the SPC export waiver and the extension of the Bolar exemption could result in additional EU API sales of \u20ac254 million by the end of the next decade. However, the figures and conclusions of the CRA report are being disputed by other consultancies as well as originator representatives such as EFPIA. \"The potential negative impact of the adoption of an SPC manufacturing waiver on the R&D-based pharmaceutical industry has been underestimated,\" says the EFPIA spokesman. \"Recent studies find that the adoption of such a measure would lead to the loss of between 4500-7700 direct jobs in the [research-based] industry with an additional 19,000-32,000 indirect job losses. It would also result into a decrease of between \u20ac215-\u20ac364 million in R&D investment.\"Also, the opportunities for exporting European generic drugs to non-European markets prior to an SPC expiry had been exaggerated. Often, SPC extensions in Europe during which generic-drug companies could be entitled to a manufacturing waiver, expire earlier or only a little later than the intellectual property rights for medicines in other non-EU markets, according to EFPIA. In a report (6) on the impact of the introduction of SPC exemptions on the biopharmaceuticals sector, Pugatch Consilium, a consultancy in Bicester, England, points out that many non-EU generic-drug and biosimilar markets have erected trade barriers to restrict imports from areas such as Europe. \"Why would India and Brazil or other emerging markets favour European generic [-drug] manufacturers as opposed to their own domestic ones?\" asked David Torstensson, partner at Pugatch and author of the report (6). \"In many cases, they already have a policy framework in place that actively discriminates against foreign competitors,\" he continued. \"Such localization policies often include price preferences in government tenders; import bans and increased taxation on foreign products; and local affiliation and/or production requirements. As a result, locally-produced generic drugs can take as much as 90% of the local generic- drug market in many emerging markets.\" EFPIA has urged that in areas where improvements to the SPC system are considered to be necessary, a non- legislative approach should be taken. Without legislation, there would be no manufacturing waiver, which would be a major disappointment to the generic-drugs and biosimilars sector. It will also reinforce the view within the European pharmaceuticals sector that it needs to act together on key issues like patents and patent exemptions. \"The manufacturing waiver is something which helps the European pharmaceutical industry as a whole,\" says van den Hoven. \"The research-based sector knows it is a good step for the generic drugs and biosimilars sector. If there was something being considered which was good for them, we would not try to block it.\" At the moment, a united front within the industry on matters such as the manufacturing waiver and even other SPC exemptions seems a long way away.

A flurry of acquisitions, an expansion of biotechnology needs, and a growth in new facilities and services offered were seen. The following are some of the highlights. Mergers and acquisitions Acquisitions were robust in 2017, with more than 25 companies making moves to gain new facilities and services. The following are some of the notable mergers and acquisitions of 2017. Recipharm completed the acquisition of Kemwell's pharmaceutical businesses located in Bengaluru, India in February 2017. As part of the transaction, Recipharm also has a right of first negotiation to acquire Kemwell's Indian biopharma business, which was not included in the transaction and will continue to be retained by the sellers. The acquired business, Recipharm Pharmaservices Private Ltd, offers development services and commercial manufacturing of solid, semi-solid, liquid, and topical products. The development business provides formulation development, small-scale manufacturing for clinical trials, and analytical services (1). In April 2017, Sartorius Stedim Biotech (SSB) acquired Umetrics, a specialized provider of data analytics software for development and manufacturing processes headquartered in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. SSB has been a cooperation partner of Umetrics since the end of 2012, distributing and co-marketing their software to players in the biopharmaceutical industry. Umetrics' software has applications in critical process steps of biopharmaceutical manufacture and development, including cell culture processes and specific purification steps (2). Lonza announced in August 2017 that it acquired Micro-Macinazione (Switzerland), a contract manufacturer providing micronization of active ingredients for the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries, from Cross Equity, a Swiss private equity firm. The acquisition boosts Lonza's micronization services at its existing micronization clinical and commercial manufacturing site in Quakertown, PA, which Lonza gained through its previous US$5.5-billion acquisition of Capsugel (US) in early July 2017 (3). In September 2017, Roquette completed its acquisition of Itacel, an excipient division of Blanver, a Brazilian multinational company specializing in the development, manufacture, and commercialization of raw materials and drugs. The acquisition is part of a series of investments made by Roquette to position itself globally, according to the company (4). PCI Pharma Services (PCI) acquired Millmount Healthcare, a pharmaceutical and healthcare contract packaging services provider, in October. Millmount provides services in blister packaging, bottling, and tub filling, as well as in late-stage customization and cold chain packaging services. The acquisition supports PCI's efforts to expand its clinical trial service offerings. The addition of Millmount, based near Dublin, Ireland, will be PCI's fourth acquisition outside of the United States in four years (5). Partnerships Sanofi and Lonza announced on 27 Feb. 2017 that they have entered into a strategic partnership to build and operate a large-scale mammalian cell culture facility for monoclonal antibody production in Visp, Switzerland. The strategic partnership enables Sanofi to react quickly to fluctuations in demand in a short timeframe, reinforcing their capability to launch biologic medicines and ensure consistent access for patients. It also provides Lonza with needed capacities to respond to growing manufacturing demands for large-scale mammalian cell culture-based therapeutic proteins (6). Vetter and medical-device company Microdermics entered into a strategic cooperation agreement to develop innovative microneedle drug-delivery systems in May 2017. The companies have joined forces to enable the progress of the microneedle technology to late-stage process development and device manufacture on a commercial scale. Vetter's primary role will be in the fill/finish aspect, but the it will also jointly conduct proof-of-concept studies on selected drugs and drug classes. Vetter will jointly design devices for testing, including how to integrate the microneedle technology into injection devices (7). In June 2017, Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH and Rentschler Fill Solutions GmbH announced a strategic partnership to provide new fill/finish facilities and solutions for biopharmaceutical products. Under the terms of the agreement, Rentschler Fill Solutions will serve as the exclusive partner for the fill/finish services of Rentschler Biotechnologie's manufacturing projects. Rentschler Fill Solutions is owned by the Rentschler family and will begin operations in mid-2018. In addition to servicing Rentschler Biotechnologie's clients, Rentschler Fill Solutions will offer its fill/finish services on a clinical as well as commercial scale to its own client base. The company will employ advanced aseptic filling technology at the Rentschler Fill Solutions facility in Austria (8). Recipharm announced on 20 Sep. 2017 a long-term manufacturing pact with Roche. The pact will add \u20ac35 million to Recipharm's annual sales, matching more than 6% of the company's current sales. Under the agreement, Recipharm will acquire a manufacturing facility located in Legan\u00e9s, Spain, from Roche. The Outsourcing: A Year in Review In a productive year, 2017 was filled with acquisitions, facility expansions, and new biopharma technology. OUTSOURCING REVIEW 12 Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.comOutsourcing Review pact will also extend a collaborative opportunity to Recipharm's nearby facility in Parets, Spain (9). In September 2017, Recipharm also signed a contract with Kancera for the development and manufacture of drug candidate KAND567 as a capsule formulation for oral administration. Recipharm will develop the preparation required for effective release of KAND567 from the capsules, as well as manufacturing the pharmaceutical product. The work will be performed at Recipharm's development facility in Solna, Sweden (10). SGS announced on 12 Oct. 2017 that it has entered into a collaboration with biotech company Bavarian Nordic A/S to develop a new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) challenge strain. The collaboration will assist with the advancement of a universal vaccine candidate designed to induce protective immune responses against both subtypes (A and B) of RSV. The project will build upon the results of Phase II trials conducted by Bavarian Nordic, and will include a human challenge study, which will be carried out at the SGS Clinical Pharmacology Unit in Antwerp, Belgium, using the new RSV challenge strain, once it has been fully developed and validated (11). New facilities MilliporeSigma announced in January 2017 the opening of a facility in Mollet des Vall\u00e8s, Spain dedicated to the manufacture of meglumine, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved excipient for pharmaceuticals and a component of medical imaging contrast media. The FDA-validated facility in Spain is solely dedicated to the production of meglumine, an amino sugar derived from glucose (12). On 26 Jan. 2017, Almac Group announced that as part of its ongoing global expansion, the company has secured a new facility in Dundalk, County Louth, Ireland. The new facility will be located at IDA Business Park. The new facility will increase the group's European footprint by 32,000 ft 2 (13). In February 2017, Novasep announced the opening of its new \u20ac11-million bioconjugation unit in the company's Le Mans site in France. The 2000-m 2 facility includes two flexible GMP production suites equipped with 10-L to 400-L vessels to support both clinical and commercial manufacturing of antibody-drug conjugates. The stand-alone facility is purpose-built and offers R&D services, quality control, and scale-up laboratories (14). Eurofins Scientific announced on 20 Mar. 2017 that it will be establishing a pharmaceutical chemistry and microbiology facility in Livingston, Scotland. The announcement follows Eurofins' acquisition of Exova's pharmaceutical, food, and water testing business in the United Kingdom and Ireland in July 2016, and the subsequent purchase of ILS's pharmaceutical business in October 2016 (15). FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies announced in September 2017 the opening of its new 10,000-ft 2 cell culture Process Development Laboratories in Wilton Centre, Teesside in the United Kingdom. The laboratories were built through a JPY 1-billion (US$9-million) investment, part of a greater JPY 14-billion (US$130-million) expansion. The new laboratories will be dedicated to supporting activities in the Saturn mAb Platform (16). Sartorius announced on 13 Sept. 2017 the official opening of its new facility for the manufacture of laboratory instruments in the Sartorius Campus in the industrial zone of Grone in Goettingen, Germany. Approximately \u20ac42 million has been invested into the 25,000-m 2 building, representing the largest single investment of the Sartorius Campus (17). Sartorius Stedim Cellca is building a new \u20ac30-million Cell Culture Technology Centre at Science Park III in Eselsberg, situated at the northwestern scientific hub in Ulm, Germany, the company announced on 28 Sep. 2017. The new laboratory and office complex will approximately double the company's space and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019 (18). References 1.

Synthesizing the recipe for success can be daunting, especially in the current uncertain business and regulatory environment. More complex molecules demand more sophisticated formulation methods. Advanced technology for pharmaceutical manufacturing will increase the required skill sets of bio/pharma workers. The industry also faces gaps in know-how and expertise as experienced employees retire. These factors suggest a challenge for bio/pharma employers and a positive employment picture for bio/pharma employees seeking to start or advance careers in the bio/pharmaceutical industry. Mix in financial pressures from shareholders and payers, pressure to reduce costs, and business and regulatory uncertainties related to Brexit, however, and the final result may be conflicts between employer priorities and employee career paths. Respondents to Pharmaceutical Technology/ Pharmaceutical Technology Europe's annual employment survey (1) shared opinions about the current employment environment, expressed reservations about compensation and workloads, and indicated that better career opportunities were a top priority. While respondents based in Europe generally agreed with their counterparts in the United States and around the world, there were some significant differences. More than 45% of the Europe-based respondents reported that business increased in 2017 compared to 2016. Respondents felt \"more secure\" in their positions in 2017 (21.9%) versus 18.6% in 2016 (2); however, more respondents said they felt less secure in 2017 (26.6%) compared with 25.8% in 2016. Opinions about the job market varied. Nearly one-half of the Europe-based respondents said the job market was moderately competitive, compared with 44.3% for the global audience. Alternately, 21.6% of the Europe-based audience (25% for global audience) said the market for jobs was competitive; there are more qualified candidates than open jobs. The remaining 30% said there are few qualified applicants for open positions and employers must compete for qualified candidates. Survey respondent profile More than 480 bio/pharma professionals from around the globe\u2014nearly 20% from Europe\u2014responded to the survey, which was fielded in September and October 2017. Respondents primarily were full-time, permanent employees (87.3% of respondents) at innovator bio/pharmaceutical companies (33.8%), generic-drug manufacturing companies (11.6%), contract research and manufacturing organizations (15.8%), and consulting firms (6.4%). The represented companies develop or manufacture both small- and large-molecule drugs, vaccines, and cell therapy or regenerative medicines for privately held companies (40.4%), publicly traded companies (40.2%), and non-profit/academic/ government groups (14.2%). Respondents reported a range of job responsibilities, from R&D, to manufacturing, to quality control/assurance.

Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 172017 Employment Survey responses work for companies with more than 5000 employees; 32% work for companies with fewer than 500 employees. Compared with previous years, the Europe-based respondents reported more experience working in the bio/pharma industry; 26.8% had fewer than 10 years of experience, 30.8% had 10-20 years, 35.9% had 20-35 years of experience, and 6.4% have worked in the industry for more than 35 years. About half of the respondents worked outside the bio/pharma industry for up to five years. More work, less play ... Workloads increased slightly in 2017, with 64.2% reporting increases compared with 56.6% in 2016. Almost one-third of the respondents (32.9%) say they worked more hours in 2017 than two years ago, similar to responses in previous years. While 47.3% of Europe-based respondents (56.3% for US respondents) said they were contracted to work approximately 40 hours per week, only 25.7% (21.6% for US) reported working 40 hours. More than 17% (31.4% for US respondents) said they were contracted for more than 40 hours per week; however, 52.7% of the respondents (more than 70% for US) said they work 40 or more hours per week. Vacation and paid time off benefits were more generous in Europe; 87% of the European-based respondents reported four or more weeks of paid vacation, compared with 43.3% for US respondents. Of all respondents, 27.3% reported that they used their full allotment of vacation, personal, and sick time. A similar percentage (22.5%) said they used less than half of the available time off. European-based respondents (70%) were more likely to use at least three-quarters of their paid time off compared to US-based respondents (57.4%). But more pay Salaries were up globally; in Europe, 58.7% reported a salary increase in 2017, up from 48.7% in 2016. Satisfaction with salary levels improved compared to the past two years; however, more than half (54.7%) were dissatisfied with their compensation. Similar to the global audience responses, 40% of the respondents said they were paid at the low end of the salary range for their job function for their expertise and responsibility; 14.7% said they were paid below market value. In for the long term? While three-quarters of the respondents have more than 10 years of experience in bio/pharma, 35% stayed with the same employer\u2014on average\u2014for less than five years compared with 24.9% for the global audience. More than one-third of the 2017 respondents said they stayed with an employer for an average of 6-10 years; 31.2% stayed with the same employer for more than 10 years. In addition to salary and benefits, employee recognition can play a role in job satisfaction. Similar to the global audience responses, most Europe-based respondents said their work is fully valued by their employer (25.4% strongly agreed; 54.9% agreed). More than 80% of respondents said their skills and training are used to the fullest level. Only 52% see opportunity for career advancement in their current position; 62% reported opportunities for professional advancement at their current companies, slightly lower rates than reported by the US audience. Career intangibles Compared with responses from the global audience, Europe-based respondents express strong opinions about single factors that would motivate them to change jobs; professional advancement (38.8%), work/life balance (37.3%), and intellectual challenge (31.3%) were the top factors. Similarly, the respondents from Europe were more likely to define single factors as \"the main reason I come to work;\" intellectual stimulation (40.3%), challenging projects (35.8%), and relationships with colleagues (30%) were the top reasons cited. Overall, respondents were tolerant of negative workplace activity; only a small fraction cited factors that would cause them to quit their jobs; issues with management (19.4%), work/life balance (14.9%), a long commute (12.1%), and discrimination (11.9%) were most frequently cited. Seeking better employment opportunities More than half of the 2017 respondents (54.9%) \"agreed somewhat\" or \"agreed strongly\" that they would \"like to leave their job, given the opportunity,\" up slightly from 2016. More than one-third said they were \"likely to leave my job voluntarily in the coming year;\" only 9.9% expected to leave their job involuntarily. In a somewhat concerning result, nearly 20% said they would like to change careers and leave the bio/pharma industry. While the desire to change positions is strong, the number of people actually changing jobs is significantly less, but growing. In 2016, 17.1% of respondents reported a voluntary job change; in 2017, that number jumped to 28.2%. Confidence levels of those seeking new bio/pharma positions continued to rise in 2017; 26.9% said it would be straightforward to find a comparable new job; 47.8% said it may take a while, but they would be able to find a comparable position. The percentage of less- optimistic job seekers declined slightly, 13.4% said it would be straightforward to find a job, but the new job probably would not be as good as the current position; 11.9% anticipated a difficult search and they would have taken whatever position was available.

PTE 18 Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.comPharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 19 timquo/shutterstock.comThe pharmaceutical industry is mainly dominated by tablet formulations, but softgels are gaining widespread acceptance as a preferred dosage form. \"Softgel capsules are a popular dosage form in the consumer healthcare market because of their unique benefits, such as ease of swallowing and quicker onset of action in relation to tablet formulations,\" says Kaspar van den Dries, senior director of formulation sciences, solid dosage forms, and softgels at Patheon, part of Thermo Fisher. \"These are important considerations for patients when they are choosing treatment of pain or allergies.\" He also notes that a softgel formulation can be used for lifecycle management approaches to prescription, generic, and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, for cases in which softgel technologies can be used to generate improved versions of existing drugs. \"In the consumer healthcare market, there are plenty of examples of softgel success stories. Compounds such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac, when formulated into softgels, have improved performance, which is an important consideration for the patients,\" van den Dries highlights. \"Another example is chewable ibuprofen, a softgel formulation specifically designed for patients having difficulty swallowing. This product was launched through a lifecycle management approach to existing children's suspension products and has been well-received in the European market.\" According to van den Dries, it is increasingly difficult and complex to develop new compounds, especially with the majority of lead compounds in the drug development pipeline presenting with solubility and bioavailability challenges. \"In this case, a lipid- based formulation in a softgel capsule can provide significant advances by improving the bioavailability of these compounds and increasing the chance to obtain proof of concept for these molecules,\" he explains. \"Softgel is still the most popular enabling formulation for bioavailability enhancement, compared to other solubilization approaches such as spray drying, hot melt extrusion, or particle size reduction,\" van den Dries says, highlighting that most products Adeline Siew, PhD being approved to date are lipid- based formulations. \"Softgels based on lipid formulations make use of the body's digestive pathways. This approach is, therefore, a well- established route for improving bioavailability, but it is sometimes overlooked or considered as a key risk in development, mainly because of time and cost pressures in early development, as companies don't want to overspend in early development, when the probability of success is still low. The experienced formulators and senior management responsible for these compounds are aware of these risks and options to reduce them. However, because not all companies have the internal experience or know-how on softgel technologies, you still see programmes with suboptimal formulations, which could have been mitigated by considering softgel formulations early in development.\" There are also other areas where softgel formulations are being considered, observes van den Dries. \"For example, softgels can provide reduced exposure for highly potent compounds (because no powders are involved in the manufacturing process) and improved uniformity for low-dose APIs compared to tablets,\" he says. Softgel versus liquid-filled hardgel capsules In terms of the manufacturing process, softgels provide a number of benefits over liquid-filled hardgel capsules. \"Liquid-filled hardgel capsules are produced through a two-step process. The first step is to fill a two-piece hardgel cap with liquid, and the second step is the subsequent banding of these capsules. Small-scale batches are produced using a different type of equipment from that used to make commercial-scale Opportunities with Softgels Softgel capsules are a popular dosage form among patients but they also provide a number of manufacturing benefits over liquid-filled hardgel capsules. \"Softgels based on lipid formulations make use the body's digestive pathways.\" \u2014van den Dries, PatheonFormulation batches,\" explains van den Dries. \"In contrast, the production of softgel capsules, for both large- and small-scale batches, can be done on the same equipment without the necessity of banding. This flexibility provides significant cost advantages, both on unit price and total development costs. In addition, a softgel formulation is more versatile. By changing the composition of the fill or the gel material, you can obtain a chewable, gummy formulation that makes the medication easy to ingest for children, or people who have difficulty swallowing (e.g., elderly). With softgels, there are also opportunities to create an enteric-release formulation, or even a controlled-release, abuse-deterrent formulation. All of these formulations can be produced on the same equipment. Globally, there is more capacity available in softgel manufacturing than there is available for liquid-filled hardgel capsules, hence, providing more flexibility in the supply chain of products. The burst strength test Softgels are dynamic systems where the fill and shell compositions, fill-shell interaction, and process parameters can have a substantial influence on the softgel integrity, highlights Melanie Bayarri, formulation development scientist at Patheon, part of Thermo Fisher Scientific. She observes that with increasing quality requirements, there is a need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to focus on making smart choices early in the development programme. \"The Bringing together the benefits of lipid-based formulations and modified-release drug delivery Lipid-based systems with modified-re lease profiles present excit- ing opportunities for drug developers. \"On the one hand, lipid-based formulations provide benefits such as solubility and permeability en- hancement, modulation of transporter, elimination of food effects, re- duction of inter-patient and intra-patient variability, greater API load- ing, and the avoidance of dose dump ing,\" observes Julien Meissonnier, vice-president of Science & Technology at Catalent. \"On the other, with extended or sustained drug release, dosing frequency can be reduced; peaks and troughs of drug levels in the blood are dampened, which consequently optimizes therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing concentration-dependent adverse effects.\" Meissonnier explains that in some cases, conventional approaches for modified-release drug delivery may prove difficult because of physico- chemical and pharmacokinetic challenges posed by the drug compounds. \" F o r e x a m p l e , m o s t A P I s i n t o d a y ' s d e v e l o p m e n t p i p e l i n e a r e p o o r l y soluble or poorly permeable, and some have low melting points. When these physico-chemical challenges are not addressed properly by the formulation technology, it often results in extensive positive food effects, which when combined with a narrow therapeutic window, can trigger a potential risk to the patient, with the potential risk of dose dumping,\" he says. \"Modified-release lipid-based form ulations in softgel capsules can address these challenges. For poorly soluble compounds, lipid-based formulations promote solubilization along the gastrointestinal tract; whereas for poorly permeable compounds, lipid-based systems facilitate transcellular or paracellular transport by exploiting the lipid assimilation pathway as well as potential uptake through the lymphatic pathways. Lipid ex cipients can be used to modul ate transporter and pre-systemic metabolism. All these mechanisms result in increased drug exposure, re- duction of inter-patient and intra-patient variability, and elimination of food effects,\" he explains. \"In addition, dose dumping can be eliminated with lipid-based matrix systems.\" The dosage form of choice for a modified-release lipid-based formula- tion is a soft capsule. \"Soft capsules are the proven dosage form for lipid- based formulations,\" says Meissonnier. \"They have good developability and manufacturability. They are compatible with the wider range of lipid liquid and semi-solid excipients and fo rmulations. Moreover, soft capsules do not compromise the performance of the lipid-based fill.\"According to Meissonnier, there are various ways of modifying the release of actives through the lipid-based fill or the soft capsule shell. \"Whereas monolithic softgels can be designed, the preference would be to leverage multi-particulate soft-gel atin capsules to further reduce vari- ability. These softgels can be designed to have a solid lipid matrix core that will extend release rate through an erosion diffusion process. The other option is a film-coated soft-gelatin capsule with a liquid fill where the drug release profile is facilitated using coated beadlets, and con-trolled by the nature of the coating polymer.\" Meissonnier cites a case study where an extended-release lipid-based formulation was developed using Catalent's OptiShell soft capsule tech- nology. The formulation was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2016. \"This is the first FDA-approved treatment using OptiShell soft capsule technology to deliver an extended-release semisolid formulation in a softgel format,\" says Meissonnier. \"The active ingredients are used to increase vitamin D levels, but peak concentrations or 'surges' in 25-hy- dro xyvitamin D 3 lev els induce the expression of the metabolizing en- zyme Cytochrome P450 subfamily 24, inhibition of parathyroid hormone,\" he explains. \"Controlling the drug release maintains 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels in the blood above the 30 ng/mL concentration, avoiding peaks that result in lesser activity. In addition, gradual repletion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 could provide more predictable maintenance of serum levels below the poorly defined safe upper limit of approximately 100 ng/mL, allowing for more consistent dosage.\" The product's controlled-release system is a and, according to Meissonnier, \"lipid-based matrices, in which the drug is homogeneously dispersed/dissolved, are the system of choice for low-dose potent compounds. Catalent's OptiShell soft capsule tech- nology uses a precisely controlled hot-filling process for encapsulation of the lipid-based matrix, providing content uniformity performance above standard oral solid forms.\" He adds that the patented shell com- position can handle encapsulation of high-temperature fill formulations for semisolid and highly viscous fi ll formulations. It can also handle higher pH fill formulations. \u2014Adeline Siew, PhD 20 Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.comFormulation burst strength test is an important technique to support formulation and process choices made throughout softgel product development. It is an established method to assess softgels shell robustness,\" she says. \"It is performed with a Dr. Schleuniger Pharmatron 400 N model 6D(SG) softgel tester. The apparatus is similar to a tablet tester and compliant with the specifications as laid down in the European Pharmacopoeia \u2014 Chapter 2.9.8 (1) and the United States Pharmacopeia \u2014Chapter <1217> (2). It is easy to operate,\" Bayarri explains. \"A softgel sample is placed individually between two jaws that compresses it at a fixed rate of 2.5 mm/second until the sample bursts or until the maximum force of 400 N. The force (N) required to burst the sample is recorded and in case the softgel does not burst, the result is noted as > 400N,\" she says. \"The evaluation of softgels shell robustness is not only based on the number of bursts and the withstood force before burst, but also on the relative shell flexibility as the apparatus records as well the diameter (mm) of the softgels before compression and at maximum compression,\" Bayarri highlights. \"Using this test, we can evaluate the influence of critical parameters on the softgels shell robustness related to the formulation design (e.g., fill formulation, gel formulation, fill-gel interaction), process design (e.g., die design, ribbon thickness, hardness, and drying time), and storage temperature.\" \"During product development, we assess softgel shell robustness using the burst strength test, and we have been able to establish a good correlation between the burst strength test Advances in transdermal patch drug delivery and measurement Medherant, a bioadhesives company formed as a spin-out from the University of Warwick (UK) in 2015, is developing its TEPI Patch technology, a higher-dosage drug-delivery patch with a constant rate of drug release. The patch is formulated by mixing the drug with an adhesive that enables high drug loading. The co mpany's first patch, containing ibuprofen, is being manufactured for clinical trials. Dr. Gabit Nurumbetov, principal scientist at Medherant, has developed an improved instru- ment to test the release of drugs from a transdermal patch. The device, patented by Medher- ant, is an improved, miniaturized, and multiplexed version of a Franz or diffusion cell, which is a device commonly used to measure the amount of drug that permeates across human skin. \"In essence, the cell is a vial with a modified top part where you can place human skin and your formulation (gel, cream, or patch). The volume below the skin is filled with a biological fluid, which is taken out for analysis through a sampling port,\" explains Nurumbetov. \"The amount of drug permeated across the skin is then measured by means of chromatographic or/and spectroscopic methods allowing estimation of parameters such as API flux, patch area efficacy, and others.\" The improved diffusion cell, which is patented by Medherant, can test more than 100 for- mulations per day, compared to approximately 12 in the same period with traditional Franz cells, reports the company. Drug release in a transdermal formulation is complex. \"It is affected by physico-chemical properties of the adhesive and drug and the presence or absence of additional excipients in a formulation,\" says Nurumbetov. \"Some adhesives can chemically 'hold' drug molecules leading to a lesser amount of drug delivered. Also, if the molar mass of a drug is higher than 500 Daltons, it is likely to be not suitable fo r transdermal applications. Additional chemicals (permeation enhancers) in the formulation can also affect the drug-delivery performance.\" The new instrument will allow high-throughput testing for faster development. \u2014Jennifer Markarian\"Softgels are dynamic systems where the fill and shell compositions, fill-shell interaction, and process parameters can have a substantial influence on the softgel integrity.\" \u2014Bayarri, Patheon The ISO/IEC 17025 Calibration NIST Reference Material Producer Lifetime Guarantee Fast Recalibration Service 4001REFERENCE MATERIALS 0659 Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 21results and product performance,\" Bayarri says.

PTEFormulation Critical parameters in transdermal patch manufacturing A QbD approach can address manufacturing complexities Transdermal patches are used to deliver drugs through the skin for ei- ther a local or systemic effect. This route can improve patient compliance by avoiding the difficulties associated with swallowing or with injecting drugs. T ransdermal patch manufacturing, however , is relatively complex because it generally has more process parameters and material attributes that can impact performance, compared to some other dosage forms, says Cormac Lyons, vice-president of R&D at Tapemark, a contract manufac- turing organization specializing in transdermal pat ches , oral thin films , and topical drug delivery. A quality-by-design approach can help address these complexities, he says. Pharmaceutical Technology Europe spoke with Lyons to learn more about the manufacturing parameters and quality control testing involved in transdermal patch manufacturing. Critical attributes PTE: What are the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of a transdermal patch? Lyons (Tapemark): The CQAs of a transdermal patch are the attributes essential or detrimental to the product's safety and efficacy. These may include: drug delivery, drug dissolution, patch assay, content uniformity, residual solvents, patch adhesion, patch removal from liner, adhesive shear resistance, adhesive cold flow, bioburden, crystallization, skin sen- sitization, and product stability in primary packaging. These CQAs will be different based on the type of patch being developed. PTE: What are the critical material attributes (CMAs) or critical process- ing parameters (CPPs) that affect these CQAs?Lyons (Tapemark): There are CMAs and CPPs for each process involved in developing a transdermal patch: blending, coating, con- verting (i.e., making the coated film into the finished patches), and pouching (i.e., packaging individual patches). The CMAs are associated both with the raw materials and the intermediate materials made from these raw materials. In blending for example, the raw materials are the adhesive, the API, and the different excipients. The viscosity of the adhesive and the purity and particle size of the API are important CMAs for these raw materials. The resulting blend is the raw material for th e coating process. After blending, the intermediate blend's CMAs are homoge neity, viscosity, and solids con- tent. The blend CPPs that impact the fi nal blend CMAs are blending time, speed, and equipment design. Another example is the coating process. In this process, the blend CMAs of homogeneity, viscosity, and solids contents are key because they will impact the drug-in-adhesive laminate (another intermediate) CMAs such as drug homogeneity, assay, and residual solvents. In addition, the CPPs that also impact the CMAs of the output drug-in-adhesiv e l aminate are coating thickness, line speed , and drying conditions. Quality control PTE: What quality control tests should be performed on patches? Lyons (Tapemark): There are specific quality control tests for each of the CQAs noted previously. Two main types of testing are in-process test- ing and finished-product testing. In-process testing involves understanding how materials are af- fected during manufacturing. This testing can help create a more robust production process and ensure the right controls are in place. In-process testing can include methods to ensure the blending process has achieved a homogenous mix. It also can include measuring and quantifying adhesion characteristics throughout the manufacturing process. Finished-product testing analyzes the final product's physical proper- ties to help ensure the patch is produced with the desired physical charac- teristics and performs as expected. Adhesion and tack testing, for example, can help determine if the product will adhere to a user's skin for a given period of time . Manufacturers must first define what levels of adhesion level and tack are required in a fi nished product and then implement the methods or tools to measure for those levels. \u2014Jennifer Markarian 22 Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.com cristi180884/shutterstock.comNEW CHECK OUT PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGY'S ALL NEW MARKET RESOURCE!

Most pharmaceutical companies and some contract manufacturers have embraced continuous manufacturing to some degree for both drug substance and drug product manufacturing. Several factors are considered when determining whether batch or flow production methods are warranted. Considering the hazards The switch from batch to flow chemistry is often driven by the need to perform hazardous reactions, according to Matthew M. Bio, president and CEO of Snapdragon Chemistry. \"Flow chemistry is an excellent way to deal with gas/liquid reactions and reactions that are run under high pressures, at high temperatures, or that involve unstable intermediates that require low temperatures,\" he says. At Hovione, the hazard source is first identified. In addition to the above examples, highly exothermic reactions and reactions with highly toxic/corrosive reactants are also good candidates, according to Rui Loureiro, director R&D process chemistry development with the company. \"Reactions that involve hazards that cannot be easily controlled under batch conditions are typically performed using flow chemistry,\" he says. Loureiro does note, however, that not all hazardous reactions are automatically switched to flow chemistry. \"Many catalytic hydrogenations and hydrolysis reactions have been performed in batch for a long time in a safe manner. In such cases where safety is not compromised, the decision to move to flow should consider the required throughput versus the investment in time and costs,\" he observes. Reactions that involve suspensions are also often a challenge in flow chemistry, particularly during the development stages using smaller equipment, according to Filipe Ata\u00edde, team leader of Hovione's continuous manufacturing group. \"Such processes often must be studied at much lower concentrations, which can make CCyynnthhhiaaa AA. CCChhaallleenneeerr is a contributing editor to Pharmaceutical Technology Europe.Hazardous Chemistry: Choosing Batch or Flow aadvantaggges.it difficult to define the benefits of flow versus what can be achieved in the batch process,\" he comments. The reaction time/rate is usually the primary indicator as to whether the reaction is practical in flow, according to Bio. Long reaction times would result in tubular or continuous stirred-tank reactors that are quite large. For these slow reactions, however, flow chemistry still presents opportunities. \"With the expanded processing windows available in flow (e.g., pressure, temperature), many reactions that at first glance would appear as poor candidates for flow can be successfully developed as continuous processes,\" he asserts. Knowing the process kinetics also helps convert batch processes to flow, since the equipment can be designed to fit the kinetics, agrees Rudi Oliveira, an R&D chemist in Hovione's continuous manufacturing group. \"The decision to use flow chemistry in a process should be taken as soon as possible, however, and preferably at the start of process development so reactors can be designed early and delays be avoided,\" he notes. Equipment and cost considerations Designing the equipment setup is key in flow conditions, according to Loureiro. While the equipment must be assembled to obtain the best performance out of the process, it should also mitigate the different hazards. \"One example is a very fast reaction (< 1 sec) that produces a significant exotherm. The equipment designed for this process must be dimensioned to perform the reaction in the appropriate time, but it should also be capable of removing the heat generated efficiently,\" he explains. Loureiro also notes that a variety of engineering solutions have been developed over the years to make it possible to perform certain hazardous processes safely in flow and avoid the use of expensive reagents or long synthetic routes that in batch would be required to work around those issues. Ata\u00edde points to tube-in-tube technology for gas/liquid reactions, which 24 Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.comAPI Synthesis and Manufacturing provides a different type of control at the interface between the two phases than is possible when simply bubbling a gas into the liquid phase, as an example. \"The evolution of flow chemistry is highly dependent on the engineering solutions that are developed,\" adds Loureiro. The arrival of 3D-printed reactors is a good step toward the required flexibility to better address the various chemistries. From a larger perspective, according to Bio, as flow chemistry has successfully moved from a laboratory curiosity to an actual production technology, there are opportunities to use continuous manufacturing not just as a tool to address a single problematic step, but as a technology that allows new opportunities, both technical and economic, when an entire process end-to-end can be done in flow. He also notes that while the cost of developing a commercial batch process need not be paid until late in development, the cost of flow processes is generally paid up front, but in the long run can be significantly lower. \"Flow provides unique opportunities in automation that promise to greatly reduce the cost of development,\" Bio says. Snapdragon is currently building an autonomous flow chemical development platform that promises to dramatically speed the discovery and development of flow processes. Reasons for going with the flow Flow chemistry is typically safer for hazardous reactions due to downsizing of the reactivity zone, which also provides increased heat and mass transfer, and higher precision in controlling process parameters, according to Oliveira. \"A flow system will always have a much smaller volume of reactive stream and thus is intrinsically safer than batch,\" Bio explains. Flow systems are also typically small footprint reactors, so containment for highly potent APIs is much easier. Flow typically also provides much greater control over the process variables that could impact product quality, even if the quality of the input material is variable, which can result in improved product quality relative to batch, adds Bio. From an economic perspective, flow systems typically have significantly lower capital costs than a comparable batch reactor and are readily automated, resulting in lower operating costs, according to Bio. Barriers to switching from batch to continuous Despite the fact that flow chemistry can enable hazardous reactions to be performed on a commercial scale that cannot be safely conducted under batch conditions, barriers to the advancement of flow chemistry do exist. \"The biggest barrier is the lack of expertise needed by process development chemists. To truly develop robust and scalable flow processes, practitioners need to have a good understanding of physical chemistry and reaction design, skill sets not widely available,\" says Bio. Electrical engineering and computer programming expertise are also needed for effective implementation of automation and real-time analytical technologies, also skills that many process development professionals do not have. Bio also notes that collaboration is needed between chemists, engineers, and analytical scientists. From a technical standpoint, Bio notes that the laboratory tools available for flow chemistry development today typically don't easily translate to pilot or commercial scale, which inhibits adoption of the technology. To address this issue, Snapdragon has developed laboratory platforms that directly translate to pilot-scale platforms to facilitate a rapid design to delivery cycle. More analytical tools specifically designed to work with flow systems are also needed. \"It is through these analytical tools and the integration of them into the process control strategy where the true power of flow over batch is to be realized,\" Bio states. Real potential for supply chain improvements The combination of small footprint and low capital and operating costs allows for new ideas in supply-chain management and supply risk mitigation, according to Bio. \"Multiple flow plants can be built and deployed to ensure robust supply chains. The low cost also means that there is minimal penalty for over building production capacity, which can eliminate the risk of drug shortages.\" In addition, Bio says that process development chemists should strive to eliminate hazards where ever possible, and flow chemistry can be a critical tool. Rather than storing hundreds of tons of temperature- sensitive intermediates on site for use in batch processes, small flow reactors can be used to convert stable, non-hazardous precursors to the required intermediates on-demand. \"An on-demand flow system is an intrinsically safer situation where no explosion can occur,\" Bio says. This approach would also eliminate the need for trucks and rail cars to carry hazardous materials around the country. \"The supply chain for most, if not all, of these materials could be re-imagined in terms of on-demand, point-of-use manufacture. Not only would this greatly reduce the human, environmental, and national security risk, but also create resilient supply chains able to tolerate local disruptions,\" he continues. \"The question really should be, why do we need to run hazardous chemistry in batch; flow should be the default,\" Health and Quintiles are now IQVIA - created to advance your pursuits of human science by unleashing the power of data science and human ingenuity.

HUMAN DATA SCIENCE Research & Development | Real-World Value & Outcomes Commercialization | TechnologiesEverett Historical/shutterstock.com Lyophilization, or freeze drying, was a crucial development in pharmaceutical manufacturing, because it allowed heat-sensitive vaccines, antibiotics, and protein-based drugs to be dried safely. The process results in powders with long shelf lives that can be reconstituted at the point of use. Its strategic importance continues to grow, as injectable biopharmaceuticals become a more prominent part of the overall drug market. In 1998, lyophilized pharmaceuticals accounted for 11.9% of all new injectable or infusible drugs, but, by 2015, they made up half of all such new drug introductions (1). The process is used widely to process monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, and half of the world's 10 top-selling drugs are lyophilized. Yet, the basic pharmaceutical freeze drying process has seen little change since it was introduced in the 1940s (lyophilization made a considerable difference during World War II in allowing medicines such as penicillin (Photo) to be shipped long distances and remain stable). According to experts who work in the field, lyophilization remains one of the most time-consuming and expensive of pharma's unit operations, with energy efficiency of less than 5%, dominance of open loop processing, and lack of inline quality monitoring technology (2). Experts see uncertainty and debate, at the individual facility level, over best operational practices. \"'Because it's always been done that way' is an all too common response,\" scientists noted in a white paper. Even such basic questions as where to place the sensor in a vial to monitor the process can provoke disagreement (3). To help reduce variability and develop more uniform, consistent, and efficient lyophilization processes, the National Institute of Standards and Technology funded the Advanced Lyophilization Technology Hub (LyoHUB) as part of its advanced manufacturing technology consortium in 2014. Based at Purdue University, its members\u201414 pharmaceutical manufacturers and equipment vendors, as well as universities, independent consultants, and scientists with regulatory agencies\u2014are developing more modern approaches to lyophilization equipment design, analytics, instrumentation, training, and control. The group launched a demonstration facility at Purdue University in 2016 to facilitate R&D and pilot testing.Agnes ShanleyIn September 2017, LyoHUB released a 10-year technology roadmap for pharmaceutical freeze drying, identifying priorities for lyophilization in terms of process technology, training, analytical methods, and equipment design. The roadmap reflects the opinions of more than 100 industry and academic experts whose views were elicited, analyzed, and summarized using methods developed at Cambridge University (4). LyoHUB members currently view the development of sensors and instrumentation, including wireless sensors, and process models for primary drying as key short-term priorities for the industry. They have also been focusing on publishing \"best practices\" papers in open-access journals to summarize current practices and describe the state of research into alternatives. One of the first white papers describes best practices for process monitoring (3). Inherent complexity Part of the reason why pharma may still be on a learning curve in understanding lyophilization is because the multi- step process is so complex compared with other pharma operations. \"Lyophilization involves complex heat and mass transfer,\" explained Alina Alexeenko, Purdue University professor of aeronautics and astronautics and co-director of LyoHUB, in an April 2017 webcast (5) on the use of modelling in lyophilization. Each water molecule undergoes four phase-change transitions,she said, while, in the primary drying step, the heat-transfer processes are complex. Some of them are pressure dependent and others cn be very sensitive to differences between container types and even to the finishes on the surfaces of vials or containers, she noted. LyoHUB is advocating greater use of modelling and simulation, including advanced modelling tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). First used in aeronautics Modernizing Lyophilization A technology roadmap aims to drive and consolidate improvements in a process that has remained unchanged for more than 70 years. Despite lyophilization's growing importance, the basic process has not changed much since the 1940s. 28 Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.comLyophilization and aerospace applications, CFD simulations can offer more detailed views of what's happening in the equipment than sensor information alone can give, showing important details about vapour concentration and temperature and pressure distribution, Alexeenko said. For example, Alexeenko recalled one industrial-scale lyophilizer design that was studied. Researchers found that a relatively short section of clean-in-place and steam-in-place (CIP and SIP) piping, which accounted for roughly 3% of the equipment's area, resulted in a 20% reduction in vapour flow rate and overall throughput. More widespread use of modelling and CFD programmes, such as Siemens' Star CCM, could help improve lyophilizer design and allow existing equipment to be used more efficiently, and LyoHUB is advancing those efforts. Among other goals mentioned most prominently in LyoHUB's roadmap are: Development of continuous or semi-continuous processes based on technologies that include spray freezing, agitated vacuum drying, rotary shell freeze drying, and electrospinning. Over the past few years, the food industry has moved to continuous operations, resulting in tremendous gains in product uniformity. LyoHUB members expect the same to be possible for pharmaceutical freeze drying. Use of improved heating methods involving infrared heaters or volumetric heating via microwave, which would allow for closer control of the process. Use of spray-freeze drying, particularly for making bulk APIs. Alternative sterilization methods, such as hydrogen peroxide and cold-plasma sterilization. Steam sterilization, using steam at temperatures above 120 \u00b0C, is most often used. The process, however, involves heating and recooling, resulting in equipment wear. In addition, the typical sterilization process can take more than six hours to complete. LyoHUB members plan to evaluate lower-temperature alternatives. Establishment of standards for characterizing lyophilization equipment performance, which would facilitate scaleup using different vendors' equipment. Better process control, especially during the primary drying stage, during which the ice crystal structure is set, and with it, mass transfer and drying rates. Currently, control is based on traditional open-loop approaches. As a result, such variables as product temperature, drying rate, and residual moisture content are not monitored directly, so any deviations from optimal levels may not receive enough attention. Development of process analytical technology (PAT) tools, which will be required for closed-loop control. These tools would monitor heat flow and product temperature in real time. Improved container and closure systems. Currently, product is freeze dried in glass vials with rubber stoppers. LyoHUB is evaluating the use of plastics and developing data on the chemical and physical interactions between pharmaceuticals and containers. Among other plans, the group is considering using vials or stoppers that have been embedded with arrays of sensors to monitor temperatures and pressures during processing and transport. This approach would save money, because it would allow out-of-range vials within an otherwise compliant product lot to be discarded, rather than the entire lot. Farther off in the future, LyoHUB is evaluating freeze drying's potential use with novel therapies such as cell- and gene-based therapies. Below are some recent developments that have taken place within the roadmap's focus areas. Spin freezing and miniature mass spectrometers For the past few years, RheaVita, based in the Netherlands, has been working on a continuous lyophilization process based on spin freezing. Collaborating with Ghent University in Belgium, researchers have developed a prototype spin-freezing lyophilizer to develop comparative process data (6). The researchers recently presented a model and theoretical design space (as required by pharmaceutical quality by design) for the continuous process (7). In November 2017, Atonarp, an instrumentation company in Tokyo, and the lyophilization equipment manufacturer IMA Life North America established a venture to commercialize a new lyophilizaton-monitoring platform, based on research that the two companies did with Pfizer (8). Driving the technology is Atonarp's miniature mass spectrometer, which is said to take up less than half a cubic foot of space. Work with Pfizer evaluated the device's performance in monitoring the presence of silicone oil (a sign that heat transfer fluids are leaking from lyophilizer shelves). Researchers also used the device successfully to detect endpoints for both primary and secondary drying. For secondary drying, the spectrometer proved to work better than the Pirani gauges typically used. The technology was also used to detect vacuum leaks online. Venture partners say that it can be made Internet of Things (IoT)- ready with an Ethernet connection and single 24-V power supply. Research is continuing, to evaluate the technology for use with predictive approaches and quantitative measurements. Wireless sensors and heat-flux sensors Other process-monitoring solutions developed for lyophilization include IQ Mobil's Tempris wireless temperature monitoring technology, as well as Millrock Technology's measurement platforms based on heat-flux sensing, which have shown positive results in recent tests run at Purdue (9). Coriolis Pharma has evaluated heat-flux sensing as a PAT technique for lyophilization (10). Researchers found that direct measurement of heat transfer provided more insights into the thermodynamics of the freezing process than traditional methods. It also allowed them to Contin. on page 40Experts see uncertainty and debate, at the individual facility level, over best practices.

Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 2930 Pharmaceutical Technology DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.com In Part I of this article series, the authors discussed the regression control chart method for identifying out-of-trend data in pharmaceutical stability studies. In Part II, the by-time-point method and the multivariate control chart method are investigated, and improved approaches are suggested. The method is illustrated using real data sets. KENTO H/SH UTTER STOC K.COMPeer-Reviewed This article is a continuation of Part I, in which the authors discussed the identification of out-of-trend (OOT) data in the stability studies of single batches using a regression control chart method (1). If several batches are considered, there are two different time scales. The first one is the life within batches, which has been covered in Part I (1). The regression control chart uses this within-batch context. The second time scale is the order of batches. Two approaches are followed in this Part II article. The by-time-point method uses the between-batches context only, while the multivariate approach uses both be- tween-batches and within-batches contexts. Two statistical concepts have been suggested in the lit- erature (2). The first concept was based on known variance and expected value of distribution of measurements. This method was referred to as the Shewhart method in Part I. In the current situation, however, where only a small sample size is available, it is not justified to assume known variance and expected value. The second method suggested was to use the tolerance interval, but this is not a proper approach either. The tolerance interval gives the limits within which a certain proportion of population falls and is not relevant for a single data point. The proper concept that one should use when a single observation is in question is the prediction interval, using t-distribution (1). Detecting OOT data using the by-time-point method In this method, the result for the new batch is compared with points of earlier batches belonging to the same time of batch life. Use of by-time-point method, original proposal The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of Amer- ica (PhRMA) Statistics and Stability Expert Teams (2) Methods for Identifying Out-of-Trend Data in Analysis of Stability Measurements\u2014 Part II: June 2017 CITATION: When referring to this article, please cite it as M. Mihalovits and S. Kem\u00e9ny, \" Methods for Identifying Out-of- Trend Data in Analysis of Stability Measurements\u2014 Part II: By-Time-Point and Multivariate Control Chart,\" Pharmaceutical Technology 41 (12) 2017. Pharmaceutical Technology DECEMBER 2017 31suggest calculating the tolerance interval with \u00b1ks limits around the mean of data of earlier batches at the same time point. From tables or calculating with approximations, k can be found. If the new data fall out of the interval that be- longs to the respective time point, they are OOT. Along with the tolerance interval, Torbovska and Trajkovic-Jolevska (3) calculate the earlier described Shewhart control limits (as- sumed known expected value and variance), based on a z (standard normal) statistic. Suggested use of by-time-point-method In the by-time-point situation, neither the Shewhart interval nor the tolerance interval are the proper intervals to use. As explained previously, the prediction interval is to be used with Student's t-distribution. Equation 1 gives the calculation for prediction interval: [Eq. 1] where, is the mean of the reference data that belongs to the ith time point, is the new measured data at ith time point, sy(i) is the sample standard deviation of reference data that belongs to the ith time point, and n is the number of reference data at the ith time point (number of historical batches). t(/2) is the critical value of Student's t-distribution at one sided /2 level with (n-1) degrees of freedom. If the in- equality is satisfied, that is the is within the interval, the data are accepted, otherwise they are OOT. In this method, a 5% significance level was used instead of the 0.27% level, which is accepted in quality engineering applications as discussed under Shewhart method in Part I (1). The reason for this choice is to keep the level of error of the second kind sufficiently low. A type II error (second kind) occurs when the null hypothesis is false, but erroneously fails to be rejected. The calculation can be improved using pooled standard deviation. For this purpose, it should be proven that the error variances at different time points are equal, which can be tested by Bartlett and Levene tests, for example. For the authors' data, the hypothesis of homogeneity of variances is accepted (details of tests are not shown here). The pooled sample variance ( sp) is calculated in Equation 2 as: [Eq. 2] where p is the number of time points. Also, a new t/2 value is to be used in calculations, as the degrees of freedom of standard deviation is changed from (n-1) to p(n-1) . For illustrational purposes along with prediction limits, Shewhart limits (=0.05), confidence limits (=0.05), and tolerance limits (P=0.99, =0.95) are calculated as well. None of these limits are appropriate to use in the current situations, except the prediction limits. These limits are dis- cussed in detail below. Shewhart limits can be calculated by Equation 3 : [Eq. 3] where y is the assumed variance, equal to sy. As the known variance is assumed, there is no room for pooling. One may, however, use the pooled standard deviation as a substitute of y. The latter is falsely assumed to be known be- cause of the small sample size. When the pooled estimated variance is substituted, y is taken to be equal to sp. Confidence limits can be calculated by Equation 4 : [Eq. 4] For the calculations with pooled standard deviation, sp is substituted with sy in Equation 4 and a new t/2 is obtained with degrees of freedom of sp2. Tolerance limits can be calculated by Equation 5 : [Eq. 5] To calculate the tolerance factor ( k1), different approxima- tions could be used. Howe (4) suggests the following formula (Equation 6 ): [Eq. 6] This approximation is recommended if [Eq. 7] conforms to the current situation. In Equation 6 , n is the number of historical points, is the degrees of freedom of , is the critical value of standard normal distribution at one-sided (1-P) level, and is the critical value of chi- square distribution at one-sided (1-) level with degrees of freedom. For the calculations with pooled standard devia- tion, sr is substituted with sy in Equation 5 and the degrees of freedom of () is used in Equation 6 ( also changes) and in Equation 7 . It is important to note that the method does not use the time dependence function. This approach is an advantage, because an assumed function may falsify the conclusion. At 32 Pharmaceutical Technology DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.comthe same time, it is a drawback, since the functional time dependence, which is an essential feature of stability data, is not used at all. Example I: By-time-point method Using the data set found in Part I (1), the statistical intervals based on calculations with the pooled standard deviation (Equation 2 ) are given in Table I . The grey colouring indicates that the observed data in the row of the grey pair of boxes are OOT considering the limits specified in the columns. Consid- ering the correct interval (prediction limits), the data point at 18 months are OOT, while the other data are accepted points just as they were at regression control chart in the first ar- ticle of the series (1). The mistakenly used confidence interval would not contain y* at the 0-, 18-, 36-month time points; therefore, these would be OOT, while if the tolerance intervals were used, all the points would be accepted. The Shewhart limit approach would find the 18-month time point as OOT. The calculated intervals at 0-month time point are illus- trated in Figure 1 . The confidence interval is narrow and even some historical points are out of that range.Detecting OOT batch by multivariate method In this section, the observed batch is compared to earlier batches. As compared to the previous section, whole sets of data within the batch are compared (time function itself as with regression control charts) to those of historical batches (as with by-time-point method). The time function, if linearity is assumed, is character- ized by two parameters: slope and intercept. If the time function is unchanged, both parameters are unchanged. The originally proposed slope control chart method In the seminal paper by the Statistics and Stability Expert Teams (2), only the slopes are considered in the stability study. It is checked if the slope of the new batch belongs to the same distribution as that of the earlier batches. More precisely, it is assumed that estimated slopes of batches fol- low a normal distribution with the same expected value and variance. This assumption needs to be checked. The authors suggest constructing regression lines separately for each batch using data up to the time point in question. If the slope of the new batch is out of the tolerance interval Peer-Reviewed Table I: Prediction-, Shewhart-, confidence-, tolerance limits, by-time-point method using sp.

Remarks to the originally proposed slope control chart method As explained previously, the prediction interval is to be used given that the interval for one future observation (slope of a new batch) is in question. This is not only sound but advanta-geous as well, because the calculation of the prediction range is simpler than that of the tolerance range. The prediction range is narrower than the tolerance range, thus the test cri- terion based on the prediction range is stricter. This method is an advantage for reducing the risk of false conclusion, en- abling a manufacturing company to detect disorder earlier. A more profound improvement considers the trend line as a whole, thus both parameters (i.e., slope and intercept) are considered. The authors do not see any reason for allowing dif- ferent slopes but not different intercepts. The difficulty is that as the estimate of the intercept and slope are statistically not independent, the prediction intervals may not be calculated separately. For separate intervals of two mutually dependent variables, Bonferroni inequality could be used for example; whereas for a joint interval, Hotelling T-square distribution could be used. Using Bonferroni inequality, a rectangle predic- tion region is obtained, which is easier to calculate, but is less accurate. If using Hotelling T-square distribution, an ellipse region is calculated, which might be harder to handle but more accurate. This method is, in fact, profile monitoring, which is established in reference 5 and dealt with in many papers (6, 7). Another point of possible improvement is that for the historical batches, all points may be used for the regression, not just the ones until the time point in question (i.e., the most recent point of the test batch). This would lead to more sensitive test criterion because of the larger amount of infor- mation used. This approach gives additional difficulty as the variance-covariance matrix of parameters estimated from previous batches and from the actual batch is different, thus the homoscedasticity assumption is not justified. Therefore, this improvement is not utilized for the time being; the same number of points is considered for all batches. The calculations in the following can be used every time a new data point is obtained, and a new regression line is fitted with the new data included. The data of historical batches are taken into account only up to the time point of the new data of the observed batch, and separate regression lines are fitted to those data. The prediction region for the new pair of parameters is calculated in Equation 8 : [Eq. 8] where n is the number of historical parameter pairs (his- torical batches), p is the number of parameters (here 2), Fp,n-p, is the upper critical value of F-test with (p,n-p) degrees of freedom at one sided level. The (X-x*) is the matrix of the difference of mean vector of the historical parameters (X) and vector of the new parameters (x*): [Eq. 9] The (X-x*)T is the transpose of the tained: [Eq. 13] where n is the number of reference batches, sb0 and sb1 are the sample standard deviations of historical intercepts and slopes, respectively, cov(b0;b1 ) is the estimated covariance between the parameters, and and are the means of the parameters of historical batches. Covariance is estimated as follows: [Eq. 14] If the inequality ( Equation 13 ) is satisfied, the (b0*, b1*) is within the region and the batch is accepted, otherwise it is OOT. The acceptance region is a spatial shape. By calculat- ing and plotting b0* and b1* pairs to the critical value of F, the region can be obtained, as illustrated in the following. For illustrational purposes, regions calculated by the Shewhart method (Shewhart region) (=0.05), confidence region (=0.05), and tolerance region (P=0.99, =0.95) are calculated as well. These calculations, however, are not ap- propriate to use in the current situations.34 Pharmaceutical Technology DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.comThe Shewhart region is calculated by (8): [Eq. 15] The confidence region can be calculated as follows (8): [Eq. 16] while the tolerance region is calculated by (8): [Eq. 17] where k2 is the tolerance factor taken from reference 9 for P=0.99 and =0.95. Its value is 48.77.This method is not sensitive enough when a single point is in question. The reason is that a single OOT data will not have an impact big enough on the stability profile to make the observer detect the batch as an OOT batch. However, the method is more sensitive and, therefore, should be used when the question is whether the observed batch is OOT (in other words, all the points are OOT in the batch). Parameters of stability profile with less data are less certain, therefore, the acceptance re- gion is wider. As more data become available, the uncertainty of parame- ters gets smaller, and detection of OOT batch becomes more certain. One should start using this approach after the third data point is obtained in the observed batch, and keep using the method at every time point when new data are obtained, until the end of the stability study. In the example calculation, all data of the observed batch (and, therefore, all data of historical batches) are considered, including the last point. Example II: Hotelling T-square joint prediction region In the example calculation, all data of the observed batch (and, therefore, all data of historical batches) are taken into account. Intercepts and slopes of Batch I -VIII from Table II were used as reference data and the method was used to observe data of Batch IX. Using the terms from Table III , Equation 18 is obtained from Equation 13 : [Eq. 18] Where F with degrees of freedom 2 and 6, at one-sided 0.05 level is 5.14. As the Equation 18 is satisfied, the batch can be accepted as non-OOT. The prediction region can be illustrated by calculating max values of (b0*, b1*) to F2,6,0.05 that satisfy Equation 13 . Every (b0*, b1*) within the region is accepted as non-OOT. Figure 2 illustrates the calculated re- gions. One should keep in mind that the prediction region is the proper approach in the current problem. As the new data (slope and intercept) are found within the prediction region, they are non-OOT. By mistakenly using the confidence region, some of earlier batches and the new batch are found to be OOT. If the tolerance region approach is used, all batches would be accepted as non-OOT. Conclusion The by-time-point method and multivariate control chart were discussed in this article as methods that could be used to identify OOT data and OOT batches in pharmaceuti- cal stability studies. The earlier suggested methods are im-Peer-Reviewed Table II: Parameters of regression lines of batches.

The most important part of the improvement is the use of the prediction region concept instead of the tolerance interval or Shewhart method concepts. Also, for the earlier suggested method, the slope control chart is im-proved so that not just the slope of the observed batch is considered in the stability study but also the intercept. The multivariate control chart using Hotelling T-square distri- bution satisfies the requirements mentioned. The by-time-point method is a way to identify OOT data, while the multivariate approach is less sensitive to detect this kind of phenomena and should be used to detect an OOT batch instead. Also, the multivariate approach uses the time dependence function within the batch, which means more information from the data set is used, hence, giving sound conclusions. The three methods discussed in Part I and Part II are possible ways to identify OOT data or batches in stability studies. The sensitivity of the methods to detect OOT results are not studied yet, therefore, one should decide if the data can be accepted by using all methods and drawing the conclusion from the results.

MARTIN BARRAUD /OJO IMAGE S/GETT Y IMAGE Spetrmalinak/shutterstock.comEnvironmental sustainability is a growing concern in many manufacturing industries, and the pharma industry is no exception. Facilities and operations that are designed to conserve resources, such as energy and water, can improve a company's \"green\" image as well as reduce its manufacturing costs. Although there are some instances where GMP requirements may not be the most energy or water-conserving mode of operation, it is possible to attain both GMP compliance and efficiency, say experts (1, 2). Big Pharma companies have already made progress toward reducing water, energy, and waste, thus improving carbon footprint (3, 4). Water Drinking water, a crucial input to pharma manufacturing, is expected to become an increasingly limited resource, which means its cost will rise (2). Careful use, including repurposing discharge water from pharma processes for other uses (e.g., cooling towers or building sanitation systems) would help address this problem (2). Discharge of polluted water from some API manufacturing facilities, particularly effluents that could cause antimicrobial resistance, is also a growing concern that is beginning to be addressed (5). Energy Although different types of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes use energy in different amounts, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems, used to control the air quality of the process environment, consume more energy than any other system across all types of manufacturing. In API manufacturing, for example, HVAC may account for 35-40% of manufacturing site energy use, and in drug product manufacturing, HVAC may account for 60-75%, says Keith Beattie, Life Science lead at EECO 2, a UK-based energy efficiency consultancy. \"Optimizing other utilities, such as installing a more energy-efficient chiller or implementing control strategies, can improve efficiency by a few percent, but improving HVAC is the quickest return on investment,\" he adds.Jennifer Markarian There are some straightforward methods for reducing HVAC energy use, often using existing systems and reengineering or optimizing them. \"The first step is to minimize the quantity of air used,\" suggests Beattie. \"Cleanrooms often use higher air change rates than required to meet their classification, and reducing air flow by even a small amount can result in significant savings.\" A second step is to minimize the energy going into conditioning of the air. Systems can be set back or even switched off when not needed, and widening the set points for temperature and humidity can allow the system to run more efficiently. Conditioning more efficiently\u2014using high-efficiency motors and fans, for example\u2014also creates energy savings. Finally, says Beattie, companies should maintain their systems by monitoring, optimizing, and not neglecting mechanical maintenance. EECO 2 has developed an innovative approach to make cleanroom operations even more efficient using a control system that maintains a fixed air quality level (i.e., particulate count) by varying air flow rates, rather than the traditional method of fixed air change rate. The company has been able to reduce energy consumption by nearly 70% using this method of model predictive control in the company's test facility, which is representative of a commercial cleanroom, says Beattie. He reports that this energy savings using the adaptive, demand-based system is measured from an already energy-efficient baseline traditional system. \"Our adaptive system analyzes the data from particle counters in real time and uses these data to control the air change rate. From a compliance point of view, we are controlling the contamination level and we have data on the real performance of the cleanroom. This control system can thus assure quality and improve efficiency.\" How to validate such a system is a question that needs to be answered, because the current validation methods were based on traditional methods, notes Beattie. 36 Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.comDesigning Sustainable Pharma Facilities Innovative methods for water and energy conservation can reduce carbon footprint.Facility Design and Operations Single-use systems impact in biopharma manufacturing In biopharma manufacturing, single-use systems are considered beneficial for various reasons, including significantly reducing the water use required for cleaning of traditional stainless-steel systems. Another benefit is that, because they are closed systems, single-use systems can operate in a cleanroom with a lower grade classification, which corresponds to operational savings (6). To better understand the factors affecting the sustainability of a biopharmaceutical facility, the M+W engineering construction company conducted a lifecycle assessment (LCA) on a facility model. LCA is standard methodology used to evaluate environmental impact of a product, process, or service (or in this case, a facility), explains David Estap\u00e9, technology manager for Life Sciences in the Global Business Unit, Life Sciences & Chemicals, of M+W Group. An LCA can look at different environmental impact categories; this study considered climate change impact (i.e., carbon footprint in carbon dioxide equivalents). An LCA from \"cradle to grave\" takes into account not just the facility operation, but all materials and resources from construction to demolition of a facility. Facility operation, however, is the largest contribution to carbon footprint, the study confirmed (7). Using a software programme designed to evaluate LCA via mass and energy balances, M+W looked at process, building, and utility systems for a generic monoclonal antibody production process using single-use systems and modular construction for a manufacturing facility located in China. The study concluded (7) that transportation of the building modules (by ship) had a small percent of the total environmental impact of the facility (only 1%). The building systems (particularly HVAC) had a significant impact that varied by facility output (28-38%). Surprisingly, the production and disposal of single-use components accounted for only 9-11% of the total impact, while transportation of the consumables to the facility site accounted for 25-30% of the total. \"The waste generated by consumables has been raised as a possible concern for single-use systems, but we found that waste was, in reality, a relatively small component. For a facility located at a long distance from the single-use system source, air transportation of the consumables was the biggest impact,\" reports Estap\u00e9. Optimizing the supply chain for consumables is thus important. \"Facility location is significant for transportation as well as for the 'greenness' of the energy source used in the LCA,\" he adds. \"Sustainability of facility design is increasingly important, and programmes like LEED [the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design] certification are desired,\" notes Estap\u00e9. \"It is necessary, however, to understand what exactly contributes to the environmental impact for a particular facility, given its location and all aspects of its operation, not only factors such as energy-efficient lighting and HVAC. We can design the best facility but not truly solve the problem, if the majority of the impact is outside the facility, in transportation, for example. Looking at the LCA is crucial to addressing the real impacts.\" References 1. PharmTech, \"Energy Management in Bio/pharmaceutical Facilities\" (20 Feb. 20), J. Markarian, Use in Oct. 3. J.

Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 37Maisei Raman/shutterstock.comThe world of pharmaceutical production is changing rapidly, as therapies and global supply chains become more complex. Manufacturers must not only speed product delivery but ensure quality, safety, and efficacy. Success demands consistent discipline and rigor from supply chain and manufacturing operations, as well as programmes and procedures that mitigate risk and variability. This article discusses efforts that have been underway at Janssen Pharmaceuticals for the past few years to help achieve these goals. Corporate leaders wished to create a programme with a transparent structure that would allow employees in different functions throughout the company to measure performance against internal benchmarks, but with a clear focus on customers, i.e., patients and healthcare providers. Inspired by Toyota Production System and obeya Inspiration for this programme came from the Toyota Production System principle, obeya . Grounded in pure, fundamental data analytics, this concept is translated, roughly, as \"gathering all the information that is required to make fast, sound decisions that enable robust and sustainable improvements.\" In 2011, Janssen Supply Chain (JSC) used obeya to create and implement global, cross-functional reliability rooms (RRs). These centres are designed to analyze data and provide insights for production forecasts, identify planning and risk metrics, and predict trends and areas of improvement across all supply chain functions and manufacturing sites. So far, Janssen has set up more than 20 reliability rooms across its global supply chain facilities, each with its own set of performance goals. Teams at each facility track goals on a weekly basis to discern new and emerging issues. This approach allows the team to get ahead of and mitigate any supply chain problems in the making. At its heart is an automated reliability metric dashboard, designed to provide transparency on how well the company is delivering on 21 standard end-to-end reliability metrics. This allows teams to be Ian Elliot is senior director, global supply chain reliability, at Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. able to compare, track, and predict performance across supply chains, markets, and products. The result is new insights into the cumulative improvements and strategies across the network in areas such as supplier readiness, quality, on-time delivery, and risk management. If a systemic trend or issue is recognized through the channels of the reliability rooms, a project task force is deployed to address and solve it. Then, after it has been addressed, teams collaborate to discover the root cause of the supply disruption and to locate any patterns that might be behind it, sharing these insights to drive action with respective business process owners. Continual improvement This process of continual improvement and internal readjustment allows for consistent and sustainable improvement across the supply chain. It ensures that employees from different functions, each with different perspectives, review performance and escalate issues or near-misses to identify their root causes and identify any risks that might be embedded in any future plans. In the six years since they were first rolled out, RRs have become essential for monitoring the vital signs of the supply chain. They also serve as a phorum in which teams can meet and discuss plans for procurement, production, quality, logistics, and engineering. This approach ensures that one plan, executed by one team, delivers results against a set of shared priorities. A central group is charged with discovering systemic issues that affect the supply chain and working with partners at various sites to find robust, sustainable preventative and corrective actions. At the same time, the central RR identifies best practices that can be shared with the company's suppliers and other supply-chain partners. A core tenet of the RRs is risk identification and assessment, which are achieved through a stratification of metrics and other factors based around supply balancing. In this approach, supply- chain-performance metrics are 38 Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.com Reliability Rooms and the Move to Proactive Supply Chain Management Cross-functional reliability rooms identify risk and planning metrics, provide insights for production forecasts, and predict trends and areas for improvement.Good Distribution Practices monitored against some thresholds for which performance has been correlated to impact. Thresholds then indicate whether or not the problem is under control. For example, there is a statistical correlation between certain metrics that are associated with stock outs in certain markets, which are fed by certain sites. Knowing these correlations allows targets to be set so that any supply disruptions can be avoided. Similarly, data have been correlated on the types of product- quality issues and their impact on the supply chain. These correlations, and thresholds, are then used to guide inventory stocking and business continuity planning. Using planning to track risk Demand and planning can be used to track risk. The RRs, for example, engage in monthly demand reviews to measure and monitor mean-absolute-percent error and bias to forecast. The company has also introduced a bias-tracking signal that effectively measures and identifies patterns in under- and over-forecasting. Using this signal helps ensure that the assumptions made in business forecasts are regularly and thoroughly reviewed. Regular review is essential to minimizing variability. The supply-chain function is utilizing advanced analytical techniques to determine the optimum algorithm for each product and market. For example, for planning, teams typically look at the demand/ supply balancing during a 13-week period. When and where gaps in supply or atypical reductions in inventory show up, the RRs raise and review a short-term exception management (STEM) action. Individuals from different functions within the company jointly decide on the best course of action, and results are monitored weekly. In addition, the RRs keep a log of every potential supply interruption, early warning indicator, and critical stock out, tracking each issue and its resolution. So far, data have shown that, if a potential supply interruption can be identified more than eight weeks before it happens, the company will be more than 80% successful in mitigating its impact. Monitoring suppliers Assessment tools also provide a holistic picture of the level of contract partner and supplier risk and performance. The granularity of tracking will depend on the company's level of dependency on the individual partner. Generally, the RRs track data on suppliers' quality, delivery, cost and risk profile, technology usage, innovation, audit results, and strategic alignment. In some cases, their internal performance is monitored in terms of capacity utilization, schedule attainment, raw material and work-in-progress levels, as well as audit status. These data provide transparency and a window into their internal performance, giving early warning signs of possible trouble. Data sharing takes place within a framework of partnership that encourages periodic business reviews and a spirit of mutual improvement. Managing information At this point, RR's collect data from sources that include the following: Business warehouses that store data on commercial performance Online portals, laboratory information systems, and enterprise resource planning systems that store product quality data Procurement systems that provide supplier performance data. These data are then interfaced into an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), using business filters and calculations to derive performance data. The EDW is built on a Teradata platform, and staged data are visualized and analyzed using a number of different software programmes, including products from Spotfire, Tableau, Qlikview, and Qliksense. During the initial planning stages of the Janssen RRs, there were concerns about gathering the data, making them visible, and ensuring attendance from the stakeholders at each site amid busy schedules and eminent deadlines. Gradually, as the teams adopted the approach and started to see and feel the benefits, each team adapted the approach to make it work best for them. As a result, each room has a standard configuration and standard data, but sites have the freedom to incorporate extra information to optimize their effectiveness and efficiency. Training approaches Because the company is global in outlook, training for the RRs tends to be built around a central communication or training plan, utilizing short video clips that explain system utilization. This basic structure is then reinforced with traditional presentations, both self-study modules and interactive. This standard is maintained by a central team and then made accessible via internal networks. Training is also augmented, based on local or regional practice, to accommodate local needs. Sustainable results Since their inception, RRs have had a measurable impact in in preventing supply chain disruptions by allowing the company and employees to visualize any constraints, understand the business from an end-to-end perspective, and drive a more predictive mindset. The RRs solve challenges and problems every day, which can range from missed deliveries from suppliers to accommodating changes in demand to equipment improvements. One of the issues monitored has been the availability and correctness of narcotics licenses that permit the sale of some products in regulated countries. Through data collection and analysis, key themes were identified related to timeliness, certain countries' response rates, and the quality of documents. Cross-functional approach A cross-functional team from quality, customer logistics, global planning, and affiliate services, facilitated by If a [potential] supply interruption can be identified more than eight weeks before it happens, the company will be more than 80% successful in mitigating its impact. Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 39Good Distribution Practices the global reliability team, has put in place a revised process, simplified procedures, developed personnel training, and installed performance monitoring on the process. As a result, the company have seen a 35% reduction in issues, meaning more \"right-first-time\" deliveries from affiliates and less risk of stock outs. Janssen has seen a number of additional improvements and successes from the RRs. Since 2015, the company has delivered a 100% \"launch on time\" success rate for new products. This is based on a supply chain that can deliver these new products to customers following regulatory approvals and in the committed timeframe. Connection to the customer As RRs develop, they remain centered around four key principles: Commitment and connection to the customer. This requires thinking about partners in order to make the best decisions and compromises to support them. Ability to see and articulate business priorities , as well as the commitments that have already been made. Performance, and the use of a standard for tracking our performance , not only in reliability, but in safety, quality, cost, and impact on customers. Evaluation of progress. It is important to look at progress against larger business plans, to ensure that the organization is on track to meet competitive goals, deliver on the sites' missions, and launch new products. Functional teams are made accountable for reliability Along the way, Janssen has had to revise its original approach. In 2016, for example, the company made functional groups more accountable for reliability so that the supply-chain function could take more of a supportive role. This approach has helped the functional teams remain the drivers of the various parts and has meant the solutions have greater internal buy-in, while also supporting broader-based improvement. The company has also updated the RRs' daily performance management to standardize them around Johnson & Johnson's production system and values (1), which brings a single standard to all company sites. This approach is currently being rolled out across the company's network, increasing the rigor in root cause analysis and execution. Measuring both site and overall performance Looking to the future, performance metrics will need to blend both site and supply chain performance. Those metrics, observations, and staff can then be used to identify and eliminate any waste in the system and make sure everything possible is being done to keep products continually affordable. As the company moves forward, the RRs will become increasingly connected to show how performance is affecting overall supply chain effectiveness. The organization already relies heavily on data analytics to help develop the optimum scenario for supply. In the future, there will be an even greater need for faster data collection. The RRs are proving to be a key process and capability. They help ensure that the organization can predict and visualize issues, rather than simply react to them. Reference 1.

Q:I recently transferred to the document control department and am working with people on creating and/or revising standard operating procedures (SOPs). My colleagues h ave very different ideas on how much information should be included in the SOPs. Some want very detailed instructions and others want minimal information. Can you please advise on how detailed SOPs should be to fulfill regulatory expectations? A:There is no right or wrong answer regarding how much or how little information should be contained in an SOP. Whether you work in the medical device, pharmaceutical, or bio-technology industry, you are relying on SOPs to help you perform the day-to-day activities associated with your job. The purpose of an SOP is to define the steps, in logical order, needed to perform a repeatable task and achi eve a repeat- able outcome. SOPs document the steps of key processes to help ensure a consistent, quality output. SOPs are useful tools for operationalizing, optimizing, and communicating important corporate policies, government regulations, and best prac- tices for ensuring consistent, reliable, and safe medications or medical devices to patients. SOPs should be written to allow your personnel to conduct operations in a consistent manner that will assure regulatory compliance and product quality. They need to reflect a com- pany's specific manufacturing or other operations. The more repeatable and consistent an operation or procedure becomes, the less waste there will be in the process. Consistency in work performance will lead to fewer deviations and investigations associated with the process, which translates into less down time and fewer product rejections. This is just good business sense. Regulations and SOP s SOPs should not be written for regulators, but should reflect a company's operations. Writing SOPs to appease regulators or because you think the regulatory authorities require them will only lead to confusion and regulatory citations. Writing an SOP for a process, procedure, or operation that you do not perform just because it is listed in the regulations is not advised. This concept is particularly important when taking into consideration today's environment. They are many virtual and small companies that outsource much of their operations.US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 200.10 discusses the relationship between a contract provider and a contract giver by stating, \"The Food and Drug Administration is aware that many manufacturers of pharmaceutical products utilize extramural independent contract fa cilities, such as testing laboratories, contract packers or labelers, and custom grinders, and regards extramural facilities as an extension of the manufacturer's own facility.\" Companies that outsource all or some of their operations should rely on their quality agreements and the SOPs of their contract providers to define how they perform the services being outsourced. Contractproviders should not write an SOP that defines something they are not doing that they have contracted for another entity to do. Some companies, in particular start-up companies, might be tempted to purchase pre-written SOPs. This activity mightbe acceptable on the condition that the purchased SOP isreviewed and the appropriate changes be made to reflect the actual operations of the company who purchased the SOP. Failure to tailor purchased SOPs to the actual specific process will most likely result in a regulatory citation for failure to follow written procedures. SOP format Another consideration for an SOP is the format for communicating the information. A company needs to keep an open mind to various SOP formats and communication types. All SOPs, regardless of format, should offer clear step-by-step instructions and may utilize various presentation styles as a means of communicating the details of the SOP. The following examples are presentation styles to be considered when writing SOPs:What's in Your SOP? SOPs should be written to allow your personnel to conduct operations in a consistent manner. ask the expert50 Pharmaceutical Technology Europe DECEMBER 2017 PharmTech.comAd Index COMPANY PAGE COMPANY PAGE General description: This describes in paragraph form the necessary elements that need to be performed to successfully execute the SOP requirements. Play script: This is a simple step-by-step instructional SOP. Its format is a written set of instructions with a logical sequence flow (operator does a, then b, then c, etc.). It is similar to following a recipe for making a cake. The majority of SOPs utilize this type of format. Flow chart: A flow chart SOP translates the elements of the written step-by-step instructions into a sequence of pictures that define what is needed to perform the operation in the defined sequence of steps displayed in the flow chart. Pictorial: A pictorial SOP uses only pictures to communicate to the user the appropriate steps in the SOP and the order they are to be performed. This type of SOP can be useful when there are language concerns. Combination: A combination SOP uses multiple methods, such as both words and pictures, to communicate to the user the critical information in the SOP and the order in which the steps are to be performed. Training for effective SOPs The final consideration for effective SOPs is training. The traditional read/understood acknowledgement may not be enough to assure that an employee understands the content of the SOP. Companies should consider group trainings and comprehension evaluations for determining the effectiveness of the SOP. Keep in mind, however, that just because an employee does not pass an SOP comprehension test does not necessarily mean the employee doesn't understand. It could be an indication of a poorly written SOP or ineffective training. Companies should also consider training on SOPs through the use of video recording. This could include presenting video demonstrating proper technique as well as using video recordings as on the job training tools to evaluate proper technique of an individual. The use of video recording could be most helpful for people who need to gown appropriately to enter into an aseptic manufacturing area. Remember there is no set rule dictating the format of the SOP instructions, and it is up to the company to determine what works best for your facility. SOPs should be written to reflect a company's business practices, allowing them to optimize efficiency and productivity of their operations. It is important to tailor your procedures to the personnel performing your operations whether highly experienced or relatively new to the regulated environment. The training on an SOP is equally as important as the information contained in the SOP, and companies need to consider the most effective way to train personnel on an SOP. The training presented may not be the same for all SOPs. Bottom line, SOPs and the associated training should be easily understood and able to be followed by the employees who rely on them to perform their job responsibilities.
