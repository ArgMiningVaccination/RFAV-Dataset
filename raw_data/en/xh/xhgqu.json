It has electricity (seen in an EKG), magnetic (seen in MRIs), sonic (ultrasound) thermic, and other types like subtle, and light energy. The practice of Energy Medicine relies on a trained practitioner who can assess, identify, and rebalance your unique energy flow. There are various ways to achieve these goals. Dr. Fuentes-Valdes has explored Energy Medicine studies starting with her work with medical acupuncture and treatment of the \"meridians\" (energy channels) and through a program designed by Donna Eden, a leader in the field and thought through the Mindvalley University. EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) is an energy psychology therapy tool, which Dr. Fuentes-Valdes learned about in the Tapping Solution Summit and books. She also took Reiki 1 and 2 courses a Japanese technique that helps with relaxation and stress management. Using the varied techniques helps to restore the flow of energy in the body, maintaining good health, wellbeing, and support healing.
