The dried herb can be burned as a way to purify the air, it is used in opening/closing ceremonies and cleansing rituals, and many believe that sage brings about peace and protection. Burning dried sage is a form of smoke cleansing, and this process has been shown to change the molecular makeup of the air and overall energy in a space. This change happens as the smoke attaches itself to negative energy and as it dissipates, the negative energy dissipates as well. Studies show that burning herbs, like sage, can even reduce bacteria in the air. Practicing smoke cleansing not only smells great, but can positively impact your mood, since smoke increases the oxygen supply in the brain. More oxygen in the brain = muscle relaxation = happier self. When doing a smoke cleansing, set a positive intention for the practice. Bring positive energy to the space or person you are going to cleanse, and allow the smoke to take away any negative energy. (Be aware of hot embers that may fall, and have a small bowl in your other hand under the bundle to catch these, if needed.) We recently picked sage from our healing garden and have bundled them up as small gifts for you. Next time you have an appointment at MindBody Wellness, feel free to take a sage bundle for your use.
