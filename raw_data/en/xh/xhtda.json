(page 2)", "sitename": "Drugs.com", "date": "2012-11-17", "cleaned_text": "I recently dropped from using a 25 mcg Fentanyl patch to using a 12 mcg patch. It seemed to me that prior to dropping to the lower dosage, that I was experiencing some withdrawal symptoms, like anxiety, being very emotional, tingling in the feet. On the day that I dropped to the 12 mcg patch I started to have diarrhea and felt queasy and had no appetite. I thought that was possibly due to anxiety about dropping to a lower dosage that evening. (I have Crohn's disease,so it is difficult to know if the GI symptoms are from the Crohn's or from the Fentanyl withdrawal). For the first 48 hours, the only withdrawal symptoms that I had were the GI issues. Then last night (48 hours after dropping to the 12 mcg dosage) I started to get almost constant tingling in the feet and could not sleep. (I do feel fortunate that I was able to sleep for a little while every 2 to 4 hours). I have not read other posts from people that have experienced this type of situation. I am wondering if anyone else has the withdrawal symptoms start several days after dropping the dosage? Any advice for getting through the withdrawal symptoms will be greatly appreciated. Thank you When do Fentanyl withdrawal symptoms start after the dosage has been reduced? Question posted by BlessedByGod1 on 17 Nov 2012 Last updated on 18 April 2021 26 Answers Page 2 I can so relate to you, I also have Crohn's and have been on the Fentanyl patch for 15 years, I have three ruptured disc and it has really helped. I started out on 100 mcg and weaned myself down to 12 mcg, but it has effected my ability to be put under anesthesia. I recently had oral surgery and the doctor had a hard time sedating me due to my bodies high tolerance to [Opioids](/article/opioid-narcotics.html). I spoke with my Gastroenterologist and GP about coming off of it all together. In doing so before I cut the patch in half (I use the Mylan brand) and had very little side effects They suggested I start out by changing it every four days instead of three. I'm now on my second patch change and have noticed GI issues, chills and headache just feeling like crap~lol. I am questioning myself if I should go back to cutting them in half or every 96 hours. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Hope all has gone well with you!! I've been on the patches for 13 years, following a horrific skydiving accident. I've learned an awful lot about them over that time and I can tell you what any knowledgeable doctor will tell you, which is that aside from medical rapid detox (expensive), the only safe way to get off of them is to gradually reduce the dosage over time, NOT to extend the time between changing patches. By extending the time between changing them, you're just giving yourself full on withdrawals every 3-4 days, then you cure them by putting on a full sized patch. Basically you're just torturing yourself with that method, and it won't help you at all. You have to slowly reduce the amount that you're taking. The longer you can spread that out, the better. A person can safely (but miserably) get off of a fairly strong dosage within a month or two, but if you can spread it out over a period of a few to several months or even longer, so much the better. Myself, I've spent the last 18+ months reducing from a 200mcg/48 hour prescription, down to 14mcg/48 hours, and I finally put on what I hope is the last patch I'll ever wear, about 72 hours ago. During all this time I've suffered from a lack of energy, loss of appetite, and generally just feeling blah, but aside from that, no major withdrawal symptoms. Regardless of the warnings, it's completely safe to cut the patches if you use the Mylan brand that does NOT have a gel filled pouch. It makes no difference whether you request that your doctor prescribe a smaller dosage (insurance charges you the same either way), or whether you simply cut them to the size that you desire to wean to. By cutting them you have more control, since they only make the patches in multiples of 12.5 or 25mcg, up to 100mcg. So you can trim off 5mcg or 10mcg pretty easily and accurately, for example, and less than that if you're using a 12.5. Anyway, cut them and reduce your dosage gradually, don't extend the time between changing patches! Would like to hear from you. I have been on 100mcg every 48 hr for almost 15 years for neurogenic pain associated with MS. I have been trying to take it down to every 72 hr and I am not doing very well at all. The withdrawal symptom I have the most trouble with is agonizingly painful leg cramps that are beyond description. At the first sign of these beginning I have to run to a new patch. The stomach problems and tiredness (and constant yawning!!) are not THAT hard to deal with. The fact that my pain comes roaring back just makes me want to give up, also. When I approached my pain doc about doing this (cutting down) he did not offer any kind of replacement for the pain problem, although I am also on a fairly strong dose of hydrocodone, it does nothing to replace the fentanyl. With everything that is going on with the CDC, etc., I am afraid they are going to cut me off the fentanyl with no help whatsoever. I am in a quandary, absolutely. Also, my age works against me because fentanyl is not recommended for folks over 65 and I am 64, fast approaching that magical age where it is not \"appropriate\" for me to use fentanyl. Anyone out there with some good suggestions, or if eunonymous can answer or recommend, I would so appreciate some input to my quandary. This site is very poorly designed. No option to reply, only to \"add a comment\", and when you do, it takes you to another page where it only shows the ORIGINAL poster's very first comment, not the person's comment that you're trying to reply to. Very annoying. Didn't occur to them that someone may want to reply to someone's reply? Anyway, this is in response to LeighBA. I'm sorry to say that I can't really help you at all with dealing with your original symptoms that resulted in you getting on the patches. We all of course had issues that led to us getting on them, and those issues can very from post-trauma or post-surgical pain, to chronic pain of all sorts. I know MS is incredibly debilitating and progressive, but I don't know what kind of pain issues you had or would have that are directly related to your condition when you're not on the patches. If you want to get off the patches, you'll either have to deal with your pain symptoms until you're completely off of them for a few weeks and can assess your true pain symptoms, or you'll have to replace the patches with something else. Only your GP or pain management specialist can help you with that. If you're not happy with your doctors, you should considering finding a new one. I can tell you though that agonizingly painful leg cramps isn't a typical withdrawal symptom of the fentanyl patches. Abdominal pain, nausea, chills, and restless legs among other symptoms are all very common however, although these can be almost completely avoided if you wean yourself off slowly over a period of a few to several months. If you've been on a 48 hour regimen like I was for nearly as many years as you, you'll probably find that you start to not feel \"right\" if you go even 6 hours past your usual 48 hour schedule without changing patches. Changing to 72 hours would almost certainly make you pretty miserable every 3rd day, because your body is conditioned to receiving the medication every 48 hours, and you're going into withdrawals on the third day. The reason I switched from 72 to 48 several years ago was because I finally noticed a pattern of having debilitating abdominal pain every third day, and realized that the patches weren't lasting for 72 hours like they were supposed to. Eventually, two or three years after I was changed to 2 patches every 48 hours (200mcg total), I started changing 1 patch every 48 hours instead, and that improved my quality of life even more, since I was getting a more even dosage even though I was using the same prescribed amount every month. I completely understand and relate to your concerns about what's going on with the CDC. Part of what's so horrible about being enslaved by these patches is the stress and worry every month about getting your prescription filled, having to go to the doctor every month to physically get a hand written prescription, worry about insurance covering it, or losing your insurance, etc. etc.. They really consume a large part of your life. I can't tell you how happy I am to be off of them after 13 years, just for those reasons alone. I hope you can get off of them and still find a way to mange your MS symptoms. Hi and thank you for responding to my question. I can happily report that as of 03/14/2016 I am totally off the Fentanyl patch!!! I had very little side effects by doing the method that my doctor proposed. What I did is as follows: I changed the patch (12 mcg) every four (4) day instead of three (3) for one (1) month. After that I cut the Mylan12 mcg patch in half for one (1) month. Then I took a leap of faith and removed it for the last time, I had very little if any side effects. So the next question that I had for my doctor was what do I now do for pain. She prescribed Tramadol HCL 50 mg 1 to 2 tabs.@ 6 hours as needed. I am happy to report that I have only had to take 3 so far since stopping the patch. I know this may sound funny, but my brain feels so much clearer since stopping Fentanyl. I actually have and feel emotions that I forgot I had. It's almost as if I were in a brain fog while on this drug. I understand chronic pain, but the mind is a powerful tool. I hope that you can experience is as good as mine on your journey to a Fentanyl free life. I have Stage IV leiomyosarcoma, a rare and deadly cancer. I have two tumors: one on the inside of my right knee and one in the crook of my left elbow, but neither of these is life-ending. I have had this cancer since 2005 and have been taking a 50 mcg/hr. Fentanyl patch, with 4mg Dilaudid (3 per day) for breakthrough pain since 2011. I also have interstitial cystitis for 20 years that is as painful as the tumors, if not more so. My PM dr. has suddenly decided that he is taking me off ALL pain meds. I am frantic since I need the meds, and I know how awful it is to wean oneself off opioids. He cut my 50 mcg/hr. every 72 hours to a 25mcg patch and I am in excruciating pain. He plans on cutting down from the 25 mcg patch to NOTHING (I have just started the 25's nine days ago). There are only two other PM drs. that I can switch to, but neither will prescribe the patch and did not accept me as a patient. When asked why I am leaving my current dr., I tell the truth and say that he is discontinuing all my meds. If these drs. hadn't already told me that they can't prescribe the Fentanyl patch, they are doubling glad, as they think that I am \"doctor shopping\". I am almost 61 years old and never run out of my meds, or \"lost\" them, or ever failed my monthly blood and urine tests. I have never abused my meds and don't know what to do. I do know that I cannot live in this intractable pain! I no longer have an oncologist, as M.D. Anderson no longer takes my insurance. Besides, they have all told me that since there currently exists only one chemo drug, I am not eligible for it (I am in no danger of dying even though I feel as if I am - lol) I wouldn't take it if I could after reading how it is what is killing them, it's so horrible. I really want to report my dr., as he had no reason to D/C my meds, but the insurance company said that he has no complaints ever. Any suggestions would be so very welcomed!! I am new to this group but have some input. I have been on fentanyl and 10 mg oxycodone for almost 4 years after a bad fall in my garage, complicAted byMRSA in my bloodstream. was admitted to the hospital a few weeks after my fall. My back pain had\" become so bad I could not walk. I had abscesses in my left hip that left me with permanent damage. After 3 months of hospitals , procedures and surgery, plus a year of IV antibiotics, I am MRSA free, but on fentanyl and oxy. In January 2013 I started on 25, then next month increased to 50 mcg. About a year later after another fall, my dose was increased to 75 mcg. I was prescribed the oxycodone from the start, one 10 mg tablet daily for breakthrough pain. While hospitalized and afterwards I had been taking oxy around the clock. I found the fentanyl helpful with no feelings of euphoria, just minimized pain. Then last summer \"government guidelines\" indicAted that dose must come down to 50mcg. That wasn't much fun at all, but I managed. In April of this year I received a spinal cord stimulator, a true miracle for me. It has helped from the very start. My fentanyl dose was reduced to 25 mcg and then the fun began! They gave me a prescription for 2 oxycodone per day due to the reduction. I tried to only take one as I want to get off all of this, but the withdrawal symptoms you've all described did me in. This past week I told my nurse I'm done!!She listened! I am now on 12 mcg every 3 days plus the 1 oxycodone per day plus a clonidine 7day patch and vistiril. The clonidine and vistiril are for withdrawal symptoms and next month I may try what you all suggest and cut the 12 in half. Ask your doctors directly for something for the withdrawals. I will try to keep you all posted on how this goes. Thanks for reading my post Hello Well I can help u out if u want to listen I've been on the fental patch for over 15 yrs 60 knee operions needing new knees and a hip and I've come down from 200mcg to 3mcg now it's been a real bitch to say the least I've got a good doc and u need to start to cut ur way down there are a couple of ways to do this one if ur patch is all glue and no gelly pack then it's much easy to do this first u start cutting down the patch at 1/6th of an inch at a time in other words leave ur patch on for 5 days use ur break through meds to help with the terable pain once ur down to half the patch then ask for the next lower dose so if ur on 100 ask the doc for 50 and start again cutting at 1/6 of an inch untill u get down to half again then ask for the lower dose again ect. Now here's the hard part once ur at 12mcgs u keep on doing what u were doing 1/6th at a time and once u get to the smallest or ur last 1/6th of a inch leave the patch on untill it falls off that's what I was told to do and I'm off of the dam stuff . Now please use ur break through meds as needed most likely u will or should be on a heavy does untill, ur body calms down keep in mind , this is the hard part now with u not having it on ur body it's still in ur fat and will take over a month for u to be clean from it ... now the jelly patches u can still cut them but it's soooo much harder to get this right u need to get opsight it's the same stuff the hospital uses to put over an i.v. on ur skin once u have made sure the patch has equal amounts in it so ,both sides look the same u can cut it and use the opsight to seal it and work ur way down that , way or just ask for the ones that aren't gel and the glue ones are very much better and safer.. keep in mind this will take 6-12 months and ur will power ,to get off of u will also need something for the nasua I use PROCHLORPERAZINE at 10mgs 4-6times a day to stop it cold also. With long term use of heavy pain meds there's things the docs don't tell u but I will 1)every one that's oipit talrent needs to have there testrone checked men woman yes woman to we need it to help with the healing of our body's and it's been proven that even as little as 1yr,there's a huge difference in our testrone levels and that needs looked in to first it will help with coming off the fental. .don't bleave me look up on youtube John hopkins and testrone and pain management ok I hope I've helped this Essa is to help anyone that wants to come off the patch with out really to much trouble yes u will have w/ds but nothing terable All the best Boom Hi I've been on 400mcg for four years after 56 operations.I am starting get to come off Went from 400 straight to 300 now yesterday down to 200 apart from not sleeping up to now just some hot flushes. My consultant told me I have to just use will power when I asked for his help USELESS person I'm very worried after reading glasses this about getting down to the lower doses.Does the effects always happen to everyone?I'm er worried now as my doctor don't seem to want to help.he never said not to do it bit at time so been taking 100mcg in one go off worried I could halm myself now. I've been trying to wean myself off Fentanyl: for a few years now. I easily weaned from 150 mcg to 25 mcg, It was getting from 25 mcg to 0 that became a problem. The gel packs absolutely CANNOT be cut. But the mylar ones can, although it says you are not supposed to cut them. 25 mcg easily becomes 12/6/3. Then I stretched out the days between each decrease. I WISH I'd had help from my GP but neither my GP nor my oncologist seemed interested in helping me get off this drug! It didn't seem to be helping, so why should I take it? Plus it was masking other pain (ie: infected tooth). WARNING: SERIOUS BRAIN CHEMICAL CHANGES WILL OCCUR. After ending the weaning by slowly cutting the mylar patch down, and balancing any discomfort with small amounts of vicodin and clonazepam, I celebrated being off the Fentanyl. I felt quite proud of myself. But, suddenly, after over a week, I was hit by a severe, crippling depression. I thought I was over the physical dependency, but NO! My brain chemistry was apparently going to take some time, quite a long time, to recover. So I iformed my doctor that I'd weaned off the patches. He suggested the antidepressant Wellbutrin,. Within 24 hours I (thankfully) felt considerably better. It's now been almost six months, and I'm down to one Wellbutrin a day. Still fighting some mood swings if I forget to take it, or take it late in the day, but things are slowly getting better. My brain is recovering on its own schedule, so I'll just have to be patient. MY SUGGESTION: To all the people trying to free themselves from a physical dependence on Fentanyl (which really helped during the first few years of cancer treatment), I urge you to try to find a KNOWLEDGEABLE doctor who will SUPPORT you in your desire to wean off this medication. And be kind to yourself... I dIscovered that sheer will power can't make up for a lack of the essential neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and acetylcholine. Good luck and BE SENSIBLE. Thanks... my wife is at 25 and will go to zero in 3-4 mos. I like the idea of cutting the mylars... we'll see. Thanks again. Thanks... my wife is at 25 and will go to zero in 3-4 mos. I like the idea of cutting the mylars... we'll see. Thanks again. I'm also on Mylan patches (that's the only brand I can use on hyper-sensitive skin), and have decreased from 150mcg/h to 100mcg/h. I'd really like to decrease the dosage to ZERO, but, right now, I'm happy decreasing it in increments. I haven't ever cut the patches but it sounds logical... Has anyone else cut them to decrease with any luck? If so, what kind of withdrawal symptoms did you have to deal with? I'd really appreciate any experiences you're willing to share--- Very much! Thank you so very much for your time and feedback. I have been on the fentanyl patch 225mg. for over 10 yrs. With my faith in GOD and docter, I started weaning down 25mg. every year. I am now on 75mg. and this feb. or mar. i will go down another 25 and I will be on 50mg. Dropping 25 mg. year, I felt alittle anxiety but that's all.With my faith and support from. My doctor and family, it waasnot that bad. I hope this will help someone. Keep the faith and trust GOD Hi all. My wife has been on 75mcg for over two years. Just got script to drop to 50mcg patch. Thx for all your insights and (unfortunate) experiences shared here. She is ready 50 to move down... I'll keep reading.. Good luck with dropping down 25 mcg at a time. That MIGHT be a little much at once. My doctor and I have a plan to wean me off of 50 mcg x 48hrs. I had a BAD withdrawal reaction a couple of times before we realized that I'm a \"delicate flower\" (ha!) and needed to slow down the process in order to minimize the symptoms of withdrawal. I'm now on 12+25 every 3 days. Next step: Put on the 25 every 3 days, but do the 12 every 4 days. Yeah, it's hard to keep up this crazy schedule, but I find that the slower I lower, the better I do. If your wife has problems, please consult with the dr and see if she can go slower. Thx bcktabs... 75 to 50 may be too aggressive... we'll see soon. Can always add the 12.5... will plan for that when she goes from 50 to 37.5. Thx for advice. How's your wife doing? I hope very well... I have started my new regimen of 25 mcg/3 days and 12 mcg/4 days. I must admit that I do feel the negative symptoms of withdrawal, but not too bad. Lost appetite, feet going crazy at night, and a little pain breaking through. I will hang with this for about another 4 weeks and see how things go. If possible, I will take the next step down. Has anyone EVER quit 100% successfully? Baktbs... thx. my wife is ok. On her 4th 50 patch. She has tramadol for breakthrough pain but hasn't used that at 3x50mg daily for a year... she does seem to be faring well. Fyi. She is 67 y.o. and 107 lbs... dean I'm taking 75mg for over 2 years and I get days mixed up when I forget to replace a patch I get very sick, I experience vomiting and sever stomach pain not to mention sever anxiety. They do help me control the pain but I'm thinking I wish I had never started using them. My son is a peri medic and has told me story's of men my age actually dying from these things but every instance they have had multiple patches on all at the same time. Thanks everyone for sharing... my wife stopped her Fen patches in Feb2016. She lasted used a 25 on the 13th. Didn't want to half the mylar and turned her last 30 day script back to Dr. Minimal side effects. Her pancreatitus acts up, but tramadol is all she takes. Hope you get better Sincerely. DW. I recently changed from the 25 mg to the 12.5 mg. The withdrawal symptoms began within hours of starting the lower dose. They included severe stomach pains, tingling of fingers and toes, [insomnia](/health-guide/insomnia.html), anxiety, no appetite and body aches. After three days of withdrawals, I decided to stop using them. I have been of Fentanyl patch since it FIRST came out--approx. 17 years. I had tried everything up to the patch and it was a horrible existence. Demeral shots three times a week, AWFUL, I couldn't function. Then came the \"patch\"... I finally had my life back, I could work, play with kids, cook, keep my home and all was well. Its been so many years that I cut back from 125 to 50 simply by cutting the patch and it worked. I've been on the 50's and tried to cut to the 25 but the pain was to bad. My doc' asked me way I wanted to quit, as they were not affecting anything but the pain. It just seems time, I've been on them for so long I just want to STOP. So, getting ready to try again, I'll cut in half the 50's and go from there. If the pain is to awful, I'll revert back knowing I'll probably have to live with the \"patch\". Yes, the Mylan brand is by far the best. After almost 40 years on different pain remedies, I don't even know whats out there that isn't an opioid - and if they really work. I'll never take anything like oxy-or designer types because of the stigma, maybe that's why I want to stop using the patch. My doc' is all for it--but warns me to take it slow, as it didn't work last time. Best of luck to all. Hi I have/was on 212mcg every 3 days Abbas now on none. I made the patches last 5 days and not 3 days. It has been hard I was on my 5mcg patch it came off and did not know until I came to change it, so I have now stopped the patches it feels like I have a very bad head cold for the last 4 days but I am alive, Hi I have/was on 212mcg every 3 days And now on none.

It has been hard I was on my 5mcg patch it came off and did not know until I came to change it, so I have now stopped the patches it feels like I have a very bad head cold for the last 4 days but I am alive, WELL IS LIKE EVERYONE TO READ MY EXPERIENCE. MY DR GAVE ME 50 MG BALIUM AND 0.1 CLONIDIDINE. YOU TAKE 5 MG VALIUM 8 TIMES A DAY AND 3 CLONIDINES (lowers blood pressure) I had restless leg for 15 minutes first night. All done after 4 days. Just stopped medicine and I'm off. I was on 25 mg for 2 years, then 12 for 3 months now NOTHING. IM SO HAPPY AND PROUD. I am scheduled for surgery which I'm praying helps the pain. God bless you all with your journey. How is mylon different from the Durajesic patch? Would like to sound positive, but am afraid no-can-do. I started on 12mcgms and after 9 months leading up to a hip-replacement had graduated to 125. Had the op in December and have gradually weaned off until now, two months later, I am \"clean\". Unfortunately, being \"clean\" does nothing for the W/Ds. Sleeplessness, tingling feet that drive me to distraction, anxiety, restlessness, difficulty in concentrating, anger - you name it and I've got it. Can't be of any help I'm afraid, but rest assured that there are countless others of us going through the same s**t - you are NOT alone. All I can say is \"hang in there\". I doubt very much that a \"magic cure\" exists - if it did, wouldn't we have heard about it by now? Final comment - I am lucky enough to have family/friends who try to understand (even though they don't), and are remarkably patient (with the possible exception of my wife whose patience is definitely wearing thin, but who has to put up with me and my moods day in day out). My heart goes out to you - I KNOW what you're going through - just (like me) - hang in there. It WILL end one day. Best wishes. I started on 50 mcg's for severe arthritis. The sweating was not only unbearable it was embarrassing every 20 minutes. I dropped to 25 quickly with no problem but still got the severe sweating so I dropped to 12 and started with the tingling feet all night long. After some time I mastered it to a degree then stopped using it with disastrous effects. Walked the floor for 10 days with about 1 hour snooze in 24 hours. Lost 10 pounds (the only good thing). Must tell you all now there is a company that now does a 5 mcg patch changed once a week. I used 4 patches and it made it easier but you still have to persevere. I've been off for a year now with no problems. Good luck to all. Sorry all, but have to confess I'm now back on it. The last week has been unbearable so last night I halved a 12mgm patch and stuck it on. 12hrs later and none the better or wiser. Guess I'll just have to wait and see what transpires. This whole scenario is truly a bitch. Never mind Geordie mate, hang on in there it isn't going to harm you taking it, you'll get by. Take a look for the 5mcg patches another company do now, they are one patch a week and it worked for me. Wish you all the very best. Thanks TrueBlue 1938 for your kind wishes. Last night was the worst ever, but the 6mcg seems to have finally kicked in and am beginning to feel half-human today. Do you know if the 5mcg patch is available otc, or is it scrip only? Am trying to avoid my Doc at the moment - his platitudes and condescension are not what I'm after right now. I was fortunate, my doctor and drug store are in the same building and devised the plan together to get me off of Fentanyl that I took for about 5 years. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid and is only with prescription even the lower dose. My doctor is one in a million though and helps every way he can. I was prescribed one month of patches which is 4 patches, I could have had further prescriptions but the side effects to me (severe sweating) were worse than the pain. Why do you want off of it ? I thought CD was treated with antibiotics so what is prescribed to you mfor it ? Trueblue1938 - I want off Fentanyl because since my hip-replacement I am totally pain-free - not even taking Paradol, and I doubt very much if this is due to the Fentanyl. I was, after all, on 125mcg pre-op, which really wasn't achieving much even then. Having got down to 12 I suppose I should be feeling grateful, but if I no longer need it for pain relief, why the hell can't I get off it? I'm hoping this trial on 6 is a step in the right direction, but am having my doubts - still constantly on edge, although the feet problem doesn't seem to be reappearing. Thanks for your support and will keep you posted on progress. I found the feet sensations unbearable couldn't sleep at all with them. Much like quitting smoking it takes a long time to get over it I have a left knee replacement 1997, left hip 2000 and right hip 2005 and a pacemaker in 2005 as well, waiting to see when they will all wear out. But I have arthritis in the neck causing lots of pain that goes up to the back of my head which is why I tried Fentanyl. If you are over the feet sensations to me that was some 80% of the battle a good nights sleep being very much needed. Trueblue 1938 - mate, reading of your catalogue of ops makes me feel like an utter wimp. Why am I complaining? Couple of months after ONE op and I'm whingeing??? Let's just say that you are my hero. All I really (selfishly) want is a night's sleep. And a lessening of the anger/frustration. And to be \"nice\" again - like I used to be. An angry Grandad is not quite what kids expect. I will persevere (as much for their sake as mine) and see what happens. I admire your achievements mate. Wan on 100mcg patches for 2 years, then dropped to 75, now today started on 50. I've never been able to sleep without Temzapam, I've always had a sleeping issue but the getting off the patch is not entertaining at all. Nothing more than aches and restlessness so far... Have been off it for two weeks now and it's pretty grim. Feet are making it virtually impossible to sleep and have no energy whatsoever. Am determined not to go back on it though - although that could easily change of course! Will keep you posted on my progress (or lack of) - in the meantime, good luck to all fellow-sufferers Had fourth back surgery in Dec. Had been on 100 mcg fentanyl patches for several years... 4-5. Half of back is fused but am doing well now. My pain doc gradually decreased my dose and have been off everything for about six weeks. HOWEVER the withdrawals have been horrific. Massive headaches, insomnia. My husband and I sleep in separate beds sometimes because of my twitching and thrashing around. Been to er twice because of severe headaches but don't know whether these are tension or withdrawal symptms. How much longer will this take??? Have been off it for 3weeks now. Insomnia is the big issue, but whether that's due to the feet problem is debatable. Lie awake all night until finally dropping off between 4-5. Managing on 3hrs sleep is horrendous, but unfortunately one just has to get on with it. My Doc has been very supportive, but short of going onto sleeping pills - which I refuse to do - it's just a case of sucking it up. Not pleasant, but I'm determined to beat this. I hope things start to change for you. I can't know how you feel, however I can relate. I have chronic pain due to an accident at work 25 years ago. Add in the fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis, well pain is painful. We tried numerous med and treatments over the years nothing seemed to help but fentanyl. I was on 12mcg for 8 years. Then my Dr retired. The way things are you have to take the first Dr you can get. The new Dr took me off fentanyl, 25mcg per month down to 0. She does not give out any pain meds at all, nothing! I had my last 25mcg patch 2 weeks ago. Went to emerg twice, they wanted me back on fetal but I said what's the point when after the 2 weeks you prescribe the Dr would not give any. They said she can't take you off without anything for pain. Well... we are hopefully getting a new Dr in a few weeks. In the meantime I am here with little to no sleep, severe pain and total exhaustion. If something can be found other than fentanyl I will give it a go. Sorry... that was 125mcg for 8 years. An update for my fellow-sufferers. Have been off it for nearly 6 weeks now, and life is beginning to get slowly better. Still get the sweats/headaches and mood-swings, but all in all, things are looking up. At the moment, the hardest thing to cope with is the insomnia. 2 - 3 hours sleep a night is hard to live with, but once in a while I get a full night, and the joy of waking up fully rested cannot be described. The feet are definitely on the mend - not as much twitching/thrashing as before - which may explain my occasional full night's sleep. I feel that I'm almost there. It's been a long and painful (at times frightening) road, but I honestly believe I've nearly reached the end. Hang in there guys. I've been on 25mcg for three years, back injury in the cops. I'm sick of feeling like a junkie and didn't get my script filled over Easter. No sleep for me but I'm one day further down the track. Restless legs, aching body, flu symptoms and loose stools - I've been watching band of brothers to put my pain into perspective. My GP prescribed me Sifrol for the restlessness and it works a treat, I'm trying to sleep with endone as otherwise there's no sleep at all and my four G&G kids don't understand why i can't play today. Lucky to have a supportive wife and your stories to keep me motivated, one day at a time, thanks for your stories. Hotsauce74 - sorry to read of your troubles - what can I say? My last post was (I think) starting to sound positive, but here we are back again. Have just had one of the worst days in a long time - one minute you're up, the next someone kicks you in the guts. All I can say is that I've had a wee setback and I'll take it from there. Hope you and yours continue to stick it out together - best wishes mate. Hello all - I just found this site and I'm glad it's one that is current/real time rather than years old. I want to say thanks to all who are contributing here, as I am also trying to get off fentanyl patches after ~ 3 years of 50mcg every 48 hrs. It's so helpful to hear your experiences with withdrawal symptoms, as I have had a very tough week trying to go from 37 to 25mcg. I've been on 37 (12+25) for two months, and thought it time to take it down another step. Within hours of doing so I was hallucinating and freaking out. I'm giving some serious thought about the comment re: cutting Mylan patches into smaller doses, rather than going to the next level \"whole\" patch. Sounds like it just might work better!!! Please keep up the conversations - it seems to me that everyone is responsible, and committed to quitting. EVERYONE: FINGERS CROSSED, YES!!! Geordie, keep up the good work and stay positive! Well my last 25 patch was March 6th after being on 125mcg for 8 years. I will say it has and still is hell. I have had a few trips to emerge with a few Dr's wanting me back on the fentanyl. I am not sure if this is related to withdrawal or my thyroid med are out (no thyroid due to cancer). I am exhausted, out of breath, can hardly climb stairs, can't breath well lying down. I have gained 40 lbs since october. My friend a nurse had wondered if I have had a heart attack as one night I was alone and had excruciating pain through the abdomen to the back, , rather like gall bladder but I have none, my arm hurt. Good news we will be getting a new Dr in a few weeks. In the meantime I have no pain med at all. Has anyone here been prescribed CLONIDINE to help withdrawal symptoms? If so, what was your experience? After reducing my dosage last week from 37 to 25, within hours I was in bad shape. By the time I was able to get help from my pain dr., I had already put my 12 patch back on for 7 hours. Never took the drug. Anybody know if it will help when I try to reduce my dosage again? Many thanks, all ... I was prescribed clonidine as well as clonazipam. The clonidine lowered my blood pressure to 70/50 every time I took one so obviously took only a few. The clonazipam made me even more anxious and edgy. I think my withdrawal symptoms have passed. The last patch a 25 was middle march. It is hell going off fentanyl and I would recommend that your Dr monitor you. My Dr never explained what would happen and neither did she once take my BP, ask how I was doing. She only prescribed 25mcg less every three weeks. Going from a high dose to 0 in a short time was not recommended when I visited emerg. Having Patience - I have been presribed nothing since coming off Fentanyl. Don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Just didn't feel like substituting one more drug for another. Am still struggling through, but it's far from easy. The foot tingling/twitching has returned, have no energy - particularly in the lower legs (which appear to be wasting away to nothing). Am seriously wondering if I have developed MS or MD since my Op. Absolutely pain-free, but DOING anything is an ordeal. I'm just constantly tired.Whether or not this has anything to do with withdrawal I have no idea, but I don't think I can take much more of it. So my question to you is - do you think the substitute drugs are helping?? Geordie, I am not on any substitute drugs either. I couldn't take the cloning inexpensive or clonazipam. I am doing the hot baths, trying to walk for exercise and living with the pain. I certainly can't function the way I did with the fentanyl but my head feels clearer off it. I have hab blocks in the past through the throat and lower back for pain and may try it again. Sleep does not come easy. I hope you feel better soon. My pharmacist told me that after a month all withdrawal symptoms are gone and if you have symptoms it is because of something else. I tend to agree, I went through hell for a month with trips to emerg. What does your Dr think? Sorry... I could not take either the clonidine or clonazipam the side effects were too much. I have been reading all the comments. To telll you the truth I am really scared. I just started my weaning process from 75mcg to 50mcg. I am constantly cold. I live in AZ. I want to be me again. Luckily I have a Truly understand Husband. But I am tired of all this already. All of you have given me some hope. Thank You! Rdnkbrb... you may have easy withdrawal symptoms or some harder. As various pharmacists have said up to three weeks fully off is the worst of it. I had my last 25mcg in early March and have no symptoms now... just the same old pain. I am glad to be off it though, my head is so much clearer. Hang in there, you may go through feeling like you have been hit by a bus full oF people with the worst flu and you got it all. My son said he had never seen me so ill. I have had many surgeries, cancer and a small stroke all before 55 . He told his family that he thought I was dying. Other than the pain I feel great. In time you will also. Thankfully we both have very supportive husbands. rdnkbrb - don't be SCARED!!! This is nothing you won't get through. We are all going through the same s**t - just some of us are taking a bit longer than others to climb the hill. I have been \"clean\" for 2 months now but am still going through the process of clearing the body system and - more importantly - brain. That lump of grey matter is still crying out to be \"fed\" - but no way am I going to give in. My Doc actually said to me that I would \"experience a couple of days dicomfort\". Can you BELIEVE that? How the hell would HE know? It's taken - and still is - a long time, but I'm getting there. DON'T believe everything you've been told. It may be a nightmare for you (hopefully not), but you WILL get through it. As they say - just think positive. It seems to be working for me (even though the Missus gave up on me a while ago!) Geordie... you are doing so well. Some have it easy some a lot worse. We are all different people and our experience will be unique to us individually. Your journey has been a long one with many detours but you are on the right track. You are doing great! Take one step and one day at a time, you will get to your destination. Bye the way... unless your Dr has gone through this he has no idea of the true experience. Even if he has, your journey is yours, unique to you! Remember, fentanyl does not define who you are, you are not fentanyl. Geordie, have you considered that your sleep issues and tiredness may be from another cause? I know withdrawal is awful, but to me it sounds like possible thyroid issues and/or adrenal fatigue. I strongly urge you to research those things. I bet some great supplements might help your body out and get some good sleep and feel better. Just a thought :) Geordie, it would not hurt to have your thyroid checked as suggested. I have had Mty thyroid removed due to cancer and symptoms of sleep issues and leg twitching, weakness etc are also. You may ask if your vitamin B12 be checked. Yes a low level of this vitamin can create serious issues in your body. Hello - my name is Pete. I have a rare muscle disorder called generalized myoclonic dystonia. I started with hydrocodone; my dosage gradually increased. Next was Percocet. Before I knew it I was on the max dosage of 10 10/325's a day. Next - pure Oxy. It did nothing. Then it was Fentanyl. A 100 patch at first - I hated it so I dropped to a 75 an 4 Percs as needed. It worked great at first but I had to use a new patch every day as my body quickly stopped getting any relief from wearing a patch for 72 and then 48 hours. I want off. Heat releases more of the med. and the subsequent feelings make me want to eat my gun. I don't because I really want to live. I love my wife, my children and my grandchildren. Well I live on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. May - September is in the 90's. I need heating pads for my legs - more Fentanyl into my system. My solution to getting off the patch was simple - cut 1/8 inch off the patch every week. The patch is 18/8's long so - 18 weeks. If I cut more than that, say a 1/4 of an inch I would get very nauseas, vomiting followed. The patch I use is the \"FENTANYL TRANSDERMAL SYSTEM 75 mcg/hr\" The manufacture is Mallinckrodt. This patch is essentially a \"sticky patch\" unlike other brands that are \"gel filled\" pouches. The difference between the 2 is night and day. Cutting 1/8 a week is ~5% and easily doable. I have 1/2 inch - 4/8 left to go. This is my suggestion - small decrease over time means a gradual reduction with little if any side-effects. I'm trying to wean down from 50 to 25. It is HELL! I want to die!!! Wired up and anxiety through the roof!!! I've never felt like this in my life!! I'm terrified! What can I do? My pain doc gave me oxycodone to help with this extreme exhaustion/wired feeling. What else can I do! I'm ready to check myself into a mental hospital. It never stops... Enjoy I just been tapered from 25 to 12 now Im no longer replacing the 12 with anymore patches, when will the withrawal start? Cances are you will continue with withdrawal for some time. however, There is a patch on the market now of 5mcg/hour made by Butran's. Each Butran patch lasts for one week. I took these 5mcg's for one month and continue to have what I consider severe withdrawal not having slept any more than a couple of hours a day. get the mylan brand anytime you are tapering! you can cut them up which helps the process it saved me!! 3 days no patches after on 8 mcg every day Yes, Mylan brand works best! I had been on 75mcg q 48 hrs for about 3 years, constipation, clouded mind, lethargy etc. I couldn't stand it anymore so with a new Dr's help and a slowly decreasing dose I have just finished my last patch! It is so awesome to think clearly again!!! He took me down 5-7 mcg at a time x10 days at each dose. (Done by cutting up 25 & 50 mcg patches) It has taken almost 4 months but I only have had slight withdrawal symptoms, worst is the diarrhea and some increased pain. I still take Hydrocodone, Clonipen and Lunesta, working on the Hydrocodone next, I will be looking for a new pain med... not sure what the dr has in mind for that??? Anyway, good luck and go very gradually, it's worth it! Hi guys I have been on fentynl for over two years and I'm really struggling coming down I decided to do it myself but I'm suffering terribly with increased pain cold sweats I also have fuzzy head I was on a hundred dropped to 75mg and three days ago I dropped again to 50 mg guys I feel worse than ever think maybe I ought to go to the doctors can I get some feedback bk from some one please thks jane You are going down way too fast. I went from 75 -65- 60-50 over 6 wks. Then 49 for a 2 wks then 32 for a wk an now at 25. I plan on going down slower from here. Not sure what my plan is yet. My withdrawal has been minimal. I want to be off by sept or oct. Mylan brand is best to get at the end. U can go slower at your pace. Good Luck. I'm really sorry that you're having a terrible time, I pray that you have a easier time. I am also getting off the patches, and I have been on the 75.mcg patches for 6-8 yrs, and what I'm doing is, I dropped to 50. and then for a month, and then 25. For a month, and last 12. for the final month. It's easier that way. I was on 100 every 2-3 days for almost 10 yrs and I'm tampering down now . On my second week of 75 and I'm having withdrawal symptoms. The dr said it would be fine / it isn't fine ! Restlessness , stomach upset n loose stools and headaches . Worst second week than the first and I'm suppose to wean to 50 next ? Any suggestions appreciated! I don't take anything else . Go to the Emergency room, you should never try to do this yourself! WEANING OFF FENTANYL the easy way... Many doctors may not prescribe this or even believe in it, however I've used it very effectively in the past. My daughter also works at a Veterinary practice as a scrub nurse and they do the same thing for animals. Because the animals use such small doses they cut the patches down to size. 1) Good ruler, preferably clear, but it doesn't have to be. 2) A very sharp \"fine\" permanent marker. 3) A good surface to work on. 4) A pair of sharp scissors. 5) A pair of reading glasses bcuz my eyes are not great. A good goal for is/was 25 MCG every 4 weeks. Figure out, by the size in MCG(Really... MILLIMETERS) of your patch, how much to go down at each patch change. I change my patch every 48 hours. I started out at 100 MCG. * When I use the word SPLIT or SECTION below, I do not mean actually cutting the patch ... The only time I will cut the patch is when I use the word CUT! * I figure out how big/long the patch is. I section it into quarters. [I would now wean down one quarter, or 25 MCG, every 4 weeks]. I then split that quarter into quarters... And removed 1 quarter every third change, or 6 days. Measure the entire patch. If the patch is 80 mm long... One quarter of that is going to be 20 mm. One quarter of that will be 5 mm. Cut off 5mm of the patch and put the rest of the patch on as instructed earlier. Cut two more patches just like this if you're on the 48-hour plan. I'm not saying that the patch is 80 mm long. Different brands are different sizes. I was just using this as an example. If you are going to use this method, please measure carefully, and do all of this with a clear head. I am not telling you that this will work for you or it is safe for you... As I am not in the medical field. I am just telling you what my experience has been and how wonderful it has worked for me in the past. I was on 100 MCG, 40 mg of oxy per day, and 15 mg of oxycodone 4 times a day. I am now on 25 MCG patch, and 5 mg of oxycodone 4 to 5 times a day. My pain has increased over the years, yet I am on less medication. At some point I may wean off of the patch entirely. If you do use this method please let me know how it work for you. And if you have any questions please let me know. Blessings! Dear Jane, I realize by the date of this answer that any advice I give you at this time will probably be to late. Although maybe I can shed some light on this subject as to help others. I've been on fentanyl for 11 yrs. An incredible long time. When I first went to a pain specialist in Saskatchewan for the first time I was already taking demerol prescribed by a GP. When I got to the pain specialist we spoke at length at what could be done for pain control. The first patch I ever put on was a 25mcg fentanyl patch. Over the next 6mons I was increased up to 150 mcg. That is a wopping dose of pain patches. The same time I was using these patches the doctor also increased my demoral as well. Well it was many missed days blurred into weeks and months of not knowing really that life was passing me by all high on these drugs. One day I went to the pain specialist after about a year and just simply said I didn't feel that my pain was so severe that I needed to take such a high dosage of medication. Over that year alone I gained 25lbs because all I was doing was sleeping my life away, eating and watching tv. Unfortunately no appetite for life. It was gone. So 25mcg by 25mcg every 2 months I would go down 25 mcg. I finally got down to 50mcg and told the doctor I was happy to stay with that and he agreed. He decided at that time he would take me off demoral and put me on T2's. They weren't strong enough and eventually I went up to T4's x 4 per day. So this is what I've been taking for about aprox 10 years now. I recently moved back to BC from SK. The doctors here frown apon fentanyl. There's been too many deaths in BC and don't feel its a medication to be used for chronic pain. I'm a responsible person and do not agree with what they say. However, I was going to be taken off this medication whether I wanted to or not. So we began. I started at 50mcg and was taken down in segments of patches 12mcg every 2 moms. It took my body a whole month just to adjust to the withdrawal symptoms which includes, lightheadedness, continual stretching like you just woke up. strange feelings in my arms like I wanted to punch them to stop it. Jumping legs, diarrhea, nausea, insomnia flushing and sweating. By the end of the second month my body had a rest and I was able to go down another 12 mcg and so on, until the very last 12mcg. On the very last patch of 12mcg, I just left the patch on for 5days until it basically had nothing left to give and fissled out on its own. On the 5th night I removed it but I was still feeling withdrawals such as lightheadedness jumping legs and weakness. I did this without any extra help. I still take my T4's daily but sometimes only have to take about 3 a day. When I read how fast your doctor made you go down I found it neglegent on your doctors part. Telling you to do it yourself is absolutely ridiculous and ludicrous all in a measure. I'm so sorry that happened to you and hope you don't have any long lasting ill effects from it. I read other peoples comments as well. You are to never cut any fentanyl patch in half. It is so dangerous. That's not the way to do it. I'm sure if you asked any pharmacy or read the paperwork of the fentanyl patch box it will tell you just that. I'm glad to be off it. My doctor did me rite. I feel alive again. I wish everyone here the absolute best and hope that my own personal info helps even one person, that would make me feel great about what I experienced and gone thru over this part of my life. Take Care Everyone. Hello BlessedbyGod, First of all NOBODY should ever wean off Fentanyl by themselves-without a Doctor- let alone be TOLD to do so. I understand you are probably better by now- hopefully- but I felt it was important to answer this anyhow. If a doctor is helping you wean off, withdrawal symptoms shud be relatively minor as apposed to not hvin help. Although the sleep issues and even the GI issues, could be some withdrawal. I hope you are okay now and tht you are being continualy blessed by God. April I just would like to see god and religion prohibited from use of any sort. These are medical questions, and deserve medical responses. Blessed by a god has no place in these types of forums. Should be a rule to keep religious references out of the equation. There are churches for that type of help. This is a public forum and if you are offended by references to God or other religious expressions you are free to move along. In order to reduce any anxiety you may feel, of course. Spirituality has been a part of medicine and healing for thousands of years and its effectiveness for certain patients is well documented. If you found a treatment matrix that worked for you how would you feel about someone ridiculing it or even trying to take it away? If it works for anyone we should be anxious to understand why. That is how knowledge is formed. If it is not for you walk away on your own path. Besides, \"BlessedByGod is her SCREEN NAME!! She didn't say anything about God in her question. But even if she did, just like someone already said, religion has had its place in the medical community just about forever. Sounds like maybe you don't feel you were blessed by God and that's what really irritated you? God helps those who help themselves:-)! May God Bless you!! I totally agree. If the person is offended by someone saying they are blessed by God, what is the issue? I will tell you that I just had major back surgery 4 weeks ago & up until I had it I was on Fentanyl 50 mcg for almost a year. After my surgery I weened down by 12.5 mcgs every 6 days & now am completely off of it. I am having some bad issues now, like not being able to sleep properly & headaches, and I would like to know when these symptoms will cease, but I will tell you this. If it were not for the grace & love of God I would not have made it through my last 14 years of medical stress including having cancer. So I suggest that if you have an issue with God & His love for all of us, then maybe you might like to look at another group or maybe think about what God can do for you. Then I ask Godto doubly bless you since you seem to need it. Yes I agree with Randolph. 1st of all there are many Religions used around this world and we don't need to hear about every ones \"God\" related to their Religion being the one to pray to for help, as this is a forum about \"DRUGS\" only, not what or who you believe in that has anything to do with what man creates to aid what troubles you. How do you know your God is even the right God you think of to trust with your life and family, when there are so many others being worshipped on this planet? If you don't want to hear of other Gods being mentioned in this forum, keep yours to your self. 2nd Religion is man made. There is a huge difference between Spirituality and Religion. Yet you speak of both here as if they are one. I am a spiritual person not Religous who doesn't believe in just one God you are referring to in that little black book of yours. I have a Higher Power I believe in that is too grand to even begin to understand or define to others as it isn't necessary in order for me to believe in it so I can pray to it for direction and believe it hears my prayers, It is so grand I can't begin to understand it but just believe it is out there and that is enough for me to pray to it without having to understand what or who it is, although I do choose to call it God (MY GOD) for a lack of a better name as Frank or George don't cut it for me so when I speak of my God of my lack of understanding I am talking about the one and only creator of this entire universe and any life forms contained within it, not just this planet.. It is too grand for such menial people to be defining and thinking they understand it with their small weak misunderstanding minds. Tell me when your God was born like his so called son was, how long does it live for and when will it die. Never to all questions as it was here before it created this awesome universe and will remain continually expanding it and life within it until energy is non exsistant. So you don't even know what you speak of when using that name in this forum, telling other to suck it up and shut up if they don't feel comfortable with as I don't feel comfortable with you speaking like that, so just keep your wisdom to what you know of what drugs we discuss here please. If you need more information your \"GOD\" won't give it to you but a pharmacist if you step off your pedestal to ask one, as they know more about these medications than the doctors themselves. They know all they need to, to understand who to give what to in order to get kick backs for how much they can subscribe to you so they can make a living too.. You are just their guinea pig trying them out to see how they work or don't work and what they may do to harm you. Just look at the law suits going on the TV about so many drugs harming and disfiguring people. So don't let them suck you into trying the new and improved stuff fresh on the market. You are best sticking with older drugs already proved to be save to consume. I would like to agree with you about using a doctor to get off the fentanyl patches, but the truth is that I couldn't find a doctor who would treat me for the withdrawal symptoms while I was using medical marijuana for the pain relief. My pain specialist dropped me immediately when I started using the medical marijuana. He wanted to up my dose to control the pain. I was abandoned by the medical community and I am angry with our government that treat's natural products like a crime making it impossible to get a doctor who is willing to help you. I am glad that you have had good results with your doctor and that your pain is gone. For me I am going to be in pain the rest of my life from spinal cord disease that affects my ability to walk to the next room, but I am walking for now. With the Grace of the Almighty God! I am hopeful you are off this drug by now. I was on 3patches at50 micron. I was also on oxycodone. I am now down to 1 patch at 50, and no more oxy. I was on the 3 patches and the oxy for 4 years. It was a very difficult transition to get where I am at. My problem is I cannot get off the last patch. I start withdrawal about 2 hours after the patch should have been changed. These are the worst systems I ever had. Tremors, sweating, upset stomach anxiety and a increase in pain. I am thinking I may have to keep it. Anyone have any ideas? Patch880 and Randolph. You are taking issue with the mention of God saying this is just about medications. I think this is all about what helped someone get relief from pain. If it is God that helped then I think it's wonderful. Why get upset about little things. get over it and learn from each other. Yes Randolph, I sure agree with you on there being some kind of rule about Religion or any parts of it being included in any medical discussions here as it has no place in medicine what so ever; with the small exception they keep a room for anyone to go to pray to whatever GOD of theirs over a loved one (but usually, mostly for themselves and their feelings) in bad shape who may need all the prayers they can get; however, they all don't come from the same God that's for sure. So unless we want to talk about politics in here as well, I say keep Religion out of here all together, as we have many people from all parts of the world that may be offended by hearing what they read about it. After all, how long has it been since they abolished the Lord's Prayer from school rooms even?? To the person that posted that no talk of religion should be allowed in this forum. You no more have the right to tell us to refrain from talking about God, than we do you to tell you that you have to agree with our beliefs. Opinions are just that, opinions. You have the right to yours, just as we have the right to ours. With that said, I do believe in God, and I could not get through this journey without Him. I am so thankful to know that God is with me and others or whatever it is that helps you get past this and want a healthier and better life for ourselves. I'm also thankful to know that it's ok for people to talk about God being with us and helping us through a very difficult time in our lives, or whatever it is that is helping you through this. The withdrawal symptoms can be bad enough, so if you find something that helps you, as long as it doesn't hurt you or someone else, then may God be with you and guide you through the hardest of times. And God bless this community site. Patch880 it's funny how you went into the longest speach of anyone about God and what you believe in. Someone else just mentioned God in one sentence and that is wrong but you can write half a book about your beliefs and that's ok? Doesn't make much sense to me. Both of you that had issue with it caused way more conversation about it then if you would have just left the little thing alone. Funny how God works isn't it !!! I also hope you r doing well and will pray for you. I stand with them here as a defender that people can express their faith in God here. Many of us who struggle with pain find comfort in God and in the fact that we are not alone in believing in God while experiencing pain, side effects as a result of medicine, etc. May God give us all the comfort and help .. Recently I was taken off the patch. I was on 100 mcg for two yrs the told to taper off by myself. The withdrawals can be mild as you are stating to severe as; loose stools, vomiting, cold sweats, anxiety, tremor, upset stomach. What I'm trying to say it will be like a major flu and you can have symptoms a couple weeks to a month after taking the patch off. Be careful if you have certain health conditions. You may have to be in the hospital, but not always. GOOD LUCK!! Thank you so much for your response. I seem to have days with no withdrawal symptoms (so I think I am over the worst) and then the next day I will start having the symptoms again (anxiety, loose stools, feet tinlging and inability to sleep). My doctor said that the symptoms typically last 5 to 7 days. I am on day 7 and last night was a rough one. My doctor says to stay on the 12 mcg for a month and then to stop using the patch completely. When I stop using the patch completely will there be another series of withdrawal symptoms? Will those withdrawal symptoms be worse then when going down from 25 to 12? I would try wearing your last of the patches one day longer each time. I dont know if it will help but thats how my dr did mine and I was on 100 mcg patch. Again, Good Luck!!( the W/Ds will lesson soon. Also, I forgot to add, due to my Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, I have constipation anyway, do no loose stools, no vomiting, but YES it is hard to sleep and your pain will increase, but the pain is easier to deal with than the withdrawal effects. Hello Ms. Shelton, did you decrease from 100 down to 75, then 25, then 12? I am on 75 now and increased monthy from 25 to 50 hen to 75. I want to go off the medication and try and deal with the pain. I am asking you because you have experience. I am also on a anti depressant and anexity medication. Thank you Blesssings. In the last 10 yrs I have had multiple surgeries. The worst being 2 Cspine surgeries because the neuro surgeons said if not I would be quadlapegic. I have been on the fentanyl patches 100mch for 8 years every 48 hours and have stayed on that dose. This med is hell.Although it has helped pain my doc went on vacation and I found myself short one patch until tomorrow. In just a matter of hours I have started sweating, I'm soaked and I am curled up on the couch like a zombie!! This happened in just hours of not wearing one. My husband is on 75mcg and is going to be tapering off, he is very anxious that it will be hard to do what was the best way that you suggest? I am trying to get off 75cgh-h and I'm coping ok with most things it throws at me but what I can't find and where is how to stop the restless legs that only start as I fall asleep and are very extreme. There us no chance of sleep this pls advise me anyone. ... sammyjoewhite they shouldn't have taken you off like that if you do a Google search on them it will tell you everything I wanted to ask you about your tapering off. I have been on the Fentanyl 75mcg every 48 hrs, for over 15 years! No, that is not a type o. Last month I decided I want to get these manufactured opioids out of my body. So I started to extend them to every 3 days. So far so good but I'm wondering, what kind of side effects you experienced and if you are off the patch for good? Any info you can give me will be a huge help. Thank you for your time Hello BlessedByGod1. The good news might be that these side effects will diminish, taper off and will pass. Other than encouragement, it truly is a wait it out sort of thing. Regards pledge Thank you for your response. The withdrawal symptoms seem to diminsh for a day or two and then they reappear. Today is the 7th day since I dropped down to the 12 mcg patch. Last night was rough (very anxious, feet tingling constantly and inability to sleep). Is this a common occurrence? Yes it is.
