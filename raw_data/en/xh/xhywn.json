To be added to the list, submit a registration and deposit. Meditation can be seen as the process of learning to recognize and trust a natural quality of awareness that is available to all of us in any moment no matter what is happening in our experience. This awareness allows us to open to and connect with the truth of each moment. As we gain confidence in the mind's ability to recognize this natural awareness we begin to release the burden of trying to control, manipulate, or fix experience so that it meets our ideas of the way it should be, and relax into the truth of the way it actually is. Clear seeing and wisdom arise naturally and we see directly for ourselves what leads to well-being and freedom and what leads to suffering, both in our own life and in the world around us. Through this process we begin to live our lives from a place of greater balance, integrity, confidence, and connection. This silent retreat, open to both beginners and experienced meditators, will offer guided meditations and instructions, time for questions and discussion with the teachers. Optional mindful movement based on qigong will be offered by teacher Greg Scharf. A limited number of You Choose fee spaces are available for ages 18-26.
