Skin cancer specialists at the OSUCCC &ndash; James are conducting an immunotherapy study that could lead to a new use for influenza vaccination through a more targeted method of injection. &ldquo;Instead of just receiving the vaccine in your arm as you would on an annual basis, we inject it directly into the melanoma so that it can recognize and kill the cancer cells,&rdquo; Carlo Contreras, MD, says. The study is one of many immunotherapy efforts underway at Ohio State, where researchers work every day to harness the body&rsquo;s own defenses to target cancer. &ldquo;Immunotherapy has become so important over the last five to 10 years,&rdquo; Contreras says. &ldquo;Immunotherapy boosts the patient's own immune system so it's better able to recognize and kill off melanoma tumor cells.&rdquo; Learn more about melanoma, including risks, symptoms and treatment options at the OSUCCC &ndash; James. The next frontier of cancer treatment Immunotherapy research continues to grow in scope and efficacy at Comprehensive Cancer Centers like the OSUCCC &ndash; James, where oncologists across several disciplines are working with patients to improve outcomes using the new treatments. Through work by Ohio State&rsquo;s immunotherapy experts &mdash; including those at the groundbreaking Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-Oncology &mdash; researchers are expanding the immune systems of patients through intravenous, oral or topical administration, and then unleashing the enhanced capabilities to fight and kill cancer cells.
