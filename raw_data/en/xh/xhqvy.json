Although usually harmless, the common cold can be frustrating to deal with, and lowers your immune function temporarily. Luckily there are slew of herbal remedies one can incorporate into their diet to aid in remedying the cold virus. Many of these herbs can be used to soothe a sore throat, decongest and generally feel better. These are also easy herbs to grow in your backyard or kitchen garden. While it is true that basil season is in the summer, this does not mean that you can keep it all year round. To enjoy herbs like basil in winter, finely chop up the leaves of basil that are freshly harvested and store them in an ice cube tray. Fill up the tray with water and freeze. Basil can aid in reducing symptoms of coughs, colds, and the flu. One of the best ways to consume it is to use it as a garnish on salads, soups, and even dals. Rosemary is an age-old herb known to provide relief for colds and sore throats. Known for its anti-viral and anti-microbial properties, it is said to stimulate the blood circulation to the brain to ease headaches. Inhaling the steam from its boiled leaves and stem bits works effectively for nasal and chest congestion. Thyme, a member of the mint family is a staple spice available in most kitchens and it has a distinct flavour. Historically, it was used by the ancient Greeks as incense and ancient Egyptians used it for embalming purposes. Of late, thyme is quickly gaining traction for its immune-boosting, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. Thyme essential oil prepared from its leaves is known to be an excellent decongestant and expectorant. Thyme leaves are rich in Vitamins A and C and drinking thyme tea can help clear congestion and mucus caused by flu. The edible red clover tea, prepared from its pinkish pale purple buds is a preferred home treatment for stubborn colds, dry coughs, bronchitis and even whooping cough. Gargling with the tea also aids in relieving sore throat. The herb is rich in Vitamin C and micronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and thiamine, that help kickstart the immune system. Spearmint is a mild variety of mint whose leaves have proved to be a great cold reliever. In aromatherapy, its oil is used for mind and body rejuvenation, and as a treatment for respiratory conditions such as cold, cough and acute bronchitis. Garlic has been used since time immemorial as a health remedy, with records dating back as far as 5000 years ago detailing its health benefits. This history exists for good reason as garlic has anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-fungal benefits making it one of the most effective immunity-boosting herbs one can enlist the aid of. Even garlic supplements can prevent flu symptoms. Ginger is referred to medicinally as a diaphoretic. In other words, it is a compound that can induce sweating. This feature makes ginger highly effective when it comes to relieving flu symptoms or breaking a fever. Ginger can be consumed as a spice in meals or in the form of tea. It is highly effective at relieving the symptoms of a sore throat, especially when crushed and mixed with hot water that can be sipped or gargled with. Horseradish is also among the easy herbs to grow. It is a spicy root that is chocked full of vitamin C but also contains compounds like sulforaphane and isothiocyanate that are known to clear up one's congestion. By grating the root, and adding vinegar to taste, one can easily make their own horseradish condiment. It is recommended to avoid consuming horseradish in excessive amounts if one is struggling with any gastrointestinal or kidney-related disorders. Another plant option to try is lemongrass which can aid in relieving cold and flu symptoms. It is traditionally consumed in the form of hot tea after brewing the herb overnight. This tea is full of antioxidants that aid in reducing flu-like symptoms while vitamin C also aids in treating coughs. Another manner in which lemongrass can be taken is to simply put a mesh bag full of chopped up leaves of lemongrass in a bathtub so you can soak in as you fill up your tub. Licorice root is different from licorice extract. The former is a herb that aids flu symptoms by working on the mucous membrane lining the throat making it very effective when one is struggling with a cough or cold. It can be consumed similar to how cough syrup is taken or can be brewed into a tea that will have slightly dampened but just as effective impact. Herbal remedies are often effective in combating flu symptoms. These herbs can easily be grown in your backyard. Ensure you are consuming them in safe amounts and preferably with other foods, instead of directly.
