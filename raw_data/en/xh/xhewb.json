At RWJBarnabas Health, we share King's belief in the power of compassionate action. Each of our hospitals is actively engaged in making a difference on critical community issues, including housing, employment, food security and economic empowerment. That includes everything from hiring locally to finding ways to make fresh, affordable produce widely available. System-wide, we've added RWJBarnabas Health TeleMed, a telemedicine service that improves access to care for people with transportation or scheduling challenges. To expand our community reach, we partner with other organizations, like the New Jersey Devils, to bring about positive change. One example: Collaborating with the staff of the Barnabas Health Hockey House at Newark's Prudential Center, our specialty physicians and nutrition experts have developed a youth hockey program that promotes optimal performance and good health while building confidence, sportsmanship and life skills. It's now available at ice-hockey rinks throughout the state. The Devils organization and players, including NHL MVP Taylor Hall, also work closely with us to bring encouragement and moments of joy to hospitalized children. Partnerships with nonprofit organizations like Mercer Street Friends reflect the RWJ University Hospital Hamilton family's commitment to serving our community beyond the healthcare setting. And our dedication to ensuring community well-being is demonstrated daily. Caring for patients at the hospital, occupational health program or physician practices; sharing knowledge through robust community education programs; and providing health screenings at community events and senior centers\u2014it's our mission to make a difference in our community any way we can. At RWJBarnabas Health, we believe in the greatness of the New Jersey community and are glad to help improve quality of life for everyone who, like us, calls the Garden State home.

Healthy Together | 4 | Winter 2019 Hamilton_WinterWellness_Winter19_final.indd 4 12/17/18 1:36 PMFor many people, winter is a time for family get-togethers and cozy evenings cocooned from chilly winds. But unless a little care is taken, winter also can bring unpleasant experiences\u2014like getting sick or being injured. \"Winter definitely is a difficult time of year from many perspectives,\" says Sofia Mavasheva, MD, a specialist in internal medicine at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton. Dr. Mavasheva says the biggest winter wellness challenges include staying active, maintaining good nutrition and, first and foremost, battling influenza. KEEP FLU AT BAY Behavioral changes stemming from cold weather cause some of the problems. \"We spend more time indoors and keep our houses closed up\u2014there's no fresh air going through,\" Dr. Mavasheva notes. \"We're in closed spaces with other people and end up sharing flu and other viruses with each other.\" Historically, seasonal flu cases peak in February. But December, January and March are also active months\u2014and flu season runs from October to May. Vaccination is the first line of defense against flu and is recommended for everybody. \"You need to be vaccinated,\" Dr. Mavasheva says. This is especially true for people at high risk for complications from flu. That includes those 65 and older, pregnant women, children younger than 5 and people of any age with a chronic medical condition, including asthma, diabetes and heart disease. Vaccinations take two weeks to start working; get a flu shot as soon as the flu starts spreading in your community. \"We always tell patients to please vaccinate to reduce your exposure to the flu virus,\" Dr. Mavasheva emphasizes. After vaccination, handwashing is the next best way to prevent flu. \"Sanitize, sanitize, sanitize,\" Dr. Mavasheva advises. \"Clean hands are the key defense in dealing with the flu virus.\" If you do catch the flu, don't give it to somebody else. \"This virus gets from person to person via droplets in the air, which we're all breathing together,\" Dr. Mavasheva says. \"If you're sick, the best thing to do is not to go to work and share it with your coworkers.\" STAY ACTIVE In addition to being prime time for flu, winter lends itself to inactivity. Daylight hours are fewer and temperatures are colder. It's natural to want to stay inside where it's warm. However, Dr. Mavasheva suggests pushing back against the impulse to lounge the winter away. \"It's good to stay in some sort of exercise program throughout the year,\" she says. \"A lot of people like to walk. Weather permitting, continue to do that. Just dress a little warmer.\" You can also walk indoors at the mall. Not keen on walking? Try swimming laps in an indoor pool, taking a yoga class or using exercise equipment, such as a stationary bike or a rowing machine. EAT WELL When snow blankets fields, locally grown produce naturally becomes hard to find. But good nutrition is still important, so don't skip the fruits and vegetables. Veggies imported from warmer climates are available year-round. \"At least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, winter or not,\" urges Dr. Mavasheva. \"Try to stick to that as much as you can. That's a source of fiber and vitamins that should not be neglected.\" One way to up your intake of vegetables this winter: Make some vegetable soup. Soups are a great cold- weather comfort food, and it's easy to find healthy recipes online. AVOID ACCIDENTS The frozen precipitation that can make winter beautiful also makes it slippery. Walking is tricky on ice- and snow- covered walkways. As a result, emergency departments see more injuries from falls in winter than other seasons. \"People fall, and often break bones,\" Dr. Mavasheva says. \"One has to use extra caution.\" Otherwise, simply stepping out to get the morning newspaper can result in a trip to the emergency room. SOFIA MAVASHEVA, MD To help prevent falls, shovel and treat sidewalks, driveways and steps promptly after snow. When visiting older friends and family, remember to check indoors and out for fall hazards around the home. Taking these wellness tips to heart will help make this winter your healthiest yet.IS IT A COLD OR THE FLU? In most cases, it's easy to tell the difference between a harmless cold and potentially dangerous flu. \"Usually people use the phrase, 'I feel like I was hit by a truck,' to describe how they feel when they have the flu,\" says Sofia Mavasheva, MD, a specialist in internal medicine at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton. Along with common cold symptoms like sneezing, having a runny nose and coughing, flu sufferers generally have painful body aches and a high fever. Upper respiratory symptoms are noticeably worse, too. \"You feel generally very miserable,\" Dr. Mavasheva says. \"If you feel that way, most likely you have the flu. Get yourself to the doctor right away.\" Doctors can diagnose flu by swabbing a patient's nose and testing for the virus. Often, they treat patients with an antiviral medication, which can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. If you suspect you have the flu, get to the doctor within 24 to 48 hours of when symptoms start. \"The sooner we start treatment, the better,\" Dr. Mavasheva says.

Healthy Together | 6 | Fall 2018 Healthy Together | 6 | Winter 2019 Hamilton_Afib_Winter19_final.indd 6 12/17/18 1:38 PMThat feeling when your heart flutters, misses a beat, speeds up or slows down can be alarming. Though these palpitations are often harmless, they can signal serious malfunctions in the heart's muscles and nerves. The most common type of irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, is atrial fibrillation\u2014AFib for short. At least 2.7 million Americans are living with AFib, and that number is expected to grow as the average age of the population rises. Untreated AFib significantly increases both risk of heart-related death and risk of stroke. WHAT IS AFIB? When the heart beats, it squeezes and that pushes blood through each of the heart's four chambers. With AFib, the top two chambers of the heart quiver instead of beating regularly. This means the heart can't pump well so some blood is left sitting. And when blood is stationary, clots form. Blood flowing through the heart can sweep clots out into the circulatory system, where they can cause blockages that lead to complications such as stroke. ANALYZING SYMPTOMS The first step in assessing an arrhythmia is a thorough patient history. Doctors look for clues: When do symptoms occur? Are they associated with specific activities? Do lifestyle factors contribute? Will weight loss help? For instance, sleep apnea, associated with obesity, can cause arrhythmia, including AFib. Stress and medications also can play roles. Several tests are used to diagnose AFib. An electrocardiogram (ECG) records electrical signals as they move through the heart and can show irregularities. To further evaluate how the heart is working, patients may be asked to wear a portable ECG device called a Holter monitor for 24 hours or longer. An event recorder is a portable device that monitors heart activity over longer periods\u2014a few weeks to a few months. Patients activate the device when they experience symptoms and doctors are able to review the heart's rhythm at the time symptoms occurred. RESETTING RHYTHM Treatment for AFib aims to regulate the heartbeat and prevent clots from forming. If the AFib is caused by an underlying condition, that will be treated first. The heart's regular rhythm (called sinus rhythm) can be reestablished using medication, an electrical shock (cardioversion) or a combination of the two. Before cardioversion is performed, a blood-thinning medication is recommended for several weeks to reduce the risk of blood clots and stroke. If those treatments don't work, a minimally invasive procedure can be used to ablate, or destroy, the tissues that trigger or maintain the disruptive rhythms. This stops the arrhythmia at its source. Blood thinners are prescribed to help prevent blood clots. Because AFib can occur without symptoms, many patients continue these medications even after normal heart rhythm is reestablished. With active monitoring, patients who have AFib can reduce their risk of complications. It's important to keep follow-up appointments with a primary care provider, who will watch for and help manage additional stroke risk factors, including high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking and obesity. WHO IS AT RISK? If you have one or more of the following conditions, you may be at higher risk for atrial fibrillation, or AFib : Alcohol use (especially binge drinking) Coronary artery disease Heart failure or an enlarged heart Family history of AFib Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) High blood pressure Valvular heart disease Lung disease Sleep apnea Advanced age You are a high-performance or endurance athlete WHEN TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR The symptoms below have many possible causes\u2014atrial fibrillation (AFib) is just one of them. Consult your physician if you experience: Fluttering or thumping in the chest Heart palpitations\u2014periods of especially rapid, intense heartbeat Confusion Dizziness, lightheadedness Fainting Fatigue Weakness Loss of ability to exercise Shortness of breath Get it checked.

Friends Food Bank. Currently the two organizations are working on integrating the RWJBarnabas Health Wellness on Wheels program (see story, page 12) with the Mercer Street Friends Preschool curriculum. The two organizations partnered after RWJUH Hamilton identified these community needs from a system survey. \"One of the things that was driven home was that there were issues of nutrition, and especially obesity, in our community that needed to be addressed,\" says Ted Taylor, Director, Pastoral Care, at RWJUH Hamilton. When the hospital looked at potential partners for a community impact initiative on nutrition, Mercer Street Friends was a natural partner. What happens when a community-focused hospital and a dynamic, local human services agency join forces? Kids get healthy food and learn important, lifelong lessons about nutrition. Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton and Trenton, New Jersey, non-profit Mercer Street Friends kicked off their collaboration last year when, during the hospital's Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service, members of hospital management visited a preschool and food bank run by the Quaker-affiliated human-services agency. \"A whole team of our senior leadership did a day of reading with preschool kids and a day of work at the food bank,\" says Diane Grillo, Vice President of Health Promotion. Next, hospital staff donated more than 50 backpacks filled with food during the August \"Send Hunger Packing\" food drive. Even more recently, RWJUH Hamilton collected donations of food and hygiene kits for seniors, to be distributed by Mercer Street The nonprofit began in 1958 and today runs programs in career development and parenting, as well as education and nutrition. Next up: a collaboration that will teach preschoolers about nutrition and healthy eating. \"The idea is that children will teach parents,\" explains Lauren Stabinsky, Director, Community and Corporate Wellness. \"We're trying to educate children and have them carry the message home,\" she says. Ultimately, a hospital dietitian may work on premises at Mercer Street Friends Preschool. The Mercer Street Friends partnership is just one of several initiatives the hospital has entered into with local service agencies in support of its mission to improve social determinants of healthcare. \"In the end, it's all about the people and reaching them in their homes, schools, churches and shelters,\" Grillo says. \"That's the work that our social impact teams have been doing for more than two years and will continue to do.\" TED TAYLOR GOOD NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDSRWJUH Hamilton and Mercer Street Friends Food Bank collaborated to provide backpacks filled with items for people in need. Healthy Together | 8 | Winter 2019 Hamilton_MercerStFriend_Winter19_REV1.indd 8 12/19/18 11:12 AMHealth needs have a way of happening at inconvenient times. You're on a business trip and forgot a prescription. It is after hours and your doctor's office is closed. Your family is on vacation and you have a sick child. Or you're simply too sick to get out of bed. For those situations and more, RWJBarnabas Health TeleMed now offers telemedicine\u2014medical care available through a smartphone, tablet or computer\u2014for urgent needs, or for people who feel they just don't have time to visit a doctor. \"At RWJBarnabas Health, we've been doing telemedicine for a long time in specific specialty services,\" says Amy Mansue, President, Southern Region, RWJBH. \"For example, when very fragile babies are sent home, telemedicine lets doctors and nurses see a baby in real time if parents have a concern.\" The rollout of the broader RWJBarnabas Health TeleMed program to the general public follows a successful pilot program with the system's 30,000 employees. \"We know that telemedicine is not a one- size-fits-all solution for every demographic,\" Mansue says. \"But we also know that people's lives are increasingly time-pressed, and that we're in a world of one-click expectations when it comes to service. \"Our job is to find ways to get people access to the services they need, at the right level of care, at the time they need it.\" HOW IT WORKS Once enrolled, patients can log in at any time of night or day for a videoconference with one of the on-call, U.S. board-certified physicians. There's a flat fee of $45, payable by credit card at the time of service. (Many private insurance plans cover telemedicine, and in New Jersey, state-funded health insurance plans are required to, as long as certain standards are met.) RWJBarnabas Health TeleMed is secure and compliant with HIPAA, a federal law that sets standards for, among other things, the privacy of health information. The doctor at the other end of the camera can assess symptoms, look at the area in question and make a judgment as to whether follow-up tests are needed. Though telemedicine is not meant to replace a patient's relationship with his or her primary care doctor, \"we do know that there are people who don't have access to primary care, or don't go routinely,\" Mansue says. \"This is a way to connect them with healthcare.\" Older patients may find telemedicine easier to adopt because long-distance healthcare has become common for chronic conditions, such as checking pacemakers or heart monitors over the phone. Younger patients, on the other hand, may actually prefer telemedicine to the in-person kind. \"One study showed that 70 percent of people under age 35 had accessed medical care through telemedicine,\" Mansue says. \"They do everything through their phones\u2014 create relationships, order pizza\u2014so it feels natural to do healthcare that way as well.\" Ultimately, the goal for RWJBarnabas Health TeleMed is for physicians to be able to access, with patient permission, a patient's entire medical record in order to help make better diagnoses. \"That's an aspirational goal right now, because electronic medical record systems don't communicate between themselves as well as they need to yet,\" Mansue says. \"But the technology improves every year.\" To enroll or learn more about RWJBarnabas Health TeleMed, powered by American Well, visit www.rwjbh.org/telemed, or download the app at the App Store or Google Play.

All the other kids would be having Slurpees and chocolate bars after the game, but my parents had oranges and granola bars ready for me,\" the 26-year-old New Jersey Devils left wing recalled during a post-practice interview at RWJBarnabas Health Hockey House in Newark. \"Eating well was instilled in me at an early age and it's something I take pride in, for sure.\" Those healthy habits\u2014along with hard work and amazing talent\u2014have paid off, for Hall's career as well as for his team. Last year, he scored a career-high 93 points and led the Devils to the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in five years. He also became the first-ever Devils player to win the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player. What's his secret for staying at peak fitness? It turns out that Hall's regimen, while serious, is also simple, with principles that can be followed by athletes at any level. EATING TO WIN Ask Hall to name a favorite food, and you won't hear anything about ice cream or cake. \"I tend to avoid sugar,\" he says. \"I'm lucky that I don't often have a craving for it. But with the calories we expend, it's very important for me to digest healthy carbohydrates and lots of protein. \"I keep my diet pretty simple. Protein, carbohydrates and then as much roughage as I can\u2014a side dish like asparagus or sweet potatoes, and always a salad with dinner. Gluten-free pasta, rice and quinoa\u2014those are really good for people like me who expend a lot of energy.\" Hall sticks to snacks that are low in carbohydrates and high in fat, like nuts, or high in protein, like Greek yogurt. \"That kind of snack is not going to give you a big burst of energy before bedtime, so it will allow you to rest properly,\" he says. Less nutritionally worthy foods are limited, but not eliminated. \"My cheat foods are cheeseburgers and pizza,\" Hall says. \"Maybe once a week you have yourself a night where you have those things. Certainly, you've got to live your life.\" Getting enough fluid takes on special urgency for professional athletes. \"Staying as well-hydrated as possible is huge. You don't want cramps during the game,\" Hall says.He starts each day with two 500-milliliter bottles of water as soon as he wakes up, to get his metabolism going. \"All day, I drink a ton of water, and during games, as many fluids with electrolytes as possible.\" BODY AND MIND During the 82-game season, players expend energy where it counts\u2014on the ice. After the season, Hall takes up to a month off from any physical activity, to give his body a rest. From then on, he works out and skates three times a day, five days a week. His advice for other athletes is to focus their workouts on what their weaknesses are. \"Some athletes might already have a very strong core, but need to work on their foot speed,\" he says. \"Overall, don't worry about what you're good at. Just try and correct stuff that might be hampering you a little bit.\" To prepare mentally, Hall uses meditation and relaxation techniques. \"When I have a calm brain and everything seems easy HELPING KIDS GET HEALTHIER, TOGETHER RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) and the New Jersey Devils have built a robust partnership focused on promoting health and good, clean hockey fun. RWJBH is the official healthcare provider for the Devils and their home base, the Prudential Center, where healthy snacks are available at all events. With the help of its specialty physicians and experts in nutrition and wellness, RWJBH collaborates with the Devils to benefit pro players, young athletes and children in need. Some examples: A rink affiliate program brings youth hockey clinics and wellness and nutrition education to players and coaches at ice hockey rinks statewide. The two organizations partner each year on the Running With the Devils 5K Run and Walk, with proceeds benefiting RWJBH hospitals. Devils players visit RWJBH hospitals to participate in special events for children. \"That's a huge part of being a hockey player,\" says Devils star Taylor Hall. \"We have a platform to give back, whether with a smile or simple encouragement. And not only is it great for the patients, it's also good for us.\" To learn more about the RWJBarnabas Health/New Jersey Devils partnership, visit www.rwjbh.org/devils.PHOTO CREDIT \u00a9 JERSEY DEVILS/ANDY MARLINto me, I seem to play my best,\" he says. A WORD TO YOUNG ATHLETES Perhaps surprisingly, Hall's advice to aspiring young hockey stars is not necessarily to work harder, but to take a step back. \"Some parents have their kids in hockey year-round,\" he says. \"You see these kids who are amazing hockey players, but they just don't seem to have a passion for it. I would say that you have to try out different things and have some free time. \"You have to really love whatever you do,\" he says. \"The thing that you have the most passion for in life is what you're going to be successful at.\"From top: practicing shots in the Little Devils zone; membership is free for ages 12 and under; healthy snack options for all Devils fans.

The 35-foot vehicle, decorated with bright fruits and vegetables, is the hub of the Wellness on Wheels mobile education initiative, which launched in the fall of 2018. Equipped with a hydroponic and earth-box greenhouse and a full kitchen, the van travels to places like preschools, senior homes and houses of worship in areas where affordable, healthy food is hard to come by. It's fun to see young kids marvel at what an herb's root looks like, run their fingers through soil, sort plastic fruits and vegetables or smile as they taste-test healthy recipes. Behind those hands-on activities is an overarching goal: to help communities get healthier. \"At RWJBarnabas Health, we embrace the concept of bringing health and wellness to communities by teaching people in places where they live, work, earn and learn,\" says Barbara Mintz, Senior Vice President, Healthy Living and Community Engagement. \"We want to make sure that people in underserved communities have a level playing field when it comes to being healthy.\" HELP FOR HUNGER More than 900,000 New Jersey residents face hunger every day, according to the Community Food Bank of New Jersey. Unemployment, low wages and high housing costs contribute to the problem. So does the prevalence of \"food deserts,\" areas where residents live more than one mile from a supermarket and, without a car, must depend on public transportation to get there. Too often, those residents resort to unhealthy packaged or fast foods. Wellness on Wheels aims to change those patterns and, to increase its impact, partners with local community groups. At a recent event at a New Brunswick preschool, hosted in conjunction with the Puerto Rican Action Board, a dietitian fluent in conversational Spanish showed children how to fill a plate with colorful food and demonstrated a simple, healthy recipe. Says Mintz, \"We partner with local food banks and farmers markets to distribute healthy foods at our events.\" Simple, culturally appropriate recipes are also provided to further support the mission of helping good health begin at home.

Healthy Together | 12 | Winter 2019 System_WellnessWheels_Winter19_REV2.indd 12 12/19/18 10:43 AM\"Improving with Age\" is the title of a presentation that Lina Shihabuddin, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Behavioral Health Network at RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH), likes to give. \"A lot of things do get better with age,\" says Dr. Shihabuddin, who is board- certified in adult and geriatric psychiatry as well as hospice and palliative medicine. \"Growing older should not be thought of as a bad thing, but as a transition to a different phase of life.\" That's a call not just to think positive, but also to think about aging and health in a new way. It's the approach healthcare practitioners like those in the RWJBH Behavioral Health Network are taking when they proactively screen for depression and anxiety in primary care settings. \"It's no longer 'I have a disease, so I need to see a doctor,'\" Dr. Shihabuddin explains. \"It's 'I need to be well.' Screening and early intervention helps patients of every age stay ahead of the game.\" ISSUES OF AGING Geriatric psychiatry, also known as geropsychiatry, refers to mental health care of a person 65 years or older. \"People seek out geriatric psychiatry for two reasons,\" Dr. Shihabuddin says. \"One, they may be dealing with very normal life adjustments that come with aging, which may include retirement, loss of a partner or distance from family. \"A second level of the issue is the start of memory problems, erratic behavior, possibly unsafe driving,\" Dr. Shihabuddin says. \"Is this the beginning of dementia, or a reversible medical problem? That's where the intersection of primary care, neurology and geriatric psychiatry really comes into play.\" Anxiety, depression and other issues can be triggered by a wide range of conditions, such as thyroid dysfunction, vascular problems, obesity or untreated diabetes. Once the problem is diagnosed, healthcare providers can come up with a treatment plan, which may include anything from treating a disease, to creating a safer environment at home, to finding ways to be sure the patient has activity during the day, to teaching family members how to minimize conflict. \"The last resort, for us, is to offer medications,\" such as antidepressants or sleep aids, Dr. Shihabuddin says. \"Medications have more side effects for geriatric patients, and take longer to get out of the system. In treating geriatric patients, you have to start at very low dosages and slowly increase the dose if needed.\" TAKING THE FIRST STEP Dr. Shihabuddin urges older adults (or their loved ones) to speak with their primary care provider as soon as signs of depression or anxiety appear. \"The earlier you detect and treat a disorder, the better off you are,\" she says. Getting older gets a bad rap, Dr. Shihabuddin believes. \"Yes, as the body ages, the neurons in the brain cells get less flexible, so it may be harder to learn new things,\" she says. \"On the other hand, the mind is more mature, giving older people the ability to look more analytically at situations and take them in stride. That's what we call wisdom. \"People think about aging and they tend to think about things falling apart,\" Dr. Shihabuddin says. \"If we do enough early detection and prevention, it does not have to be like that.\"GETTING OLDER, GETTING BETTER GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY CAN HELP ADULTS NAVIGATE ALL THE TRANSITIONS THAT COME WITH AGING.

Cardiologists put heart failure into one of four classes, starting with symptoms. Here is the New York Heart Association Classification: CLASS I: Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue or shortness of breath CLASS II: Comfortable at rest, excessive physical activity results in fatigue and shortness of breath CLASS III: Symptoms with non- excessive physical activity CLASS IV: Symptoms at rest The cardiologist will then do an objective assessment of the degree of heart failure based on observations as well as tests such as a blood test, X-ray, electrocardiogram, stress test and echocardiogram. Healthy Together | 14 | Winter 2019 System_Heart_Winter19_final.indd 14 12/18/18 12:01 PMThe term \"heart failure\" means that this vital organ is damaged in some way. Despite the dire- sounding nature of the term, however, a diagnosis of heart failure is far from a death sentence. \"Care for heart failure patients has improved so dramatically that, although this is a chronic problem, patients who have it can live long and productive lives,\" says Gary Rogal, MD, Chief of Cardiology for RWJBarnabas Health and a member of Barnabas Health Medical Group. The key to this positive outcome is simple\u2014but not necessarily easy. The heart failure patient must take medicine as directed and make the recommended lifestyle changes. \"The patient who listens to the things their doctor recommends they do will do better in the long term,\" Dr. Rogal says. \"I always tell my patients, '50 percent of your outcome is based on what I do, and 50 percent is based on what you do.'\" UNDERSTANDING THE TERMS About 5.7 million U.S. adults have heart failure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"'Heart failure' is a generic, umbrella term that covers many different disease entities,\" Dr. Rogal says. \"In the simplest terms, the heart is a pump, and it is failing as a pump.\" The failure can fall into two different categories that often exist together: left- sided and right- sided dysfunction. (See sidebar at right.) \"People sometimes get confused when they hear 'heart failure,' and ask, 'Am I going to have a heart attack?'\" Dr. Rogal says. \"The reality is that they're two different types of pathologies.\" Heart failure does not lead to a heart attack, he explains. Also, heart failure develops gradually, but a heart attack happens suddenly, when blood flow to an artery leading to the heart is blocked. In either case, patients will receive similar advice for a heart-healthy lifestyle. GETTING TO GOOD HABITS Those recommendations likely come as no surprise: Take medication as directed. Exercise. Eat a healthy, low-salt diet. Stop smoking. Get enough sleep. Manage stress. Still, many patients don't follow doctors' orders, Dr. Rogal says. \"People's lives are so busy, and this tends to be a problem that's not an immediate issue staring them in the face,\" he says. \"They think they can pay attention to it tomorrow.\" At the first sign of weakening or abnormality of the heart muscle, \"I tell patients they need to start medications to help their heart muscle and begin to exercise,\" Dr. Rogal says. \"Walking is the easiest way to begin. And over the years, the pharmacology for heart failure has dramatically improved, so that we have a broad spectrum of medicines we can use.\" Dr. Rogal also recommends that patients with heart failure stop drinking. \"Alcohol is a direct toxin to the heart muscle,\" he says. \"It can also lead to other issues, such as excessive sodium intake and dietary indiscretion. In my view, once you've started to develop any sign of heart muscle impairment, it's time to hang up the alcohol.\" The same caution does not hold true for sexual activity. \"In most cases, patients YOUR HEART DOESN'T BEAT JUST FOR YOU.

GARY ROGAL, MD TWO SIDES OF HEART FAILURE WITH LEFT-SIDED HEART FAILURE, the muscle in the left side of the heart weakens so that the heart can't pump enough blood properly (systolic dysfunction), or stiffens (diastolic dysfunction) so that the pressure in the heart goes up. Either case can result in fluid in the lungs and reduced heart output, resulting in marked reduction in exercise capacity, breathing difficulty and fatigue. IN RIGHT-SIDED, OR RIGHT VENTRICULAR (RV) HEART FAILURE, the right side of the heart loses pumping power, leading to a backup of blood in the veins that results in swelling and congestion. can remain sexually active,\" Dr. Rogal says. \"But be sure to discuss this with your doctor to ensure there are no limitations.\" Heart failure patients will find that the benefits of a heart-healthy lifestyle far outweigh the effort required to create new habits. Says Dr. Rogal, \"You can live a very productive and positive life with heart failure\u2014as long as you follow the guidelines shared by your doctor.\" Healthy Together | 14 | Winter 2019 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG 15 System_Heart_Winter19_REV1.indd 15 12/19/18 11:16 AMWhen Katherine Bentley, MD, Director of the Pain Program at Children's Specialized Hospital, first met Harley Bourgeois, the 20-year-old had been confined to a wheelchair for more than a year. Harley had traveled with her mother from their North Carolina home to New Brunswick so that the young woman could be evaluated for the hospital's Chronic Pain Management Program. It had been six years since Harley had been diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a chronic condition that is thought to be caused by an injury to the nervous system, and that grows more excruciating over time. \"It was a long way to come just to be evaluated, but we had to meet her, and she had to know what she would be getting into if she came back for the program,\" Dr. Bentley says. \"It's a huge commitment. But she was ready for it.\" UNEXPLAINED ACHES Harley's problem started when, as a healthy middle-schooler, she had an X-ray for a minor injury that caught a suspicious abnormality on her right femur. An oncologist removed the lump, and all seemed well\u2014but the aching in Harley's right leg never went away. One day, the horse she was riding bucked, shooting her into the air. She landed on the same aching femur. For many months thereafter, she and her parents traveled from doctor to doctor as the pain escalated. By the time Harley got to Children's Specialized Hospital, the slightest touch\u2014even a breeze\u2014 sent pain shooting through her body. \"CRPS is a hard diagnosis because it's a diagnosis of exclusion. You rule out everything else, test by test,\" Dr. Bentley says. \"While we don't know everything about why a youngster might be experiencing this chronic pain, we know that intensive therapies and multidisciplinary treatment plans can help them.\" Harley worked with a dedicated team of physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, child life specialists and physician/advanced practice nurses. The Chronic Pain Management Program is not for the faint of heart. \"Harley was weaned off her pain meds, and had hours of therapy every day, six days a week,\" Dr. Bentley says. The goal of therapy is to re- train the brain to decrease sensitivity to pain. Patients can take advantage of aqua therapy in the hospital's pool, as well as cutting-edge technology like the ZeroG, a dynamic support harness that helps people walk without using their full body weight. The program also emphasizes mental preparation for reentering the normal life that so many have lost. A typical day would include meditation, individual and group psychology sessions, peer mentoring and evening recreation. Over the course of eight demanding weeks, Harley made progress: mastering the parallel bars, walking up a stair, walking with a walker and the ZeroG harness. Finally, one day when her mother visited, Harley surprised her by walking to her without assistance, and giving her a big hug. That was in March 2018. Harley is now a student at North Carolina State University, fulfilling her dream of studying livestock and poultry management. She still makes time to visit her friends and former therapists at Children's Specialized. \"The takeaway of this story is, 'never give up hope,'\" Dr. Bentley says. \"Harley had been in such pain and dysfunction for a long time, but she kept looking for a way to get better. And thanks to her perseverance and commitment, she did.\"To learn more about the Chronic Pain Management Program and other services at Children's Specialized Hospital, visit www.childrens-specialized.org.KATHERINE BENTLEY, MD HOW A BRAVE YOUNG WOMAN GOT HER LIFE BACK, WITH THE HELP OF CHILDREN'S SPECIALIZED HOSPITALHarley (third from right) came back to Children's Specialized Hospital for a visit with friends and fellow alumni of the Chronic Pain Management Program.

A. Patients are referred to a gynecologic oncologist when they're diagnosed with an invasive cancer in the gynecological tract: the uterus, cervix, vagina and ovaries. Their gynecologist, gastroenterologist, primary doctor, internist or even an emergency physician must recommend that they consult with a gynecologic oncologist. What can a gynecologic oncologist do for a patient? A. We specialize in surgeries for people with gynecologic cancers. Studies show that survival rate improves when gynecologic cancer surgery is performed by a gynecologic oncologist. Where do you treat patients at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton? A. I see patients in the Cancer Center, next to medical oncology and radiation oncology. If a patient needs radiation therapy or chemotherapy, I refer them to those doctors. I'm kind of like the door to patient care for gynecologic cancer. What makes the partnership between Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and RWJUH Hamilton unique? A. The Cancer Center provides patients access to clinical trials\u2014the newest state-of-the-art treatments\u2014close to where they live and work. The patients used to come to New Brunswick to see me. Now, I go to Hamilton to see them.LORNA RODRIGUEZ, MDHAMILTON: THE NEXT GENERATION What began nearly 20 years ago as an informal get-together of under-40 up-and-comers swiftly organized and became one of the most vital adjuncts to the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton Foundation. Known as the Young Professionals Group (YPG), the group's early mission was to provide young people interested in helping the hospital network professionally and gain board experience. As the group formalized, its primary mission evolved to help raise much-needed funds for the hospital's capital projects. When RWJUH Hamilton opened a new Pediatric Emergency Department in 2011, the Young Professionals Group pledged to help support the initiative. In 2016, the group wrapped up a five-year fundraising effort that resulted in a $200,000 contribution; but it's by no means the end of their support of the hospital. \"This year we committed to raise $150,000 in 2019 and 2020 for our Cancer Center,\" says Brian Hartmann, a financial advisor who lives in Hamilton and serves as the group's current chairman. To support their initiative, members host their signature event, All in Good Taste, in the spring, where they honor a Young Professional of the Year. They hold additional fundraisers throughout the year. The membership of approximately 25 people changes regularly as members age out of the group and have the opportunity to be voted onto the Board of Trustees. There's never a shortage of young professionals eager to join, because the group makes contributing to their communities fun, says Rachel Holland, a Hamilton Square event planner and longtime member. \"We're raising money, helping the hospital and helping the community,\" she says.THE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS GROUP SUPPORTS THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION WITH AN EYE TO THE FUTURE. RWJUH Hamilton's Young Professionals Group presented a donation to the hospital following October's Paint the Bar Pink event. We're caring for the community together.

Patients can view the garden through the center's bay windows while receiving chemotherapy or infusion therapy. \"Chemotherapy treatments usually last four to five hours, so we wanted to give patients something beautiful to look at while they sat through treatment,\" German says. Also new: an image salon, where women coping with cancer-related hair loss and appearance concerns can try on wigs and other accessories and get makeup tips from professionals to help them look and feel more confident. MORE ON THE WAY \"We're focusing on treating the whole patient\u2014physically, spiritually, socially and emotionally,\" German says. A range of on-staff specialists\u2014from oncologists, oncology nurses and radiation therapists to pharmacists, research nurses, social workers and supportive staff\u2014guide patients through the continuum of care. Nurse navigators help patients through the ins and outs of treatment. A new holistic services program offers everything from art, aroma and pet therapies to meditation, spiritual enrichment, kinetic massage and reiki (a healing technique aimed at channeling the body's energy through touch).

The RWJUH Hamilton Cancer Center's partnership with RCINJ further expands patients' access to new treatments and precision medicine, and offers patients with cancer the opportunity to participate in studies of investigational treatments that may help them and future patients. The National Cancer Institute recognizes RCINJ as a leader in cancer treatment innovation and research with its elite Comprehensive Cancer Center designation\u2014one of only 70 in the U.S. \"Being able to extend the knowledge and technology at RCINJ throughout the RWJBarnabas Health System is incredible,\" says Andrew M. Evens, DO, Director of the Lymphoma Program and Associate Director for Clinical Services at RCINJ. \"Whether a patient is in South Jersey, Central Jersey or North Jersey, he or she has access not only to that innovation and cutting-edge therapy, but also to leading disease experts for any specific cancer.\" Let's beat cancer together\u2014 close to home\u2014at RWJUH Hamilton.

PRECISION IMAGING The Center now boasts an expanded, state-of-the-art radiotherapy department, the centerpiece of which is the TrueBeam radiotherapy system. TrueBeam delivers targeted high-dose radiation beams to patients with lung, breast, prostate, head, neck and other cancers. The system allows oncologists to account for even minute changes in a patient's breathing and physical position, German says, so that the tumor is more accurately imaged and radiation beams are more precisely targeted. \"Because radiation therapy is administered every day over several weeks, it's important that we hit the tumor's exact location with the correct dose of radiation every day, every time,\" German says. \"TrueBeam allows us to do this.\" The expanded Center's imaging lab now houses its positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET- CT) imaging system\u2014which, German notes, was located in a trailer before the expansion. The PET-CT essentially combines two imaging technologies to produce a sequence of super-detailed images. While numerous cancer centers use PET-CT imaging to confirm diagnosis, German says, RWJUH Hamilton also uses it to stage cancers and plan treatment, improving accuracy and eliminating the need for repeat testing. A CALMING VIEW While the expanded Cancer Center leads the way in technology and treatment, German says, it is also prepared to guide patients through cancer's harsh emotional toll.
