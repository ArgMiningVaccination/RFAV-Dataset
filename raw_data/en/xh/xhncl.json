Imagine inviting greater meaning, guidance, and growth into your own life. Imagine the ripple effect in our meetings and communities as we live our faith in the world. The Spiritual Deepening Program gives Friends and newcomers opportunities to rediscover Quaker faith and thought, connect with Spirit, and build relationships with each other through sharing and deep listening. Through exercises, discussions, introspection, and creativity, participants share their spiritual stories, explore how Quaker thought and spiritual practices can transform lives, and go deeper together into the life of the Spirit. There are two ways to go deeper with Spiritual Deepening: [The Spiritual Deepening Library](https://www.fgcquaker.org/spiritual-deepening-library/) The Spiritual Deepening Library is a collection of experiential activities and resources. The program grew as a response to a deep hunger among Friends for spiritual relationships, improved sense of faith community, and a better understanding of the roots of our Quaker faith and spiritual practices. Program materials are designed for participants of all ages and stages in their spiritual journey. Participants engage in activities, discussions, role-plays, spiritual practices, art and music exercises, and worship sharing. Inviting newcomers to join a Spiritual Deepening small group can serve as outreach and offer a way to integrate newcomers into the life of the meeting. [Spiritual Deepening eRetreats & Online Offerings](https://www.fgcquaker.org/fgcprograms/spiritual-deepening-program/spiritual-deepening-eretreats-and-online-offerings/) Join a Spiritual Deepening eRetreat, together or as individuals, to build spiritual community and explore Quaker practices and faith over a 4-week online session led by a seasoned facilitator. eRetreats are offered on topics such as Silence & Light, Living into Wholeness, Becoming Patterns & Examples, and Understanding and Healing White Supremacy.
