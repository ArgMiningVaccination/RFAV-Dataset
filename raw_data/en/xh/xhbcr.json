These decisions are based on the medical information provided by the patient and the patient's physician . The patient and his or her physician determine the course of treatment. The assistance provided through these services does not constitute the practice of medicine. Payment of Plan benefits is not determined through these processes. The Plan Manager does not reward doctors and other individua ls for denying coverage or withholding services. Financial incentives are never offered. In fact, utilization management actually helps the Plan Manager make sure you get the preventive care and medically necessary services you need. You may request a review of the medical necessity and appropriateness of hospital resources and medical services given or proposed to be given to you for purposes of determining the ava ilability of payment, referred to as a utilization review. Additionally, you may request an internal appeal of the coverage decision within sixty (60) days of receiving notice of the decision if the decision involves a denial, reduction or termination of a benefit or the denial of payment for a service . Just call Customer Service at the number on your identification card to find out how. Finally, you may also request an external review to be conducted by a certified independent review entity at the cost of the Plan if you have completed the internal appeal process and meet other conditions. PRECERTIFICATION Utilization review includes precertification and concurrent review . This provision will not provide benefits to cover a confinement or service which is not medically necessary or otherwise would not be covered under the Plan . Precertification is not a guarantee of coverage. If you or your covered dependent are to receive a service which requires precertification , your qualified practitioner must contact the Plan Manager by telephone or in writing. Re fer to the Schedule of Benefits for time requirements. After your qualified practitioner has provided the Plan Manager with your diagnosis and treatment plan, the Plan Manager will: 1 Advise you in writing if the proposed treatment plan is medically necessary ; 2. Advise you in writing the number of days the confinement is initially precertified ; and 3. Conduct concurrent review as necessary. If your qualified practitioner extends your confinement beyond the number of days initially precertified , the extension must be precertified through concurrent review . If it is determined at any time your proposed treatment plan, either partially or totally, is not a covered expense under the terms and provisions of the Plan , benefits for services may be reduced or services may not be covered. 20 Utilization/Case Management Continued PENALTY FOR NOT OBTAINING PRECERTIFICATION If your qualified practitioner does not obtain precertification for services being rendered, your benefits for hospital or qualified treatment facility may be reduced. Refer to the Schedule of Benefits for the applicable penalty. SECOND SURGICAL OPINION When a covered person obtains a second opinion evaluation, such evaluation must be obtained within the procedures specified in the Plan delivery system rules described in the covered person's certificate in order for coverage to apply.

If you choose to terminate coverage during the Leave, or if coverage terminates as a result of nonpayment of any required contribution, coverage may be reinstated on the date you return to active status immediately following the end of the Leave. Charges incurred after th e date of reinstatement will be paid as if you had been continuously covered.

The date you receive benefits equal to any maximum benefit shown on the Schedule of Benefits; or 4. The end of twelve consecutive mont hs immediately following the date of your termination of coverage. This period of tim e is measured from the date your coverage is terminated under the Plan , to the same calendar day of the next succeeding months. The Extended Benefits provision applies only to covered expenses for the disabling condition which existed on the date your coverage terminated. The Plan must remain in effect. RETIREE COVERAGE If you are a retiree who is under age 65 or is age 65 or older and non- Medicare eligible, you may enroll or continue coverage under the Plan for you and any of your eligible dependents . Please see your retirement system for more details.

When a surviving dependent spouse is covered under KTRS, dependents acquired through remarriage are not eligible. When a surviving dependent spouse is covered under KRS, dependents acquired through remarriage may be added by timely enrollment. Please see your retirement system for more details. SPECIAL ENROLLMENT If you previously declined coverage under this Plan for yourself or any eligible dependents , due to the existence of other health coverage (including COBRA), and that coverage is now lost, this Plan permits you, your dependent spouse , and any eligible dependents to be enrolled for medical benefits under this Plan due to any of the following qualifying events : 1. Loss of coverage due to any of the following: a. Legal separation or annulment; b. Divorce; c. Cessation of dependent status (such as attaining the limiting age); d. Death; e.

However, loss of coverage does not include a loss due to failure of the individual or the participant to pay premiums on a timely basis or terminati on of coverage for cause (such as making a fraudulent claim or an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact in connection with the plan). 2. Employer contributions towards the other c overage have been terminated. Employer contributions include contributions by any current or former employer (of the individual or another person) that was contributi ng to coverage for the individual. 3. COBRA coverage under the other pl an has since been exhausted. 56 Eligibility and Effective Date of Coverage Continued If you are a covered employee or an otherwise eligible employee , who either did not enroll or did not enroll dependents when eligible, you now have the opportunity to enroll yourself and/or any previously eligible dependents or any newly acquired dependents when due to any of the following family status changes: 1. Marriage; 2. Birth; or 3. Adoption or placement for adoption. You may elect coverage under this Plan provide d enrollment is within 30 days from the qualifying event or as listed in the Dependent Effec tive Date of Coverage section. You may be required to provide proof that the qualifying event has occurred due to one of the reasons lis ted before coverage under this Plan will be effective. Coverage under th is Plan will be effective the 1 st day of the month following the signature date of the enrollment form, unless otherwise specified in this section. In the case of a dependent's birth, enrollment is effective on the date of such birth provided the appropriate paperwork is received. In the case of a dependent's adoption or placement for adoption, enro llment is effective on the date of such adoption or placement for adoption, provi ded the appropriate paperwork is received. If you become eligible for coverage under this Plan th rough the special enrollment provision, benefits under the Plan will be subject to the pre-existing condition limitation as defined within the Definitions section of this booklet. If you apply more than 30 days after a qualifying event or as listed in the Dependent Effective Date of Coverage section, you are considered a late applicant and will not be eligible for coverage under this Plan until the next annual open enrollment period. Please refer to Exhibit A at the end of this document or see your employer for more details. COVERAGE TERMINATION DUE TO PLAN CHANGE If an employee or dependent changes Insurance Carriers during Open Enrollment, the existing coverage with the prior Insurance Carrier will termin ate on December 31, except for the following: 1. If a covered member is hospitalized when cove rage would normally terminate, the prior Insurance Carrier that covered the member's hospitalization during the previous plan year would continue coverage until the member is released from the hospital or transferred to another facility. At the time the member is released from the hospital or transferred to a new facility, the succeeding Insurance Carrier will assume responsibility for that member . It is the member's responsibility to ensure that a transfer or re-hospitalization is to a participating facility in compliance with all Plan delivery rules. 57 Eligibility and Effective Date of Coverage Continued 2. If a member has family covera ge and a covered dependent is hospitalized when coverage would normally terminate due to a change in Insurance Carriers, the hospitalized family member would continue his/her prior coverage until discharge from the hospital or transfer to another facility. All other covered dependents not hospitalized at the date the new coverage begins would be transferred to the new Plan on the date the new co verage starts (not on the date the hospitalized dependent is released or transferred. 3. If a covered member is not at work and/or is on unofficial leave without pay or otherwise continuing to pay for his/her own health in surance premiums on the group coverage, that participant will begin coverage with his/her su cceeding Insurance Carrier on January 1, even though he/she is not at work. These provisions take precedence over all Extension of Benefits clauses and Actively at Work clauses contained in any of the Insurance Carrier's sta ndard commercial contracts in compliance with KRS 304.18-126 and KRS 304.18-127. Entitlement to Medicare : if an employee, spouse, or dependant who is enrolled in the Plan becomes entitled to coverage (i.e., becomes enrolled) under Part A or Part B of Medicare, other than coverage consisting solely of benefits unde r section 1928 of Social Security Act, the employee may make a prospective election change to cancel coverage of that employee, spouse, or dependent, under the Plan. In addition, if an employee, spouse or dependent who has been entitled to coverage under Medicare loses eligibility for such coverage, the employee may make a prospective election to commence coverage of that employee, spouse, or dependent under the Plan. Coverage may be elected under this Plan provided en rollment is within 30 days from the entitlement of Medicare. 58 TERMINATION OF COVERAGE Coverage terminates on the earliest of the following: 1. The date the Plan terminates; 2. The end of the period for which any re quired contribution was due and not paid; 3. The date you enter full-time military, naval or air servi ce, except coverage may continue during an approved military leave of absence as indicated in the Special Provisions For Not Being in Active Status provision; 4. The end of the month in which you fail to be in an eligible class of persons according to the eligibility requirements of the employer ; 5. For all employees , coverage will terminate on the last day of the second month following the date in which your employment terminates; 6. For any benefit, the date the benefit is removed from the Plan; 7. For your dependents , the date your coverage terminates; 8. For a dependent , the date the dependent enters full-time military, naval or air service; 9. For a dependent , the end of the calendar month such covered person no longer meets the definition of dependent ; or 10. The date you request termination of coverage to be effective for yourself and/or your dependents based on valid qualif ying event guidelines. IF YOU OR ANY OF YOUR COVERED DEPENDENTS NO LONGER MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS, YOU AND YOUR EMPLOYER ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTIFYING THE PLAN MANAGER OF THE CHANGE IN STATUS. COVERAGE WILL NOT CONTINUE BEYOND THE END OF THE MONTH IN WHICH ELIGIBILITY ENDS EVEN IF NOTICE HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN TO THE PLAN MANAGER . TERMINATION OF HRA Coverage for a Participant and/or Eligible Dependent ends on the sa me date that coverage under the Commonwealth Select Plan ends. However, you, your covered spouse , and/or your covered child(ren) may be eligible to continue covera ge under this HRA in accordance with federal law beyond the date that coverage would otherwise end if coverage is lost for certain reasons. Your continuation of coverage rights and responsibilities are described in th e below Continuation of Coverage se ction. All HRA dollars that are not applied towards Eligible Medical Expenses incurred before your termination date of this SPD are forfeited . 59 IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR EMPLOY EES AND SPOUSES AGE 65 AND OVER Federal law may affect your coverage under this Plan. The Medicare as Secondary Payer rules were enacted by an amendment to the Social Security Act. Also, additional rules which specifically affect how a large group health plan provides coverage to employees (or their spouses ) over age 65 were added to the Social Security Act and to the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, the health care plan of an employer that has at least 20 employees must operate in compliance with these rules in providing plan coverage to plan participants who have \"current employment status\" and are Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 and over. Persons who have \"current employment status\" w ith an employer are generally employees who are actively working and also persons who are NOT actively working as follows: Individuals receiving disability benefits fro m an employer for up to 6 months, or Individuals who retain employment rights and have not been terminated by the employer and for whom the employer continues to provide coverage under this Plan. (For example, employees who are on an approved leave of absence.) If you are a person having \"current employment status\" who is age 65 and over (or the dependent spouse age 65 and over of an employee of any age), your coverage under this Plan will be provided on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to employees (or dependent spouses ) who are under the age of 65. Your rights under this Plan do not change because you (or your dependent spouse ) are eligible for Medicare coverage on the basis of age, as long as you have \"current employment status\" with your employer . You have the option to reject plan coverage offered by your employer , as does any eligible employee . If you reject coverage under your employer's Plan, coverage is terminated and your employer is not permitted to offer you coverage that supplements Medicare covered services . If you (or your dependent spouse ) obtain Medicare coverage on the basis of age, and not due to disability or end-stage renal disease, this Plan will consider its coverage to be primary to Medicare when you have elected coverage under this Plan and have \"current employment status\". If you have any questions about how cove rage under this Plan relates to Medicare coverage, please contact your Medicare office. 60 CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS THE CONSOLIDATED OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1986 (COBRA) CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS On April 7, 1986, the Consolidated Omnibus Budge t Reconciliation Act (COBRA) was signed into law. This federal law applies to employers with 20 or more employees. The law requires that employers offer employees and/or their dependents continuation of medical coverage at group rates in certain instances where there is a loss of group insurance coverage. ELIGIBILITY A qualified beneficiary under COBRA law means an employee , employee's spouse or dependent child covered by the Plan on the day before a qualifying event . A qualified beneficiary under COBRA law also includes a child born to the employee during the coverage period or a child placed for adoption with the employee during the coverage period. EMPLOYEE: An employee covered by the employer's Plan has the right to elect continuation coverage if coverage is lost due to one of the following qualifying events : Termination (for reasons other than gross misconduct) of the employee's employment or reduction in the hours of employee's employment; or Termination of retiree coverage when the former employer discontinues retiree coverage within one year before or one year after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. SPOUSE: A spouse covered by the employer's Plan has the right to elect continuation coverage if the group coverage is lost due to one of the following qualifying events : The death of the employee ; Termination of the employee's employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct) or reduction of the employee's hours of employment with the employer ; Divorce or legal separation from the employee ; The employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits; or Termination of a retiree spouse's coverage when the former employer discontinues retiree coverage within one year before or one year after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. DEPENDENT CHILD: A dependent child covered by the employer's Plan has the right to continuation coverage if group coverage is lo st due to one of the following qualifying events : The death of the employee- parent; The termination of the employee- parent's employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct) or reduction in the employee -parent's hours of employment with the employer ; The employee- parent's divorce or legal separation; Ceasing to be a \" dependent child\" under the Plan; The employee -parent becomes entitled to Medicare benefits; or Termination of the retiree -parent's coverage when the former employer discontinues retiree coverage within one year before or one year after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 61 COBRA Continued LOSS OF COVERAGE Coverage is lost in connection with the foregoing qualified events, when a covered employee , spouse or dependent child ceases to be covered under the same Plan terms and conditions as in effect immediately before the qualifying event (such as an increase in the premium or contribution that must be paid for employee , spouse or dependent child coverage). If coverage is reduced or eliminated in anticipation of an event (for example, an employer eliminating an employee's coverage in anticipation of the termination of the employee's employment, or an employee eliminating the coverage of the employee's spouse in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation), the reduction or elimination is disregarded in determ ining whether the event causes a loss of coverage. A loss of coverage need not occur immediately after th e event, so long as it occurs before the end of the Maximum Coverage Period. NOTICES AND ELECTION The Plan provides that coverage terminates, for a spouse due to legal separation or divorce or for a child when that child loses dependent status. Under the law, the employee or qualified beneficiary has the responsibility to inform the Plan Administrator (see Plan Description Information) if one of the above events has occurred. The qualified beneficiary must give this notice within 60 days after the event occurs. (For example, an ex- spouse should make sure that the Plan Administrator is notified of his or her divorce, whether or not his or her coverage wa s reduced or eliminated in anticipa tion of the event). When the Plan Administrator is notified that one of these events has happened, it is the Plan Administrator's responsibility to notify the Plan Manager who has contracted with a COBRA Service Provider who will in turn notify the qualified beneficiary of the right to elect continuation coverage. For a qualified beneficiary who is determined under the Social Security Act to be disabled at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage, the continuation coverage pe riod may be extended 11 additional months. The disability that extends the 18-month coverage period mu st be determined under Title II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insuran ce) or Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act. To be entitled to th e extended coverage period, the disabled qualified beneficiary must provide notice to the COBRA Service Provider within the initial 18 month coverage period and within 60 days after the date of the determination of disability under the Social Security Act. Failure to provide this notice will result in the loss of th e right to extend the COBRA continuation period. For termination of employment, reduction in work hours, the death of the employee , the employee becoming covered by Medicare or loss of retiree benefits due to bankruptcy, it is the Plan Administrator's responsibility to notify the Plan Manager who has contracted with a COBRA Service Provider who will in turn notify the qualified beneficiary of the right to elect continuation coverage. Under the law, continuation coverage mu st be elected within 60 days after Plan coverage ends, or if later, 60 days after the date of the notice of the right to el ect continuation coverage. If continuation coverage is not elected within the 60 day period, the right to elect coverage under the Plan will end. A covered employee or the spouse of the covered employee may elect continuation coverage for all covered dependents , even if the covered employee or spouse of the covered employee or all covered dependents are covered under another group health plan ( as an employee or otherwise) prior to the election. The covered employee , his or her spouse and dependent child, however, each have an independent right to elect con tinuation coverage. Thus a spouse or dependent child may elect continuation coverage even if the covered employee does not elect it. 62 COBRA Continued Coverage will not be provided during the election pe riod. However, if the individual makes a timely election, coverage will be provide d from the date that coverage w ould otherwise have been lost. If coverage is waived before the end of the 60 day el ection period and the waiver revoked before the end of the 60 day election period, coverage wi ll be effective on the date the el ection of coverage is sent to the COBRA Service Provider . On August 6, 2002, The Trade Act of 2002 (TAA) was signed in to law. Workers whose employment is adversely affected by international trade (increased import or shift in production to another country) may become eligible to receive TAA. TAA provides a second 60-day COBRA election period for those who become eligible for assistance under TAA. Pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974, an individual who is either an eligible TAA recipient or an eligible alternative TAA recipient and who did not elect continuation coverage during the 60-day COBRA el ection period that was a direct consequence of the TAA-related loss of coverage, may elect continua tion coverage during a 60-day period that begins on the first day of the month in which he or she is determined to be T AA-eligible individual, provided such election is made not later than 6 months after the date of the TAA-re lated loss of coverage. Any continuation coverage elected during the second election period will begin with the first day of the second election period and not on the date on which coverage originally lapsed. TAA created a new tax credit for certain individuals w ho became eligible for trade adjustment assistance (eligible individuals). Under the new tax provisions, elig ible individuals can either take a tax credit or get advance payment of 65% of premiums paid for qualified health insurance, including continuation coverage. If you have questions about these new tax provisions, you may call the Health Care Tax Credit Customer Contact Center toll-free at 1-866-6 28-4282. TTD/TTY callers may call toll-free at 1-866-626-4282. The Plan Administrator shall require documentation ev idencing eligibility of TAA benefits. The Plan need not require every available document to esta blish evidence of TAA. The burden for evidencing TAA eligibility is that of the individual applying for coverage under the Plan. MAXIMUM COVERAGE PERIOD Coverage may continue up to: 18 months for an employee and/or dependent whose group coverage ended due to termination of the employee's employment or reduction in hours of employment; 36 months for a spouse whose coverage ended due to the death of the employee or retiree , divorce, or the employee becoming entitled to Medicare at the time of the initial qualifying event ; 36 months for a dependent child whose coverage ended due to the divorce of the employee parent, the employee becoming entitled to Medicare at the time of the initial qualifying event , the death of the employee , or the child ceasing to be a dependent under the Plan; For the retiree , until the date of death of the retiree who is on continuation due to loss of coverage within one year before or one year after the employer filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 63 COBRA Continued DISABILITY An 11-month extension of coverage may be available if any of the qua lified beneficiaries are determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to be di sabled. The disability has to have started at some time before the 60 th day of COBRA continuation coverage and mu st last at least until the end of the 18- month period of continuation coverage. The qualified beneficiary must provide notice of such determination prior to the end of the initial 18-mont h continuation period to be entitled to the additional 11 months of covera ge. Each qualified beneficiary who has elected continuatio n coverage will be entitled to the 11-month disability extension if one of them qualifies. If a qualified beneficiary is determined by SSA to no longer be disabled, you must notify the Plan of that fact within 30 days after SSA's determination. SECOND QUALIFYING EVENT An 18-month extension of coverage will be available to spouses and dependent children who elect continuation coverage if a second qualifying event occurs during the first 18 months of continuation coverage. The maximum amount of conti nuation coverage available when a second qualifying event occurs is 36 months. Such second qualifying event may include the death of a covered employee , divorce or separation from the covered employee , the covered employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), or a dependent child's ceasing to be eligible for coverage as a dependent under the Plan. These events can be a second qualifying event only if they would have caused the qualified beneficiary to lose coverage under the Plan if the first qualifying event had not occurred. You must notify the Plan within 60 days after the second qualifying event occurs if you want to extend your continuation coverage. TERMINATION BEFORE THE END OF MAXIMUM COVERAGE PERIOD Continuation coverage will terminate before the e nd of the maximum coverage period for any of the following reasons: The employer no longer provides group health coverage to any of its employees ; The premium for continuation is not paid timely; The individual on continuation becomes covere d under another group health plan (as an employee or otherwise); however, if the new plan coverage cont ains any exclusion or limitation with respect to any pre-existing condition , then continuation coverage will end for this reason only after the exclusion or limitation no longer applies or prior creditable coverage satisfies the exclusion or limitation; NOTE: the federal Health Insurance Portab ility and Accountability Act of 1996 requires portability of health care coverage effective for plan years beginning after June 30, 1997, an exclusion or limitation under the other group hea lth plan may not apply at all to the qualified beneficiary , depending on the length of his or her prior creditable coverage . Portability means once you obtain health insurance, you will be able to use evidence of that insurance to reduce or eliminate any pre-existing medical condition limitation period (under certain circumstances) when you move from one health plan to another. 64 COBRA Continued The individual on continuation becomes entitled to Medicare benefits; If there is a final determination under Title II or XVI of the Social Security Act that an individual is no longer disabled; however, conti nuation coverage will not end until the month that begins more than 30 days after the determination; The occurrence of any event (e.g. submission of a fraudulent claim ) permitting termination of coverage for cause under the Plan. TYPE OF COVERAGE; PREMIUM PAYMENT If continuation coverage is elected, the coverage must be identical to the coverage provided under the employer's Plan to similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiar ies. This means that if the coverage for similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries is modifi ed, coverage for the individual on continuation will be modified. The initial premium payment for continuation coverage is due by the 45th day after coverage is elected. The initial premium includes charges back to the date the continuation coverage began. All other premiums are due on the first of the month for which the premium is paid, subject to a 31 day grace period. The COBRA Service Provider must provide the individual with a quote of the total monthly premium . Premium for continuation coverage ma y be increased, however, the premium may not be increased more than once in any determination period. The dete rmination period is a 12 month period which is established by the Plan. The monthly premium payment to the Plan for continuing cove rage must be submitted directly to the COBRA Service Provider . This monthly premium may include the employee's share and any portion previously paid by the employer . The monthly premium must be a reasonable estimate of the cost of providing coverage under the Plan for similarl y situated non-COBRA beneficiaries. The premium for COBRA continuation coverage may include a 2% administration charge. However, for qualified beneficiaries who are receiving up to 11 months add itional coverage (beyond the first 18 months) due to disability extension (and not a second qualifying event ), the premium for COBRA continuation coverage may be up to 150% of the applicable premium for the additional months. Qualified beneficiaries who do not take the additional 11 months of speci al coverage will pay up to 102% of the premium cost. OTHER INFORMATION Additional information regarding rights and obliga tions under the Plan and under federal law may be obtained by contacting the COBRA Service Provider or the Plan Manager . It is important for the covered person or qualified beneficiary to keep the Plan Administrator, COBRA Service Provider and Plan Manger informed of any changes in marital status, or a change of address. 65 COBRA Continued PLAN CONTACT INFORMATION Ceridian COBRA Continuation Services Humana Insurance Company 3201 34 th Street South Billing/Enrollment Department St. Petersburg, FL 33711-3828 101 E. Main Street 1-800-488-8757 Louisville, KY 40201 Toll Free: 1-877-597-7474 66 THE UNIFORMED SERVICES EMPL OYMENT AND REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ACT OF 1994 (USERRA) CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS Effective October 13, 1994 federal law requires that health plans must offer to continue coverage for employees who are absent due to service in the uniformed services and/or their dependents . Coverage may continue for up to 18 or 24 months after the date the employee is first absent due to uniformed service. ELIGIBILITY An employee is eligible for continuation under USERRA if absent from employment because of voluntary or involuntary performance of duty in the Armed Forces, Army National Guard, Air National Guard, or the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, or any other category of persons designated by the President of the United States of America in a time of war or national emergency. Duty includes absence for active duty, active duty for training, initial activ e duty for training, inactive duty training, full-time National Guard duty, and for the purpose of an examination to determine fitness for duty. PREMIUM PAYMENT If continuation of Plan coverage is elected under USERRA, the employee or dependent is responsible for payment of the applicable cost of coverage. If the employee is absent for less than 31 days, the cost will be the amount the employee would otherwise pay for coverage. For absences longer than 30 days, the cost may be up to 102% of the cost of c overage under the Plan. This includes the employee's share and any portion previously paid by the employer . DURATION OF COVERAGE Elected continuation coverage under USE RRA will continue until the earlier of: 18 months beginning the first day of absence from employment due to service in the uniformed services for elections made prior to 12/10/04; or 24 months beginning the first day of absence from employment due to service in the uniformed services for elections beginning on or after 12/10/04; or The day after the employee fails to apply for or return to employment as required by USERRA, after completion of a period of service. Under federal law, the period of coverage available under USERRA sh all run concurrently with the COBRA period available to an employee and/or eligible dependents . OTHER INFORMATION Employees should contact their employer with any questions regarding coverage normally available during a military leave of absence or continuation coverage and notify the employer of any changes in marital status, or a change of address. 67 MEDICAL CONVERSION PRIVILEGE If your medical coverage under the Plan terminates, medi cal conversion coverage is available without medical examination. The medical conversion covera ge will provide lesser benefits than this Plan. You are eligible to apply for medical conversion if you were covered under the Plan for at least 90 days and: 1. Your coverage ends because your employment terminated; 2. You are the covered dependent former spouse or a covered dependent child of an employee whose marriage ended due to legal annulment, dissolution or divorce; 3. You are the surviving dependent spouse or child, in the event of the employee's death, or at the end of any survivorship continuation provided in the Plan; or 4. You have been a covered dependent child but no longer meet the definition of dependent under the Plan. You have 31 days after the date your coverage terminates to make conversion application to the Plan Manager , and pay the required premium for your individual or family coverage. The premium must be paid monthly, in advance. You may obtain application forms from the Plan Manager . The conversion coverage will be effective on the day after your group medical covera ge ends, provided you enroll and pay the first premium within 31 days after the date your coverage terminates. LIMITATIONS This privilege does not apply when your group medical coverage termin ates under the Plan and is replaced with other group medical coverage within 31 days of the termination of your coverage under the Plan. If you had any pre-existing condition which could have been excluded under the Plan, it will be excluded under the medical conversion coverage. The medical be nefits under the conversi on coverage in the first year will not exceed the benefit limits which would have been paid under the Plan. The benefits may be reduced by the amount of benefits paid under the Plan after your coverage ended. DUPLICATION OF COVERAGE Humana Insurance Company (HIC) will not issue individual medical conversion to you if HIC determines that you have other coverage that would result in overi nsurance or duplication of benefits with the medical conversion plan. HIC determines overinsurance according to its standards. Individual medical conversion may not be offered to you if you are eligible for Medicare . Please contact your employer or HIC for additional information. 68 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS BENEFITS SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISION Benefits described in this Plan are coordinated with benefits provided by other plans under which you are also covered. This is to prevent duplication of c overage and a resulting increase in the cost of medical coverage. For this purpose, a plan is one which covers medi cal or dental expenses and provides benefits or services by group, franchise or blanket insura nce coverage. This includes group-t ype contracts not available to the general public, obtained and maintained only because of the covered person's membership in or connection with a particular organiza tion or group, whether or not designa ted as franchise, blanket, or in some other fashion. Plan also includes any coverage provided through the following: 1. Employer , trustee, union, employee benefit, or other association; or 2. Governmental programs, programs mandated by st ate statute, or sponsored or provided by an educational institution. This Coordination of Benefits provision does not appl y to any individual policies or Blanket Student Accident Insurance provided by or through an edu cational institution. Allowable expense means any eligible expense , a portion of which is covered under one of the plans covering the person for whom claim is made. Each plan will determine what is an al lowable expense according to the provisions of the respective plan. When a plan pr ovides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be deemed to be both an allowable expense and a benefit paid. EFFECT ON BENEFITS One of the plans involved will pay benefits first. Th is is called the primary plan. All other plans are called secondary plans. When this Plan is the secondary plan, the sum of the benefit payable will not exceed 100% of the allowable expenses incurred under the Plan and any other plans included under this provision. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION In order to pay claims , it must be determined which plan is primary and which plan(s) are secondary. A plan will pay benefits first if it meets one of the following conditions: 1. The plan has no coordination of benefits provision; 2. The plan covers the person as an employee ; 3. For a child who is covered under both parents' pl ans, the plan covering the parent whose birthday (month and day) occurs first in the calendar year pays before the plan covering the other parent. If the birthdates of both parents are the same, the Plan which has covered the person for the longer period of time will be determined the primary plan; If a plan other than this Plan does not include prov ision 3, then the birthday rule will be followed to determine which plan is primary. 69 Coordination of Benefits Continued 4. In the case of dependent children covered under the plans of divorced or separated parents, the following rules apply: a. The plan of a parent who has custody will pay the benefits first; b. The plan of a step-parent who has custody will pay benefits next; c. The plan of a parent who does not have custody will pay benefits next; d. The plan of a step-parent who does not have custody will pay benefits next. There may be a court decree which gives one parent financial responsibility for the medical or dental expenses of the dependent children. If there is a court decree, the rules stated above will not apply if they conflict with the court decree. Instead, the plan of the parent with financial responsibility will pay benefits first. 5. If a person is laid off or is retired or is a dependent of such person, that plan covers after the plan covering such person as an active employee or dependent of such employee . If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule will be ignored. If the above rules do not apply or cannot be determin ed, then the plan that covered the person for the longest period of time will pay first. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS WITH MEDICARE In all cases, Coordination of Benefits with Medicare will conform to Federal Statutes and Regulations. In the case of Medicare each individual who is eligible for Medicare will be assumed to have full Medicare coverage (i.e. Part A hospital insurance and Part B voluntary medical insurance) whether or not the individual has enrolled for full coverage. Your benefits under the Plan will be coordinated to the extent benefits would otherwi se have been paid under Medicare as allowed by Federal Statutes and Regulations. RIGHT OF RECOVERY The Plan reserves the right to recover benefit paymen ts made for an allowable expense under the Plan in the amount which exceeds the maximum amount the Plan is required to pay under these provisions. This right of recovery applies to the Plan against: 1. Any person(s) to, for or with respect to whom, such payments were made; or 2. Any other insurance companies, or organizati ons which according to these provisions, owe benefits due for the same allowable expense under any other plan. The Plan alone will determine against whom th is right of recovery will be exercised. 70 REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION RIGHT OF RECOVERY These provisions apply when Plan benefits are paid as a result of injuries or illnesses you sustained and you have a right to a recovery or received a recovery. SUBROGATION This Plan reserves all rights of subrogation. This means that the Plan has the right to recover its previously paid benefit payments from any award, settlement, or damages that you or your dependent may receive or to which you may become entitled. It also means that the Plan has the right to take action on your behalf to obtain an award, settlement, or damages. The Plan shall have the first lien upon all awards, settlements, or damages subject to its subrogation or reimbursement rights listed below. This lien shall be in the amount of benefits provided or the amount of be nefits that will be provided under the Plan, plus the reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, to enforce the Plan's rights. The beneficiary agrees that by accepting and in return for the payment of covered expenses by the Plan in accordance with the terms of this Plan: 1. The Plan has the right to recover payments for benefits paid for by the Plan. 2. The Plan has the right to recover payment for benefits paid by the Plan to or on behalf of you or your dependent from any award, settlement, or damages that you or your dependent may become entitled to or receive as a result of an accident , a person's fault or negligence, or any other circumstance under which you or your dependent has the right to recover from any other party. 3. The Plan may recover its benefit payments for an y type of benefit which may be paid by the Plan, such as medical, dental, vision, mental, disability, supplemental accident, or accidental death or dismemberment benefits. 4. An \"award, settlement, or damages\" includes an y award, settlement, damages (whether equitable, legal, compensatory, etc.), compensation, benefits, or any other payment of any kind. The amount may be paid by formal court award, informal compromise, redemption agreement, application for benefits, or otherwise. The amount also may be paid in a lump sum, installment, or annuity payments (such as income replacement). The Plan has the right to recover from all of these amounts. 5. An \"award, settlement, or damages\" includes am ounts of any type, kind, nature, or character, regardless of whether the amount identifies or covers the Plan's benefit payments, otherwise relates to medical benefits, or is specifically limited to cer tain kinds of damages or payments. In addition, attorneys' fees or any other co sts associated with the amount will not reduce the amount of the Plan's reimbursement. This Plan has the first priority to recover from your award, settlement, or damages. The Plan's first priority lien also will apply regardless of whether you or your dependent is or was made whole from the award, settlement, or damages, whether before or after the Plan's subrogation recovery. This Plan precludes the operation of the \"make-whole\" and \"common fund\" doctrines. 71 Reimbursement/Subrogation Continued 6. Your \"right to recover\" from any other party means that you or your dependent has the right to recover damages or expenses from another party, su ch as an individual, partnership, corporation, government, or other entity, as well as against th at party's respective insurance carriers or governmental fund, for causing an injury or illness to you or your dependent or otherwise with respect to any injury or illness incurred by you or your covered dependent . This right to recover from any other party also includes your own insurance carrier, such as your automobile insurance, automobile no-fault coverage, hom eowners, personal accident, general liability, or life insurance carrier. It also includes a second medical insurance or other non-insured medical or other coverage. It also includes uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage or programs. The Plan has the right to recover from any of these parties, or any other parties, in connection with your illness or injury. In the event you or your dependent is entitled to or receives an aw ard, settlement, or damages from any party (which includes the other party's or your own insurance carrier or coverage), the Plan has the first lien upon the award, settlement, or da mages and must be reimbursed for its benefit payments made to you or your dependent , or on your behalf. The Plan's first lien supersedes any right that the Plan participant may have to be \"m ade whole.\" In other words, the Plan is entitled to the right of first reimbursement out of any awar d, settlement, or damages the Plan participant procures or may be entitled to procure regardless of whether the Plan participant has received compensation for any of his or her damages or expens es, including any of his or her attorneys' fees or costs. Additionally, the Plan's right of firs t reimbursement will not be \"set-off\" or reduced for any reason, including attorneys' fees, costs, comp arative negligence, limits of collectibility or responsibility, or otherwise. As a condition to receivi ng benefits under the Plan, the Plan participant agrees that acceptance of benefits is constructiv e notice of this provision. Reimbursement to the Plan must be made immediately upon entitlement or receipt of any award, settlement, or damages. The Plan will charge interest at a reasona ble rate for any delay in reimbursement. PLAN'S RIGHT TO ASSERT CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF The Plan has the right, if it so chooses, to assert rights on your behalf to obtain an award, settlement, or damages. Specifically, through subrogation, the Plan is entitled to all claims, demands, actions, and rights of recovery which you or your dependent may have against or from any party to the extent of the Plan's benefit payments. In addition, this Plan is entitle d to attorneys' fees incurred in asserting rights on your behalf. The Plan does not require you or your dependent to pursue a claim against another party. However, as stated above, the Plan reserves the right to directly pursue recovery against another party on your behalf, should you or your dependent elect not to pursue an award, settlement, or damages against or from a party. MISCELLANEOUS SUBROGATION You, your dependent , your attorneys, or anyone acting on your behalf legally cannot do anything to prejudice the rights of the Plan in the exercise of its subrogation rights to recover from, or assert your rights to obtain, an award, settlement, or damages. The Plan's subrogation rights also extend to the guardian or estate of you and your dependent . The Plan's subrogation pr ovisions will apply without limitation by the Plan's Coordination of Benef its provisions, unless the C oordination of Benefits provisions would result in a greater recovery for the Plan. 72 Reimbursement/Subrogation Continued DUTY TO COOPERATE As a condition to participating in the Pl an and receiving benefits under the Plan, you and your dependent agree to be bound by all of the Plan's provisions, including, but not limited to, the Plan's subrogation provisions. The Plan will make benefit pa yments on a claim on the condition that you or your dependent , upon entitlement or receipt of any award, settlement, or damages, will fully reimburse the Plan for the Plan's benefit payments and for expenses (including a ttorneys' fees and costs of suit, regardless of an action's outcome) incurred by the Plan in collecting this amount. As a precondition to receiving benefits under the Plan, you and your dependent must enter into agreement with th e Plan to reimburse the Plan for its benefit payments from any award, settlement, or damages pursuant to the Plan's subrogation provisions. In this agreement, you also must agree to assign direct payment to the Plan from any award, settlement, or damages to the extent of the Plan's benefit payments. You and your dependent also otherwise must sign and deliver any and all instrume nts, papers, and reimburse ment agreements required by the Plan necessary for the Plan's reimbursement right. You and your dependent also are required to do whatever is requested or necessary in order to fully ex ecute and to fully protect all the Plan's rights and to do nothing that would interfere with or diminish those rights. Further, you and your dependent must notify the Plan in writing of any proposed settlement and obtain the Plan's written consent before signing any release or agreeing to any settlement. In any event, the Plan's benefit payments for any current or historical claims under the Plan on your behalf will be deemed to be the equivalent of you or your covered dependent entering into an agreement to reimburse the Plan and otherwise signing and delivering any instruments and papers as required by the Plan. In the event that you or your dependent fails to enter into the foregoing agreement, or to otherwise comply with such requests, the Plan is entitled to withhold or deny benefits otherwise due under the Plan until you do so. RETENTION OF AN ATTORNEY If you or your attorney receives any recovery (whether by award, settlement, damages, compromise, or otherwise), you have an absolute obligation to immediatel y tender the recovery to the Plan under the terms of this provision. If you or your attorney does not immediately te nder the recovery to the Plan, you will be deemed to hold the recovery in constructive trust for the Plan, because you or your attorney is not the rightful owner of the recovery and should not be in possession of the recovery until the Plan has been fully reimbursed. PARTICIPANT'S NONCOMPLIANCE If you or your dependent do not comply with the provisions of this section, the Plan Administrator shall have the authority, at its sole discretion, to deny payment of any claims for benefits by you and to deny or reduce future benefits payable (including payment of future benefits for other injuries or illnesses) under the Plan by the amount due as reimbursement to the Pl an. The Plan Administrator may also, at its sole discretion, deny or reduce future benefits (including future benefits for other injuries or illnesses) under any other group benefits plan maintained by the Pl an Sponsor. The reductions will equal the amount of the required reimbursement. If the Plan must bring an action against you to enforce this provision, then you agree to pay the Plan's attorneys' fees and costs, regardless of the action's outcome. 73 Reimbursement/Subrogation Continued RIGHT TO COLLECT NEEDED INFORMATION You must cooperate with the Plan Manager and when asked, assist the Plan Manager by: Authorizing the release of medical information including the names of all providers from whom you received medical attention; Obtaining medical information and/or records from any provider as requested by the Plan Manager ; Providing information regarding the circumstances of your sickness or bodily injury ; Providing information about other insurance coverage and benefits, including information related to any bodily injury or sickness for which another party may be liabl e to pay compensation or benefits; and Providing information the Plan Manager requests to administer the Plan. Failure to provide the necessary information will re sult in denial of any pending or subsequent claims , pertaining to a bodily injury or sickness for which the information is sought, until the necessary information is satisfactorily provided. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION EXCLUSIONS 1. Sickness or bodily injury for which medical payments/personal injury protection (PIP) coverage exists under any automobile, homeowner, marine, avia tion, premise, or any other similar coverage, whether such coverage is in effect on a primary, secondary, or excess basis. This exclusion applies up to the available limit under the other coverage regardless of whether a claim is filed with the medical payments/PIP carrier . Whether medical payment or e xpense coverage is payable under another coverage is to be determined as if the coverages under this Plan did not exist; 2. Any covered expenses to the extent of any amount received from others for the bodily injuries or losses which necessitate such benefits. \"Amount s received from others\" specifically includes, without limitation, liability insurance, worker's compensation, uninsured motorists, underinsured motorists, \"no-fault\" and automobile med-pay payments; 74 GENERAL PROVISIONS The following provisions are to protect your legal rights and the legal rights of the Plan. CONTESTABILITY The Plan has the right to contest the validity of your coverage under the Plan at any time. RIGHT TO REQUEST OVERPAYMENTS The Plan reserves the right to recover any payments made by the Plan that were: 1. Made in error; or 2. Made to you or any party on your behalf where the Plan determines the payment to you or any party is greater than the amount payable under this Plan. The Plan has the right to recover against you if the Plan has paid you or any other party on your behalf. TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES A claim will not be reduced or denied after two years from the effective date of the benefit because a disease or physical condition not excluded and causing the loss existed before the benefit effective date . WORKERS' COMPENSATION NOT AFFECTED The Plan is not issued in lieu of, nor does it affe ct any requirement for coverage by any Workers' Compensation or Occupational Disease Act or Law. WORKERS' COMPENSATION If benefits are paid by the Plan and the Plan determines you received Workers' Compensation for the same incident, the Plan has the right to recover as describ ed under the Reimbursement/Subrogation provision. The Plan will exercise its right to recover against you even though: 1. The Workers' Compensation benefits are in di spute or are made by means of settlement or compromise; 2. No final determination is made that bodily injury or sickness was sustained in the course of or resulted from your employment; 3. The amount of Workers' Compensation due to medical or health care is not agreed upon or defined by you or the Workers' Compensation carrier ; 4. The medical or health care benefits are specifically excluded from the Workers' Compensation settlement or compromise. You hereby agree that, in consideration for the coverage provided by the Plan, you will notify the Plan Manager of any Workers' Compensation claim you make, and that you agree to reimburse the Plan as described above. 75 General Provisions Continued MEDICAID This Plan will not take into account the fact that an employee or dependent is eligible for medical assistance or Medicaid under state law with respect to enrollment, determining eligibility for benefits, or paying claims . If payment for Medicaid benefits has been made u nder a state Medicaid plan for which payment would otherwise be due under this Plan, payment of benefits under this Plan will be made in accordance with a state law which provides that the state has ac quired the rights with respect to a covered employee to the benefits payment. CONSTRUCTION OF PLAN TERMS The Plan Manager has the sole right to construe and prescribe the meaning, scope and application of each and all of the terms of the Plan, including, withou t limitation, the benefits provided thereunder, the obligations of the beneficiary and the recovery rights of the Plan; such construction and prescription by the Plan Manager shall be final and uncontestable. PRIVACY OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION The Plan is required by law to maintain the privacy of your protected health information in all forms including written, oral and electronically maintained , stored and transmitted information and to provide individuals with notice of the Plan's legal duties and privacy practices with respect to protected health information . The Plan has policies and procedures specifically designed to protect your health information when it is in electronic format. This includes administrative, ph ysical and technical safeguards to ensure that your health information cannot be inappropriately accessed while it is stored and transmitted to the Plan Manager and others that support the Plan. In order for the Plan to operate, it may be necessar y from time to time for health care professionals, the Plan Administrator, individuals who perform Plan -related functions under the auspices of the Plan Administrator, the Plan Manager and other service providers that have been engaged to assist the Plan in discharging its obligations with respect to delivery of benefits, to have access to what is referred to as protected health information . A covered person will be deemed to have consented to use of protected health information about him or her by virtue of enrollment in the Plan. Any i ndividual who may not have intended to provide this consent and who does not so consent must contact the Plan Administrator prior to filing any claim for Plan benefits, as coverage under the Plan is contingent upon consent. Individually identifiable health information will only be used or disclosed for purposes of Plan operation or benefits delivery. In that regard, only the mi nimum necessary disclosure will be allowed. The Plan Administrator, Plan Manager , and other entities given access to protected health information , as permitted by applicable law, will safeguard protected health information to ensure that the information is not improperly disclosed. 76 General Provisions Continued Disclosure of protected health information is improper if it is not allowed by law or if it is made for any purpose other than Plan operation or benefits delivery. Disclos ure for Plan purposes to persons authorized to receive protected health information may be proper, so long as the disclosure is allowed by law and appropriate under the circumstances. Improper disclosure includes disclosure to the employer for employment purposes, employee representatives, consultants, attorn eys, relatives, etc. who have not executed appropriate agreements effective to authorize such disclosure. The Plan Manager will afford access to protected health information in its possession only as necessary to discharge its obligations as a service provider , within the restrictions noted above. However, Plan records that include protected health information are the property of the Plan. Information received by the Plan Manager is information received on behalf of the Plan. The Plan Manager will afford access to protected health information as reasonably directed in writing by the Plan Administrator, which shall only be made with due regard for confidentiality. In that regard, the Plan Manager has been directed that disclosure of protected health information to be made to the person(s) identified by the Plan Administrator. Individuals who have access to protected health information in connection with their performance of Plan-related functions under the auspices of the Pl an Administrator will be trained in these privacy policies and relevant procedures prior to being granted any access to protected health information . The Plan Manager and other Plan service providers will be required to safeguard protected health information against improper disclosure thro ugh contractual arrangements. In addition, you should know that the employer / Plan Sponsor may legally have access, on an as-needed basis, to limited health information for the purpose of determining Plan costs, contributions, Plan design, and whether Plan modifications are warranted. In a ddition, federal regulators such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Departme nt of Labor may legally require access to protected health information to police federal legal requirements about privacy. Covered persons may have access to protected health information about them that is in the possession of the Plan, and they may make changes to correct errors. Covered persons are also entitled to an accounting of all disclosures that may be ma de by any person who acquires access to protected health information concerning them and uses it other than for Plan ope ration or benefits delivery. In this regard, please contact the Plan Administrator. Covered persons are urged to contact the originating hea lth care professional with respect to medical information that may have been acquired from them, as those items of information are relevant to medical care and treatment. And finally, covered persons may consent to disclosure of protected health information , as they please. 77 HEALTH CARE CLAIMS PROCEDURES SUBMITTING A CLAIM This section describes what a covered person (or his or her authorized representative) must do to file a claim for Plan benefits. A claim must be filed with the Plan Manager in writing and delivered to the Plan Manager , by mail, postage prepaid. Claims must be submitted to the Plan Manager at the address indicated in the documents describing the Plan or claimant's identification card. Claims will not be deemed submitted for purposes of these procedures unless and until received at the correct address. Also, claims submissions must be in a format acceptable to the Plan Manager and compliant with any applicable legal requirements. Claims that are not submitted in accordance with the requirements of applicable federa l law respecting privacy of protected health information and/or electronic claims standards will not be accepted by the Plan. Claims submissions must be timely. Claims must be filed as soon as reasonably possible after they are incurred, and in no event later than 15 months after the date of loss, except if you were legally incapacitated. Plan benefits are only available for claims that are incurred by a covered person during the period that he or she is covered under the Plan. Claims submissions must be complete. They must contain, at a minimum: a. The name of the covered person who incurred the covered expense ; b. The name and address of the health care provider ; c. The diagnosis of the condition; d. The procedure or nature of the treatment; e. The date of and place where the procedure or treatment has been or will be provided; f. The amount billed and the amount of the covered expense not paid through coverage other than Plan coverage, as appropriate; g. Evidence that substantiates the na ture, amount, and timeliness of each covered expense in a format that is acceptable according to industry standards and in compliance with applicable law. A general request for an interpretation of Plan provisions will not be considered to be a claim . Requests of this type, such as a request for an interpretati on of the eligibility provisions of the Plan, should be directed to the Plan Administrator. Medical claims , medical correspondence should be mailed to: Humana Claims Office P.O. Box 14601 Lexington, Kentucky 40512-4601 78 Claims Procedures Continued MISCELLANEOUS MEDICAL CHARGES If you accumulate bills for medical items you purchase or rent yourself, send them to the Plan Manager at least once every three months during the year (quarter ly). The receipts must include the patient name, name of item, date item purchased or rented and name of the provider of service . PROCEDURAL DEFECTS If a pre-service claim submission is not made in accordance with the Plan's procedural requirements, the Plan Manager will notify the claimant of the procedural deficiency and how it may be cured no later than within five (5) days (or within 24 hours, in the case of an urgent care claim ) following the failure. A post-service claim that is not submitted in accordance with these claims procedures will be returned to the submitter. ASSIGNMENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES A covered person may assign his or her right to receive Plan benefits to a health care provider only with the consent of the Plan Manager , in its sole discretion, except as ma y be required by applicable law. Assignments must be in writing. If a document is not sufficient to cons titute an assignment, as determined by the Plan Manager , then the Plan will not consider an assignment to have been made. An assignment is not binding on the Plan until the Plan Manager receives and acknowledges in writing the original or copy of the assignment before payment of the benefit. If benefits are assigned in accordance with the foregoing paragraph and a health care provider submits claims on behalf of a covered person , benefits will be paid to that health care provider . In addition, a covered person may designate an authorized representative to act on his or her behalf in pursuing a benefit claim or appeal. The designation must be explicitly stated in writing and it must authorize disclosure of Protected Health Information with respect to the claim by the Plan, the Plan Manager and the authorized representative to one another. If a document is not sufficient to constitute a designation of an authorized representative, as determined by the Plan Manager , then the Plan will not consider a designation to have been made. An assi gnment of benefits does not constitute designation of an authorized representative. Any document designating an authorized representative must be submitted to the Plan Manager in advance, or at the time an authorized represen tative commences a course of action on behalf of a claimant . At the same time, the authorized representative should also provide notice of commencement of the action on behalf of the claimant to the claimant , which the Plan Manager may verify with the claimant prior to recognizing the authorized representative status. In any event, a health care provider with knowledge of a claimant's medical condition acting in connection with an urgent care claim will be recognized by the Plan as the claimant's authorized representative. Covered persons should carefully consider whether to desi gnate an authorized representative. An authorized representative may make decisions independent of the covered person , such as whether and how to appeal a claim denial. 79 Claims Procedures Continued CLAIMS DECISIONS After submission of a claim by a claimant , the Plan Manager will notify the claimant within a reasonable time, as follows: PRE-SERVICE CLAIMS The Plan Manager will notify the claimant of a favorable or adverse determination within a reasonable time appropriate to the medical circumstances, but no later than 15 days after receipt of the claim by the Plan. However, this period may be extende d by an additional 15 days, if the Plan Manager determines that the extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the Plan. The Plan Manager will notify the affected claimant of the extension before the end of the in itial 15-day period, the circumstances requiring the extension, and the date by which th e Plan expects to make a decision. If the reason for the extension is because of the claimant's failure to submit information necessary to decide the claim , the notice of extension will describe the required information. The claimant will have at least 45 days from the date the notice is received to provide the specified information. URGENT CARE CLAIMS The Plan Manager will determine whether a claim is an urgent care claim . This determination will be made on the basis of information furnished by or on behalf of a claimant . In making this determination, the Plan Manager will exercise its judgment, with deference to the judgment of a physician with knowledge of the claimant's condition. Accordingly, the Plan Manager may require a claimant to clarify the medical urgency and circumstances that support the urgent care claim for expedited decision-making. The Plan Manager will notify the claimant of a favorable or adverse determination as soon as possible, taking into account the medical exigencies particular to the claimant's situation, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of the urgent care claim by the Plan. However, if a claim is submitted that does not provide sufficient information to determine whether, or to what extent, expenses are covered or payable under the Plan, notice will be provided by the Plan Manager as soon as possible, but not more than 24 hours after receipt of the urgent care claim by the Plan. The notice will describe the speci fic information necessary to complete the claim . The claimant will have a reasonable amount of time, taking into account his or her circumstances, to provide the necessary informati on but not less than 48 hours. The Plan Manager will notify the claimant of the Plan's urgent care claim determination as soon as possible, but in no event more than 48 hours after the earlier of: a. The Plan's receipt of the specified information; or b. The end of the period afforded the claimant to provide the specified additional information. 80 Claims Procedures Continued CONCURRENT CARE DECISIONS The Plan Manager will notify a claimant of a concurrent care decision that involves a reduction in or termination of benefits that have been pre-authorized. The Plan Manager will provide the notice sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow the claimant to appeal and obtain a determination on review of the adverse determination before the benefit is reduced or terminated. A request by a claimant to extend a course of treatment beyond the period of time or number of treatments that is a claim involving urgent care will be decided by the Plan Manager as soon as possible, taking into account the medical exigencies. The Plan Manager will notify a claimant of the benefit determination, whether adverse or not within 24 hours after receipt of the claim by the Plan, provided that the claim is submitted to the Plan at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the prescribed period of time or number of treatments. POST-SERVICE CLAIMS The Plan Manager will notify the claimant of a favorable or adverse determination within a reasonable time, but not later than 30 days after receipt of the claim by the Plan. However, this period may be extende d by an additional 15 days, if the Plan Manager determines that the extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the Plan. The Plan Manager will notify the affected claimant of the extension before the end of the in itial 30-day period, the circumstances requiring the extension, and the date by which th e Plan expects to make a decision. If the reason for the extension is because of the claimant's failure to submit information necessary to decide the claim , the notice of extension will describe the required information. The claimant will have at least 45 days from the date the notice is receive d to provide the specified information. The Plan Manager will make a decision no later than 15 days after the earlier of the date on which the information provided by the claimant is received by the Plan or the expirati on of the time allowed for submission of the additional information. TIMES FOR DECISIONS The periods of time for claims decisions presented above begin when a claim is received by the Plan, in accordance with these claims procedures. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS Many health care providers will request an assignment of benefits as a matter of convenience to both provider and patient. Also as a matter of convenience, the Plan Manager will, in its sole discretion, assume that an assignment of benefits has been made to certain Network Providers . In those instances, the Plan Manager will make direct payment to the hospital , clinic, or physician's office, unless the Plan Manager is advised in writing that you have already paid the bill. If you have paid the bill, please indicate on the original statement, \"paid by employee, \" and send it directly to the Plan Manager . You will receive a written explanation of the benefit determination. The Plan Manager reserves the right to request any information required to determine benefits or process a claim . You or the provider of services will be contacted if additional inform ation is needed to process your claim . 81 Claims Procedures Continued When an employee's child is subject to a medical child support order, the Plan Manager will make reimbursement of eligible expenses paid by you, the child, the child's non- employee custodial parent, or legal guardian, to that child or the child's custodi al parent, or legal guardian, or as provided in the medical child support order. Payment of benefits under this Plan will be made in accordance with an assignment of rights for you and your dependents as required under state Medicaid law. Benefits payable on behalf of you or your covered dependent after death will be paid, at the Plan's option, to any family member(s) or your estate. The Plan Manager will rely upon an affidavit to determine benefit payment, unless it receives written notice of valid claim before payment is made. The affidavit will release the Plan from further liability. Any payment made by the Plan Manager in good faith will fully discharge it to the extent of such payment. Payments due under the Plan will be paid upon receipt of written proof of loss. INITIAL DENIAL NOTICES Notice of a claim denial (including a partial denial) will be provided to claimants by mail, postage prepaid, by FAX, or by e-mail, as appropriate, within the time frames noted above. However, notices of adverse decisions involving urgent care claims may be provided to a claimant orally within the time frames noted above for expedited urgent care claim decisions. If oral notice is given, written notification will be provided to the claimant no later than 3 days after the oral notification. A claims denial notice will state the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination , the specific Plan provisions on which the determination is based, and a description of the Plan's review procedures and associated timeline. The notice will also incl ude a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary. The notice will describe the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures. The notice will also disclose any internal Plan rule, pr otocol or similar criterion that was relied on to deny the claim . A copy of the rule, protocol or sim ilar criterion relied upon will be provided to a claimant free of charge upon request. If the adverse determination is based on medical necessity, experimental, investigational or for research purposes, or similar exclusion or limit, the notice will provide either an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination, applying the terms of the Plan to the claimant's medical circumstances, or a statement th at such explanation will be provided free of charge upon request. In the case of an adverse decision of an urgent care claim , the notice will provide a description of the Plan's expedited review pro cedures applicable to such claims . 82 Claims Procedures Continued APPEALS / GRIEVANCES If your medical claims have been denied, you have the right to file an appeal or grievance to Humana. The following section outlines your rights to file an appeal. 1. Adverse Determination - procedures performed or proposed to a covered person are not deemed medically necessary , by the insurer, or are experimental or investigational services and would result in coverage being denied, reduced or terminated. An adverse determination does not mean a determination that the health care services are limited or excluded by the plan, unless medical necessity is a result of the limitations or exclusions. 2. Coverage Denial - services , treatments, or devices that are specifically limited or excluded under the covered person's plan. Who Should Perform the Appeal? Adverse Determination - The Plan Manager will handle the Internal Appeal Process for Adverse Determinations in accordance with KRS 304.17A.600-633. Coverage Denial - The Plan Manager will handle the Internal Appeal Process for Coverage Denials in accordance with KRS 304.17A.600-633.

After exhaustion, a claimant may pursue any other legal remedies available to him or her. Additional information may be available from a local U.S. Department of Labor Office. LEGAL ACTIONS AND LIMITATIONS No action at law or in equity may be brought with respect to Plan benefits until all remedies under the Plan have been exhausted and then prior to the e xpiration of the applicable limitations period under applicable law.

REIMBURSEMENT OF HRA FUNDS Only medical care expenses that have not been or will not be reimbursed by any other source may be Eligible Medical Expenses (to the extent all other conditions for Eligible Medical Expenses have been satisfied). As such, this HRA does not coordinate benefits with any other group or individual health coverage except as provided herein. \"HRA Eligible Medical Expenses\" are medical care expenses incurred by you or your eligible Dependents that satisfy all of the conditions described below. All expenses that are not within the scope of \"HRA Eligible Medical Expenses\" described belo w are excluded. Eligible Medical Expenses covered under this HRA Plan must also be covered under the Commonwealth Select Plan. The following expenses are eligible for reimbursement under this HRA Plan (provided all other terms and conditions of the HRA have been satisfied): 87 Claims Procedures Continued Medical Preventive Health Care Prescriptions Over the Counter Medications Vision Dental Durable Medical Equipment \"Incurred\" means the date the service or treatment is provided; not when the expense arising from the service or treatment is paid. Thus, an expense that h as been paid but not incurred (e.g. pre-payment to a physician) will not be reimbursed until the services or treatment giving rise to the expense has been provided. In no event will the following expenses be eligible for reimbursement: Any expense that is not a Code Section 213(d) expense Any expenses incurred for qualified long term care services Expenses incurred prior to the date that c overage under this HRA becomes effective Expenses incurred after the date that coverage under this HRA ends Expenses that have been reimbursed by another pl an or for which plan to seek reimbursement under another health plan. To the extent that Eligible Medical Expenses are covered both by this HRA and by an Employer sponsored FSA in which the employee participates, Eligible Medical Expenses are first reimbursed from the FSA and then the HRA. CLAIMS REIMBURSEMENT Under this HRA, you have two reim bursement options. You can complete and submit a written claim for reimbursement (see \"Traditional Paper Claims\" below fo r more information). Alternatively, you can use an electronic payment card (see \"Electronic Paymen t Card\" below for more information) to pay the expense. In order to be eligible for the Electroni c Payment Card, you must agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the Electronic Payment Card Program (the \"Program\") as set forth herein and in the Electronic Payment Cardholder Agreement (the \"Car dholder Agreement\") including any fees applicable to participate in the program, limitations as to card usage, the Plan 's right to withhold and offset for ineligible claims, etc. The following is a summary of how both options work. Traditional Paper Claims 1. You can obtain a reimbursement form from the Third Party Administrator. You must complete the reimbursement form and submit it to the Third Part y Administrator with an Explanation of Benefits (\"EOB\"). An EOB is a document provided by an insurer that explains the amounts, if any, paid under the Commonwealth Select Plan. For informati on relating to the Third Party Administrator, please view the Plan Contact Information Section of this SPD. Forms can be mailed to P.O. Box 3967, Louisville, Kentucky 40201-3967 or faxed to (800) 905-1851. 88 Claims Procedures Continued 2. In some instances, your insurer (if Humana) may submit the EOB on your behalf. In that situation, you certify when you incur the expense that the expense has not been reimbursed by any other source and that you will not seek reimbursement from any other source. You may submit requests for reimbursement of Eligible Medical Expenses at any time prior to the end of the HRA Run Out Period. The HRA Run Out Period for active employees is 90 days after the end of the plan year . The HRA Run Out Period for terminated employees is 90 days from the termination date. Requests for reimbursements submitted after the HRA Run Out Period will not be reimbursed. 3. Your HRA claim is deemed filed when it is received by the Third Party Administrator. If your claim for reimbursement is approved, you will be provided reimbursement as soon as reasonably possible following the determination. Any unclaimed reimbursement amounts (e.g., failing to cash a reimbursement check) will be forfeited and returned to the Employer if not claimed (or cashed) within 90 days of receipt. 4. If it is later determined that you and/or your eligible Dependent(s) received an overpayment or a payment was made in error (e.g., you were reimbursed for an expense under the HRA that is later paid for by the Commonwealth Select Plan or some other medical plan), you will be required to refund the overpayment or erroneous reimbursement to the HRA. 5. If you do not refund the overpayment or erroneous payment, the Plan reserves the right to offset future reimbursement equal to the overpayment or e rroneous payment or, if that is not feasible, to withhold such funds from your pay. If all other attempts to recoup the overpayment/erroneous payment are unsuccessful, the Plan Administrator may treat the overpayment as a bad debt, which may have income tax implications for you. In addition, if the Plan Administrator determines that you have submitted a fraudulent claim, the Plan Administrator may terminate your coverage under this HRA (and to the extent permissibl e, under the Commonwealth Select Plan). Electronic Payment Card The Electronic Payment Card allows you to pay for Eligible Medical Expenses at the time that you incur the expense. 1. You must make an election to use the card. In order to be eligible for the Electronic Payment Card, you must agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the Program as set forth herein and in the Electronic Payment Cardholder Agreement (the \"Cardholder Agreement\") including any fees applicable to participate in the Progr am, limitations as to card usage, the Plan 's right to withhold and offset for ineligible claims, etc. You must agree to abide by the terms of the Program both during the Initial Election Period and during each Annual Election Period. A Cardholder Agreement will be provided to you. The card will be turned off effective the first day of each Plan Year if you do not affirmatively agree to abide by th e terms of the Program during the preceding Annual Election Period. The Cardholder Agreemen t is part of the terms and conditions of your Plan and this SPD. 89 Claims Procedures Continued 2. The card will be turned off when employment or coverage terminates. The card will be turned off when you terminate employment or when coverage under the Plan ends. Contact your Third Party Administrator for reactivation of the electronic payment card after submission of your initial COBRA premium payment. 3. You must certify proper use of the card. As specified in the Cardholder Agreement, you certify during the applicable Election Period that the amounts in your HRA will only be used for Eligible Medical Expenses (i.e. medical care expenses incurred by you, your spouse , and your tax dependents) and that you have not been reimbursed for the expense and that you will not seek reimbursement for the expense from any other source. Failure to abide by this certification will result in termination of card use privileges. 4. HRA reimbursement under the card is limited to health care providers (including pharmacies). Use of the card for HRA expenses is limited to merchants who are health care providers (doctors, pharmacies, etc.). As set forth in the Cardholder Agreement, you will not be able to use the card at a regular retail store - e.g., a supermarket, gr ocery store, or discount store with a pharmacy. 5. You swipe the card at the health care provider like you do any other credit card. When you incur an Eligible Medical Expense at a doctor's office or pharmacy, such as a co-payment or prescription drug expense, you swipe the card at the provider's office much like you would a typical credit card. The provider is paid for the expense up to the maximum reimbursement amount available under the HRA (or as otherwise limited by the Program) at the time that you swipe the card. Every time you swipe the card, you certify to the Plan that the expense for which payment under the HRA is being made is an Eligible Medical Expense and that you have not been reimbursed from any other source nor will you seek reimbursement from another source. 6. You must obtain and retain a receipt/thir d party statement each time you swipe the card. You must obtain a third party statement from the health care provider (e.g., receipt, invoice, etc.) that includes the following information each time you swipe the card: The nature of the expense (e.g., what type of service or treatment was provided). If the expense is for an over the counter drug, the written statement must indicate the name of the drug. The date the expense was incurred. The amount of the expense. You must retain this receipt for one year following the close of the Plan year in which the expense is incurred. Even though payment is made under the card arrangement, you may be required to submit a written third party statement (except as otherwise provided in the Cardholder Agreement). You will receive a letter from the Claims Administra tor that a third party statement is needed. You must provide the third party statement to the Claims Administrator within 45 days (or such longer period provided in the letter from the Cl aims Administrator) of the request. 90 Claims Procedures Continued 7. There may be situations in which you will not be required to provide the written statement to the claims administrator. More detail as to which situations apply under your Plan is specified in the Cardholder Agreement: Co-Pay Match: As specified in the Cardholder Agreemen t, no written statement is necessary if the Electronic Payment Card payment matches a specific co-payment you have under the Commonwealth Select Plan for the particular ser vice that was provided. For example, if you have a $10 co-pay for physician office visits, and the payment was made to a physician office in the amount of $10, you will not be required to provide the third party statement to the Claims Administrator. Previously Approved Claim Match: As specified in the Cardholder Agreement, no written statement is required if the expense is the same as the amount, duration and provider as a previously approved expense. For example, the claims administrator approves a 30 count prescription with 3 refills that was purchased at ABC Pharmacy. Each time the card is swiped for subsequent refills at ABC Pharmacy the receipt need not be provided to the Claims Administrator if the expense incurred is the same amount. Provider Match Program : As specified in the Cardholder Agreement, no third party statement is required to be submitted to the Claims Administrator if the electronic claim file is accompanied by an electronic or written confirmation from the health care provider (e.g., your prescription benefits manager) that identifies the nature of your expense and verifies the amount. Note: You should still obtain the third party receipt when you incur an expense and swipe the card, even if you think it will not be needed, in th e event the receipt is requested by the Claims Administrator. 8. You must pay back any improperly paid claims. If you are unable to provide adequate or timely substantiation as requested by the Claims Administrator, you must repay the Plan for the unsubstantiated expense. The deadline for repaying the Plan is set forth in the Cardholder Agreement. If you do not repay the Plan within the applicable time pe riod, the card will be turned off and an amount equal to the unsubstantiated expen se will be offset against future eligible claims under the HRA. If no claims are submitted prior to the date you terminate coverage in the Plan , or claims are submitted but they are not sufficient to cover the unsubstantiated expense amount, then the amount may be withheld from your pay (as specified in the Car dholder Agreement). Lastly, the employer may treat the unreimbursed amount as a bad business debt, which could have income tax implications for you. 91 Claims Procedures Continued 9. You can use either the payment card or the traditional paper claims approach. You have the choice as to how to submit your eligible claims. If you elect not to use the electronic payment card, you may also submit claims under the Traditional Pape r Claims approach discussed above. Claims for which the Electronic Payment Card has been used cannot be submitted as Traditional Paper Claims. MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT The maximum reimbursement amount that you can receive is equal to your Health Reimbursement Account balance at the time the request for reim bursement is processed. Any portion of a claim for reimbursement that exceeds the maximum reimburse ment amount will be suspended and processed when the Reimbursement Account becomes sufficient. Pended claims will be processed and, if appropriate, paid before any new claims are processed and paid. DENIED CLAIMS If your claim for benefits is denied, you will have the right to a full and fair review process.

This notice has information about your current prescription drug coverage wi th the Kentucky Employees Health Plan (KEHP), and new prescription drug coverage available January 1, 2006 for people with Medicare. It also tells you where to find more information to help you make decisions about your prescription drug coverage. 1. Starting January 1, 2006, new Medicare pre scription drug coverage will be available to everyone with Medicare. 2. Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by the Kentucky Employees Health Plan is, on average for all plan participants, expected to pay out as much as the standard Medicare prescription drug coverage will pay. 3. Read this notice carefully - it explains th e options you have under Medicare prescription drug coverage, and can help you decide whether or not you want to enroll. You may have heard about Medicare's new prescrip tion drug coverage, a nd wondered how it would affect you. PwC has determined that your prescriptio n drug coverage with the KEHP is, on average for all plan participants, expected to pay out as much as the standard Medicare prescription drug coverage will pay. Starting January 1, 2006, prescription drug coverage will be available to everyone with Medicare through Medicare prescription drug plans. All Medicare prescr iption drug plans will provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans might also offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium. Because your existing coverage is on average at least as good as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay extra if you later decide to enroll in Medicare coverage. People with Medicare can enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan from November 15, 2005 through May 15, 2006. However, because you have existing pr escription drug coverage that, on average, is as good as Medicare coverage, you can choose to join a Me dicare prescription drug plan later. Each year after that, you will have the opportunity to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan between November 15th through December 31st. If you do decide to enroll in a Medicare prescri ption drug plan and drop your KEHP prescription drug coverage, be aware that you may no t be able to get this coverage back. If you drop your coverage with the KEHP and enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan, you may not be able to get this coverage back later. You should compare your current coverage, including which drugs are covered, with the coverage and cost of the plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage in your area. 113 In addition, your current coverage pays for other heal th expenses, in addition to prescription drugs, and you will still be eligible to receive all of you current health and prescription drug benefits if you choose to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan. You should also know that if you drop or lose yo ur coverage with the KEHP and don't enroll in Medicare prescription drug coverage after your cu rrent coverage ends, you may pay more to enroll in Medicare prescription drug coverage later. If afte r May 15, 2006, you go 63 days or longer without prescription drug coverage that's at least as good as Medicare's prescription drug coverage; your monthly premium will go up at least 1% per month for every month after May 15, 2006 that you did not have that coverage.

Howe ver, the examples in the regulation only explicitly deal with situ ations where an employee elects family coverage and adds family members at no additional cost. It is not clear, but IRS staff members ha ve informally stated that the \"tag-along\" rule applies even if the employee must increase an election to add additional dependents. Also, the preamble and examples in the regulation indicate that the \"tag-along\" rule applies to HIPAA events and situations where a spouse terminates employment; it is not clear what other events might be covered by the \"tag-along\" rule. (2) It appears this rule does not require that a spouse's coverage include a Health FSA. (3) By an increase or decrease in dependent care expenses, we mean that the event increases or decreases the amount of expenses that an employee can have reimbursed on a tax- free basis under Code secti on 129 from a dependent care assistance plan. For example, if the employee gets married and his or her spouse does not work outside the home, the spouse would be available to care for a child, and thus the employee may not be able to claim that dependent care expenses are being used to enable the employee to be gainfully employed \u2014 a condit ion that must be satisfied for the expense to be reimburs ed on a tax-free basis under Code section 129. Conversely, the marriage can increase the amount of expenses reimbursable under the dependent care assistance plan if, for example, a new spouse or stepchild is a \"qualifying individual\" for whom dependent care assistance can be receiv ed. A spouse's death or divorce might lead to fewer dependent care expenses eligible for reimbursement under section 129 if, for example, the spouse was a \"qualifying individual .\" Conversely, if the spouse was not employed outside the home, the death or divorce might require the employee to pay for a caregiver in order to re main gainfully employed, and therefore the expenses may be reimbursed on a tax-free basis under section 129. (4) Most employees are entitled to certain rights under th e Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), whether or not the benefits are provided through a cafe teria plan. Employees generally must re ceive up to 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave, although the employee or employer generally can choose to substitute av ailable paid leave for unpaid leave. During FMLA leave, the employer must maintain group health coverage (including FSA coverage) on the same conditions as coverage would be prov ided if the employee had not taken the leave. An employee's entitlement to other benefits during FMLA leave is determined by the employer's establis hed policy for providing such benefits when the employee is on other forms of paid or unpaid leave (as appropriate). If be nefits are continued during unpaid leave, proposed IRS regulations a llow benefits purchased through a cafeteri a plan to be paid in several ways, including increased salary reductions before the leave to prepay benefits or using salary reductions after the leave to \"catch-up\" on payments. Benefits continued on paid FMLA leave are paid for in the same manner as during any paid leave. Employees can choose to drop benefits while on leave, but FMLA requires they have the right to be reinstated upon return from leave. (5) For purposes of eligibility in this plan, a divorced dependent is not an \"unmarried\" dependent. (6) Primary residence is the official residence claimed for tax purposes. (7) Military Insurance Coverage, which does not include Veteran's Administra tion benefits, is c onsidered \"Another Employer \"Cost or Coverage Changes under the Employer's Plan\" are not included in this chart. In the event there is a mid- year change in the health plan, sp ecific direction will be provided to the group or groups affected.
