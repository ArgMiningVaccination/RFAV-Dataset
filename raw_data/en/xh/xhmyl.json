What is Clean Label Project? The Clean Label Project is a nonprofit third-party expert that tests for over 400 environmental and industrial toxins, including heavy metals. Once Upon a Farm is the recipient of both the Clean Label Project Purity Award and the Clean Label Project Pesticide-Free Certification. Our Awards Purity Award We are proud to have been awarded the Clean Label Purity Award. After rigorous, independent testing of our products for over 400 different contaminants including heavy metals, chemicals, pesticides, and other toxins, Clean Label Project has determined that we meet their highest purity standard. Pesticide-Free While certified organic goes a long way to reduce the chemical load used in agriculture, birds, bees, water, and wind can be the cause for contamination of organic farmland. Our Pesticide Free Certification recognizes us as a brand who's going above and beyond to eliminate the presence of pesticides in our finished products. 1,000 Day Promise Our Advanced Nutrition Blends are the FIRST products to be 1,000 Day Promise Certified by Clean Label Project. Inspired by European regulations, it's the first U.S. certification that requires heightened nutritional elements and regulation of heavy metals, toxic compounds and melamine found in baby food. The Once Upon a Farm Difference What we keep out of our recipes is just as important as what we put in! Always Organic Whole Ingredients Cold-Pressed Nutrient-Rich Farm-to-Fridge No Added Sugar No GMOs Dairy-Free No Preservatives Nothing Artificial Here's How We're Different From Our Farm to Your Fridge Cold from start to finish with no added sugar or concentrates. Our cold-pressed blends are nutritious, clean, safe, utterly delicious, and made with ingredients you can pronounce. Our Work Doesn't Stop Here Being awarded the Clean Label Purity Award and Pesticide Free Certification doesn't surprise us, but it does validate the extraordinary lengths we go to keep your little ones safe. Our work won't stop here. We will continue to rigorously test and go the extra mile with the hope that together we can raise the standards by which all baby food and kids snacks are made. "}
