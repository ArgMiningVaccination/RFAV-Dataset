That last one is particularly interesting evidence of the [mind-body connection](https://chopra.com/articles/time-for-a-body-mind-and-spirit-cleanse)! Most humans are much more likely to succumb to an infection or a flare of an auto-immune condition or fibromyalgia if they have recently experienced [emotional distress.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866360/) Combine all three of the above (stress, poor sleep, emotional upset), and the immune system becomes significantly impaired and doesn't do a good job defending itself or maintaining balance. One reason this happens is because [stress](https://chopra.com/articles/7-simple-ways-to-de-stress) causes the body to release the hormone cortisol, which impairs immune function. Specifically, cortisol alters the behavior of inflammatory and Natural Killer (NK) immune cells. The purpose of this alteration is to make more energy available for the presumably more immediate issue (fleeing, fighting, etc.). Cortisol shots, creams, etc. are used specifically for their inhibitory effect. Because cortisol is so potent, high cortisol states (from chronic stress or longer-term pharmaceutical use) can cause side-effects, including weight gain, persistent immune system dysfunction, bone weakness, metabolic impairment, and joint damage. A second reason why stress, including emotional stress, and lack of sleep impair immune function involves [glutathione](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2756154/), one of the body's key natural antioxidants. Glutathione is depleted approximately [37%](https://www.nature.com/articles/1395616) by stress, according to animal neuropsychopharmacology studies. Glutathione increases the production and activation of NK cells, which play a role in cancer prevention, as well as infectious disease defense. Glutathione also has a direct inhibitory impact on virus replication. This is one reason scientists have stated, including during the world's recent challenges, that people with chronic disease (prolonged stress and inflammation=reduced glutathione) are more susceptible to infections. Two strategies that are efficacious for enhancing the immune system are to increase glutathione and reduce cortisol. There are also herbs, foods, and supplements that have direct antiviral or antibacterial (or antifungal) impact. These can, of course, also be useful. Just because something is holistic or natural does not mean it is completely harmless, however. I advocate taking only what you need, when you need it (but in sufficient quantity, if you do need it). As with any health advice, discuss these supplements and suggestions with your providing physician to make sure there are no drug-herb interactions, bleeding disorders, or other contraindications. As mentioned above, there are many herbs and some foods that have direct anti-bacterial or anti-viral impact. I emphasize prevention, rather than treatment, whenever possible. Thus, increasing glutathione, reducing cortisol, sleeping well, and diminishing stress are my key holistic approaches to immune health. Prevention is not always possible, however. So, a few favorite evidence-based herbs and foods to consider if you feel acutely \"compromised\" (sick) are listed below (note: this is not a comprehensive list). Choose a reputable brand, follow the label's instructions, and check with your doctor to verify if these options are right for you. I wanted to end this article with a few positive perspectives to keep in mind if you find yourself feeling under the weather this winter or anytime. *Editor's Note: The information in this article is intended for your educational use only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
