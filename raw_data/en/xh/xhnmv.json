[The superstar couple](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-beauty/news/beyonce-steps-out-with-long-waist-length-hair-2013249/) have pledged to take on a plant-based vegan diet for the next three weeks, the \"Holy Grail\" rapper announced on his website, Life + Times. \"Psychologists have said it takes 21 days to make or break a habit. On the 22nd day, you've found the way,\" Jay Z wrote by way of an introduction. \"On December 3rd, one day before my 44th birthday, I will embark on a 22 Days challenge to go completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based!\" he continued. \"This all began a few months back when a good friend and vegan challenged me to embrace a 'plant-based breakfast' everyday. It was surprisingly easier on me than I thought...\" That friend was Marco Borges, an exercise physiologist and founder of 22 Days Nutrition, a vegan, organic, and gluten-free food and lifestyle company. Jay Z has called him \"the world's best trainer,\" and Pharell says he's \"a brilliant teacher of the idea that working out is not just a temporary fix to lose weight \u2014 it's a way of life.\" According to Borges' website, 22 Days Nutrition is \"a partner in the journey of Jay Z and Beyonce's exploration of a vegan diet.\" So why now? \"There's something spiritual to me about it being my 44th birthday and the serendipity behind the number of days in this challenge; 22 (2+2=4) coupled with the fact that the challenge ends on Christmas day,\" Jay Z wrote. \"It just feels right!\" ( Jay's obsession](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/beyonce-removes-long-extensions-debuts-blonde-pixie-cut-on-instagram-201388/) with the number four is well-documented; they were married on 4/4, Blue Ivy's middle name includes the roman numeral for four, and Beyonce's fourth album was titled simply 4.) He went on: \"So you can call it a spiritual and physical [cleanse](https://www.usmagazine.com/shop-with-us/news/best-detox-cleanses-teas-drinks-for-weight-loss-in-2021/). I will post my progress...Any professional vegans out there that have any great food spots, please help out!\" (In fact, the couple were spotted on Dec. 3 at Real Food Daily, an organic vegan eatery.) As for whether this could be a permanent lifestyle change? \"I don't know [what happens after Christmas](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-style/news/beyonce-2014-official-calendar-photos-of-cover-and-centerfold--2013710/),\" he concluded. \"A semi-vegan, a full plant-based diet? Or just a spiritual physical challenge? We'll see...Best of luck and health!\" "}
