native medicine (CAM) has been increasing steadily over the last a couple of decad es in both developing and developed countries. Although there has been no national popu lation-based study on CAM use in Australia, a number of regional studies have indica ted the consistent trend of increasing CAM use. This has drawn attention from the community, h ealth professionals and governments on issues associated with its use, such as quality, sa fety and the efficacy of CAM interventions. In addition, there have been questions about the valid ity of the reported prevalence data due to the heterogeneity of the CAM therapies and the way samples that were drawn for these studies. This thesis presents findings of a series of system atic literature reviews of CAM usage internationally and in Australia, which provided th e basis for the planning of a national population-based study. Most importantly, the thesi s presents the key findings and detailed analyses of findings of this Australian CAM usage s tudy based on a national representative sample. The first systematic review considered provides com prehensive overview of the current CAM use in the general populations around the world. In the second review, concerning the situation in Australia, the usage of CAM by the gen eral population in different regions and specific patient groups was evaluated. Finally, the use of all modalities of Chinese medicine worldwide was also systematically appraised. Althou gh there are a number of methodological issues that might have an impact on the validity of the prevalence data of overall and specific CAM use, over the last decade, the use of the most common forms of CAM such as herbal medicine in a number of countries has increased mar kedly. In Australia, despite the fact that 2 there has been no national population-based study, existing literature on regional health studies suggests that, in general, a higher level o f use of CAM therapies in Australia than in other Western countries. The national population-based survey was planned to investigate the national profile of CAM use in Australia, and to identify possible regional differences. The survey employed a random digit dialling (RDD) sampling method and interviews were carried out using computer- assisted telephone interviews (CATI) for data colle ction. A sample size of 1,067 participants was calculated and allocated between the six Austra lian states and two territories in proportion to Australian census data. National quotas for age and gender were applied to enhance the representativeness of the study populations. After undertaking a pilot study to refine the survey instruments and the CATI program, the major survey was conducted between May and June 2005. Comparison of respondents' demographic s tatistics with the Australian Census data confirmed the representativeness of the study sample. Through the three systematic reviews and consultati on with experts in the field, a total of 17 CAM therapies were included in the study. The 17 fo rms of CAM consist of substance-based therapies, such as Chinese herbal medicine; manipul ation therapies, such as chiropractic; nutrition therapies, such multi-vitamins; exerci se-based therapies, such as Qigong; and mind-body therapies, such as meditation. The most striking finding of this study is that the prevalence of overall CAM use in Australia is considerably higher than estimated in previously regional studies. Over two thirds (68.9%, 95% CI: 66.1% to 71.7%) of participants had used at least one of the 17 CAM therapies in the previous 12 months. Of these CAM users, 64.0%, (95% CI: 60.5% to 67.5%) had visited a CAM practitioner, that is, 44.1% of the total surve y participants. Concerning the specific use 3 of the 17 forms of CAM, the 10 most popular forms, in decreasing order, were clinical nutrition, Western massage therapy, meditation, Wes tern herbal medicine, aromatherapy, chiropractic, yoga, naturopathy, acupuncture and Ch inese herbal medicine. The high prevalence of CAM may be partially explain ed by regional (state) variations. Overall, the state of New South Wales had the highe st CAM use (72.1%), closely followed by Queensland (71.0 %) and Victoria (69.8%), with Sout h Australia being the lowest of prevalence (60.8%). In addition, significant region al differences were found for specific forms of CAM therapies. For example, the use of acupunctu re and osteopathy was significantly lower in the states of Western Australia and South Australia. The prevalence of visits to acupuncturists, herbalists, naturopaths and osteopa ths were also significantly lower in South Australia, compared to New South Wales and Victoria . Consistent with the existing literature, the most c ommon characteristics of CAM users were likely to be younger (aged from 18 to 34), female, employed, well educated, have private health insurance cover and have higher than average incomes. In terms of the frequency of practitioner visits and the expenditure related to CAM, the estimated number of visits to CAM practitioners by adult Australians in the 12 month period was comparable to the estimated number of visits to medical doctors. The annual \"ou t of pocket\" expenditure on CAM, nationally, was estimated as A$4.13 billion. Importantly, additional information was also sought about each of the four forms of CAM, which in Australia are subject to statutory regulat ion in one or more states: Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, chiropractic and osteopathy. The perceived and actual benefits and risks of using these four forms of CAM therapies an d other matters related to its use, such as the attitudes towards the national and private heal th insurance coverage are presented. 4 In summary, this first national CAM survey in Austr alia gathered critical data concerning the usage of CAM, investigated potential regional diffe rences and estimated expenditure associated with these therapies. It also suggested that while the concurrent use of Western medicine and CAM was common, the communication amon g the different health-care professions and the consumers had been grossly inad equate. These findings have a number of implications such as interpretation of the perceive d benefits and risks associated with the frequent CAM use, the needs of product and practiti oner regulation, economic impact on users, actions required from health insurance compa nies and related government agencies as well as research and education programs. 5 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background The use of complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM) is increasing in the Western world. 1-7 This trend is apparent from comparisons of the fin dings of population studies conducted in the United States (US) in 1990 2 and 1997 3 and from national population health surveys in the US in 1999 4 and 2002. 1 It is significant that a comprehensive national st udy is currently being planned by the US National Center f or Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). 8 Surveys in other countries, including the United K ingdom, 5 Canada 6 and Japan 7 have revealed a similar trend. In Australia, estim ates of CAM usage have been based on the Omnibus Health Surveys conducted in th e State of South Australia in 1993, 9 2000, 10 and 2004. 11 The findings of these studies are generally in acc ord with those in the US. 1-4 Increasing CAM usage in the US, Australia and other Western countries is also reflected in the expenditure on CAM, which is of concern to cons umers and governments. It has been estimated that a total of $US27 billion was spent o ut-of-pocket on CAM in the US in 1997. 3 Consistently, based on the South Australian Health Survey, 11 an estimated $AU1.8 billion was spent by Australians on CAM in 2004. It has als o been estimated that there were approximately 1.9 million Western herbal medicine a nd naturopathy practitioner consultations in Australia in 2003. 12 6 In recognition of the increasing use of CAM, state and national governments in Australia have recently introduced regulatory measures for certain forms of CAM. For example, the State of Victoria introduced statutory regulation of Chinese medicine in 2000, 13 the first jurisdiction outside China to do so. Two other Australian states , Western Australia and New South Wales, are developing similar legislation. At the national level, the Office of Complementary Medicine was established within the Australian Ther apeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in 1999 to align the regulation of some forms of CAM w ith that of conventional medicines. 14 These actions are welcome; however, they relate onl y to certain specific forms of CAM and do not address a range of issues that are critical for public safety and confidence in CAM. Of particular concern are potential adverse interactio ns due to the concurrent use of CAM and conventional health-care services and products. There has been no nationwide study to investigate C AM use in Australia, and the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have highe r numbers of some types of CAM practitioners, such as Western herbal medicine prac titioners and naturopaths, than other Australian states. 12 Thus, there is a view that there might be differen ces in the prevalence of use of different forms of CAM between states/territ ories of Australia, and, as mentioned above, Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture have been subject to statutory regulation in Victoria since 2000, which may have influenced the use of Chinese medicine in this state. 7 1.2 Rationale As mentioned above, in recent years numerous popula tion studies have been conducted to determine the national prevalence and expenditure o f CAM in many countries. 1-7,9-11,15-17 In Australia, at least three regional studies were con ducted between 1993 and 2004. 9-11 High levels of the use of CAM and expenditure on it were reported. However, systematic reviews 18,19 also suggested that there are considerable discrep ancies in the findings of different studies on the use of various forms of CA M. In general, a clear definition of CAM and a system of classification of CAM modalities, a n appropriated-designed survey instrument, as well as rigorous sampling and data c ollection methods are the major factors impacting on the internal and external validity of these studies. Considerable efforts have been made to address these issues in the current study. Extrapolation of the findings of Australian regiona l studies 9-11 to a national level could be problematic. As mentioned above, it is generally ac cepted and also observed in previous studies 12 that some CAM practitioners are more concentrated in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Other limitations of these regional studies include possible overlapping CAM modalities (e.g. Chinese medicine, herbal medic ine and Ginseng) and also that the range of CAM modalities included were differed, 9-11 for example, the exclusion of some popular CAM modalities (e.g. massage, see Chapter 2, Table 2.2). Although conventional medical therapies are still p redominant in the treatment and management of diseases/conditions, there is evidenc e that many Australians are turning to various forms of CAM to supplement, and sometimes r eplace, conventional treatments. It is apparent that patients with chronic diseases, such as arthritis, 20 diabetes, 21 asthma, 22 and 8 chronic inflammatory conditions, commonly use CAM t herapies. 23 A small number of high- quality clinical trials have demonstrated that some forms of CAM have a marginal benefit for a narrow range of such chronic illnesses. These the rapies include manipulation for low-back pain, 24 acupuncture for improving function and pain relief in osteoarthritis. 25 Thus, it is of interest to explore some common forms of CAM that b eing used by the general populations for a range of medical conditions. Currently in Australia, limited studies were conduc ted to explore matters that related to CAM use. Thus, where relevant, matters such as the exte nt to which medical doctors are aware of their patients' use of CAM, the perceived and actua l benefits and risks of CAM use, the relationship between CAM use and regulatory and hea lth insurance coverage matters, and some related economic considerations, such as perso nal expenditure on CAM were also explored. In summary, the need for a nationwide population-ba sed study on CAM utilisation in Australia is warranted. This study was undertaken t o investigate the national epidemiological profile of CAM use in Australia, and to reveal poss ible regional differences. A total of 17 CAM therapies were included in the study. They incl uded substance-based therapies, such as Chinese herbal medicine; manipulation therapies, su ch as chiropractic; nutrition therapies, such as multi-vitamins; exercise-based therapies, s uch as Qigong; and mind-body therapies, such as meditation. Additional information was also sought about each of the four forms of CAM, which in Australia are subject to statutory re gulation in one or more states: acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy. 9 1.3 Objectives and Research Questions The aims of the present study were to collect infor mation about the use of CAM in the Australian general population, specifically, to inv estigate the prevalence of use, out-of-pocket expenditure on CAM and to evaluate other matters re lated CAM use such as health insurance coverage, regulation and, perceived and actual bene fits and risks of using several specific forms of CAM. The overall objectives and associated research ques tions are: 1. Delineate the current utilisation of CAM in Austral ia. a. What is the total prevalence of use of CAM (practit ioner visits and products)? b. What are the relative popularities of different for ms of CAM? c. What is the prevalence and frequency of CAM practit ioner visits? d. Are there regional (state) differences in CAM use i n Australia? e. How is the public demand for CAM changing? 2. Estimate the expenditure associated with CAM produc ts/services in Australia and assess the socio-economic characteristics of CAM users. a. What is the out-of-pocket expenditure? b. What are economic consequences and drivers for CAM use? 3. Explore the rationale for CAM use by consumers and their general concerns. a. Are there differences in the forms of CAM used rela ted to age, gender, national region or other socio-demographic characteristics? b. What specific benefits and risks are perceived by t he users of common forms of CAM? 10 c. What benefits and risks do users of common forms of CAM consider they have actually received? d. What proportion of CAM users voluntarily discusses their use of CAM with their medical doctors? And what are the main reasons for non-disclosure of use? 4. Evaluate the extent, demand for and consequences of health insurance cover for CAM products/therapies. a. What is the extent of health insurance coverage on CAM? b. What proportion of users receives health insurance rebates for CAM? c. What is the public demand for insurance coverage on CAM? d. Does the availability of insurance cover affect the demand and utilisation of CAM? 5. Explore attitudes towards statutory CAM regulation. a. Does statutory regulation have an impact on the dem and/use of specific forms of CAM? 6. How do the survey results compare with those of oth er national and international studies? 11 1.4 Significance of the Study The use of CAM therapies by Australians has increas ed markedly over the last two to three decades and it seems certain that this trend will c ontinue. Given this situation, the present study was intended to address a broad range of issu es concerning the use of CAM in Australia that have not been answered conclusively by previou s studies. This study has created a national, population-based epidemiological profile of CAM use by the Australian adult population, including an investigation of differenc es between individual states and territories. Specifically, the study has provided reliable and c omprehensive information on the prevalence of use of individual forms of CAM, rationales for u sing CAM and the perceptions of users of the risks and benefits of CAM therapies. The findings also provide insights into the attitud es of CAM users and non-users of the provision of health insurance cover for CAM therapi es and how the availability of insurance cover may influence the use of CAM products and ser vices. A fuller understanding of such issues is essential for determining the need for, a nd the nature of initiatives by governments and health-care agencies to enhance public safety a nd confidence in CAM therapies. Such considerations should include adequate regulatory c ontrols on CAM products and CAM practitioners, training of health-care professional s (CAM and conventional health-care providers), public education, and health services p lanning (including health economics). The study outcomes will also assist in defining additio nal research needs, ranging from socio- economic to scientific/clinical research related to safety and efficacy of CAM therapies. The risks associated with the use of CAM are of gro wing concern. Therefore, important objectives of the proposed study were to investigat e the level of understanding by users of the 12 potential for adverse effects of individual forms o f CAM, the incidence and nature of adverse effects and, critically, the effectiveness of commu nication between patients and health-care practitioners. Thus, the study has provided informa tion on the levels of awareness of health- care professionals of their patients' use of CAM an d the extent to which CAM users understand the risks and benefits of CAM. The outco mes reinforce the need for health-care professionals to be aware of their patients' therap eutic choices and the need for them to advise their patients about the appropriate and safe use o f CAM. The information collected in the study on the demog raphic characteristics of CAM users, on their rationales for deciding to use CAM, on the sp ecific health conditions for which common forms of CAM are being used will provide a much-nee ded population data-set for health care researchers (for future population studies and basi c and clinical research) and help identify priorities for further research on the use of CAM, including laboratory and clinical research on the efficacy and safety of CAM therapies. This is c onsistent with the recommendations of the Federal Government's Review of Complementary Therap ies in the Australian Health-care System. 26 In addition, the data collected will also guide go vernment agencies in the development of further regulatory controls for CAM and provide consumers with relevant and timely advice on CAM use. The findings will also gu ide educational institutions concerned with both the training of conventional health-care practitioners and CAM practitioners in respect of designing curricula which recognise the broad range of therapies being used by the population. 13 1.5 Organisation of the Thesis This thesis comprises eight chapters. Chapter 1 pro vides a brief overview of the background, rationale, objectives and details the specific rese arch questions addressed by the study, as well as the significance of the study. Chapter 2 compris es three systematic reviews of CAM utilisation literature. The first review is concern ed with global utilisation of CAM, the second summarises specifically CAM use among the general A ustralian population and by individuals with various diseases/conditions, and the third rev iew exclusively covers Chinese medicine utilisation. Chapter 3 discusses methodological issues associate d with conducting a CAM population study in Australia. This chapter also addresses the approaches adopted to achieve a representative study population sample, the data co llection process (computer-assisted telephone interviews), and the challenges of addres sing commonly encountered problems, such as the definition and classification of CAM mo dalities. The results and discussions of the national CAM pop ulation survey are divided into four sections: Chapter 4 presents a national profile of CAM utilisation in Australia through a multivariate analysis of the survey data. It examin es CAM utilisation as a whole, including its prevalence of use and, prevalence and frequency of visiting CAM practitioners. Chapter 5 presents detailed analyses of the regiona l differences in CAM use in Australia. Chapter 6 presents the findings on the four CAM mod alities that are currently regulated in Australia, at either national or state level, that is, acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy. Specific data related to these therapies such as expectations of the 14 users, actual outcomes, and adverse events related to their use were sought from survey participants. Chapter 7 presented additional results arising from the CAM survey including the expenditure on CAM, the rationales for CAM use, concurrent use of both CAM and Western medicine, and other matters such as, health insurance coverag e and regulatory issues. The general discussion, conclusions, policy implications, limit ations of the study and some possible solutions are included in Chapters 8. 15 CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1 Definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicin e (CAM) There have been many debates surrounding a single d efinition of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), but none have been conc lusive. 27 Considering the diversity of CAM modalities, the definitions of CAM in the curre nt literature are inconsistent, and vary significantly in different social contexts. The term \"complementary and alternative medicine\" a nd its short form, \"CAM\", are terms most commonly used in the literature. \"Complementar y\" generally mean that such medicine (including therapies and products) is being used in addition to conventional Western medicine. \"Alternative\" implies it is being used in dependently. Other terms are widespread, and are used interchangeably, to describe CAM. 28 They include: traditional, oriental, holistic, unconventional, non-conventional, unorthodox, essen tial and unproven medicine. One of the major biologically based CAM therapies, \"megavitamins\", sometimes referred to dietary supplements is somewhat vaguely defined. A national CAM study in the US 3 referred to these dietary supplements as vitamins not prescr ibed by a medical doctor. The US National Health Interview Survey 1 referred to these as vitamins used in excess of th e recommended daily allowances (RDA) established by the National Academy of Sciences, Food and Nutrition Board. 16 Although the various definitions of CAM are debatab le, after carefully examining the literature it is apparent that most of these defini tions are made in relation to conventional (Western) medicine. This viewpoint is supported in a recent editorial published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine .29 In a US landmark study on CAM utilisation in 1990, the research team referred to CAM as \"interventions neither taught widely in medical sch ools nor generally available in US hospitals\". 2 At the same time, in an attempt to clarify the iss ue, the British Medical Association came up with the following:30 \"Both alternative and complementary types of medici ne are described by the term \"non- conventional\". This is not an exclusionary term and illustrates the level of acceptance of these methods by the medical community. Complementary med icine is defined as those techniques which are used while the patient is using conventio nal ones. These include methods such as chiropractic and osteopathy. Alternative medicine i ncludes techniques which are used to the exclusion of conventional medicine. These methods h ave been specified as incompatible with conventional practice (i.e. certain types of herbal remedies).\" In 1995, in a letter 27 sent to the British Journal of General Practice , Ernst and his colleagues commented that: \"Complementary medicine is diagnosi s, treatment and/or prevention which complements mainstream medicine by contributing to a common whole, by satisfying a demand not met by orthodoxy or by diversifying the conceptual frameworks of medicine\". They further commented that an inclusive, positive approach, not defining what complementary medicine does not represent but what it actually means, would clearly be more constructive. 17 More recently, the definition of CAM appears to ref er to a broad range of therapies and products. A document produced by the World Health O rganisation (WHO) 31 refers to CAM as \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\". S imilarly, the National Center for CAM (US) defined CAM as \"a group of diverse health-care and medical practices and products that are not presently considered to be an integral part of conventional medicine\". 32 Perhaps a more encompassing definition of CAM was provided by the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) expert panel at the Conference on CAM Researc h Methodology in Bethesda, MD, in April 1995:33 \"A broad domain of healing recourses that encompass es all health systems, modalities, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant he alth systems of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promotin g health and well-being. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and the domain of th e dominant system are not always sharp or fixed\". 18 2.2 Classification of CAM Modalities No conclusive definition of CAM has been advanced. Debates continue in an attempt to classify CAM; 29 so do discussions on the CAM therapies that should be included to produce the overall CAM prevalence in various societies. 33 Most notably, there were critics of the abovementioned US landmark CAM survey in 1990. 2 Rosner 34 argued for the inclusion of chiropractic as an alternative or complementary the rapy to conventional medicine, as it has been largely accepted by the general public as a fo rm of effective health care. Similarly, Fridman et al .35 argued for the inclusion of relaxation techniques as a single form of CAM. Both views were published in the \" New England Journal of Medicine \", in the issue following publication of the 1990 CAM survey. 2 Some so-called CAM modalities, such as Chinese medi cine in China and ayurvedic medicine in India, have been used for thousands of years as medical systems in different countries. Some forms of CAM, such as osteopathy, homeopathy, and chiropractic, originated from, and to various extents have been incorporated into West ern medical systems. However, some CAM may be considered outside the boundaries of cur rent, well-established Western medical theory. An example is folk medicine which the medic al community has rejected in the past, due to the lack of scientific evidence that meets m ainstream medical standards. But to the extent that such therapies are better researched an d produce convincing scientific evidence, they may become gradually accepted. Excessively large numbers of modalities fall under the umbrella of the term CAM. Given the growing popularity of CAM use, the NCCAM 36 divided these into five major domains. Table 2.1 is a synthesis of these classifications. 19 Table 2.1 CAM modalities classified in the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) Classifications CAM therapies (NCCAM samples) Alternative medical systems Homeopathic medicine Naturopathic medicine Traditional Chinese medicine Ayurvedic medicine Mind-body interventions Meditation, prayer, mental healing, and therapies t hat use creative outlets such as art, music, or dance Biologically based therapies Dietary supplements: vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances, such as enzymes, organ tissues, and metabolites Manipulative and body-based methods Chiropractic Osteopathic Massage Energy therapies Qigong, reiki, therapeutic touch, pulsed fields, magnetic fields Differences in the comprehensiveness of CAM modalit ies can be observed by making comparisons between two recent studies conducted in the US and Australia. 1,11 The South Australian health survey11 employed a prompt card in a face-to-face interview and asked participants whether they had used any one of seven forms of CAM or \"other CAM\". The 2002 US National Health Interview Survey 1 included questions on 27 types of CAM therapies, which had been considered to be commonly used in the US. Comparisons between an investigation of popular forms of CAM only, and a relatively comprehensive classification of CAM deserves further deliberation. Most surveys on CAM prevalence used a questionnaire with a list of common therapies. The list has been adapted from previous studies and/or aimed to reflect the diverse cultures or make up of the population being studied. However, t he current thesis does not provide 20 judgement on how many on which CAM modalities compr ise the definitive spectrum. In order to make comparisons with the existing classificatio ns of CAM in Australian, a systematic search on published studies on CAM usage in Austral ia was conducted. A total of five studies 9-11,37,38 were identified as Australian regional surveys bas ed on random or representative samples. The detailed methodologi es and CAM modalities in these studies are summarised in Table 2.2. The CAM modalities use d in these surveys, not surprisingly, varied considerably, and even changed over time in studies. 9-11 Nevertheless, this methodology comparison provided the essential data of CAM usage in the Australian context, and formed the basis of the list of CAM therapies u sed in the present study. Internationally, two systemic reviews on CAM utilisation in differen t countries that based on representative populations were referred,18,19 and a number of questionnaires that used in CAM ut ilisation surveys worldwide were consulted. 21 Table 2.2 CAM modalities and data collection method in Australian regional surveys Author (year) Place of study (year) Sample (n) Data collection method Forms of CAM included in studies MacLennan et al.

In 2001, there were at least nine s urvey studies on the use of CAM among the general population of the US. 39 In Australia, CAM use among the general population has been investigated in sequential health surveys in the st ates of South Australia, 9-11 and New South Wales. 37,38 To design the current study, it was essential to co nduct a systematic review of the relevant literature. Presented in this chapter are three sys tematic reviews covering the following topics: 1) CAM use in the general population around the wor ld (mainly Western English-speaking countries, due to the limitation of getting publish ed English literature in some countries); 2) CAM used specifically in Australia. This includes C AM use among the general population and in defined populations, such as cancer patients and adolescents; 3) a purposely-designed systematic review of Chinese medicine. This is cons idered important because of the extraordinary popularity of Chinese medicine use ar ound the world, and the instigation of Chinese medicine statutory regulation in some state s in Australia. All identified studies are presented in corresponding tables in this chapter b ut may not be fully discussed. 23 2.3.2 CAM Utilisation Worldwide: A Systematic Review This review aimed to systematically evaluate findin gs from published surveys on the uses of CAM by the general population. The secondary aim wa s to determine the methodological quality of these CAM surveys, to identify the metho dological strengths and weaknesses to inform the design of the present national populatio n-based CAM survey. 2.3.2.1 Methodology The identification of literature in the CAM field i s challenging. Establishing the prevalence and utilisation of CAM is complicated and time-cons uming, given that there is often no simple means of identifying such publications. Some databases (e.g. MEDLINE) have developed literature filters for different types of publications, such as clinical trials and reviews. Such a filter for epidemiological studies is currently not available. Optimal retrieval of reports in biomedicine literature depends on the appropriate use of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), descriptors and keywords among aut hors and indexers. 40 A comprehensive list of key terminologies for the s earch strategy in MEDLINE was initially developed. Modified strategies were then used in ot her databases. Major MeSHs for CAM Traditional\" \"Medicine, Traditional\". The search was used in conjuncti on with the keyword search. A systematic search of the literature was conducted o n the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid platform), EMBASE and CINAHL, covering all ye ars since their inception up to September 2005. The search strategy for MEDLINE is presented in Table 2.3. 24 Table 2.3 Search strategy to identify CAM utilisati on studies in MEDLINE 1. exp Complementary Therapies/ Alternative exp Plants, Medicinal/ 7. exp Medicine, Herbal/ 8.

T o qualify for inclusion, papers had to use specific survey methods, either questionnaires or i nterviews, to collect information relating to CAM use, and also meet one of the following criteri a: 1. The study must have been based on a random or repre sentative sample of a national general population. 2. The study must have been based on a random or repre sentative sample of a general population for a defined regional area AND such a n ational study was not available. Articles were excluded if one of the following crit eria applied: 1. The study was an utilisation study on CAM use by a subpopulation, such as a cohort of patients with particular conditions (cancer, diabet es etc.) or a specific group of people (e.g. older people or adolescents). 2. The study investigated a single form of CAM (e.g. c hiropractic), rather than CAM as a whole. 3. The report did not describe the study methods, e.g. a review or a general article that did not mention how the data of CAM prevalence were col lected, or a report on studies described elsewhere. 4. The full publication was not written in English. 5. It was not published in an academic journal or a fo rmal report document (where a copy of the report was not supplied elsewhere). In addition to the literature search across major d atabases, the references of all relevant papers were examined to identify further literature. This approach has been found particularly useful in identifying studies that are not included in the electronic databases. All identified 26 publications were read in full, and data were extra cted for their substantive information on the target population, study design, CAM modalities, pr evalence of CAM use and other significant findings. In order to access the most recent literature, new article-alert functions, available from the MEDLINE and EMBASE (through Science Direct) were ac tivated in May 2004. These enable researchers to save search terms with databases whe n the searches are automatically performed over a defined period. Weekly searches we re performed and article alters were produced continually. Literature reviews in this th esis include articles retrieved up to March 2006. 27 2.3.2.2 Results The initial search identified over 1,200 articles. After reading titles and abstracts, a large proportion of the articles was excluded because the y covered matters other than utilisation or prevalence (e.g. CAM regulation, integration approa ch and clinical trials) or duplicated other publications. The remaining 307 articles that prese nted data on CAM use were read in full. Of these, 290 articles were then excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (see Chapter 2.3.2.1), for example, regional studies and studies on patients or health professionals. Two articles were identified by citation tracking o f eligible articles. 15,41 Two additional articles were obtained in November 2005 42 and January 2006 11 when being notified by new- article alerts. Thus a total of 21 studies are incl uded in the current review. 1-7,9-11,15-17,41-48 The key data of included articles are summarised in Tab le 2.4. The use of CAM in the general population was system atically reviewed by both Ernst 18 and Harris et al .19 in 2000. In 2001, Wootton and her colleagues also conducted a review of CAM use among the US population. 39 An overview of these three reviews and the current review are presented in Table 2.5. The majority of studies tha t were selected in the three reviews are also included in the current review. Reasons for exclusi on are presented in Table 2.5.49-58 As mentioned earlier, there have been many CAM utilisa tion studies in the past decade. 12 studies conducted after the publication of the thre e reviews mentioned above were identified and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 1,4-7,10,11,16,17,42,43,48 28 Table 2.4 Results of CAM utilisation studies in the general population Author (year) Place of study (year) Sample (n) Data collection method (response rate, %) General findings* Eisenberg et al.

These 21 studies investigated CAM use by a total of 227,086 people i n seven countries: eight studies were conducted in the US (and included a total of 87,492 participants), 1-4,15,41,46,47 four studies in the UK 5,16,17,44 (8,684 participants); three studies in Canada 6,45,48 (33,276 participants) and three studies in Australia 9-11 (9,046 participants); the remaining three studies were in Denmark 42 (16,690 participants), Italy 43 (70,898 participants) and Japan 7 (1,000 participants). The median sample size for all the studies was 3,01 5. However, the median sample size decreases to 1,500 when health surveys not specific ally for CAM are excluded. Over half (13 in total) of the studies were conduct ed as a supplement to a national health survey. In most studies, data were collected throug h postal questionnaires (two studies in the UK and one in the US), telephone interviews (seven studies), or face-to-face interviews (11 studies). In general, the sample selection methods used to ensure proper representation of the study populations were rigorous. The majority (90%) of the studies targeted the adult populations, defined in different countries as 15+, 16+, 18+, or 20+. The Italian study, 43 with a maximum sample size of 70,898, included all childre n and adults. A recent Australian study 11 also asked questions about CAM use by children (thr ough their households' adult participants). In general, the populations represen ted in these studies are considered to be appropriately specified. The overall response rates range from 23% to 88.9%. However, the two highest response rates were obtained from sub-s ample interviews with previous national surveys. When these are excluded, the response rate s ranged from 23% to 75%, with a mean of 63%. Four studies did not provide a response rat e. 33 Results of CAM Utilisation Studies The majority of studies (16 in total) employed a li st of CAM to estimate overall prevalence. The types of CAM modalities ranged from four 15 to 27 forms.1 Similarly, in the UK, the number of CAM investigated were six, eight and 23 i n 1993, 1998 and 2001, respectively. 5,16,44 Thus, the prevalence presented in Figure 2.1 does not taken account of the comprehensiveness or totality of CAM, and should be interpreted with caution. The overall prevalence of CAM varied between 8.5% i n the UK in 1993 44 and 72% in Japan in 2001. 7 Well over one in three Americans used CAM, 3 and one in two Canadians and Australians were CAM users in the year preceding th e relevant studies.6 Figure 2.1 suggests that the use of CAM, as well as the prevalence of v isits to CAM practitioners, has been increasing over the past 15 years. In particular, m arked increases were observed in sequential studies in the US (33.8% in 1990 2 to 42.1% in 1997 3), and UK studies by Thomas et al . showed an increase from 8.5% in 1993 44 to 28.3% in 1998. 5 However, only six forms of CAM were investigated in the 1993 UK study, 44 and the authors considered this to be a pilot stud y aimed at testing the feasibility of the methodologi es employed. The prevalence of visits to CAM practitioners was a lso reported in the US, UK, Canada and Australia. The lowest prevalence was reported in a 1996 US study (8.3%), 47 and the highest prevalence appeared in a 2004 Australian study (26. 5%). 11 Overall prevalence on both CAM use and visits to CAM practitioners was commonly es timated over a one-year period (preceding to the survey), except the 1999 Italian study, 43 which obtained prevalence over a two-year period, and a Danish study in 2000, 42 which were based on a 14-day prevalence. 34 Data on total costs and out-of-pocket expenditure h ave also been extracted from these studies, where available. The substantial costs drew conside rable comment in some studies. For example, CAM expenditure in the US increased by 45% , reaching US$ 21 billion in 1997. 3 Moreover, from 1993 to 2000, the overall CAM costs in Australia had more than doubled to A$2.3 billion; and in 2000, Australians paid out-of -pocket four times more for CAM than their contributions for all pharmaceuticals. 10 In Canada, out-of-pocket expenditure was about $3.8 billion Canadian dollar in US 96 US 97A US 97B US 98 US 99 US 02 UK 93 UK 98 UK 99 UK 01 CAN 95 CAN 97 CAN 99 AUS 93 AUS 00 AUS 04 ITA 99 DEN 00 JAP 01 Figure 2.1 Prevalence of CAM use in seven countries Note: Years were at the time of conducting studies, which are different from the dates of publication US: (Paramore et al. 15 ); US96 (Druss et al .47 ); US97B (Landmark report 41 ); US98 (Astin 46 ); US99; UK01 (Thomas et .17 ); et al .43 ); DEN00 (Nielsen et al .42 ); JAP01 (Yamashita et al .7). 36 2.3.2.3 Discussion It is apparent that there are considerable uncertai nties about the true prevalence of CAM among the general populations of countries. Uncerta inties are even observed within countries. As discussed earlier, many of these uncertainties a rise because of the complex problem of defining CAM and the modalities it includes. Nevert heless, when specific CAM questions were designed as part of a national health survey, it is likely that professional social scientists and statisticians were employed for the development of instruments and for data analyses. Most studies provided estimates on the prevalence o f use of individual forms of CAM, except for a 2000 Denmark study 42 and a 1999 Canadian study. 48 Two therapies (acupuncture and chiropractic) were included in all studies and, per haps, are the most frequently reported CAM modalities, together with massage, herbal medicine and multivitamins. The inclusion or exclusion of these individual therapies can potenti ally impact heavily on estimation of the overall prevalence of CAM. 19 To avoid confusing survey participants it is also necessary that each specific CAM modality be defined. The use of a show-card in a face-to-face personal interview or the provision of a detailed list of al l forms of CAM in a telephone interview or postal questionnaire would gather a more precise me asurement on prevalence. In contrast, asking participants to voluntarily provide all the names of CAM they have used would be less likely to be comprehensive. Two published reviews provided additional important information on CAM use in some other countries. 59,60 For example, CAM prevalence data for a number of E uropean countries, such as Germany and Austria. 18 However, many of the papers cited were published i n the local language, rather than English and therefore are not included in the current review. In one of the reviews, Fisher and Ward 60 summarised such European CAM utilisation data and 37 concluded that a high percentage of the general pub lic in Belgium (31%), France (49%), Germany (46%), the Netherlands (20%), Denmark (23.2 %), and Sweden (25%) were CAM users. However, it should be noted that these figur es are somewhat higher than those given in Figure 2.1. Since the pioneer research on CAM use published by the Harvard research group in 1993, 3 the US has been leading the way in investigating CAM ut ilisation among the general public. More recently, employing the most rigorous data collecti on methods (i.e. computer-assisted personal interviews with representative residents), a number of studies were conducted as part of the US National Health Surveys. 1,4 On the other hand, Australia is one of a few count ries that has investigated CAM use in sequential surveys. 9-11 Yet, these were conducted at a state level, so a full picture of Australia's nationwide utilisation was not available. Thus, the current literature review includes CAM utilisation studies only at a n ational level, with the exception of Australian regional studies. Additional common outcome measurements of these rev iewed articles are the characteristics of CAM users, concurrent use of CAM and conventiona l medicine, attitudes towards such use and communication between patients, CAM practitione rs and Western medicine practitioners. Substantial findings on these matters were also col lected and are discussed in the relevant chapters in this thesis, in comparison with the res ults of the recently completed CAM Australia national study in 2005. In all, the most critical problem in producing the true prevalence of the study population is a clear defin ition of CAM, specifically, the classification of CAM modalities. Further high quality research is needed, preferably replicated studies supplementary to a national health survey. 38 2.3.3 CAM Utilisation in Australia: A Systematic Review This review aimed to systematically examine the cur rent status of use CAM in Australia, in particular, the profile of CAM use among the genera l population, among specific patients groups and among the health professionals. 2.3.3.1 Methodology When identifying worldwide CAM utilisation studies, particular attention was paid to Australian literature. A modified version of the se arch strategy (see Table 2.3) was used to identify CAM utilisation studies that had been cond ucted in Australia with additional search limitations (Table 2.6). The two approaches are not mutually exclusive when identifying literature on CAM surveys. It was expected that the search limitation on \"Australian studies only\" did not capture all Australian studies. The f inal search and reference selection process took place in December 2005. Table 2.6 Additional search strategy to identify Au stralian CAM utilisation studies 1. exp Australia/ Capital Territory/ 9. exp Tasmania/ 10.

Most of the previously mentioned inclusion and exclusion criter ia (see Chapter 2.3.2.1) are applied to identify Australian studies, except that studies on CAM use on a subpopulation (e. g. cancer patients and the older population) are included in the Australian literature review. Studies on the general population and specific populations are presented separately. 2.3.3.2 Results The initial search identified over 500 articles. Af ter reading titles and abstracts (to clarify whether the study was conducted in Australia), a to tal of 122 articles were included for further examination and were read in full. These articles w ere then sorted in four categories to facilitate the article selection process: 1) CAM us e in a general population; 2) CAM use in a defined population; 3) CAM used by other population s, such as health professionals, and 4) articles requiring further clarification, for which opinion from an independent researcher was sought. In addition, a study conducted in Western A ustralia 61 and another in Melbourne 62 were also identified. These studies 61,62 also reported data on the use of CAM in the genera l population. However, data from both studies were co llected from in-street participants; such a convenience sampling method did not satisfy the inc lusion criteria for the current review. Six articles were identified by citation tracking o f relevant articles. One additional article was obtained in 2006 when notified by a new-article ale rt. Thus, a total of 38 studies were included in the current review. These included five studies on CAM use by the Australian general population, 9-11,37,38 seven studies on cancer patients, 63-69 eight studies on children and women (including patients), 70-77 12 studies on people with other diseases other tha n cancer, 78- 89 and six articles on other (non-clinical) populatio ns. 90-95 The key data of included articles are summarised in Table 2.7 to Table 2.11 40 Study Design and Methods The 38 Australian studies represented CAM use by a subtotal of 9,991 of the general population, 2,572 cancer patients, 386 children pat ients, 54,708 women and women patients, 1,841 other patients (exclude Parslow's study; see Table 2.10 for the reason) and 2,729 other defined populations, in five states and one territo ry. Six studies were conducted on a nationwide basis (and included a total of 56,691 pa rticipants), 12 studies in New South Wales (NSW); eight in South Australia (SA); six in Victor ia (VIC); three in Queensland (QLD), two in Western Australia (WA) and one in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). In terms of the data collection methods, the majori ty of these studies (25 in total) used traditional questionnaires (13 by mail, two complet ed by patients in the clinic waiting room and 10 completed by clinic patients in their own ti me). Eleven studies introduced face-to-face interviews (including one using a hand-held compute r). Two studies employed telephone interviews. The use of CAM by General Practitioners (GP) was investigated by analysing Health Insurance Commission data (Medicare). The qualities of sample selection methods varied. S tudies on the general population targeted randomly selected samples, while studies on clinica l or defined populations mainly recruited subjects through convenience sampling (e.g. patient s attending clinics, and routine records/questionnaires for hospital inpatients). Qu estionnaires were also completed by GPs and nurses on their personal use of CAM and also on the CAM used for their patients. Nearly half (44%) the studies on a defined population did not state the ages of their subjects. This may be partially explained by the fact that no age limitation was applied when recruiting patients, particularly cancer patients. The sample size of the majority of the studies on defined 41 populations was less than 1,000, with the exception of two studies on women. The latter were supplemental analyses of large-scale national longi tudinal studies. It is not surprising that studies on clinical popul ations tended to achieve a higher response rate than studies on a non-clinical population. This is evidenced by the fact that response rates of four patient-based studies were higher than 90%. Th irteen studies, however, did not state their response rates. Results of CAM Use among the General Population As expected, the major results found in this catego ry were Omnibus Health Surveys in a specific state of Australia. 9-11 Through extrapolation, these have been frequently quoted to represent the use of, and expenditure on, CAM in Au stralia. Two systematic reviews 18,19 on CAM utilisation studies considered the methodology employed in the first 1993 survey 9 to be rigorous. However, the CAM categories used in this survey was somewhat questionable.18 Such problem has also been observed in two more rec ent surveys.10,11 Two regional studies in New South Wales were identi fied, with higher prevalence being reported than in the previous South Australian stud ies (Table 2.7). Kermode's New South Wales study in 1995 38 was based on nutritional products, including 24 vi tamin and other supplements, herbal medicine, and homoeopathic medi cine (see Table 2.2). Many of these items are not universally considered as CAM. It is also worth noting that the Wilkinson's study 37 was conducted in a rural community in New South Wa les. An extraordinarily high prevalence of chiropractic (55.3% of the population had visited chiropractors at least once) was reported in this community. It is by far the hi ghest prevalence of chiropractor visits documented in the international literature. 42 Common results from the three South Australian 9-11 and two New South Wales studies 37,38 suggested that the use of CAM by the Australian gen eral public is not less than 50%, and approximately one in four people have visited a CAM practitioner in a 12-month period. Wilkinson et al . reported the highest prevalence of both CAM use ( 70.3%) and CAM practitioner visits (62.7%). 37 The CAM use was specifically over a 12-month perio d; however, the period is unclear for CAM practitioner visits. A high prevalence in the use of herbal medicine and multivitamins was most commonly report ed. In a recently published study, 11 the South Australian-based research team reported that 39.2% used vitamins, and an additional 13.6% used mineral supplements (excluding calcium, iron or vitamins prescribed by a medical doctor). For provider-based therapy, visits to chir opractors and massage therapists represented the majority of visits. 11 43 Table 2.7 CAM use among the Australian general popu lation Author (year) Place of study (year) Sample (n) Data collection method (response rate, %) General findings* MacLennan et al.

Key results include two most popular forms of CAM and the highest prevalence of visits to CAM practitioner. Adults: 18 years of age or older 44 General Findings of CAM Use by Children and Women P atients CAM usage in children and women patients is another area in which the prevalence has frequently been investigated. Previous systematic r eviews have concluded that there is a generally high and possibly increasing prevalence o f CAM use among paediatric populations. 96 A number of national surveys have also consistentl y found that women are more likely to use CAM than men. 39 A total of ten studies were identified. Eight were on children and women with a medical condition other t han cancer (Figure 2.2 and Table 2.8), two were on paediatric and women cancer patients 68,69 (Table 2.9). A considerably high prevalence of CAM was also foun d in Australian studies of children and women patients (Figure 2.2). The only study estimat es CAM use at the time of study found a high prevalence of 35.9% among gastroenterology out patient children. 71 Three studies were concerned with the lifetime use of CAM, that is, us e of CAM at least once previously. Over half (51.7%) of asthmatic children in Sydney 73 and approximately half (46%) of South Australian children with cancer had previously used CAM. 68 A lower lifetime-use rate (33%) was reported among non-surgical hospital inpatient children in Victoria. 72 However, the above findings may need to be interpreted with extreme ca ution, as the sample size for all the studies was rather small (median sample size=106), and the measurement of lifetime use may have a higher chance of introducing great recall bias. Female patients in Australia appeared to favour CAM products the most. A study by Gollschewski on 886 randomly selected menopausal wo men in Queensland found that over 82.5% had previously used CAM. 76 Importantly, and a safety concern, over 73% women used CAM products during pregnancy, according to an Adel aide-based study in 2000. 70 In this study, the most frequently used products were herba l medicine (56%) and aromatherapy oils 45 (40%). Specifically, chamomile, a form of herbal pr oduct, and lavender aromatherapy oil were most favoured among pregnant women. CAM prevalence among healthy women was revealed in two large-scale national surveys. A 1996 study on 41,817 women aged 18-23, 45-50 and 70 -75 found that 26.3% had visited CAM practitioners within a 12-month period. Later, in 1998, a follow-up study on the same group of women aged 45-50 further revealed that ove r 29% had consulted CAM practitioners in the 12 months preceding children Antenatal ward inpatients Women (selected ages) Women attending clinics Menopausal women Women aged 45-50 CAM use Visited CAM practitioners Figure 2.2 Prevalence of CAM use by children and wo men (patients) in Australia * Lifetime use Used during current pregnancy Currently or recently used Used in the last 12 months 46 Table 2.8 CAM use by children and women (patients) in Australia Author (year) Place of study (year) Sample (n) Data collection method (response rate, %) General findings* Byrne et al .

With the exceptions of the 1999 women's health long itudinal study and a study reviewing Queensland Cancer Registry records, the remaining f ive studies recruited patients from hospitals and clinics. Such a convenience sampling method is not necessarily a problem for studies on clinical patients, provided they are rig orously designed. Data of CAM prevalence collected on cancer patient studies were varied. Most studies were interested in the use of CAM at any time in the pas t, rather than in its use over the preceding year. As shown in Figure 2.3, the prevalence of CAM use ranges from 12% by colorectal cancer patients 65 to 52% by a mixed group of cancer patients. 66 It is interesting to note that this highest prevalence was the only study that bas ed on the estimated prevalence after diagnosis of cancer. Two studies reported on the pr evalence of cancer sufferers seeking treatment from CAM practitioners. In one study on t hose with advanced cancer, 11% sought treatment from CAM practitioners, 64 and in another, 14.5% of female with cancer sought such treatment.69 Unfortunately, more than half the studies failed t o investigate individual forms of CAM and, importantly, no follow-up studies were con ducted to reveal the trend of CAM use by cancer patients over time. Two studies reported the costs related to CAM use. Begbie's 1996 study 63 estimated that the median annual cost was $530 per user, with a maximu m of $20,000 per annum per user. Two out of three (64.3%) users felt they were getting v alue for their money. Miller 66 also found that CAM users spent a substantial amount of money over $1,000, on items such as herbal medicine, high-dose vitamins and aromatherapy, afte r being diagnosed with cancer. For most therapies, patients would recommend them to others and would take the same therapy again. 48 Table 2.9 CAM use for cancer treatment in Australia Author (year) Place of study (year) Sample (n) Data collection method (response rate, %) General findings* Sawyer et al .

These represented CAM use by patients with eight different clinical conditions: HIV/AIDS, 80,84 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 78,82 osteoarthritis, 89 depression, 88 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 87 diabetes, 86 psychiatric problems, 85 cystic fibrosis, 83 and among patients who were attended to two clinic al settings: emergency department 79 and hospital. 81 Again, a few studies reported lifetime CAM use (i. e. studies on HIV/AIDS, COPD and depression patients). An overview of all prevalence data is presented in Figure 2.4. In seven studies, over 50% of those surveyed had pr eviously used CAM on at least one occasion. The highest such prevalence was observed in RA patients in Victoria in 1982 (82% used CAM after being diagnosed, and 52% were using it at the time of the study). 78 A high prevalence among RA patients was further confirmed in a more recent study in 1998. 82 Based on Melbourne RA patients this study found that 67.3 % of patients were CAM users. On the other hand, the lowest prevalence (2.9% had previou sly used CAM) was found in a 2001 study in Canberra and its enviroment.88 However, this prevalence refers to CAM use by thos e within a sample of the general population who suffe red from depression and/or anxiety, the number of such users being expressed as a percentag e of the entire sample. The true prevalence of CAM use by people with depressive or anxiety symptoms remains unclear. The 1997 and 1999 studies found a similar prevalenc e of CAM use by HIV/AIDS subjects (56% and 55%, respectively). 80,84 These findings can be considered highly reliable, as studies were based on large samples of HIV/AIDS subjects in Australia. The authors concluded that CAM use was not significantly related to HIV positi ve individuals having been diagnosed with AIDS ( p=0.06). 51 Table 2.10 CAM use for treatment of diseases other than cancer in Australia Author (year) Place of study (year) Sample (n) Data collection method (response rate, %) General findings* Kestin et al .

With t he global trend of increasing use and practice of alternative forms of medicine, CAM use by Wester n medical doctors is of particular interests. Studies were also carried out among othe r health professionals, such as nurses, midwives and university health sciences students (T able 2.11) The six studies identified were conducted in the states of New South Wales, Victori a, Western Australia, South Australia and nationwide by means of postal questionnaires and se lf-completed questionnaires. The majority of GPs had referred their patients to a number of common forms of CAM practitioners, such as acupuncturists and massage t herapists. Based on 488 randomly selected GPs in Victoria, Pirotta 91 found 93% of them had referred their patients at l east once to a CAM practitioner, and 82% had referred them at leas t a few times a year. A recent nationwide GP study 95 in Australia further revealed that 76% and 72% of GPs had referred their patients to acupuncturists or massage therapists, respective ly, at least once a month. The use of CAM by the GPs themselves was also commo n; 26% had used massage and 21% had used acupuncture. 95 A high prevalence of personal use was also reporte d among nurses (74% in the past 12 months) 93 and university nursing, pharmacy and biomedical sc iences students (78% in the past 12 months). 92 Among the individual forms of CAM that were found to be most popular were multivitamins and herbal me dicine, a trend similar to CAM use by the general population and clinical patients. Moreo ver, an extremely high prevalence of aromatherapy use was found among nurses (44.1%) and students (nursing students: 32.5%, pharmacy students: 34.5% and biomedical sciences st udents: 35.1%). 92 55 Table 2.11 CAM use in other populations in Australi a Author (year) Place of study (year) Sample (n) Data collection method (response rate, %) General findings* Hall et al .

Utilis ation studies on clinical conditions, in particular, cancer patients, children and women pat ients were the most popular. The methodological quality of the Australian studie s is varied. In general, there is a lack of a standard approach to collect data. As with CAM util isation studies outside Australia, the extent of CAM modalities included in the totality o f CAM prevalence is the key challenge for a comparable conclusion to be drawn. Despite these shortcomings, the prevalence of CAM u se in Australia, particularly aromatherapy, herbal medicine and natural products, is higher than in other Western countries, noticeably among cancer patients and those with oth er defined clinical conditions. It is important to note that in Australia common fo rms of CAM therapy are covered, to various levels by private health insurance funds. W hen conventional medicine cannot offer an effective cure for a disease, patients are turning to other CAM especially as more scientific evidence is becoming available for certain CAM ther apies. This is evidenced by the fact that over half (58%) of patients with colorectal cancer believed that a hospital should provide information about CAM, although they did not necess arily use it. 65 In general, there is a lack of detailed information on the forms of CAM being u sed by Australians, and the efficacy of these treatments for specific clinical conditions. In this respect, poor communication between patients and practitioners, 98 is of safety concern. 57 2.3.4 Chinese Medicine Utilisation Worldwide: A Systemati c Review This review aimed to systematically examine publish ed surveys on the use of Chinese medicine (CM) by the general population. Specific i nformation about CM was extracted from identified CAM surveys (see Chapter 2.3.2.2) that i ncluded CM as one of the CAM modalities. 2.3.4.1 Methodology Chinese medicine (CM) is classified as an alternati ve medical system by the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM).36 It includes not only the commonly known acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine and Chinese therapeutic massage but other modalities, such as Qigong and Chinese medici ne dietary therapy. Many Western countries, including Australia, have experienced tr emendous growth in the use of Chinese medicine, particularly acupuncture and some popular herbs, over the past decades. However, very few studies have focused exclusively on the to tality of all CM modalities. The use of CM as a defined health-care system has not been specif ically investigated. Thus, the current review was aimed to systematically extract CM data from surveys. For the purpose of this review, CM was categorised into five major domains: 1) acupuncture, electro-acupuncture and moxibustion; 2) Chinese her bal medicine; 3) Chinese therapeutic massage; 4) Qigong, Tai Chi and martial art; and 5) Chinese medicine dietary therapy. The database literature search looked for two types of studies: 1) those that explicitly stated the prevalence of any one form of CM or CM as a who le [Type I literature], and 2) those in which CM information was embedded in utilisation st udies on general CAM use among 58 random or representative samples of the general pop ulation [Type II literature]. The search strategy to identify Type I CM utilisation literatu re is illustrated below (Table 2.12). This was used in combination with the search strategy for ge neral CAM as presented in Table 2.3. Table 2.12 Search strategy to identify type I liter ature on Chinese medicine utilisation 1. exp Medicine, Chinese Traditional/ 2. exp Drugs, Chinese 3. Medicine, or An mo).tw. 25. exp Tai Ji/ 26.

To qualify for inclusion, papers had to use survey methods: either a questionnaire or interview to collect the information of CM use, and they had to meet one of the following selection criteria: 1. The study estimated explicitly the prevalence of CM as a whole or any one form of CM and, based on a random or representative sample of a national or regional general population or a clinical population. 2. The study was an utilisation study on CAM use among random or representative samples of a national population or a regional population, if such a national study was not available, and explicit data on the prevalence of CM as a whol e or any one form of CM was available in the CAM study. Papers were excluded if one of the following criter ia applied: 1. The study was an utilisation study on CAM use in a clinical population. 2. The study did not describe the study methods, e.g. a review, an article that did not mention how the data of CM prevalence were collected, or a report describing studies elsewhere. 3. The full publication was not written in English or Chinese. 4. The study was not published in an academic journal or a formal report document. 5. Data addressed forms of herbal medicine other than Chinese herbal medicine. Again, the references of all relevant papers were e xamined to identify further literature. Furthermore, the following publications, which are not available in electronic databases or partially admitted to electronic databases, were ha nd-searched: \" Journal of Complementary Medicine (Australia, 2002-2006)\"; \" Journal of Complementary and Integrative Medicine (2004-2006); \" Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine (1991-2005)\"; \" The Journal of Chinese Medicine (1991-2005)\"; \" Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine (2003-2005)\". A search was also conducted on one of the major Chine se literature databases (CQVIP 60 Information, a fee-paying database in China 99 ) and through Google Scholar, using the key words listed in Table 2.12 to screen for further li terature. Using the same data extraction protocol, all identified publications were read in full and searched for substantive information that specifically related to CM. 61 2.3.4.2 Results Methodological Quality and Study Design Twelve Type I articles (i.e. exclusively Chinese me dicine studies) met the criteria and were included in the review. Among these, five articles 51,100-103 were based on general populations and another seven 104-110 were based on defined populations. The key data of these 12 articles are summarized in Table 2.13 and Table 2.14. CM use among the general population was investigate d in Taiwan, 51,102 Hong Kong 101,103 and New York City's Chinatown. 100 Except for Chou's 1991 acupuncture study, all othe r studies investigated CM as a whole. 102 Similar to the data collection method for CAM stud ies on clinical patients or a defined population, CM resul ts for a defined population were also based on convenience-based participant recruitment (Table 2.14). The sample sizes for all studies were large (median size for 11 studies=1,145). Stud ies on the general population mainly comprised data collected through a structured inter view or telephone interview, while studies on a defined population were predominantly conducte d by paper-based questionnaire. A further 21 Type II literature (i.e. CAM studies w ith information on CM) met the criteria for this review (Table 2.15). The methodological qualit y of these studies has been discussed earlier. Individual forms of CM were available in a cupuncture, herbal medicine, moxibustion and massage. Data on the use of Qigong and Tai Chi was available only in a US CAM study, 1 while data on Chinese medicine dietary therapy and martial art were not available. 62 Table 2.13 Chinese medicine use in general populati ons Author (year) Place of study (year) Sample (n) Data collection method (response rate, %) General findings* Chan et al.

However, the sample size was rather small (87 participants) and the survey did not differentiate between visits for acupuncture, massage or other services. Studies in Hong Kong (HK) 101,103 and Taiwan 51 were based on data over 10-15 years ago, the repre sentation of the current status of CM use is not clear. The highest prevalence (48.9% had previously consul ted an herbalist) was reported in a Hong Kong territory-wide survey conducted by Wong et al . in 1990. 101 In contrast, a low prevalence of previous use of CM (13.5%) was reported in anoth er Hong Kong survey in 1995, 103 based on randomly selected household residents. Study sub jects for the latter survey were selected in the Kwun Tong district of Hong Kong, and females in the households were chosen to answer questions on behalf of all family members. Thus, th is 1995 survey included utilisation data from all age ranges and may influence the overall p revalence. A study in Taiwan employed an unusual data collecti on method. 51 Based on a four-week diary and a retrospective interview, the researcher found that nearly one in 10 people used CM as their major form of medical care. Moreover, a large -scale study on acupuncture conducted at the same time also found just over one tenth (12.4% ) of the Taiwanese population had ever received acupuncture treatment. 102 67 Prevalence of Chinese Medicine Use in Defined Popul ations Seven studies on CM use by patients, students or ot her defined populations were found (Table 2.14). These studies were conducted in the US, 105 Canada, 106 Singapore 109 and Hong Kong. 104,107,108,110 Similar to the findings on CM use by the general p opulation, CM prevalence in defined populations varied markedly. The first in-depth, large-scale survey of Chinese m edicine use in the US 105 found that 99% of the survey participants had previously received acu puncture. The use of Chinese herbal medicine and moxibusion by the study's participants was also substantial. However, the study was conducted in six selected clinics, including Ch inese medicine clinics. It is highly likely that study participants attended these clinics for the purpose of a specialised Chinese medicine service. Thus, the results of this study on CM use have highly to be much higher than its actual use by the general population (Table 2.14). A Canadian study by Wong et al .106 recruited patients who had visited medical practit ioners without Chinese medicine expertise. The prevalence of 28% of patients and their family members who had used Chinese herbal medicine in the past year was similar to a Singapore study 109 (25.3%) on elderly people aged 65 or older. The use of CM in Hong Kong, a specially administrat ed region of China, had been considered more popular than in most, if not all, Western coun tries. However, this was not clearly confirmed by four Hong Kong studies. 104,107,108,110 A relatively low prevalence was reported for secondary school students (8.6% consulted CM pr actitioners over a three-month period), 107 for people suffering from acute illness (14% lifet ime consulting rate), 104 and for chronic hepatitis B patients (16% at the time of th e survey). 110 68 Prevalence of Chinese Medicine Use (Extracted from CAM Studies) Acupuncture and herbal medicine are popular forms o f CAM in many countries. Although very few studies have been conducted to collect dat a exclusively on acupuncture and other forms of CM, promising data are available from well -designed CAM studies. Such relevant data were extracted and are discussed below. With a lack of specific studies on CM use in Western countries, the extracted data are of partic ular value. Of 21 identified CAM studies, three did not provide information on Chinese medicine in any form. Information on acupuncture was specifically i nvestigated in the majority of studies, however, limited information is available concernin g overall CM prevalence. Moreover, no studies included a classification of Chinese-style massage and herbal medicine. Prevalence data on acupressure and moxibusion have been occasi onally reported (Figure 2.5). Overall CM prevalence was determined in three Austr alian studies 9-11 and a UK study. 16 In Australia, the prevalence increased markedly from 1 993 to 2000, from 1.8% to 3.2%, but then deceased to 2.3% in 2004. The prevalence of visits to CM practitioners was estimated in a UK study. 16 It was estimated that 0.4% of the total population had consulted CM practitioners in a 12-month period but this excluded visits to acupunc turists, herbalists and massage practitioners. The prevalence of herbal medicine use in the US ran ged between 3.0% in 1990 2 and 17% in 1997. 3 Based on four studies between 1997 and 1999, the a verage prevalence of herbal medicine use was 10.8%. 3,4,41,46 A high prevalence of herbal medicine use was also reported by studies in the UK (19.8%), 5 Australia (20.6%) 11 and Japan (17.2%). 7 Similar to the prevalence of herbal medicine use, approximately on e in ten Americans used massage 69 therapy. 3,41 This prevalence was similar to that in Canada and Japan. However, a 1999 UK study suggested that only 1.2% of the population us ed massage. 17 For acupuncture, except for a higher rate (6.7%) reported in Japan, 7 most studies estimated the prevalence at less than 3%. In terms of practitioner visits, the prevalence of visits to acupuncturists, massage therapists and herbal medicine practitioners was reported in t he US, the UK and Australia (Figure 2.6). Although the use of acupuncture treatment was frequ ently reported, less than 3% of the populations was estimated to have visited such a pr actitioner in the previous 12 months, based on the utilisation studies in six countries (Figure 2.6). These studies also estimated that less than 2% had consulted herbal medicine practitioners . 00 AUS 04 Italy99 Japan01 Figure 2.5 Prevalence of Chinese medicine use in si x countries CM: Chinese medicine; HM: Herbal medicine Note: Years were at the time of conducting studies which are different from the dates of publication.

US90, US97A (Eisenberg et al . al al .9-11 ). 72 2.3.4.3 Discussion In the US, Chinese medicine (CM) is an integral par t of the growing field of CAM. 28 The results of studies drawn from the past three decade s also suggest that CM has been used by a large part of the population of several countries, and that it is one of the most popular forms of alternative treatment to deal with diseases and mai ntain general health. Based on the current review, the prevalence of CM use may not be conclus ive for most countries. In addition, in some countries, at least in China, CM utilisation, including public use and practices, may have been investigated and reported in some other forms, such as government reports. Although an eligible CM utilisation study has not b een identified in Mainland China in the current review, data on Chinese medicine services, including specialised Chinese medicine hospitals and clinics are widely available in China . An examination of data from the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, P. R. China (SATCM) 113 suggested that, in 2004, there were 3,716 Chinese medicine hospitals i n China, including hospitals where CM was integrated with Western medicine (WM) and hospi tals of national minority medicine. The SATCM also estimated that, in 2003, in China, natio nwide, there were more than 171,419 CM physicians and 30,934 assistant CM physicians. 113 As such, if rigorous utilisation study was designed to estimate the total prevalence of CM in China, substantial proportion of CM usage is highly to be estimated. When conducting the literature search for CM, a con siderable number of studies on general herbal medicine, rather than specific Chinese herba l medicine, were also identified. However, herbal medicine/products presented in such studies were mainly Western-type medicines (e.g. St. John's Wort, evening primrose and Echinacea). D etailed analyses of the extremely broad range of herbal medicine modalities are considered beyond the scope of the current thesis. 73 2.4 Summary of the Literature Review These three systematic reviews considered to provid e a comprehensive overview of current CAM utilisation in general populations around the w orld. CAM use in different regional and clinical populations in Australia, as well as the u se of all forms of Chinese medicine around the world, have been systematically summarised. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies included, data from these reviews should be interpr eted with caution, despite the fact that the reviews have been completed adhering to rigorous me thodology. Nevertheless, the researcher performed these tasks through an objective protocol : an explicit statement of the literature search strategy (see Table 2.3), a detailed inclusi on and exclusion criteria (see Chapter 2.3.2.1) and critically, a standardised, predefined data extraction form (see Table 2.4). As expressed in Chapters 2.1 and 2.2, it appeared t hat there was little capacity to compare international literature in CAM utilisation surveys due to the substantive differences in its definition and the totality of CAM modalities. As m ight be expected, similar obstacles were encountered in the current review, particularly wit h respect to the systemic comparison between countries/regions. Nevertheless, the import ant function of these reviews was to summarise the existing literature to assist the des ign of a population-based CAM survey in Australia. The methodological issues identified wer e discussed in details (see Chapter 8.2). Although there are considerable uncertainties about the true prevalence of overall CAM and CM use, the prevalence of most forms of CAM (e.g. h erbal medicine) in many countries was found to be increasing markedly. On the basis of th e data outlined for Australia, it is apparent that overall CAM prevalence is generally higher tha n in most other Western countries. Specifically, the highest prevalence of a single fo rm of CAM (aromatherapy) was found in Australia amongst the majority (if not all) Western countries. 10,11 This therapy, surprisingly, 74 was not included in previous US national health int erviews, 1,4 nor has it been reported as part of overall CAM prevalence in the US. 2,3 In 2005, the Kobe Centre for Health Development of the World Health Organisation (WHO) published a comprehensive global atlas of CAM use. 114 It was designed to record details of policy, regulation, education, research practices a nd use of CAM around the world. CAM use in six WHO regional areas was outlined. In the WHO African region, it has been suggested th at CAM, also known as African Traditional Medicine (ATRM) is still the only form of health care in some communities. 115 In addition, it has been estimated that more than 80% of Africans used ATRM, whereas only about 50% of the African population had regular acc ess to essential pharmaceuticals. 116 In the WHO region of the Americas, a review was con ducted across 35 member states/countries. Apart from the US and Canada (see Table 2.4), a CAM survey was only available for the Argentine Republic. 117 It revealed that more than half (54.4%) of the population of Argentina used CAM, among which homeo pathy (40%), herbal medicine (36.7%), chiropractic (21.4%), acupuncture (12.9%) and bath flowers (11.6%) were most popular. No consolidated data are available on utilisation a nd practices of CAM in South-East Asian region and the Eastern Mediterranean region, despit e the belief that various modalities of CAM are being used in this region. 118,119 Other than some general data on the use of Ayurved a and Unani in India, Bangladesh and Nepal; Thai ther apy in Thailand; and Jamu in Indonesia, other forms of CAM have rarely been investigated. 75 There is a wide range of CAM within the European re gion, particularly in Western European countries, such as Germany, Denmark and the UK. Mor e importantly, nearly all countries in this region have some form of government subsidisat ion of CAM. 120 Population surveys are available in the UK and Denmark to show that the tr end of CAM use by the general public is increasing over time (see Table 2.4). Perhaps, more comprehensive results are available i n the Western Pacific region. 121 Traditional Chinese medicine (including acupuncture , herbal medicines and massage therapy) is officially recognised in a number of countries, for example, China, Japan, Singapore and the Philippines. As mentioned in Chapter 2.3.4 (a syste matic review of the specific prevalence of Chinese medicine), information available for these countries is mainly on the profile of CAM services and practices, other than the use by the g eneral population. A profile of CAM usage in Australia was not included in the WHO report. In summary, as discussed in most published CAM surv eys, rigorous survey research is required to exclude the drawbacks of all aspects of CAM research, in particular the classification and definition. In addition, future research should focus on the use of listed, commonly used forms of CAM over a defined period, p referably the previous year. Other critical matters related to CAM use, are why people use CAM, and what are the perceived and actual benefits and risks of using CAM. Presented b elow is the methodology and results of a recently completed CAM national study in Australia, in which considerable efforts were made to answer the research questions and objectives acc ording to rigorous standards. 76 CHAPTER 3. METHODOLOGY 3.1 Foreword In general, a clear CAM definition, a reliable surv ey instrument, as well as rigorous sampling and data collection methods are vital in designing a reliable CAM survey. Based on the existing literature, with specific consideration to the Australian health-care context, the identified methodological concerns in conducting a national population CAM study in Australia are discussed below. Extensive consultations were conducted with experie nced CAM researchers, CAM academics and population health researchers to assist in the survey design. These consultations were extremely helpful in confirming the issues faced by researchers conducting CAM surveys. Data collected through computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) with randomly selected individuals using random-digit dialling (R DD) seem to be the most appropriate methods in the Australian context. Seventeen (17) f orms of CAM were included in the survey on the basis of a review of existing literature on CAM utilisation, in Australia and overseas. Since a comprehensive list of CAM modalities used b y the Australian population is not readily available, a pilot study was conducted. The initial draft of the survey instrument was developed from similar considerations. The detailed sampling methods, the process of devel oping an appropriate survey instrument, the data collection protocol, the quality assurance process and the data analyses approaches are presented in this chapter. 77 3.2 Sampling Methods 3.2.1 Sample Size In general, the sample size required to represent a population depends on the size of the population, the desired level of statistical signif icance and the acceptable level of margin of error. The Australian adult population at the time of conducting this study was approximately 15.3 million. 122 CAM prevalence estimation in South Australia in 20 00 was 52.1% 10 (confirmed in 2004 with 52.2% 11 ). With 95 percent confidence intervals of plus/min us 3%, it was determined that 1,067 interviews would be appro priate for the proposed study (Figure 3.1,calculated by Epi Info 6.0 package, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA). 123 Figure 3.1 Sample size calculation using Epi Info 6 .0 software package 78 The appropriate sample size can also be calculated through the modification of a common statistical formula: Because an estimated margin of error can be calcula ted as: e = np pz) 1 ( . 1 =1,067 Where p = Value used to represent the population pr oportion (prevalence of outcome measurement, when p=0.5 it maximises the required s ample size) e = Desired margin of error z = Critical value from the standard normal distri bution table n = Target population This calculation is based on the assumption that ra ndom samples will be drawn from an extremely large general population. In the current case, samples will be drawn from 15.3 million adult Australians, which can be considered as infinitely large in statistical terms. 79 3.2.2 Sample Selection Target Population The participants of the study were adults aged 18 y ears or older who were randomly selected from all states and territories around Australia. A s all interviews were conducted in English only, only participants who were fluent in English were recruited. In addition, household members who had physical or mental handicaps, and t hose had not given oral consent to interviewers were excluded. Stratified Household Sampling Frames This study was conducted concurrently in six states and two territories: New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, West Austral ia, Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory. Sample distributions were a llocated at state level (Table 3.1). The populations of Tasmania, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are rather small. Thus, although representative proportions of interviews were achieved for all states/territories, it was decided that state-level comparisons would only be done for New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Table 3.1 Allocation of study samples in accordance with state and territory populations State/Territory ABS (%) Targeted sample size (n) New South Wales 33.5 358 Victoria 24.9 266 Queensland 19.1 204 South Australia 7.8 83 Western Australia 9.8 104 Tasmania 2.4 25 Northern Territory 0.9 10 Australian Capital Territory 1.6 17 80 Quota Set with the Interviews In an effort to achieve a representative sample thr ough the random dialling process, using the 2004 ABS population data percentages on age and gen der, 124 interviews for each gender and each age range were then allocated (i.e. 18-24, 25- 34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 and 65+) (Table 3.2). The percentages of interviews in the various age groups for each gender in the current samples matched the Australian population data. Par ticipants were accepted in each defined category until the quotas were full. These protocol s were to ensure the random digit dialling process (see below) and stratified sampling frames were practical. However, the use of quotas limited the randomised selection process, and the n eed to overcome this possible limitation will be discussed in this chapter. Table 3.2 Gender and age quotas set in the study Male Female Age range ABS (%) Quota set in the study ABS (%) Quota set in the Participants within Households The methodology used to select participants within households was the \"next birthday\" technique to minimise volunteer bias. Only one part icipant was selected from each household. Once identified, the participant would not be subst ituted with another member of the household. 81 3.3 Development of Survey Instrument A definite CAM definition is not possible, yet CAM usually refers to therapies/products that purport to offer diagnostic and therapeutic alterna tives or to complement conventional medicine. Due to the complexity of CAM modalities, it was decided to include a list of therapies based on the previously discussed systema tic reviews of the literature (Chapter 2), which were commonly being used in Australia. To address the issue of a potential overlap of CAM modalities, and to provide an appropriate classification of CAM, with consideration of the Au stralian health-care context and previous CAM utilisation studies nationally and internationa lly, 1-5,9-11 17 forms of CAM were included in the main survey (Table 3.3) (Appendix A). In add ition, based on a previous study from our research group,62 it was decided to include the specific forms of Ch inese medicine: Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, Chinese therapeutic m assage, Chinese dietary therapy, Qigong, martial art and Tai Chi. This was done to ensure th at all major forms of Chinese medicine were covered by the survey, and to produce explicit utilisation information on Chinese medicine as a whole within a general CAM study. Thi s will allow comparison with previous Australian regional studies, 10,11 which collected CAM prevalence by using different terms of individual CAM modalities, for example, \"Chinese me dicine\" and \"herbal medicine\" were researched independently. In addition to the 17 selected forms of CAM, the co ntracted professional survey company suggested that a list of \"other CAM\" should be incl uded in the survey. This was to assist the interviewers when a participant indicated that they had used CAM other than, or in addition to any of the 17 selected forms of CAM. The list of \"o ther CAM\" modalities was available to interviewers through an auto-dropdown list on the c omputer interview screen (Table 3.4). 82 Table 3.3 NCCAM classifications of the 17 selected forms of CAM in the survey NCCAM Classifications* 17 CAM therapies Alternative medical systems 1.

Pilates) Shiatsu Other--specify 83 A questionnaire was developed to answer the researc h questions which were designed to be completed in an average of 15 minutes. The question naire was divided into six sections (Table 3.5) and contained some 60 questions: 40 yes/no que stions, 15 multiple-choice questions and five open-ended questions. In addition, groups of q uestions on four specific forms of CAM: acupuncture, CHM, chiropractic and osteopathy were developed by relevant experts in these fields, with particular emphasis on the benefits an d risks, insurance coverage and regulation matters. These questions were later re-formatted in a coherent manner. Table 3.5 Structure of the computer-assisted teleph one interview questionnaire Section 1: General health and the use of convention al medical services Section 2: Prevalence and frequency of use, and exp enditure on CAM Section 3: Rationales for CAM use and attitudes tow ard CAM regulation Section 4: CAM and private health insurance reimbur sement and Medicare coverage Section 5: Questions on four CAM therapies that are regulated at national or state level Section 6: Socio-demographic information on partici pants A total of eight revisions were made to the instrum ent between December 2004 and April 2005. The instrument was then programmed for use in a CATI telephone interviewing system. A sample of the final version of the questionnaire and a sample of the CATI programming script are attached (Appendix B C). Finalisation of the instrument was achieved after conducting the pilot study. Participants were first asked about their use of th e 17 CAM therapies and any other forms of CAM over the 12 months preceding the survey. Thus w ere asked whether or not they had visited a practitioner for any of the 17 forms of C AM. Participants were not required to answer all questions. Depending on each participant 's historical CAM use, specific questions were customised by the CATI system. In an attempt t o enhance the validity, the sequence of the 17 forms of CAM therapies was offered randomly for each interview session. 84 3.4 Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview When determining whether to use a mail or telephone survey to collect information, it is important to evaluate the advantages and disadvanta ges of each method in relation to the research objectives. Mail surveys are frequently us ed and are relatively inexpensive. However, they tend to have a low response rate and are time- consuming to implement. Mail surveys are suitable for the investigation of sensitive issues, such as illicit drug use, or for surveys requiring participants to fill in complex and lengt hy questionnaires. However, unlike telephone surveys, there is less opportunity for ma il survey participants to provide explanations of their perceptions, beliefs and atti tudes towards the research questions. Computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) involv es electronic data collection, capture, and associated tasks. 125 It is commonly used in large-scale health surveys, such as the Victorian Population Health Surveys and the New Sou th Wales Health Surveys. In Australia, the percentage of households with fixed telephones is 97.5%, 126 hence the CATI surveys methodology is feasible. The advantage of using CAT I for a survey such as the one proposed, is that it is relatively cost effective, providing standardised prompts, thereby ensuring data consistency. It also offers direct data input and d ata output. 127,128 For the reasons outlined above, it was decided that the study would employ t he CATI method of data collection. A CATI facility is currently not available at RMIT University, and the cost of setting up a CATI centre is substantial. State health authoritie s in Australia conduct CATI surveys, either through their own call rooms or by contracting with commercial providers. Thus, a survey research company was contracted to conduct the tele phone interviews. The use of professional trained telephone interviewers also ensured that re liable data would be obtained. A similar approach has been used by other researchers for wel l cited reports. 2,3 85 3.4.1 Random Digit Dialling Telephone surveys, based on the selection of random telephone numbers, were used in the early 1960s. 129 Most importantly, telephone numbers should be gene rated by a random digit- dialling (RDD) method. Such a method had been used in previous similar CAM utilisation studies in the US. 2,3 Unlike drawing numbers from the phone book listing s, RDD allows for the inclusion of silent, unlisted and recently allo cated telephone numbers. Thus, telephone numbers used in the interviews did not come from an y specific source but were randomly generated by computer to ensure all household membe rs had an equal probability of being contacted. In an attempt to minimise company or other business numbers, existing residential-prefix telephone numbers was used. For the current study, the first step of the RDD sampling was to select telephone numbers from the current available Telstra (a national telephone company) telephone exchanges. Randomly generated telephone n umbers with six-digit prefixes for each study area in different states/territories were pro duced. Two digit suffixes were then randomly appended at the end of the prefixes (e.g. 9666 55** might become a telephone number between 9666 5501 and 9666 5599). A total of 20,000 telephone numbers was initially g enerated; the CATI computer system then screened out calls to facsimile machines, data line s, and unassigned and disconnected numbers, which meant only live calls were assigned to interviewers. Additional random telephone numbers were generated to recruit suffici ent participants. A minimum of five call attempts was made to contact the household member. Calling proceeded, and a record of all calls was made, including non-reachable numbers, co nfirmed call-back numbers and household members who declined to participate. 86 3.4.2 Interviewer Training In an effort to produce the precise prevalence of C AM users and non-users, interviewers with experience in health surveys were selected from the survey company to conduct the interviews for the current survey. All interviewers attended a four-hour training and debriefing session in which the fieldwork manager and study investigator went through each interview question. Interviewers were given explanations of survey back ground information and all listed CAM modalities to be investigated. In addition, a brief interview memorandum with a sh ort definition of each form of CAM was also provided to all interviewers, and used during interview sessions. Samples of common forms of CAM were highlighted on the computer inter view screen, and were provided to the survey participants if requested. Other interviewer instructions included, \"Australian common allied health professions such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy are not considered as CAM in this study\", \"please distinguish between CAM use under the supervision of a practitioner and use without such supervision\"; \"pl ease confirm it was out-of-pocket expenditure excluding money you [the survey partici pant] have obtained rebates from any source\", \"please only provide expenditure and frequ ency of visits to CAM practitioners in the past 12 months\"; \"please differentiate the use of C hinese herbal medicine and Western herbal medicine, and Chinese therapeutic massage in compar ed to other massage therapies (i.e. Western therapeutic massage)\". 87 3.4.3 Quality Control Procedures For quality control purposes, two interview fieldwo rk supervisors randomly checked interview conversations simultaneously. The researcher was al so on site, and randomly listened to most of the interview sessions. Interviewers had the opp ortunity to refer any questions from participants to the researchers during the intervie w sessions. The researchers also had the opportunity to correct or make comments on particip ants' responses. The detailed survey development process, including the quality assuranc e strategy, is summarised in the following flowchart (Figure 3.2). Pilot Study (30 CATI Interviews) Commissioned to a commercial survey company Research Proposal and ethics Approved by RMIT University Survey Design (RDD &CATI) Questionnaire Development Questionnaire Revised and Re-Programmed CATI Field Work Nationwide, 1067 telephone interviews Data Recorded Simultaneously by Interviewers Researchers & field managers monitoring and supervising Quality Assurance In-house checking by a programmer, double-checked by a researcher Data Auditing, Merging & Reformatting Dataset Produced For In-depth Analysis Figure 3.2 Survey development-process and quality-a ssurance protocols 88 3.4.4 Interview Procedures The procedure of conducting the CATI telephone inte rview is described below. The automated dialling CATI system makes the initial ph one calls from the monitoring stations; all working telephones then transfer to the intervi ewers. The interviewers then initiate the interview procedures, and the computer program cont rols questions branching or skipping. The interviewers then conduct the tasks of intervie wing and entering the data into the computer system simultaneously. Where appropriate, the CATI system will also perform data checking while an interview is in progress. The sub jects' responses are then transferred directly into a CATI program linked to a database. These procedures ensured accurate and consistent answers were given by the participants. The interactive statistical software in the CATI sy stem permits rapid preliminary analysis of the survey data. The final output of the data will be produced in different formats: raw, uncoded preliminary data files, Excel and SPSS data files and partially coded qualitative data files. The project managers in the research company will also audit a minimum of 10% of the interviews. The process of CATI auto branching is very importan t to collect reliable information. For instance, if a participant responded that they had never used any form of CAM, the CATI system would skip to the relevant questions instead of asking them specific questions on using CAM. Similarly, if a participant had used a specifi c form of CAM, the CATI system would continue to ask questions relevant to that type of CAM (e.g. practitioner visits and frequency). As a result of this automatic branching or skipping of questions, interview time was minimised. 89 Having complied with the ethical requirements, pote ntial participants were given an abbreviated statement in plain language with backgr ound information about the survey to obtain their consent to participate (Appendix D). A full, printed version of the statement was provided if a potential participant requested one ( Appendix E). Participants were informed prior to participating in the interview that this s urvey was intended to obtain accurate information about CAM utilisation to determine nati onal prevalence data. The CATI interviews were conducted in May and June 2005. A maximum of 15 attempts were made to establish contact with an individual. People who normally stay at home during the day may have different characteristics, compare d to those normally at work during the day. Thus, the telephone calls were made from nine o'clo ck in the morning to nine o'clock in the evening, seven days a week, to get a balance of dif ferent groups of participants. Appointments were made during the duration of the survey period, and an additional 10 attempts were made to contact each identified individual with an appoi ntment. No financial incentive was provided. In order to obtain accurate information on CAM prev alence, the following questions were asked: \"In the past 12 months, have you used any on e of the following types of complementary medicine? Please say yes or no when i t is named\". If a participant used one specific form of CAM, the following questions were asked: \"Have you visited a practitioner for [name of automated CAM appeared in the screen b ased on previous question] in the past 12 months?\" and \"how many times in total did you vi sit a practitioner for [name of CAM] in the past 12 months?\" Due to the limitation on the t ime of interviews, the frequency question was asked only if a participant used one of ten typ es of CAM (mainly provider-based CAM therapies, see result section Table 4.9). The flowc hart below summarises the process of the interview (Figure 3.3). 90 Initial contact Have used at least one of 17 forms of CAM in past 12 months (prevalence) Establish eligibility (eg. age and, language proficiency) End of survey (Re-affirm this survey is fully comply with relevant privacy Acts and ethics requirements)Frequency of use and expenditure on CAM in past 12 months Rationale, perceptions, attitudes & concerns of using CAM Additional questions on: (acupuncture, chiropractic, Chinese herbal medicine, osteopathy) Health insurance and CAM (Coverage and reimbursement) Regulation and CAM Demographic information (eg. education, income, employment) Selected questions in each section (rationale, attitudes, insurance coverage and regulation) Used prayer or other forms of CAM?

A pilot survey with 30 r andomly selected individuals in the state of Victoria was conducted in April 2005. The respon ses from the pilot study helped to clarify the understanding on the 17 CAM therapies to be inc luded in the main study. The pilot study was also used to validate and refine the survey que stions, the flow of the interview, and to assess the quality assurance procedures of the rese arch company contracted to conduct the fieldwork. As a result of the pilot study, changes were made to the questionnaire programming, the final version of the questionnaire and the interview schedules. Interview notes were provided to interviewers to clarify some frequently asked questions that arose from the pilot study. 92 3.5.2 Results of the Pilot Study Telephone interviews were successfully conducted wi th 30 randomly selected Victorians. Their age ranges, gender and country of birth are p resented in Table 3.6 below, and are compared with the 2001 Victorian population data. Table 3.6 Basic demographic information on pilot st udy participants Characteristic Results of pilot study % ABS 2001 Victoria % 18-24 16.7 12.7 Age range 65+ 10.0 16.9 Male 33.3 49.1 Gender Female 66.7 50.9 Australia 80.0 71.1 Birthplace Overseas 20.0 28.9 In relation to CAM utilisation, 22 out of 30 (73.3% , unweighted percentage) participants had used at least one of the 17 forms of CAM in the 12 months preceding the survey, while 86.7% participants had visited a medical doctor in the sa me period. The most popular forms of CAM were: aromatherapy, multivitamins or nutritional su pplements, and yoga (each modality, >20%). Other interesting findings include: 1. Fifty-nine percent considered Western medicine has a relatively higher risk of side effects, while 77% considered CAM to be relatively safe. 93 2. One in four participants who used CAM had never inf ormed their medical doctors. 3. Out-of-pocket expenditure on CAM products was betwe en $0 and $350 per annum. 4. Out-of-pocket expenditure on CAM consultations was between $0 and $1,000 per annum. 5. Additional out-of-pocket expenditure on CAM-related items was between $15 and $1,500 per annum. 6. If a private health insurance offered CAM for no or little additional cost, 60% participants would buy insurance from that company. 7. Medicare should or should not cover visits to pract itioners of selected forms of CAM: 80% suggested it should cover visits to an acupunct urist in addition to a registered GP who provided acupuncture treatment. 63.3% suggested it should cover visits to Chinese h erbal medicine practitioners 66.7% suggested it should cover visits to chiroprac tors 70% suggested it should cover visits to osteopaths Due to the small size of the pilot sample, the abov e data were collected to assist the design of the main survey only and must not be generalised. In the pilot study, the researcher randomly listene d to some interview sessions, and established that the vast majority of participants were able to follow the sequence of the interview questions. However, participants commented that the interview was lengthy and that some questions were repetitive (specific research questi ons on four forms of CAM: acupuncture, etc). Importantly, some participants were unsure ab out some forms of CAM and queried them. A clear explanation was desirable. In addition, two interviewers mentioned that they were unable to inform survey participants what homeopath y and osteopathy were. These matters were resolved before the main survey. 94 3.5.3 Discussions and Finalisation of the Survey Instrume nt Perhaps the most important outcome of the pilot stu dy was that it indicated that over 70% of the participants had used at least one form of comp lementary medicine in the past 12 months; this provided further confirmation of the adequacy of the target sample size (i.e. 1,067). All participants were also asked whether they had u sed any other forms of CAM other than the 17 surveyed. Only three mentioned such use, wit h none of them saying they had used other CAM but not any of the 17 forms of CAM. Thus, the p ilot study also indicated that these 17 forms of CAM therapies are likely to be the most co mmonly used CAM in Australia. Therefore, the pilot study to test CAM modalities u sed in Australia was most valuable for finalising the survey instrument. Other problems encountered during the pilot study i ncluded the definition of multivitamins and minerals. This was expected and has been commen ted by researchers in CAM utilisation studies. 1 However, there is no easy way for the general publ ic to define \"non-CAM vitamins\" and \"CAM vitamins\". It was decided, therefore, for the purpose of this survey, the term \"clinical nutrition\" would include multivitamins an d minerals. The term clinical nutrition is more commonly known in Australia. The use of the pr efix \"multi-\" also indicated that the current study was not referring to a single vitamin consumed daily. Interviewers were expected to clarify this with participants while co nducting the main survey. In addition, a few questions were designed to captu re the reason(s) why participants used a particular form of complementary medicine. For inst ance, the original question on chiropractic was: \"you mentioned earlier that you have sought ch iropractic treatment in the last 12 months. Would you say the main reasons were: [read out by i nterviewers] 1) To improve general 95 health and well-being; 2) To improve sporting perfo rmance; 3) To improve [the] ability to undertake normal daily activities; 4) For relief of symptoms; 5) None of above-other specify.\" The question was designed with multiple choices, as participants may have been using chiropractic for multiple purposes. The computer pr ogram, however, captured only one answer then skipped to the next question, so interv iewers lost the opportunity to gather additional answers. Similar programming problems al so occurred with another three questions. Such problems were resolved in consultat ion with the CATI script programmer before the main survey. Finally, as would have been anticipated, the recrui tment from certain cohorts of participants was difficult. This was particularly observed in yo ung males aged 18-34. This reinforces that the use of a national quota (see Table 3.2) in the main survey is necessary to recruit a nationally representative study population. 96 3.6 Data Analysis 3.6.1 Data Consolidation and Missing Data Abandoned interviews (four in total) did not count toward the total of 1,067 successful interviews. Information on them is not available, e ven though the interviews were partially completed, as the temporary records were deleted im mediately after the interviews had been discarded. The final dataset produced by the survey company wa s a SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences 130 ) data file. Because of the abovementioned quality assurance protocol, and the fact that the information was recorded by using a comput er-assisted telephone interview system, missing data was minimal throughout the data set. T he number of missing data in each research question is no more than 5%; thus, accordi ng to Korn and Graubard, this is fully acceptable. 131 There are two types of missing data: the purposivel y designed non-relevant items and items to which participants did not respond. Non-relevant it ems are those that were not relevant to a particular participant; for example, a question abo ut expenditure on CAM was not put to a non-CAM user. A negative value \"-1\" was assigned to these responses. Such results do not have any impact on the data analyses. While the \"re al\" missing data (e.g. a CAM user who did not state CAM expenditure for no given reason), was assigned an extreme value of \"99999\" and was clearly defined in the data property in the SPSS file. The task of identifying missing data and distinguis hing it from non-relevant data was carried out in two steps. Firstly, all data were exported t o a Microsoft ACCESS database, using 97 purposively designed queries, those participants wh o stated \"don't know\" or \"refused to answer\" were identified. These mainly occurred in q uestions about CAM expenditure, number of visits to CAM practitioners, participants' age, income and personal demographic information. In the second step, a new function ava ilable from the SPSS software 14.0 132 was employed. The \"data validation\" function was partic ularly useful in customising a particular rule to check whether an individual value was withi n a valid range and to check the minimum and maximum data values in each data cell. It also flagged the identification of invalid cases for further investigation. A number of outliers of particular values had been flagged in this step for future notice. The overall cases of missin g data in any variable are small. Thus, a missing value analysis was not conducted. The original dataset consists of 236 variables (App endix G1). However, qualitative data (e.g. medical conditions for which a form of CAM was used ) and \"other-specify\" questions (e.g. other forms of CAM and country of birth) were recor ded in a separate Excel file. Such data were merged with the original dataset. More importa ntly, before any analysis could be carried out, a series of variables was created. These inclu ded \"CAM user\", \"chiropractic u ser\" etc. Questions with multiple responses were defined as a separate set of data in order to produce multiple-response frequency tables. Finally, most demographic data were recoded in acco rdance with relevant classifications used in government reports. 98 3.6.2 Reliability and Validity of Survey Instrument Although questions contained in the current survey had been tested by a group of researchers and re-tested in a pilot study, it should be noted that the newly developed instrument has not been widely tested and its reliability has not been formally and statistically evaluated. Also, little information is known about its validity. The relationship between reliability and validity r equires further consideration. Outcome data can be valid but not reliable. Also, a measure can be reliable but invalid. 133-135 Very often, the reliability, which measures the consistency of obta ining data from a scale, can be measured by examining how people answer each item of a set of q uestions. Mathematically, Cronbach's alpha ( ) value can be calculated for each section of the q uestionnaire with a value that ranges from 0 to 1. In general, an alpha coefficient of 0. 70 or higher is considered acceptable for most instrumental design purpose.136 Unfortunately, for validity, a conclusive method o f assessment is not readily available. Most social sc ience analyses rely on a scale that produces results that are expected on the basis of well-esta blished theories. 136 Most often face validity is ascertained via experts within the particular ar ea that is researched. Therefore, scale reliability analyses (through SPSS ) were carried out for different sections within the instrument to assess internal consistenc y of items measured by the scale. This is to ensure that answers from participants will not diff er because the survey is confusing or has multiple interpretations. In the current survey, prevalence questions and att itudes towards a series of pre-defined questions on CAM-related matters are of major conce rn from a reliability perspective. The key 99 results of the reliability test on the 17 CAM preva lence questions confirm that the scale is reliable. The Cronbach's alpha value is calculated as 0.759, which suggests that the scale is reliable (i.e. a value higher than 0.7). 137 More specifically, Table 3.7 shows the item-total correlation of these 17 questions. It indicates tha t when removing any of the items, the Cronbach's alpha value would not increase markedly, from the calculated reliability of the entire scale, 0.759. Therefore, the reliability coe fficient for all items may be considered appropriate. In addition, Table 3.8 shows the inter -item correlation for the 17 CAM prevalence questions; the average correlation value is 0.163 (standard deviation (SD)=0.08) with a maximum of 0.404. It reveals that responses to these questions are not highly correlated. In addition, the item-total correlation s of these questions range between 0.199 to 0.456 (Mean=0.354, SD=0.07). According to Briggs an d Cheek, 137 this falls within the optimal range for the inter-item correlation (0.2-0 .4). Similarly, when examining the questions on whether or not participants visited a CAM practitioner, Cronbach's alpha value of 0.760 and a n average inter-item correlation of 0.171 (SD=0.09) were obtained. Moreover, considerably hig h Cronbach's alpha values were also achieved for the items on attitudes towards CAM and Western medicine ( =0.954); the reasons for informing medical practitioners about C AM use ( =0.893); the reasons for not informing medical practitioners about CAM use ( =0.970); the reasons for using acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, chiropractic or osteopathy ( =0.924); the recommendations received for using these four therapies ( =0.908); and questions on regulations and private h ealth insurance related to CAM use ( =0.763). 100 Item-Total Statistics 2.07 5.422 5.437 .742 2.00 5.138 .417 .740 1.71 5.033 .309 .757 2.09 5.434 .393 .745 2.12 5.609 .338 .750 2.04 5.311 .370 .745 1 Use ACU 2 Use CHM 3 Use CTM 4 Use CMDT 5 Use QG MA TC 6 Use WHM 7 Use WTM 8 Use Chiropractic 9 Use Osteopathy 10 Use Homeopathy 11 Use Naturopathy 12 Use Meditation 13 Use Aromatherapy 14 Use Clinical Nutrition 15 Use Energy Healing 16 Use Reflexology 17 Use Yoga Scale Mean if Item Deleted Scale Variance if Item Deleted Corrected Item-Total Correlation Cronbach's Alpha if Item Deleted Table 3.7 Item-total correlation matrix of the prev alence questions on 17 forms of CAM Inter-Item Correlation Matrix 1.000 .318 1.00 .355 .324 1.000 .207 .385 .303 1.000 .067 .143 .153 .107 1.00 .160 .239 .139 .159 .074 1.00 .219 .187 .214 .110 .147 .175 1.000 .175 .052 .043 .022 .047 .080 .232 1.00 .153 .158 .125 .101 .073 .120 .159 .054 1.00 .230 .313 .197 .245 .063 .269 .159 .101 .193 1.00 .115 .218 .162 .132 .103 .324 .215 .147 .177 .404 1.00 .134 .145 .099 .107 .244 .219 .216 .051 .125 .210 .178 1.00 .136 .143 .159 .087 .199 .206 .313 .085 .068 .135 .216 .261 1.000 .070 .137 .063 .061 .062 .275 .220 .140 .077 .169 .215 .169 .194 1.00 .147 .176 .196 .137 .252 .155 .248 .083 .092 .181 .174 .290 .323 .068 1.000 .123 .230 .222 .170 .124 .116 .248 .083 .084 .174 .153 .158 .211 .098 .304 1.00 .107 .142 .120 .084 .210 .185 .247 .007 .134 .163 .216 .356 .268 .142 .178 .123 1.00 1 Use ACU 2 Use CHM 3 Use CTM 4 Use CMDT 5 Use QG MA TC 6 Use WHM 7 Use WTM 8 Use Chiropractic 9 Use Osteopathy 10 Use Homeopathy 11 Use Naturopathy 12 Use Meditation 13 Use Aromatherapy 14 Use Clinical Nutrition 15 Use Energy Healing 16 Use Reflexology 17 Use Yoga 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Table 3.8 Item-item correlation matrix of the preva lence questions on 17 forms of CAM ACU: Acupuncture, CHM: Chinese herbal medicine, CTM : Chinese therapeutic massage, CMDT: Chinese medicine dietary therapy, QGMATC: Qig ong, martial art and Tai Chi, WHM: Western herbal medicine, WTM: Western therapeutic m assage. 101 3.6.3 Data Weighting Procedures The purpose of the data weighting process was to ad just for representativeness with the national population. The weighting procedure used i n this thesis is the most conventional, post-stratified direct weighting method. 138 The quota used in the CATI interview was based on nationwide statistics; a reasonable distribution of the study population was achieved at the end of the recruitment to represent Australia's ove rall population. However, the final make-up of the study population does not match the national population distribution exactly, particularly on a state/territory level. In additio n, at the time of developing the national quota, the available ABS population data were for June 200 4, while the study participants were recruited between May and June 2005. A post-stratif ied weighting process was required. As a result of the age/gender/region weighting proc ess, a total of 89 weighting values were applied to the original dataset (Table 3.9). The me thod used to calculate the weighting value is in accordance with the number of interviews in this survey and the proportion of sample required to represent corresponding adult Australia ns. 138 For instance, a total of 28 interviews were conducted with male participants aged 18-24 in New South Wales; this represented 2.63% of the total 1,067 interviews in the current survey (three participants who did not state their ages were weighted differently, see Table 3.9 ). Based on the ABS data, there was a population of 330,628 adults in this division, or 2 .15% of the total adult Australian population. The actual interview numbers exceeded t he total number of people required to represent the overall national population. Thus, th e assigned weighting value for people within this division is less than 1.0. This can be calculated as a ratio of approximately 2.15% over approximately 2.63%, which equals 0.81620. The sum of the total weights equals the total number of adult Australians interviewed (1,06 7). 102 Table 3.9 Data weighting values applied in the data analyses Weighting values* Regions/age 18-24 did not state their age, a weig hting value of 1.00000 was applied. N/A: Interviews did not conduct in that regional ar eas, a weighting value was not applicable. 103 The method used to define the weighting values for each participant was through the SPSS syntax technique (Table 3.10). Table 3.10 An example of SPSS syntax for data weigh ting protocol COMPUTE Wgt=0. IF ((Region=NSW) and (Age=18-24) (Gender=Male)) Wgt=0.79241. EXECUTE . Alternatively, a weight can also be based on how ma ny Australian each participant represents. On average, each of the 1,067 participants in the c urrent survey represented a total of 14,544.37 adult Australians (based on the ABS June 2005 data,122 the total number of adult Australians was 15,518,843). More specifically, for the abovementioned 28 male adults aged 18-24 in New South Wales, each participant will rep resent a total of 11,808.11 persons (the total adult population in that division was 330,628122 ). When applying these weighting factors, the sum of the weights was the total numbe r of adult Australians aged 18 or over at the time of the survey, which was approximately 15. 5 million people. However, this method produces large weighting values and is more difficu lt to manage when performing SPSS data analyses. Consequently, the method mentioned earlie r (direct weighing method), with much smaller weighting values, was used in this study. 104 3.6.4 Statistical Analyses 3.6.4.1 Descriptive Analyses A general descriptive analysis was initially carrie d out to examine the distribution of the data in terms of their central tendency and spread, such as mean, median, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis. A symmetric distribution of a number of variables (e.g. the CAM cost and number of visits to CAM practitioners) is of pa rticular importance before conducting correlations or regressions analyses (see below). W hen calculating prevalence and other major results, 95% confidence intervals are also calculat ed and, where appropriate, the exact level of statistical significance and the corresponding numb ers are also provided. Standard errors (SE) for all proportions are calcul ated as: SE= np p / ) 1 ( * where p is the proportion, and n is the total number of participan ts investigated. Consistent with some ABS reports, relative standard error (RSE) is also calc ulated with major prevalence. The formula is: RSE (as a percentage) = (Standard error of the perc entage/actual estimation)*100. All estimations with a RSE greater than 25% are recomme nded to be used with caution, while a RSE greater than 50% is considered unreliable, as i t does not meet the standard of reliability. 105 3.6.4.2 Inferential Analyses The independent t-test, and one-way and two-way ANO VA tests were used to test for differences between groups. These were conducted vi a the SPSS program. Importantly, for prevalence data, the Z-test was used to determine t he significance of differences between two percentages (through the statistical formula below (calculated in Microsoft Excel) and also confirmed in the MINITAB-a specialised statistical software package). Z= SS b ab aX X 2 2= b b b a a ab a N X X N X XX X / ) 1 ( / ) 1 ( Where aX and bX are two percentages being compared Sa and Sb are the standard errors of those percentages aN and bN are the total number of participants investigated The critical z value at the 0.05 significance level is \u00b11.96 Cross-tabulation analysis was used to reveal the fr equency and common characteristics of the outcome measurements: CAM users and related variabl es. Because participants' demographic information is mainly in the form of categorical va riables, the results can be displayed in customised multi-way frequency tables. The chi-squa re-based statistics (phi, Cram\u00e9r's V, and contingency coefficient) are obtained depending on the nature of the variables (nominal, ordinal or interval). In the result section, the we ighted percentages are presented rather than the actual frequencies of cases together with their chi-square value and probability ( p). Evidence exists to explain the characteristics that account for the use of CAM and visits to CAM practitioners. These include being female, havi ng a better socio-economic status, holistic personal beliefs and experiences with conv entional medicine. Thus, hypotheses on factors that contribute to the use of CAM were test ed to confirm whether an association exists. These hypotheses will be discussed in the logistic regression model section. 106 3.6.4.3 Multivariate Logistic Regression A regression model is commonly used to assess the r elationship between a dependent variable and a set of independent variables (predictors). In the case of the current study, the dependent variables of interest are mainly dichotomous, (e.g. whether or not CAM was used) with more than one explanatory independent variable. Accordin g to the principles of correlation and regression, a binary logistic regression is most ap propriate. 139 Mathematically, in general, the overall effect of the independent variables (known as predictors in the regression) on the dependent variable (the outcome measure) is express ed by the square of the correlation coefficient (r 2), which can be used to predict the proportion of t he variance in the dependent variable which is explained by its relationship wit h the independent variables. 140 In the current study, the major dependent variables are \"CAM user\" and \"visited CAM practitioners\" which represents the use of any of t he 17 forms of CAM and visits to a practitioner for any one of the 17 forms of CAM, re spectively. Separate regression analyses incorporating predictor variables were carried out within four specific forms of CAM. Guided by a previous US national study on why people use C AM,46 a list of the hypothesised predictor variables that used to assess the potenti al correlation with CAM use are generated (details below). However, the use of the existing c lassification may eliminate and/or include potential factors, both unintentionally and intenti onally. Thus, the maximum number of independent variables was included in the initial m odel-developing stage. Final regression outputs presented in this dissertation are variable s that had been entered via a step-wise method and which contributed significantly to the m odel. Although logistic regression does not assume a line ar relationship between the dependent and independent variables, and the dependent variables need not be normally distributed, there are 107 a few assumptions for the data that may restrict th e application of logistic regression analysis. As logistic regression is based on the principle of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), a considerably large sample is required. Peduzzi et al . suggested that a minimum of 10 observations per parameter should be included in th e model. 141 As with most statistical procedures, outliers can s ubstantially affect all results. As discussed in the data consolidation process above, a thorough da ta check was conducted before performing data analysis. In addition, for the purpose of logi stic regression, the residuals produced alongside the regression model were inspected to id entify outlying cases that may have affected the model. Moreover, as required for general multiple regressi on, logistic regression also requires no multicollinearity between variables. 142 In simple terms, this means that high inter-correl ations among independent variables will change the estimat ion of the coefficient and will be a problem. As Pallant suggested, ideally the predicto r variables should be strongly related to the dependent variables but not strongly related to eac h other. 142 In the current study, a collinearity diagnostic was conducted, and variable s with the problem of multicollinearity was detected by examining the correlation matrix and to lerance value. For example, a variable with a tolerance value less than 0.1 was not includ ed in the regression model. A few technical terms that are presented in the SPS S output format should be noted, as they are not exactly the same as conventional regression values. First, as stated in the SPSS Regression Models 12.0 Manual, 143 the Hosmer and Lemeshow Test provides the most reliable test on a model performance (to support th e model, the p value should be greater than 0.05). The significance value is in contrast to the significant results in the Omnibus Tests of 108 Model Coefficients. In the latter case, a p value less than 0.05 indicates the final model is better than the original guessing model in Block 0.142 For easy interpretation, the original beta coeffici ents in the logistic regression are in a log format, and have been transformed into an odds rati o by taking the exponential (presented as Exp (B) in the SPSS output). According to Tabachnic k and Fidell, 144 the odds ratio is \"the increase (or decrease if the odds ratio is less tha n one) in odds of being in one outcome category when the value of the predictor increases by one unit\" while keeping all the other predictors constant. For example, in the current st udy, this may refer to the odds of a participant with a particular characteristic using CAM a greater or lesser number times than someone who does not have that particular character istic, all other factors being equal. All analyses in this thesis used SPSS to compute regres sion statistics, and will be presented in comparison to a reference category for all categori cal variables. A Classification Table is also provided in the SPSS output as an indication of how well the model predicted the correct category (CAM use or vi sits to CAM practitioner). Values in the table correspond to the conventional statistics of sensitivity (the true positives) and specificity (true negatives) of the model. 143 Thus, the summarised statistics of the classificat ion table (the percentage accurate in classification (PAC) statist ics) are presented in the current thesis. Lastly, regression results presented in the current thesis were based on the original unweighted data. This is on the basis of the recommendation by Winship and Radbill that population weights do not make a difference in the results and therefore are not necessary for the regression model. 145 It is important to note that this method was also employed in a previous CAM utilisation study in South Australia.9 Thus, comparison of results between the current study and those previous studies can be much more s traightforward. 109 CHAPTER 4. NATIONAL PROFILE OF CAM UTILISATION 4.1 Results 4.1.1 Foreword The intended number of participants (1,067) complet ed the survey interview. Ninety percent of the interviews ranged between 7.5 and 22.5 minut es, with an average of 13.5 minutes. When considering the downtime in filling appointmen ts, the total average time taken to complete the whole interview was just over 22 minut es. The minimum interview time was four minutes, and the maximum was 37 minutes. The representativeness of the study population can be evaluated through a comparison with existing independent sources (e.g. the ABS data and recent government surveys), although some data collected from other sources are not read ily available for comparison (e.g. some ABS data are only applicable to people aged 15 year s and older). Nevertheless, after comparing with a variety of publications (details b elow), the study population can be considered as a representative sample of the entire Australian adult populations. Detailed results of national profile of CAM use are presented in this chapter. A regional (state) profile of CAM utilisation is presented in Chapter 5, while Chapter 6 presents specific analyses on some popular forms of CAM in Australia, such as acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy. Matters rela ted to CAM use, such as rationale for using CAM, insurance coverage and regulation are presente d in Chapter 7. 110 4.1.2 Survey Response Rate For the main survey 26,367 telephone numbers were g enerated for dialling. Of these, 28% were not functioning, 10% were not assigned to hous eholds or were facsimile/modem numbers, 15% did not answer after a maximum of 18 c all attempts. Among the remaining 7,260 participants (the eligibility of most of whom has not been established), 1,067 completed the interview. This corresponds to a 14.7% overall response rate. The response rate was calculated using the formula in the flowchart below (Figure 4.1), which is comparable to the method suggested by the American Association for Pu blic Opinion Research. 146 Due to the relatively short period of the survey (t wo months), 320 participants were not available during the study period, and 76 interview appointments remained unsolved at the end of the survey. These figures were not taken int o consideration when calculating the response rate. On the other hand, the estimated pro portion of cases of unknown eligibility was not reported by the survey company. Thus, an adjust ed response rate may be reasonably higher than the current estimation. The majority of people who refused to participate did not provide a reason. Of those who gave a detailed explanation, \"don't have time\" and \"never do surveys\" were the most common responses. 111 Initial household contacts (26,367) Completed & valid interviews (1,067) Households contacted (12,157) Agreed to participate (1,147) Contacts were established* numbers not Business and other non-households numbers (1,258), Phone did not answer, engaged after five attempts o r was an answering machining (4,403).

National aggregated quotas for gender, age ranges, and state/territory were set on the basis of 2004 ABS d ata, 124 and the proportions recruited for each of these did not differ significantly from the relevant ABS data for 2005 122 (p>0.05) (Table 4.1). The survey sample was also representat ive of the Australian population in terms of self-reported health status, 147 place of birth (born in Australia or overseas), ed ucational status, employment status and household income rang e 148 (Table 4.1). The sample representativeness in this survey was ex tended when examining the details of participants' country of birth (Table 4.2 shows the top 10 countries of birth of survey participants). It suggested that participants' coun tries of birth were reasonably distributed across a wide range of different nations similar to the Australian national data, 149 although the population of the state of Tasmania, the Northern T erritory and the Australian Capital Territory are relatively small, and the correspondi ng numbers of interviews were small. In most cases, participants were asked about their detailed demographic information rather than the combined categories presented in Table 4.1 . For example, educational background was categorised as \"did not complete high school, c ompleted high school, enrolled at TAFE or university, TAFE or university degree, postgraduate degree\" (Table 4.3). These categorical data were merged for easy interpretation, and enhan ce the statistical power when performing sub-group analyses. In addition to the characterist ics presented in Table 4.1, participants were also asked about their status of health insurance c overage.

Table 4.4 shows the prevalence of use of the 17 forms of CAM included in the survey. Over two third s (68.9%, 95% CI: 66.1% - 71.7%) of participants had used at least one of the 17 CAM th erapies in the previous 12 months. Of the total 17 forms of CAM, the use of clinical n utrition (including multivitamins and minerals) was found to be the most popular (45.8%, 95%CI: 42.8% - 48.8%), while Chinese medicine dietary therapy had the smallest following at 2.3% (95%CI: 1.4% - 3.2%). Low prevalence was also observed in the use of reflexol ogy (4.1%, 95%CI: 2.9% 95%CI: 3.3% - 5.9%). In summary, the 10 most popular forms of CAM, in decreasing order, were clinical nutrition (includin g multivitamins and minerals), Western massage therapy, meditation, Western herbal medicin e, aromatherapy, chiropractic, yoga, naturopathy, acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicin e. None of the relative standard errors of the prevalence was higher than 25%. 116 Table 4.4 Prevalence of the 17 investigated forms o f CAM Prevalence Type of CAM % 95% CI RSE* (%) Clinical nutrition 45.8 (42.8 - 48.8) 3.3 Western massage therapy 27.2 (24.5 - 29.9) 5.0 Meditation 17.5 (15.2 - 19.8) 6.6 Western herbal medicine 16.3 (14.1 - 18.5) 6.9 Aromatherapy 16.1 (13.9 - 18.3) 7.0 Chiropractic 16.1 (13.9 - 18.3) 7.0 Yoga 12.0 (10.1 - 13.9) 8.3 Naturopathy 10.7 (8.8 - 12.6) 8.8 Acupuncture 9.2 (7.5 - 10.9) 9.6 Chinese herbal medicine 7.0 (5.5 - 8.5) 11.2 Energy healing 7.0 (5.5 - 8.5) 11.2 Homeopathy 6.0 (4.6 - 7.4) 12.1 Qigong, martial art and Tai Chi 6.0 (4.6 - 7.4) 12. 1 Chinese therapeutic massage 5.1 (3.8 - 6.4) 13.2 Osteopathy 4.6 (3.3 - 5.9) 13.9 Reflexology 4.1 (2.9 - 5.3) 14.8 Chinese medicine dietary therapy 2.3 (1.4 - 3.2) 20 .0 At least 1 of the above forms of CAM 68.9 (66.1 - 71.7) 2.1 * RSE: relative standard error = (standard error/es timated prevalence)*100 117 4.1.4.2 Characteristics of CAM Users A total of 737 participants were classified as CAM users, 45.5% of whom were male, and 54.5% female. Key socio-demographic characteristics of the CAM users are summarised in Table 4.5. A higher proportion of females were CAM users than males, and fewer of those aged 65 and above were users than were younger adul ts. However, it is worth noting that 60% of those aged 65 and above used CAM (Table 4.5). It appears that CAM users are more likely to have higher levels of education, to have private health insurance, and to be in households with higher than average incomes (Table 4.5). There was little difference in the use of CAM between those born in Australia and those born over seas. In contrast, there was considerable variation in the prevalence of the use of CAM betwe en Australian states (details Chapter 5). Table 4.6 is the detailed cross-tabulation analysis that reveals the proportions of survey participants who had used each of the 17 forms of C AM, and the participants' specified socio- demographic characteristics. The largest gender dif ferentials were in the use of aromatherapy, Western herbal medicine, Western massage, naturopat hy, energy healing and yoga (all modalities with female users being higher than male users, p<0.001). In particular, the use of aromatherapy by females (24.0%) was almost three ti mes that by males (8.1%) (p<0.0001). Gender differences were also observed in osteopathy and reflexology users, but less significant (p<0.05). As mentioned earlier, the youngest group (18 to 34 years of age) was more likely to use CAM therapies than the older cohorts. However, this may be largely due to the relatively high prevalence of use of yoga, Qigong, martial art, Tai Chi and clinical nutrition by the youngest group (18-34 age group, compared with the 35-64 and 65 and older age groups, p<0.05). Not surprisingly, older people also had a low prevalenc e of use of Chinese herbal medicine, 118 Table 4.5 Socio-demographic characteristics on CAM users Were CAM users Characteristics % (95%CI) p value Gender Male 63.4 (59.3 - 67.5) Female 74.4 (70.7 - 78.1) <0.001 Country of birth Australia 70.2 (67.1 - 73.3) Other 65.0 (59.1 - 70.9) >0.05 Region New South (50.3 - >0.05 Western Australia 66.6 (57.6 - 75.6) >0.05 Employed 72.5 labour force 62.9 (57.9 - 67.9 ) <0.005 No 64.9 (60.6 - 69.2) <0.05 household income (A$) <20,000 60.1 (52.5 significance levels were adjusted to allow fo r multiple comparisons * Excludes subjects who did not provide socio-de mographic characteristics Probability of proportion being significantly different from the first value in each demographic category (Z-test) 119 aromatherapy, Western herbal medicine, (all modalit ies, 65 and above age group, compared with 18-34 age group, p<0.01), and Chinese therapeu tic massage (p<0.05). In contrast, the highest proportions of users of osteopathy and refl exology were those over 65 years of age. When examining participants' country of birth, it i s clear that a higher prevalence in the use of Chinese herbal medicine (p<0.01), acupuncture (p<0. 05), Chinese medicine dietary therapy (p<0.05) and reflexology (p<0.05) was observed in t hose born overseas than those born in Australia. However, the use of chiropractic by thos e people born in Australia (18.1%) was almost twice that of those born overseas (9.7 %) (p <0.001). Similar to the finding of overall CAM use, self-rep orted health status did not seem to significantly affect the use of any specific form o f CAM. However, a clearly higher use of some forms of CAM (yoga, Western herbal medicine, a romatherapy and naturopathy) was observed in those with an excellent/very good or go od health status. In addition, those who rated their health status as fair or poor tended to have a higher (but not statistically significant) use of acupuncture, Qigong, martial art, Tai Chi, c hiropractic, osteopathy, meditation, clinical nutrition and energy healing. With respect to educational background, for each of the 17 forms of CAM higher use was observed in those with post-secondary education, al though a statistically significant difference was only observed in the use of acupuncture, Chines e herbal medicine, Western herbal medicine, Western therapeutic massage, homeopathy, naturopathy, meditation, aromatherapy, clinical nutrition and yoga. Very similar findings were found in participants' employment status, that is, people who were employed at the ti me of the survey also had a higher rate of CAM use, except for osteopathy and energy healing. For the latter two categories of users, those unemployed or not in the labour force, had a slightly higher rate of CAM use (p>0.05). 120 Private health insurance funds in Australia provide limited coverage of a number of CAM therapies, such as acupuncture, chiropractic and ma ssage therapy. The common view of the correlation between CAM use and insurance cover is that those covered by private health insurance would be more likely to choose some speci fic forms of CAM, as they can claim for limited reimbursements for those types of CAM thera pies. This hypothesis was confirmed by most users but not users of aromatherapy, Chinese m edicine dietary therapy, as well as Qigong, Tai Chi and martial art. Among all CAM ther apies, there was a statistically significant difference between those covered by pri vate health insurance and those who are not on the use of chiropractic (p<0.01) and Western massage therapy (p<0.01). As for most Western countries, the cost related to seeing a CAM practitioner and/or the use of CAM products are mainly borne by the consumers them selves. Thus, the use of CAM may be partially determined by the affordability of that C AM therapy/product. This hypothesis is generally acceptable for most forms of CAM used by the current survey participants. The most significant income differential was for chiropracti c and aromatherapy users. Only approximately one tenth of the survey participants with an overall household income of less than $20,000 had used chiropractic (7.5%) or aromat herapy (10.1%), whereas the prevalence of use of these therapies doubled to approximately 20% among those with an income between $20,000 and $40,000, and among those with incomes e xceeding $40,000. The tests of significance mentioned above between c ategories were conducted without controlling the potential cross-effects (referred t o as interaction in statistical analyses) among predictor variables. For example, those employed ma y also have higher household incomes and be covered by private health insurance. Due to this, a multivariate logistic regression analysis that considers the correlation between var iables was also carried out. 121 Table 4.6 Socio-demographic characteristics on user s of each of the 17 forms of CAM Percents (standard error) of use of - Characteristics Acupuncture CHM CTM CMDT QGMATC WHM WTM Chiropractic Osteopathy Gender Female 9.6 (1.27) 7.7 (1.15) 5.8 (1.01) 3.0 (0.73) 7.2 (1.12) 20.2 (1.73) 33.3 (2.03) 17.1 (1.62) 5.8 (1.01) Male 8.9 (1.24) 6.1 (1.04) 4.3 (0.89) 1.7 (0.57) 4. 6 (0.91) 12.3 (1.43)** 21.0 (1.77)** 15.0 (1.55) 3. 3 (0.78)* Age (year) 18-34 7.6 (1.46) 8.1 (1.49) 5.7 (1.27) 2.3 (0.82) 9 .5 (1.61) 16.3 (2.03) 33.8 (2.59) 15.0 (1.96) ( 2.8 (0.71) 4.7 (0.90)** 17.7 (1.63) 27.7 (1.91) (2.13) 2.6 (1.16)** 12.3 (2.42) 13.9 (2.55)** 15.7 (2.68) 5.9 (1.74) Country of birth Australia 10.2 (1.06) 5.5 (0.80) 4.7 (0.74) 1.7 (0. 45) 6.2 (0.84) 15.9 (1.28) 28.2 (1.58) 18.1 (1.35) 4.8 (0.75) Overseas 6.5 (1.56)* 6.4 (1.55) 4.7 (1.34)* 27.3 (1.48 ) 15.2 (1.19) 4.5 (0.69) Fair/poor 12.1 (2.57) 6.4 (1.93) 4.9 (1.70) 0.0 (0. 00)** 6.4 (1.93) 11.8 (2.54) 26.3 (3.47) 20.6 (3.19 ) 4.8 (1.68) Post-secondary education No 6.4 (1.15) 4.7 (0.99) 4.7 (0.99) 1.9 (0.64) 4.9 (1.01) 13.0 (1.58) 20.8 (1.90) 15.4 (1.70) 3.6 (0.8 7) Yes 11.3 (1.29)** 8.7 (1.15)** 5.4 (0.92) 2.7 (0.66 ) 6.8 (1.03) 18.8 (1.59)** 32.2 (1.90)** 16.7 (1.52 ) 5.3 (0.91) Employment Employed 9.8 (1.13) 8.1 (1.04) 6.0 (0.90) 2.9 (0.64 ) 6.4 (0.93) 17.4 (1.45) 29.7 (1.74) 16.8 (1.42) 4. 5 (0.79) Unemployed/not in labour force 7.8 (1.40) 4.6 (1.10 )* 3.5 (0.97) 1.3 (0.60) 5.1 (1.16) 14.4 (1.84) 22. 5 (2.19)** 14.5 (1.85) 4.7 (1.11) Private health insurance Yes 10.8 (1.27) 7.3 (1.07) 5.7 (0.95) 2.3 (0.62) 5. 8 (0.96) 17.2 (1.55) 32.5 (1.92) 19.0 (1.61) 5.6 (0 .94) No 7.4 (1.21) 6.6 (1.15) 4.3 (0.94) 2.4 (0.71) 6.3 (1.12) 14.8 (1.65) 20.9 (1.88)** 12.4 (1.53)** 3.3 (0.83) Annual household income <A$20,000 8.1 (2.16) 5.9 (1.88) 3.7 (1.49) 2.8 (1.3 2) 6.2 (1.91) 12.1 (2.59) 18.3 (3.07) 7.3 (2.07) 6. 7 (1.99) A$20,000 - A$40,000 7.0 (1.79) 7.6 (1.85) 4.0 (1.37 ) 2.0 (0.98) 7.0 (1.78) 19.3 (2.76) 23.6 (2.97) 19. 0 (2.74)** 1.3 (0.79)* >A$40,000 10.1 (1.27) 6.9 (1.07) 5.5 (0.96) 2.2 (0. 62) 5.3 (0.94) 17.2 (1.59) 32.2 (1.97)** 18.4 (1.63 )** 5.5 (0.96) Note 1: probability of proportion being significant ly different from the first value in each demograph ic category * p<0.05, ** p<0.01; significance level s were adjusted to allow for multiple comparisons.

Not surprisingly, there were considerable differences between the 17 forms of CAM in the prop ortions of practitioner visits. For example, in the 12 months preceding the survey, onl y about one sixth (16.4%) of clinical nutrition users had consulted a practitioner, where as about one third (32.9%) of Chinese herbal medicine users and 29.1% of Western herbal m edicine users had visited a practitioner. As might have been expected, the highest proportion s of practitioner visits were by users of provider-based CAM therapies, such as chiropractic (90.6%), acupuncture (81.1%), osteopathy (76.4%) and Western massage therapy (73. 7%) (Table 4.7). It is a safety concern and perhaps somewhat puzzling that nearly one in 10 chiropractic users and approximately one in five users of acupuncture, osteopathy or Wes tern massage therapy did not visit a relevant practitioner. The actual proportion of participants who had visit ed a CAM practitioner in the preceding 12 months was 44.1% (95%CI: 41.1% - 47.1%) of the tota l survey participants (Table 4.8). Of the total practitioner visits, Western massage ther apist visits was found to be the most popular (20.1%, 95%CI: 17.7% - 22.5%); high prevalence was also observed in visits to chiropractors (14.6, 95%CI: 12.4% 5.9% - 9.15). 124 Table 4.7 Percentage of CAM users that visited prac titioners for 17 forms of CAM Percentage** Type of CAM* % 95% CI RSE (%) Clinical nutrition 16.4 (13.1 - 19.7) 10.2 Western massage therapy 73.7 (68.6 - 78.8) 3.5 Meditation 23.7 (17.6 - 29.8) 13.2 Western herbal medicine 29.1 (22.4 - 35.8) 11.8 Aromatherapy 19.3 (13.4 - 25.2) 15.6 Chiropractic 90.6 (86.2 - 95.0) 2.5 Yoga 56.9 (48.3 - 65.5) Naturopathy 55.8 (46.7 - 64.9) 8.3 Acupuncture 81.1 (73.4 - 88.8) 4.9 Chinese herbal medicine 32.9 (22.2 - 43.6) 16.6 Energy healing 46.7 (35.3 - 58.1) 12.4 Homeopathy 47.7 (35.5 - 59.9) 13.1 Qigong, martial art and Tai Chi 53.3 (41.1 - 65.5) 11.7 Chinese therapeutic massage 62.2 (49.3 - 75.1) 10.6 Osteopathy 76.4 (64.5 - 88.3) 7.9 Reflexology 51.5 (36.7 - 66.3) 14.6 Chinese medicine dietary therapy 24.8 (7.9 - 41.7) 34.8 At least 1 of the above forms of CAM 64.0 (60.5 - 67.5) 2.8 * Types of CAM are listed in descending order of t he type of CAM prevalence ** Percentages are of users that visited a practiti oner of a specific type of CAM RSE: relative standard error = (standard error/e stimated prevalence)*100 Relative standard error >25%, results to be inter preted with caution 125 Table 4.8 Percentage of participants that visited p ractitioners for 17 forms of CAM Percentage** Type of CAM* % 95% CI RSE (%) Western massage therapy 20.1 (17.7 - 22.5) 6.1 Chiropractic 14.6 (12.4 - 16.7) 7.4 Acupuncture 7.5 (5.9 - 9.1) 10.8 Clinical nutrition 7.5 (5.9 - 9.1) 10.8 Yoga 6.8 (5.3 - 8.4) 11.3 Naturopathy 5.9 (4.5 - 7.4) 12.2 Western herbal medicine 4.7 (3.5 - 6.0) 13.7 Meditation 4.1 (2.9 - 5.3) 14.7 Osteopathy 3.5 (2.4 - 4.6) 16.1 Energy healing 3.2 (2.2 - 4.3) 16.7 Qigong, martial art and Tai Chi 3.2 (2.1 - 4.2) 16. 9 Chinese therapeutic massage 3.2 (2.1 - 4.2) 17.0 Aromatherapy 3.1 (2.1 - 4.2) 17.1 Homeopathy 2.9 (1.9 - 3.9) 17.8 Chinese herbal medicine 2.3 (1.4 - 3.2) 20.0 Reflexology 2.1 (1.3 - 3.0) 20.8 Chinese medicine dietary therapy 0.6 (0.1 - 1.0) 40 .1 At least 1 of the above forms of CAM 44.1 (41.1 - 47.1) 3.5 * Types of CAM are listed in descending order of th e prevalence of CAM practitioner visits ** Percentages are of survey participants that visi ted a practitioner of a specific type of CAM RSE: relative standard error = (standard error /e stimated prevalence)*100 Relative standard error >25%, results to be interp reted with caution 126 4.1.5.2 Frequency of CAM Practitioners Visits The number of practitioner visits by survey partici pants during the 12 months preceding the survey was determined for the 10 most common provid er-based CAM therapies (Table 4.9). Thirty seven percent (37.0%, 95%CI: 34.2% - 40.0%) of the participants had visited a practitioner of at least one of the 10 forms of CAM listed in Table 4.9, on at least one occasion in the 12-month period. The highest mean n umber of visits was for users of acupuncture (8.8), closely followed by users of chi ropractic (8.4) (see Appendix G2 for the original unweighted data and Appendix G3, statistic al summary of weighted data). The average number of visits to one or more of the types of CAM practitioners in Table 4.9, over the 12-month period was 12.1, which when extra polated to the national adult population, equates to 69.2 million visits. Almost one third of these (32.1%) were to a massage therapist (Western and Chinese therapeutic massage) and over one quarter (27.5%) were to chiropractors, that is, adult Australians made 22.2 million visits to massage therapists and 19.0 million visits to chiropractors in the 12-mont h period. 127 Table 4.9 Frequency of visits to practitioners for 10 forms of CAM Survey participants Estimate for national population * Type of CAM Mean (95%CI) Million (95%CI) Acupuncture 8.75 (5.2 - 12.3) 10.16 (6.0 - 14.3) Chiropractic 8.44 (6.5 - 10.4) 19.05 (14.6 - 23.5) Homeopathy 6.65 (1.9 - 11.4) 2.97 (0.8 - 5.1) Western massage 6.29 (5.1 - 7.5) 19.55 (15.9 - 23.2 ) Chinese herbal medicine 5.98 (3.5 - 8.5) 2.12 (1.2 - 3.0) Osteopathy 5.69 (3.8 - 7.6) 3.08 (2.0 - 4.1) Chinese therapeutic massage 5.43 (3.2 - 7.7) 2.66 ( 1.6 - 3.8) Naturopathy 5.32 (2.9 - 7.7) 4.87 (2.7 - 7.0) Aromatherapy 3.98 (1.8 - 6.2) 1.93 (0.9 - 3.0) Western herbal medicine 3.75 (2.7 - 4.8) 2.76 (2.0 - 3.5) Visits to one or more of the above CAM practitioners 12.1 (10.0 -14.2) 69.15 (57.6 - 81.4) * Based on an adult Australian population of 15.5 m illion and corresponding prevalence of CAM practitioner visits as estimated in the current study (see Table 4.8). Adjusted mean after excluding two obvious outliers 128 4.1.5.3 Characteristics of People Visiting CAM Practitioner s Table 4.10 shows the socio-demographic profiles of survey participants who had visited a CAM practitioner during the preceding 12 months. In general, the findings for practitioner visits were in accord with those for CAM users. Tha t is, higher proportions of those who visited CAM practitioners were female, younger adul ts, people with higher levels of education, those with private health insurance, and those who had higher household incomes. However, it is of interest that there was less vari ation between Australian states in the proportions of participants who had visited a CAM p ractitioner than in the proportions of CAM users. Detailed analyses of the possible region al differences are presented in Chapter 5. Despite the similarities in the socio-demographic p rofiles of CAM users and those who had visited CAM practitioners, there were some differen ces. Thus, there was no statistically significant difference between the proportions of e mployed and unemployed participants that visited CAM practitioners or in the proportions in the two younger age ranges (Table 4.11). On the other hand, unlike the findings for CAM user s, significantly more participants who visited CAM practitioners were born in Australia th an born overseas and a higher proportion had household incomes of $20,000-$40,000 than less than $20,000 (Table 4.11). Table 4.11 presents a detailed cross-tabulation ana lyses that reveals the proportions of survey participants with the specified socio-demographic c haracteristics who had visited practitioners for each of the 17 forms of CAM. The overall patter n of the characteristics' differentials was similar to the findings discussed above relating to the users of each of the 17 forms of CAM, although a statistically significant difference was more commonly detected in visiting provider-based CAM practitioner, such as acupunctur e, massage therapy and osteopathy. 129 Table 4.10 Characteristics of people who had visite d CAM practitioners Visited CAM practitioners Socio-demographic characteristic % (95%CI) p value Gender Male 38.9 (34.7 - 43.1) Female 49.2 (45.0 - <0.01 Country of birth Australia 46.5 (43.1 - 49.9) Other 36.7 (30.7 - 42.7) <0.01 Region New South Wales (34.7 48.1) >0.05 South Australia 44.5 (33.8 - 55.2) >0.05 Western Australia 42.0 (32.6 - 51.4) >0.05 Self-reported education - 54.8) <0.001 Employment Employed 46.3 (42.6 - 50.0) Unemployed or in labour force 40.1 (35.1 - 45.1 ) >0.05 Private health insurance Yes 49.3 (45.3 - 53.3) No 37.9 (33.5 - 42.3) <0.001 Annual household income (A$) <20,000 30.3 (23.2 - 37.4) $20,000 - 40,000 43.2 (36.4 50.0) <0.05 >40,000 49.0 (44.9 - 53.1) <0.001 Note: significance levels were adjusted to allow fo r multiple comparisons * Excludes subjects who did not provide socio-de mographic characteristics Probability of proportion being significantly diffe rent from the first value in each demographic category (Z-test) 130 Table 4.11 Characteristics of people who had visite d practitioners for each of the 17 forms of CAM Percentages (standard error) of people of visiting a practitioner for - Characteristic ACU CHM CTM CMDT QGMATC WHM WTM (1.09) 2.1 (0.62) 3.6 (0.81) 0.6 (0.34) 3.3 (0. 77) 5.9 (1.02) 23.0 (1.81) 15.3 (1.55) 4.0 (0.84) Male 8.1 (1.18) 2.5 (0.67) 2.6 (0.70) 0.5 (0.32) 3.1 (0. 75) 3.5 (0.80) 17.1 (1.64)* 13.8 (1.50) 3.0 (0.74) Age (year) 18-34 6.2 (1.32) 2.6 (0.87) 3.9 (1.06) 0.2 (0.26) 5.9 (1. 29) 5.7 (1.27) 26.0 (2.40) 13.7 (1.88) 2.7 (0.90) 35-64 8.6 (1.20) 2.7 3.1 (0.74) 0.9 (0.47) 1.5 (0. 90)** 2.2 (1.09)* 9.5 (2.16)** 14.6 (2.60) 3.1 (1.2 8) Country of birth Australia 8.1 (0.96) 2.2 (0.52) 3.2 (0.62) 0.5 (0.24) 3.7 (0. 66) 4.2 (0.70) 21.1 (1.43) 16.2 (1.30) 3.7 (0.67) Other 5.8 (1.49) 2.6 (1.01) 3.2 (1.11) 0.9 (0.60) 1.7 (0. 82) 6.8 (1.59) 17.2 (2.40) 9.5 (1.86)** 2.7 (1.04) Self-reported health status Excellent/very good/good 7.1 (0.85) 2.3 (0.50) 2.8 0.7 (0.27) 3.2 (0. 58) 4.9 (0.72) 19.9 (1.33) 14.1 (1.16) 3.6 (0.62) Fair/poor 9.2 (2.28) 2.2 (1.14) 4.9 (1.70) 0.0 (0.00)** 2.5 ( 1.23) 3.9 (1.53) 20.6 (3.19) 16.5 (2.92) 3.0 (1.34) Post-secondary education No 4.7 (0.99) 1.5 (0.57) 2.8 (0.78) 0.4 (0.30) 1.9 (0. 63) 3.3 (0.84) 12.8 (1.57) 13.4 (1.60) 2.2 (0.69) Yes 9.5 (1.19)** 2.9 (0.68) (0.95)* 25.7(1.78)** 15.6 (1.48) 4.5 (0. 84)* Employment Employed 8.4 (1.06) 2.7 (0.62) 3.6 (0.71) 0.7 (0.31) 3.6 (0. 71) 5.4 (0.86) 22.0 (1.58) 15.3 (1.37) 4.0 (0.74) Unemployed or not in labour force 5.3 (1.17) 1.5 (0.64) 2.5 (0.81) 0.4 (0.35) 2.5 (0. 82) 3.8 (1.00) 16.6 (1.95)* 13.4 (1.78) 2.7 (0.85) Private health insurance Yes 9.3 (1.19) 2.9 (0.69) 3.6 (0.76) 0.6 (0.32) 3.2 (0. 72) 4.4 (0.84) 24.9 (1.77) 17.7 (1.57) 4.9 (0.89) No 5.3 (1.03)** 1.5 (0.57) 2.7 (0.75) 0.6 (0.35) 3.2 ( 0.81) 5.2 (1.03) 14.2 (1.62)** 10.6 (1.43)** 1.7 (0.60)** Annual household income (A$) <20,000 4.4 (1.64) 1.0 (0.80) 1.5 (0.95) 1.5 (0.97) 3.0 (1. 36) 4.3 (1.61) 9.3 (2.30) 6.3 (1.93) 4.3 (1.61) $20,000 - 40,000 6.3 (1.69) 2.9 (1.18) 3.2 (1.23) 0.4 (0.45) 3.3 (1. 25) 7.2 (1.80) 15.1 (2.50) 17.2 (2.64)** 0.9 (0.65) * >40,000 8.7 (1.19)* 2.1 (0.60) 3.7 (0.79) 0.4 (0.26) 3.0 (0 .72) 4.6 (0.88) 26.2 (1.85)** 17.3 (1.59)** 4.7 (0.89) Note 1: probability of proportion being significant ly different from the first value in each demograph ic category (Z test) * p<0.05, ** p<0.01;

In total, one in five (20.8%, 95%CI: 18.4% - 23.2%) surveyed part icipants had prayed in the 12 months prior to the survey. Of these, over a quarter (25.7 %, 95%CI: 20.0% - 31.4%) had visited a prayer practitioner, such as a priest, in the 12-mo nth period. A proportion of participants also mentioned that they prayed or visited a professiona l to pray for their health or someone else's health. Detailed percentages of such use, however, were not recorded. Presented in Table 4.12 is the demographic informat ion related to prayer users and people who had visited a practitioner for the purpose of p raying. Importantly, the answers recorded on prayer did not differentiate between \"prayer for personal health purposes\" and \"prayer for religious purposes\". The latter is not normally reg arded as complementary or alternative health care. As opposed to the overall use of the 17 specific fo rms of CAM, the proportion (26.7%) of adults aged 65 or older who had prayed for any reas on was much higher than the proportion among younger adults aged 18-34 (17.9%, p<0.05) who had prayed. It is interesting to note that a statistically significant difference was fou nd between those having a lower household income (less than $20,000, with a prevalence of 26. 7%) and those having a relatively high household income (more than $40,000, with a prevale nce of 17.2%, p<0.05). 133 Table 4.12 Socio-demographic characteristics on use rs of prayer Prayer Visited prayer practitioner Characteristic* % (SE %) P value % (SE %) p value Gender Female 25.3 (1.87) 6.1 (1.03) Male 16.1 (1.60) <0.001 4.5 (0.90) >0.05 Age (year) 18-34 17.9 >0.05 >0.05 65+ 26.7 (3.26) <0.05 7.4 (1.93) >0.05 Country of Australia 20.1 (1.41) 5.3 (0.79) Non-Australia 21.9 (2.62) >0.05 4.7 (1.35) >0.05 Region New South Wales 19.2 (2.08) 4.9 (1.14) Victoria 22.3 (2.54) >0.05 6.3 (1.48) >0.05 Queensland 23.4 (2.95) >0.05 6.7 (1.73) >0.05 South Australia 19.6 (4.36) >0.05 5.3 Australia 15.7 (1.65) >0.05 (2.00) >0.05 Post-secondary education No 18.3 (1.81) 4.2 (0.94) Yes 22.6 (1.70) >0.05 6.2 (0.98) >0.05 Employment Employed 19.4 (1.51) 5.4 or in labour force 24.0 (2.24) >0.05 5.4 (1.18) >0.05 Private health insurance Yes 20.1 (1.64) 6.5 (1.01) No 20.9 (1.88) >0.05 3.7 (0.87) <0.05 Annual household income <A$20,000 >0.05 SE: standard error Note: significance levels were adjusted to allow fo r multiple comparisons * Excludes subjects who did not provide socio-de mographic characteristics Probability of proportion being significantly diffe rent from the first value in each demographic category (Z-test) 134 4.1.6.2 Other Forms of CAM Among all survey participants, less than 5% mention ed the use of forms of other CAM than the 17 named forms of CAM or prayer. Only three par ticipants mentioned that they used other forms of CAM but did not use any of the 17 named CA M therapies or prayer. Diverse answers were provided and none of these therapies had a pre valence of higher than 2% among all participants (Table 4.13).

Thirt y-five CAM users, who did not respond to one or more of the three questions on expenditure, were excluded from the expenditure analysis. The crude expenditure estimations on CAM were skewe d toward the lower values (Figure 4.2, raw data). The maximum expenditure reported by CAM users was $10,000, either on CAM products or on CAM practitioners, and $6,000 on oth er related CAM. Some of the high amounts (e.g. $5,000 spent on visiting CAM practiti oners) were recorded by interviewers and verified by the researchers during the CATI telepho ne interviews. Such values may be considered as the actual expenditure of the users. However, when examining the raw data, a total of 95% users provided an amount of less than $1,500 (see Appendix G4-G6 for the original data and G7 for a statistical summary). Th us, there is a need to adjust for the average expenditure among all CAM users, in order to extrap olate these values to a national level. Figure 4.2 Frequency distribution of CAM expenditur e data 050 100 150 <$500 <$1000 <$2000 >$2000 Number of participants CAM Products CAM Practitioner Related CAM expenditure 136 Since the expenditure reported by a small number of participants appeared to be extraordinarily high, in an attempt to exclude aber rant values in total expenditure estimates, those extremely high values (e.g. in general, a val ue that is higher than the mean\u00b12SD can be considered as a potential outlier) and the same num bers of the lowest value were excluded. To be consistent, these numbers, corresponding approxi mately to 2.5 % of the highest and the lowest expenditure values were ignored. (presented as adjusted means below). Using this correction, the estimated annual expendi ture by survey participants on CAM products, CAM practitioners and other CAM-related i tems is summarised in Table 4.14. Thus, based on a total of 15.5 million adult Australians in 2005, together with the estimated CAM prevalence arising from the survey, the Australian national extrapolated total expenditure in the 12 months preceding the survey is estimated as A$4.13 billion (Table 4.14) (see Appendix G8 for the detailed statistics). On the other hand, as mentioned above, it was estimated that adult Australians had made a total of 69.15 million CAM practitioner visits (see Chapter 4.1.5.2). This suggests that the average out-of-poc ket expenditure to CAM practitioner visits is estimated at A$25 per visit (i.e. A$1.73 billion divided by 69.15 million visits).

Presented in Table 4.15 are adju sted means expenditure for CAM products, CAM practitioners and CAM-related items (weighted), as well as state estimations based on the corresponding state population. Table 4.15 Regional differences of out-of-pocket ex penditure on CAM State expenditure (A$) Products NSW VIC QLD SA WA Adjusted mean 186.7 172.7 187.1 187.4 163.2 SE 16.2 18.7 estimation (million) 664.0 449.4 382.6 128.2 150.9 Test for significant (4, 6 38)=0.20, p=0.938 Practitioners NSW 200.3 644.9 449.2 344.7 106.8 121.7 Test for significant difference via ANOVA: F (4, 4 10)=0.952, p=0.434 Other items related to CAM NSW VIC WA Adjusted mean 181.5 122.7 111.0 52.5 4 8.0 Test for significant difference F (4, 1 56)=0.964, Australia. 138 For CAM products, it appeared that the average expe nditure per user in each state is similar (ANOVA, F (4, 638)=0.20, p>0.05). In addition, the average amount spent on CAM products in most states is similar to the national expenditu re level (A$182.3), although Western Australia users reported a relatively lower average expenditure (A$163.2). On average, South Australia and Western Australia u sers appeared to spend less on visiting CAM practitioners than the estimated national avera ge (approximately A$60 less per person per year), although, again, the differences between states were not found to be statistically significant (ANOVA, F (4,410)=0.952, p>0.05). A much bigger variation (although not significantly different, ANOVA, F (4, 156)=0.964, p>0.05) was found between the costs related to CAM use, such as books, equipment and classes. That is, New South Wales and South Austral ia users had similar costs to the national average; Queensland users had a higher cost, wherea s the costs estimated by Victoria and Western Australia users appeared to be relatively l ow (Table 4.15). In all, at least one third (36.1%) of the total CAM costs in Australia was spent in New South Wales, a further quarter (24.7%) was spent in Victo ria, 20.3% in Queensland, 7.0% in South Australia, 7.8% in Western Australia, and only appr oximately 4.2% was spent in the remaining states and territories. Rather than the p roportions distributed to each state for total CAM costs, individual state expenditure on the cost s of each of the CAM products, CAM practitioners or other related CAM items also had s imilar distributions. For example, at least one third (35.7%) of the total national costs on CA M products was spent in New South Wales, and approximately a quarter (24.2%) was spent in Vi ctoria (Table 4.15). 139 4.2 Discussion 4.2.1 Prevalence of CAM Use 4.2.1.1 Comparison with Other Australian Studies Perhaps the most important finding of the present s tudy is that the prevalence of CAM use in Australia is considerably higher than previously es timated. The current study indicates that 68.9% of the Australian population are CAM users, w hereas the figure usually quoted is 52.2%. 11 The previous estimate is, in fact, an extrapolatio n from the findings of a survey conducted within a single Australian state, South A ustralia, in 2004. 11 Although the types of CAM included in this national study were not identi cal to those in the previous regional study, it is probable that regional differences account fo r the higher national estimate of CAM use. Unfortunately, within the national quota, the regio nal quotas were insufficient to demonstrate what might be real differences in the prevalence of CAM use between Australian states. The current study suggests that only 60.8% of the South Australian cohort were CAM users, whereas for the most populous state, New South Wale s, the prevalence of use was 72.1%, and only slightly lower in Queensland (71.0%) and Victo ria (69.8%). However, as noted above, statistically significant differences between these regional figures were not demonstrated in the current study. The findings of the high prevalence of CAM use in s everal defined states are consistent with previous small-scale regional studies, which were b ased on randomly selected participants in New South Wales. It was suggested that between 67% and 70.3% of participants used CAM during a 12-month period. 37,38 In line with the current global trend of an increa se in the use of CAM over the past decade, the relatively higher pre valence of CAM use as estimated in the present study appears accurate. 140 It is worth noting that CAM modalities investigated in the current and previous studies varied greatly. Thus, comparisons of the prevalence of ind ividual forms of CAM can only be made with limited forms of CAM. In addition, the previou s surveys were conducted in the states of South Australia and New South Wales. Thus, state an d national prevalence of CAM use in the current survey are presented (Table 4.16). Table 4.16 Comparison of CAM prevalence with previo us Australian surveys Current survey prevalence Regional survey prevalence CAM National NSW SA NSW 95 38 NSW 99 37 SA: South Australia ...

For example, the use of clinical nutrition in New South Wales, estimated in the current survey, was 47.3%, while the prevalence in the 199538 and 1999 37 New South Wales surveys was higher. However, these regional surveys include d a broader range of vitamins and minerals, whereas the current survey specified mult ivitamins and minerals, rather than daily consumer vitamin (e.g. vitamin A prescribed by a me dical doctor). On the other hand, the 39.2% of vitamin prevalence in South Australia was estimated separately from mineral supplements use (13.6%). 11 The combined prevalence is considered no less than the South Australia prevalence as estimated in the current st udy (43.6%). Similarly, the previously estimated prevalence of chiropractic and herbal med icine in New South Wales 37,38 and the prevalence of herbal medicine in South Australia 11 were also higher than the current estimated prevalence in each of these corresponding states (T able 4.16). The prevalence of massage therapy use in New South Wales 37,38 and aromatherapy use in South Australia 11 were similar to estimations in the current survey. However, a great variation in the prevalence of homeopathy has been reported. The New South Wales prevalence (5.0%) estimated in the current survey was within the broa d range of that from the New South Wales survey in 1995 (3.0%-8.0%). 38 However, a significantly lower prevalence was esti mated in South Australia (2.2% in 2004), 11 compared to the current estimation for the state o f South Australia (8.9%). These are in contrast to the abov ementioned regional differences in the prevalence of individual forms of CAM, where the pr evalence of homeopathy in South Australia, as estimated in the current survey was h ighest, compared to any other state or territory of Australia. Furthermore, after examinin g the South Australia surveys in 1993, 9 2000 10 and 2004, 11 it is very surprising that the prevalence of homeo pathy decreased substantially from 4.4% in 1993, and 4.3% in 2000 t o the most recent estimate of 2.2% in 2004. The large discrepancy in estimated homeopathy use requires further investigation. 142 Variations in the prevalence of CAM practitioner vi sits between Australian states were somewhat less than variations in the overall preval ence of CAM use. Based on the current findings, the proportion of the Australian adults t hat consulted at least one CAM practitioner over a 12-month period was 44.1%. This is again muc h higher than the prevalence of CAM practitioner visits estimated in the 2004 South Aus tralian study (26.5%). 11 Again, regional differences may, at least in part, explain the diff erence, although, it is also likely that different CAM modalities in the two studies are a factor. For example, importantly, massage therapy was not included in any one of the recent South Aus tralian CAM surveys, 9-11 whereas a substantial proportion of the current survey partic ipants had visited massage therapists. Figure 4.3 presents the prevalence of visits to pra ctitioners of eight individual forms of CAM, that were estimated by the 2004 South Australia sur vey, 11 by the current survey for the State of South Australia, and by the current survey for t he whole nation. As noted above, the current survey provides a higher overall prevalence of CAM practitioner visits in South Australia, compared to the estimated prevalence in previous So uth Australia surveys; this seems to be the same for visits to practitioners of most indivi dual forms of CAM, except naturopaths, herbal therapists, reflexologists and chiropractors . For visits to reflexologists and chiropractors, the South Australia estimates and the current survey estimates for South Australia were similar. Surprisingly, based on the current survey, none of the herbal medicine users from South Austra lia had visited practitioners; and the South Australia survey estimated that only 1.9% had visited such practitioners. 11 A low prevalence of visiting herbal medicine practitioner s was also observed in both studies. It is also important to note the limitations of the curre nt study in drawing conclusions at a state level. In particular, the relatively small number o f interviews that were conducted in South Osteopath Homeopath Aromatherapist Reflexologist Herbal therapist Prevalence of visiting CAM practitioner SA survey in 2004 Current SA estimation Current national estimation Overall CAMP: visits to any one type of CAM practit ioners SA: South Australia Figure 4.3 Prevalence of visits to CAM practitioner s in the current survey and a recent South Australia survey The prevalence of visits to naturopaths estimated b y the South Australia survey 11 (5.7%) was much higher than the current survey estimate for So uth Australian adults (1.3%) but was similar to the national estimation (5.9%). In the 2 004 South Australia study, 11 however, a prevalence of 5.7% was estimated for visits to a na turopath or a natural therapist. The definition of natural therapist is generally broade r than the definition of a defined naturopath, and may have contributed to the different finding. 144 4.2.1.2 Comparison with Overseas Studies It is of interest to compare the current estimated prevalence of CAM use in Australia with the most recent estimates for the United States (62%), 1 Canada (50%), 6 the United Kingdom (28.3%) 5 and Japan (76.0%). 7 The data were collected through the computer-assis ted telephone interview (CATI) method, with the excepti ons of the US data, which were through computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), and th e UK data, which were through postal questionnaire. Detailed data collection methods wer e discussed in Chapter 2.3.2.2. The comparisons of CAM as a whole among these count ries would be less meaningful without the recognition of the limitations of diffe rent forms of CAM being included in these surveys. For example, the 62% CAM prevalence as est imated in the 2002 US survey included prayer specifically for health reasons. 1 When prayer for health reasons was excluded from t he definition of CAM, only 36% of US adults used CAM i n the past 12 months, which is lower than a 1997 US survey conducted by the Harvard Medi cal School (42.1%). 3 The 1998 UK study found a 28.3% CAM prevalence. 5 However, the definition of CAM in this study included only eight forms of CAM. The number of CAM investigated was markedly less than the number investigated by most CAM surve ys in other countries. In addition, in this UK study, except for over-the-counter homeopathic r emedies and herbal remedies, the prevalence of other CAM was based on visits to prac titioners rather than actual CAM use. These may have impacted considerably on the overall prevalence of CAM use in the UK. Surprisingly, a more recent survey conducted by the same group of researchers in 2001 found that only an estimated 10.0% of the UK population h ad received any one of the 23 forms of CAM from practitioners in the past 12 months. 16 Again, this prevalence was for practitioner visits only; the overall prevalence of CAM use in t he UK remains unclear. 145 With respect to the prevalence of specific forms of CAM, this would be clear only if comparisons were made with several common forms of CAM. Again, as noted above, this is due to the names and classifications of individual forms of CAM varying between different surveys in different countries and even within a co untry. For example, the modality of herbal medicine was not singled out in a recent US survey in 2002, thus creating a difficulty in making comparisons with other studies. 1 Nevertheless, presented in Table 4.17 are the common CAM modalities that were investigated in the current survey, the 1997 and 2002 US surveys, 1,3 the 1998 UK survey, 5 the 1999 Canadian survey 6 and the 2001 Japanese survey. 7 A high prevalence of the use of herbal medicine, ma ssage therapy and chiropractic was observed in the current survey, the 1997 US survey and the 1999 Canadian survey. A minimum of 11% of the adult population of these cou ntries had used these therapies during a 12-month period. On the other hand, with the except ion of the extremely popular use of homeopathy as estimated in the UK in 1998 (8.6%), f or most individual forms of CAM, its use among Australians was more prevalent than most other countries. Existing evidence indicates that the practice of, a nd training in, acupuncture is common in the US and the UK. For example, it has been estimated t hat over 10,000 non-physician acupuncturists and nearly 3,000 physicians practise d acupuncture in the US in 1998. 150 In addition, according to the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, a national accrediting agency recognized by the U.S . Department of Education, there were over 50 schools and colleges of acupuncture with ac credited or candidacy status. 151 However, it is surprising to find out that less than 2% of a dults from the US and the UK had used acupuncture, whereas nearly 10% of Australians had done so. In all, the biggest distinction between the prevalence of CAM use in Australia and other countries is in the use of acupuncture, aromatherapy and naturopathy. 146 Table 4.17 Comparison of CAM prevalence with select ed overseas CAM surveys Prevalence (%) CAM AUS 05* US 02 1 US 97 3 UK 98 5 CAN 97 5 JPN 01 7 Acupuncture 9.2 1.1 1.0 1.6 ... 6.7 Chiropractic 16.1 7.5 11.0 3.6 13.0 7.1 Massage therapy 28.8** 5.0 11.1 ... 12.0 14.8 Herbal medicine 19.8** ...*** 12.1 19.8 12.0 17.2 Homeopathy 6.0 1.7 3.4 8.6 4.0 0.3 Aromatherapy 16.1 ... 5.6 3.5 5.0 9.3 Naturopathy 10.7 0.2 0.7 ... ... ... prevalence was not provided in that su rvey * Refers to the current survey that conducted in 2005 ** Prevalence includes different forms of massage therapy or herbal medicine *** The category of \"non-vitamin, non-mineral, natu ral products\" included common herbal medicine, such as Ginseng and Ginkgo biloba. The to tal prevalence was 18.9%. Prevalence included prayer specifically for hea lth reasons. Use of these CAM was not part of the total 42.1 % CAM prevalence. Prevalence was visits to practitioners for name d CAM therapy rather than the actual use. Use of each of the CAM therapies was not estim ated in any UK study. A combined prevalence of chiropractic and osteo pathy was estimated (total, 7.1%) Anecdotally, aromatherapy and naturopathy are commo nly practiced in Australia. Thus, the current survey estimated that nearly one in six Aus tralians had used aromatherapy in the 12 months preceding the survey. The high prevalence wa s also estimated in an Australian regional study. 11 On the other hand, only approximately 5% of Canadi ans and Americans reported the use of aromatherapy. 3,5 Surprisingly, in the 1997 US study the use of aromatherapy was not counted toward the total CAM p revalence. 3 Efforts to ensure the CAM modalities were comparable to a previous 1990 study conducted by the same group of researchers seemed to be the main rationale for exc luding additional, newly investigated 147 therapies in 1997. 2,3 Thus, the total estimated CAM prevalence would be higher in the US if the CAM definition included aromatherapy and naturo pathy. It is also of interest to compare the findings aris ing from the current survey with data for Japan. The prevalence of overall CAM use in Japan i s much higher than most countries, including Australia (Table 4.17). It is not surpris ing that some forms of CAM, including Kampo and acupuncture, are widely accepted in Japan . 7 For example, in addition to the 17.2% adults who used herbs or over-the-counter (OTC) Kam po (Table 4.17), 10% of adults also used ethical Kampo and nearly half (43.1%) of Japan ese adults used a dietary supplement. However, the use of other individual forms of CAM w as relatively lower in Japan than in Australia. Thus, despite the overwhelming number of licensed acupuncturists in Japan (113,000 in 2001), 152 the total prevalence of using acupuncture and moxi bustion in 2001 was only 6.7%, which was lower than the Australian prev alence (9.2%) in 2005. The findings of the current study provide strong ev idence that complementary and alternative medicine forms an integral part of Australia's heal th care system. The popularity of CAM in Australia is not only evidenced by the high prevale nce of common forms of CAM, such as chiropractic and acupuncture. But also by forms of CAM that are not common in other countries, such as aromatherapy and naturopathy. Co ncerning the efficacy and safety of use, further rigorous research in the CAM field in Austr alia is necessary and critical. 148 4.2.2 Characteristics of CAM Users Most commonly, survey studies on CAM prevalence hav e also investigated the use of CAM by different socio-demographic groups. Common chara cteristics related to a higher prevalence of CAM, such as age, educational background, and in come range were first reported in a 1990 US study. 2 The current study suggests a higher prevalence of CAM use by females, by the better educated, by those with higher incomes, by t hose in employment, and by those with private health insurance cover. These findings are generally consistent with reports of similar studies from other countries 1,3 and those of previous Australian studies. 10,11 However, in terms of age difference, the current survey found the hig hest prevalence was among the youngest adults (18-34 years old), rather than by middle-age d adults. Some findings in regard to the characteristics of users may differ between studies . For example, the gender differential in the use of CAM was not observed in two US studies 2,46 and a recent UK study. 16 It is of interest to examine the ethnicity of CAM u sers, as the conclusion drawn from a large population survey suggested that the use of differe nt CAM modalities for treatment versus illness varied across race and ethnicity categories . 153 Although differences in CAM use between Australian residents born in different coun tries were not explored, or between those in different ethnic groups, the findings indicate t hat, in general, individuals who were not born in Australia were less likely to visit a CAM practi tioner than those born in Australia. This finding was similar to the 2004 South Australian st udy, which found that Australian-born residents had used CAM more than those born elsewhe re. 11 The difference of CAM use among different ethnic gr oups was also commonly reported in the US surveys. However, the findings were somewhat con tradictory between studies. For example, both of the Harvard surveys 2,3 found the use of CAM was significantly less common 149 among African Americans (defined as black adults) t han among members of other racial groups. However, a more recently published article suggested that black adults were more likely to use CAM overall, when the definition of C AM included prayer specifically for health purposes. The authors further revealed that the hig h prevalence among black adults was mainly in the use of the mind-body therapies, inclu ding prayer, whereas the use of biological- based therapies, such as multivitamins, was less co mmon. 1 Limited CAM surveys have also explored the associat ion between the use of CAM and users' status of health insurance coverage. Again, commonl y, people with private health insurance were more likely to use CAM. 1,4 This finding is not surprising. However, detailed information on what forms of CAM people with private health ins urance were more likely to use was limited. The current survey has also confirmed high use among those with private health insurance. In addition, the current survey revealed that the common forms of CAM that participants had used, such as chiropractic, acupun cture and remedial massage were usually covered by private health insurance. Thus, for thos e who were less commonly covered by private health insurance, for CAM such as aromather apy, a significant variation of prevalence between people with and without private health insu rance was not observed. In this case, aromatherapy used by those without private health i nsurance was even higher than the use among those with insurance coverage. In terms of regional differences within countries, the trend is obvious that American people who reside in the West of the country are much more likely to use CAM than residents from other regions. 1-4 In addition, in the UK, a relatively high prevalen ce was found in the Midlands and East Anglia, while in the North of Eng land it was lower. 16 In Canada, the highest rate was reported in British Columbia and A lberta. 45,48 In Australia, potential regional differences had not been investigated in the past, as each of the previous surveys was 150 conducted in a single state. Thus, the current surv ey suggests that there are marked regional differences within Australia. The CAM prevalence on the East coast, including New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland was considerably hig her than other states/territories. Another frequently reported characteristic associat ed with CAM use is the health status of the participants, either self-rated general health or s ome specific health conditions. Commonly, people with chronic health conditions are more like ly to use CAM. 45 More specifically, people with conditions such as back pain, allergy and fati gue are frequently found to be associated with a high prevalence of CAM use. 3,46 In the current survey, overall CAM prevalence between people with relatively poor health and thos e in better health was less significant. However, for certain forms of CAM, such as acupunct ure, chiropractic and energy healing, people in poor health were more likely to have used these therapies. Unfortunately, detailed health conditions associated with specific forms of CAM use in Australia's general population were not collected in the current survey, nor in an y previous surveys in Australia. In summary, the common characteristics associated w ith CAM use in Australia are reasonably consistent with the literature in other countries. The current survey better comprehends these general findings in the Australia health context, n otably in the regional differences and the status of health insurance and CAM use among adult Australians. . 151 4.2.3 Economic Considerations of CAM Use The Australian Government's Department of Health an d Ageing estimates that the average number of services provided per patient by medical practitioners in the year ending June 30, 2005 was 5.5. 154 The estimate from the current study is similar, be ing 5.53 visits over a 12- month period. For an adult population of 15.5 milli on (with an estimated 80.8% of them visiting medical practitioners), taking the average number of visits to a medical practitioner per annum as 5.5, the total number of consultations by the adult Australian population in a 12- month period can be estimated as 68.9 million. Agai n, this figure is similar to the current estimate of the total number of visits to CAM pract itioners over a 12-month period (69.2 million). The similar number of practitioner visits for conventional medical services and CAM services is all the more surprising considering that generally, most of the cost of CAM practitioner visits would be borne by users, wherea s medical practitioner consultations are subsidised by the national health system. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIH W) estimated that, between 2003 and 2004, \"out-of-pocket\" expenditure by Australians on all over-the-counter health care products not subsidised by the national Pharmaceutical Benef its Scheme (PBS) was A$4.05 billion. 155 It is of interest to compare this figure with the c urrent estimate of A$1.86 billion spent by Australians on CAM products in the 12-month period. It appears that the annual national expenditure on CAM products accounts for almost hal f the expenditure on non-subsidised health care products. With regard to practitioner s ervices, the AIHW estimated that Australians spent over A$1.6 billion on medical ser vices. The current findings indicate that they spend a similar amount (A$1.73 billion) on CAM practitioner visits. 152 It is of interest to note the CAM expenditure estim ated in two South Australia studies. 10,11 One, conducted in 2000, estimated that over A$2.3 b illion would had been spent by the all Australians, whereas another, more recent, South Au stralia study in 2004 estimated that the cost of CAM had decreased to A$1.8 billion. The adv erse publicity of the Pan Pharmaceutical crisis in 2003 could have contributed to the declin e of the cost, as researchers have mentioned. 11 In contrast, the current survey estimated a much h igher CAM cost incurred by Australians, based on the responses from participan ts nationwide in 2005. It was estimated that the national expenditure on CAM was 4.13 billi on per annum. This was higher than that any previous Australian studies. The amount include d additional expenditure related to CAM use, such as books and audio-visual materials (A$0. 54 billion); this category was not included in any of the previous Australian regional surveys. Whether the current estimation better reflects current utilisation in Australia would nee d to be confirmed in a future well-designed follow-up study with a consistent research protocol . It is also worth noting that the mean expenditure o n CAM practitioners was relatively low in South Australia and Western Australia, compared to the mean expenditure in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria and to the national average. Although not statistically significant, the variations were notable. For examp le, the mean expenditure among South Australian adults was A$80 less than the amount spe nt by New South Wales adults (A$204.1 and A$285.9, respectively) and about A$60 less than the national average (A$263.6). The average expenditure spent on CAM products in differ ent states was reasonably comparable. As noted, the current survey suggests a lower CAM p revalence in the state of South Australia as well as a lower mean expenditure on CAM in South Australia. The above-noted discrepancy between the estimated national CAM expe nditure in the current survey and the extrapolated national expenditure generated from a single state (South Australia) 10,11 requires further consideration. 153 Internationally, out-of-pocket expenditure on CAM w as also estimated in studies conducted in the US, the UK and Canada. The highest expenditure was estimated in the US in 1997, when over $US27 billion was spent by the Americans. Nota bly, expenditure on herbal products alone amounted to $US5.1 billion, and out-of-pocket expenditure on high-dose vitamins more than tripled from US$0.9 billion in 1990 to US$3.3 billion in 1997. 3 A relatively moderate out-of-pocket expenditure on CAM was estimated in a 1997 Canadian study (3.8 billion Canadian dollars). 6 On the other hand, Ernst and Write estimated a tot al of \u00a31.6 billion was spent by UK adults in 1999, based on the average co st of a pre-categorised range of estimations. 17 Thomas and her colleagues estimated the CAM cost o f six \"more established\" therapies, and the annual out-of-pocket expenditure was estimated as \u00a3450 million in UK.5 Thus, the estimated CAM expenditure in the UK studi es may need to be interpreted with caution, as suggested by the researchers. In summary, the estimation of CAM expenditure is su bject to a number of problems. The potential inaccuracies of recall bias (generally, f or a one-year period) are the major concern for the accuracy of extrapolation. Moreover, the gr eater variation of cost estimations by individual CAM users restricts the precision of ext rapolation from a survey population to a national level. As observed in the current survey, a small proportion of participants spent a relatively large amount on CAM, due to their specif ic chronic health conditions, such as trauma. The estimations made from information provi ded by such participants do not necessarily violate the accuracy of such cost estim ation. However, the extreme values may impact substantially on the overall average. Finall y, the totality of the CAM expenditure is also subject to the same weakness of current uncert ainty over the definition and classification of CAM modalities in different social contexts amon g literature. 154 CHAPTER 5. REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN CAM USE As mentioned earlier, regional difference in overal l CAM use in Australia may contribute to the relatively high prevalence found in the current study. It is of particular interest to explore the use of specific forms of CAM and investigate th e characteristics of CAM users in different states and territories in Australia. The findings a nd discussions are presented in this Chapter. 5.1 Results 5.1.1 Overview When interpreting the findings presented in this Ch apter, it is important to note the sample of interviews that were conducted in each state and te rritory. As outlined in Table 3.1, the number of interviews was allocated at a state level based on the recent Australian Bureau of Statistics data. Thus, the final completed intervie ws were: New South Wales (353), Victoria (264), Queensland (206), South Australia (87), West ern Australia (96), other states and territories (61). Overall, the state of New South Wales had the highe st prevalence of CAM use (72.1%), closely followed by Queensland (71.0 %), then Victo ria (69.8%), with South Australia having the lowest rate (60.8%). In terms of visiting a CAM practitioner, the highest prevalence was found in Victoria (48.0%), with Queensland (41.4%) and Western Australia (42.0%) having a lower rate. However, these regional differences wer e not statistically significant (Table 5.1 and Table 5.2). 155 When examining the use of each of the 17 forms of C AM specifically, the significant regional differentials were identified in several modalities between states. As shown in Table 5.2, a substantially low rate of acupuncture use was repor ted in Western Australia (2.7%), whereas the rate was at least three times higher in New Sou th Wales (9.9%, p<0.01), Victoria (10.9%, p<0.01) and Queensland (11.6%, p<0.01). Similarly, significantly low rates were also found in the use of osteopathy in South Australia (1.2%) and Western Australia (2.2%), and the use of naturopathy in Queensland (6.2%) and South Australi a (5.5%). In contrast, Victorian adults favoured the use of aromatherapy the most (20.9%) more than double the use in South Australia (10.0%) and 1.5 times higher than the use in New South Wales (13.8%) and Western Australia (13.7%, p<0.05). Anecdotally, some types of CAM practitioners are mo re popular in some states of Australia than in others. Thus, similar to the findings of th e regional differences of CAM use in Australia, as shown in Table 5.2, it is of interest to see that visits to an acupuncturist were much higher in New South Wales (8.3%) and Victoria (10.1%) than in South Australia (3.2%, p<0.05) and Western Australia (2.7%, p<0.01). Surpr isingly, in South Australia, none of the survey participants had visited practitioners for C hinese herbal medicine, Western herbal medicine or Chinese medicine dietary therapy. 156 Table 5.1 Regional differences of use of 17 forms o f CAM Percent (standard error) of CAM use Regions Any CAM Acupuncture 4.8 (1.13) 2.2 (0.77) 3.7 (1.00) 16.9 (1.98) 27.1 (2.35) 17.0 (1.98) VIC 69.8 (2.80) 10.9 (1.90) 8.8 (1.73) 8.3 (1.68) 3.3 (1.09) 7.7 (1.63)* 17.3 (2.31) 27.2 (2.71) 17.4 (2.31) QLD 71.0 (3.15) (1.27) (0.89) 8.5 (1.94)* 15.0 (2.49) 32.2 (3.25) 14.9 (2.47) SA 60.8 (5.37) 6.9 (2.78) 5.8 (2.57) 2.3 (1.66) 1.7 (1.41) 5.4 (2.48) 10.1 (3.31) 25.3 (4.78) 17.0 (4.13) WA 66.6 (4.60) 2.7 (1.58)** 3.6 (1.80) 4.4 (2.00) 2.5 (1.52) 3.0 (1.66) 15.5 (3.53) 20.4 (3.93) 14.4 (3.42) Regions Osteopathy Homeopathy Naturopathy Meditation Aromatherapy Clinical nutrition Energy healing Reflexology Yoga NSW 6.0 (1.25) 5.0 (1.16) 11.8 (1.70) 16.7 (1.97) 13.8 (1.82) 47.3 (2.63) 5.6 (1.21) 4.0 (1.04) 12.7 (1.76) VIC 5.2 (1.36) 8.0 (1.66) 14.7 (2.16) 18.3 (2.36) 20.9 (2.48)* 43.0 (3.02) 9.1 (1.75) 5.3 (1.36) 12.4 QLD 3.8 (1.34) 4.2 (1.40) 6.2 WA 2.2 (1.43)* 6.4 (2.39) 11.4 (3.10) 17.8 (3.72) 13.7 (3.35) 46.8 (4.86) 9.7 (2.89) 3.8 (1.87) 8.6 (2.73) Note 1: probability of proportion being significant ly different from prevalence in first category (NSW ) (Z-test, *: Q ueensland, SA: South Australia, WA: Western Austral ia Note 3: CHM: Chinese herbal medicine, CTM: Chinese therapeutic massage, CMDT: Chinese medicine dietary therapy, QGMATC: Qigong, martial art and Tai Chi, WHM: Weste rn herbal medicine, WTM: Western therapeutic massag e 157 Table 5.2 Regional differences of visits to practit ioners for 17 forms of CAM Percent (standard error) of visits to CAM practitio ners Regions Any 3.1 (0.92) 0.5 (0.39) 2.2 (0.77) 6.0 (1.25) 21.9 (2.18) 15.0 (1.89) VIC 48.0 (3.05) 10.1 (1.84) 3.7 (1.14) 5.0 (1.33) 1.2 (0.66) 3.9 (1.18) 6.0 (1.44) 22.0 (2.53) 15.9 (2.23) QLD 41.4 (3.43) 7.7 (1.85) 2.0 (0.96) 2.3 (1.04) 0.4 (0.42) 5.3 (1.56) 2.1 (1.00)* 19.3 (2.75) 12.8 (2.32) SA 44.5 (5.46) 3.2 (1.93)* 0.0 (0.00)** 2.3 (1.66) 0.0 (0.00) 1.7 0.0 19.6 (4.37) 16.1 (4.04) WA 42.0 (4.81) 2.7 (1.58)** 1.1 (1.03) 1.3 (1.12) 0.0 (0.00) 0.8 (0.89) 6.7 (2.44) 12.6 (3.23)* 14.4 (3.42) Regions Osteopathy Homeopathy Naturopathy Meditation Aromatherapy Clinical nutrition Energy healing Reflexology Yoga NSW 4.9 (1.14) 3.0 (0.90) 7.2 (1.36) 3.6 (0.98) 2.9 (0.88) 9.2 (1.53) 4.0 (1.04) 1.5 (0.65) 5.8 (1.23) VIC 4.3 (1.24) 3.9 (1.18) 8.7 (1.72) 3.8 (1.16) 4.5 (1.26) 7.8 (1.63) 3.1 (1.05) 3.4 (1.11) 8.8 (1.73) QLD 2.2 (1.02) 1.5 (0.86) 2.3 (1.04)** 5.9 (1.64) 1.2 (0.76) 5.2 (1.55) 1.5 (0.86) 1.6 (0.87) 7.3 (1.81) SA 1.2 (1.18)* 4.9 (2.37) 1.3 (1.25)** 4.4 (2.25) 2.8 (1.82) 6.6 (2.73) 4.2 (2.19) 0.8 (1.01) 5.1 (2.42) WA 1.1 (1.00)* 1.3 (1.12) 6.8 (2.46) 4.0 (1.90) 4.0 (1.91) 6.6 (2.42) 4.2 (1.96) 2.5 (1.52) 4.4 (2.00) Note 1: probability of proportion being significant ly different from prevalence in first category (NSW ) (Z-test, *: Q ueensland, SA: South Australia, WA: Western Austral ia Note 3: CHM: Chinese herbal medicine, CTM: Chinese therapeutic massage, CMDT: Chinese medicine dietary therapy, QGMATC: Qigong, martial art and Tai Chi, WHM: Weste rn herbal medicine, WTM: Western therapeutic massag e 158 5.1.2 Profile of CAM Users in New South Wales More people live in New South Wales (NSW) than any other state or territory of Australia. As noted above, the proportions of CAM users and peopl e visits to CAM practitioners in New South Wales were considerably higher than most othe r states/territories. A sub-group analysis on socio-demographic characteristics that related t o CAM users and people visits to CAM practitioners in New South Wales is summarised in T able 5.3. It is worth noting that when conducting sub-group analyses in all states and ter ritories, the sample sizes become smaller and, consequently, the statistical power of the tes t to detect differences in each region is reduced. Thus, statistically significant difference s are less likely to be observed at a state level. In New South Wales, those participants who consider ed their health as poor or fair were more likely to use CAM (82.8%) than those in better heal th (70.1%, p<0.05). Such a difference, however, was not observed in the national prevalenc e. In addition, New South Wales appeared to be the only state in which such a difference was found. A few national significant findings of people visits to CAM practitioners are also obse rved in New South Wales, such as a higher prevalence among those with a post-secondary educat ion, who have private health insurance, and those with relatively higher income ranges (Tab le 5.3). 159 Table 5.3 Socio-demographic characteristics of CAM users in New South Wales Users Visited practitioners Characteristics* % (95% CI) p % (95% CI) p Gender Female 74.6 - of Birth 47.2 53.5) Unemployed labour (59.9 - 76.8) >0.05 41.9 (32.9 - (31.9 - 47.1) <0.05 household income 55.7 (42.2 - 69.3) - 46.7) 51.6) >0.05 Note: significance levels were adjusted to allow fo r multiple comparisons * Excludes subjects who did not provide socio-de mographic characteristics Probability of proportion being significantly diffe rent from the first value in each demographic category (Z-test) 160 5.1.3 Profile of CAM Users in Victoria The state of Victoria (VIC) is considered the pione er in CAM practitioner regulation in Australia and indeed in Western countries. For exam ple, it is currently the only state in Australia that has introduced mandatory registratio n of Chinese medicine practitioners. Thus, the use of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine (Table 5.1) and, visiting practitioners of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine have been f ound to be more prevalent in this state (Table 5.2). Summarised in Table 5.4 is a sub-group analysis of socio-demographic characteristics that relate to CAM users and people visits to CAM practi tioners in Victoria. The income characteristics relating to both CAM users and peop le visits to CAM practitioners in Victoria were most similar to the national figures. That is, the group of people with higher household incomes (i.e. more than $40,000/pa) had a much high er prevalence of CAM use (79.5%) and visits to CAM practitioners (59.3%) than low-income participants (i.e. less than $20,000/pa) (55.2% and 34.4% respectively, p<0.01). Again, simi lar to the overall national prevalence, the high prevalence of visits to CAM practitioners is a lso significantly higher for those born in Australia and among younger adults (both, p<0.05). 161 Table 5.4 Socio-demographic characteristics of CAM users in Victoria Users Visited practitioners Characteristics* % (95% CI) p % (95% CI) p Gender Female 74.2 - <0.05 Country of Birth - 77.9) No 61.9 (52.9 - 71.0) 41.7 Yes - - 79.7) 49.5 (41.9 - 57.2) Unemployed or labour (54.0 - 72.8) >0.05 - 78.9) (41.3 - 57.8) 75.8) 45.9 (37.2 - 54.7) income (40.6 - 69.7) - 48.2) A$20,000-A$40,000 <0.01 Note: significance levels were adjusted to allow fo r multiple comparisons * Excludes subjects who did not provide socio-de mographic characteristics Probability of proportion being significantly diffe rent from the first value in each demographic category (Z-test) 162 5.1.4 Profile of CAM Users in Queensland Surprisingly, although the prevalence of CAM use in Queensland (QLD) was considerably high, the prevalence of visits to CAM practitioners , however, was the lowest (41.4%). This raises a safety concern that a relatively large pro portion (41.8%) of CAM users in Queensland self-administered CAM products and therapies, compa red with a relatively lower proportion in other states (between 26.7% to 37.5%). After inv estigating this proportion in the use of each of the 17 forms of CAM and visits to CAM pract itioners, the larger proportions of Queensland adults who self-administered Chinese her bal medicine (76.1%) and Western herbal medicine (85.8%) may partially explain the c urrent findings (Table 5.1 and Table 5.2). The previously mentioned large gender differential in the prevalence of CAM and visits to CAM practitioners in Australia nationwide was found to be statistically significant only in Queensland (Table 5.5) (female users vs. male users , p<0.01). Female adults in Queensland tended to be more likely to use CAM (82.0%) than ma le adults (59.9%). Interestingly, such a gender difference in CAM use was not observed in an y of the other states. Furthermore, the proportion of CAM users among the group of Queensla nd young adult (82.1%) was higher than in any other state. Also, there was least vari ation (67.6%, 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively) in CAM use among different income earners who resid ed in Queensland. 163 Table 5.5 Socio-demographic characteristics of CAM users in Queensland Users Visited practitioners Characteristics* % (95% CI) p % (95% CI) p Gender Female 82.0 (74.6 - 89.3) 52.1 - 61.6) Male - 69.4) (21.5 Birth (66.8 - 80.2) - 49.9) 84.4) >0.05 44.4 (27.4 74.2 (66.9 - 81.5) 43.2 (34.9 - 51.4) Unemployed or not in labour force 67.5 (56.1 - 78.9) >0.05 39.4 (27.5 - 51.2) >0.05 Private health insurance Yes 75.6 (67.4 - 83.8) 46.5 (36.9 - 56.1) No 66.4 (57.2 - 75.6) >0.05 36.1 (26.8 - 45.4) >0.05 Annual household income <A$20,000 74.5 (58.6 - <0.05 Note: significance levels were adjusted to allow fo r multiple comparisons * Excludes subjects who did not provide socio-de mographic characteristics Probability of proportion being significantly diffe rent from the first value in each demographic category (Z-test) 164 5.1.5 Profile of CAM Users in South Australia Overall CAM use in South Australia (SA) was conside red to be the lowest in the current study (excluding Australian Capital Territory, Northern T erritory and Tasmania), although this was not the case when considering visits to CAM practit ioners rather than CAM use (Table 5.1 and Table 5.2). Surprisingly, a high prevalence of both homeopathy users and visits to homeopaths was observed in South Australia. The pro portions of these (8.9% and 4.9%, respectively) were double those proportions in Quee nsland (4.2% of use and 1.5% of practitioner visits respectively). Moreover, althou gh the use of energy healing in South Australia was the lowest (5.3%), the prevalence of visits to energy healing practitioners in South Australia, however, was the highest (4.2%). In contrast, apart from the previously mentioned lo w rate of use of acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Chinese therapeutic massage and We stern herbal medicine in South Australia, the lowest rates of naturopathy use (5.5 %) and visits to naturopaths were also found in South Australia (1.3%), being about three times less than any other state except Queensland (p<0.05). Less significant findings were found in the charact eristics of CAM users in South Australia. In regard to visits to CAM practitioners, the largest variability in participant characteristics was private health insurance and household incomes. The variations were considerably higher than for any other state of Australia. For example, Sout h Australian adults with private health insurance were two times more likely to visit a CAM practitioner than those South Australians without private health insurance (52.0% vs. 20.5%, p<0.01, Table 5.6). Finally, in contrast to the considerably higher prevalence of CAM use among females in other states (generally more than 70%), the lowest rate of CAM use by females wa s in South Australia (62.5%). 165 Table 5.6 Socio-demographic characteristics of CAM users in South Australia Users Visited practitioners Characteristics* % (95% CI) p % (95% CI) p Gender Female 62.5 (47.9 - 77.1) - 58.9) of - 56.2) 88.1) (19.6 Post-secondary education No - 80.1) 48.4 (34.4 - 62.5) Unemployed or not in labour (35.4 - 68.8) >0.05 39.0 (51.0 - 74.9) 52.0 (39.7 - 64.4) No 53.9 (31.9 - 75.9) >0.05 20.5 (2.7 - 38.4) <0.01 Annual household income 57.5 (25.1 Note: significance levels were adjusted to allow fo r multiple comparisons * Excludes subjects who did not provide socio-de mographic characteristics Probability of proportion being significantly diffe rent from the first value in each demographic category (Z-test) # Too few responses to calculate the CI 166 5.1.6 Profile of CAM Users in Western Australia In contrast to the less significant findings among CAM users in South Australia, CAM users in Western Australia appeared to have a higher corr elation with their socio-demographic characteristics. Most significantly, Western Austra lia has the highest CAM prevalence (83.2%) among people with post-secondary education than any other state. In addition, when comparing those with post-secondary education and t hose without such education, Western Australia is the only state in which significant di fferences were observed both in CAM users and in people visits to CAM practitioners (p<0.01 f or CAM users and p<0.05 for people visits to CAM practitioners). Also, Western Australia is t he only state in which statistically significant differences were observed in both the p revalence of CAM use and visits to CAM practitioners (p<0.01), with respect to users' priv ate health insurance coverage status (Table 5.7). In Western Australia, a large variation was a lso found in the country of birth of people visits to CAM practitioners, that is, people born i n Australia were more likely to visit CAM practitioners (51.1%) than those born overseas (21. 3%, p<0.01). This finding is similar to CAM users in Victoria. 167 Table 5.7 Socio-demographic characteristics of CAM users in W estern Australia Users Visited practitioners Characteristics* % (95% CI) p % (95% CI) p Gender Female 74.2 (62.4 - 86.0) 51.0 (37.5 - 64.5) Male - (20.3 >0.05 Country of Birth Australia (59.5 - 80.5) - 62.6) Non-Australia 75.8) 42.5) Yes - 81.7) 45.7 (34.3 - 57.1) Unemployed or not in labour force 56.0 (38.1 - 73.8) >0.05 32.5 (15.6 - 49.3) >0.05 Private health insurance Yes 75.6 (65.3 - 85.8) 51.1 (39.2 - 63.0) No 50.4 (34.5 - 66.4) <0.01 25.7 (11.8 - 39.7) <0.01 Annual household income <A$20,000 74.1 (52.6 - 95.7) 72.7) >0.05 41.1 (28.4 - 53.8) >0.05 Note: significance levels were adjusted to allow fo r multiple comparisons * Excludes subjects who did not provide socio-de mographic characteristics Probability of proportion being significantly diffe rent from the first value in each demographic category (Z-test) 168 5.1.7 Profile of CAM Users in Other States/Territories Apart from the five major states discussed above, d ata on CAM and visits to CAM practitioners were also collected from the state of Tasmania (TAS), the Northern Territory (NT) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Si xty-one interviews were conducted in these regions (26 each in Tasmania and in the Austr alian Capital Territory, and nine in the Northern Territory). Thus, combined results were pr esented. It is important to note that when examining the prevalence of specific use between di fferent characteristics, the sample size is too small to calculate a 95% confidence interval in several items (Table 5.8). In general, approximately half (49.6%, 95%CI: 34.8% to 64.4%) of the adult populations of the above three regions combined, were CAM users, w hile less than one in three (29.4%, 95%CI: 15.9% to 42.9%) adults had visited CAM pract itioners. Specifically, CAM use was higher in Northern Territory, being about 71.1% (95 %CI: 34.0% to 108.1%), with 38.3% (95%CI: -1.4% to 78.1%) visiting CAM practitioners. The prevalence of CAM use in Tasmania was lower tha n the national average about 52.3% (95%CI: 32.1% to 72.5%), with 29.7% (95%CI: 11.2 % to 48.2%) visiting CAM practitioners. Lastly, in Australian Capital Territory the prevale nce of CAM use was about 36.9% 61.6%), with 25.5% (95%CI: 3.2% to 47.8%) visiting CAM practitioners. Again, as noted in the Methodology section, the total number of interviews in these states/territories is not adequate to determine conclusive prevalence of CAM use. 169 Table 5.8 Socio-demographic characteristics of CAM users in other states/territories Users Visited practitioners Characteristics* % (95% CI) p % (95% CI) p Gender Female 60.4 (38.5 - 82.3) 39.0 (17.2 - 60.9) Male 41.3 (21.9 - 60.7) >0.05 22.0 (5.7 - 38.3) >0.05 Age (year) 18-34 50.4 (24.1 - 76.6) 38.3 (12.7 - 63.8) 35-64 Country of Birth Australia 49.0 (32.7 - 65.4) 26.9 (12.4 - 41.4) Non-Australia 57.8 (21.7 - 94.0) >0.05 45.2 (8.8 - 98.1) >0.05 16.4 # >0.05 Post-secondary education No 52 (27.1 - 76.9) 30.2 (7.3 - 53.1) Yes 49.7 (31 - 68.3) >0.05 29.8 (12.8 - 46.9) >0.05 Employment Employed 59.0 (40.1 - 78.0) 32.5 (14.4 - 50.5) Unemployed or not in labour force 37.7 (14.8 - 60.6) >0.05 26.2 (5.4 - 46.9) >0.05 Private health insurance Yes 55.1 (35.1 - 75.1) 34.0 (15.0 - 53.0) No 64.8) - 42.7) >0.05 - 74.4) 50.4 (12.2 - (18.2 - 58.0) <0.01 Note: significance levels were adjusted to allow fo r multiple comparisons * Excludes subjects who did not provide socio-de mographic characteristics Probability of proportion being significantly diffe rent from the first value in each demographic category (Z-test) # Too few responses to calculate the CI 170 5.1.8 Geographical Summary of CAM Use in Australia The prevalence of CAM use and visits to CAM practit ioners in states and territories of Australia can b e geographically summarised in the map below (Figure 5.1). Figure 5.1 Prevalence of CAM use in Australia prese nted in a map 171 5.2 Discussion Anecdotally, the practice of some forms of CAM, suc h as acupuncture and herbal medicine, are more common in a number of states in Australia. To a certain degree, the suggestions that people who live in New South Wales and Victoria are more likely to use CAM and visit CAM practitioners than any other states, has been confi rmed in the present study. Thus, this study observed that South Australia has a much lower usag e of CAM, compared to other states in Australia. Logically, the proportion (60.8%) of Sou th Australian residents who used CAM seems consistent with previous estimations. 11 In addition, the proportion (72.1%) of New South Wales adults who used CAM is also consistent with previous New South Wales estimations. 37,38 As noted in Table 5.1 and Table 5.2, regional diffe rences in the use of certain forms of CAM are also in accord with the existing literature. Fo r example, a previous workforce survey identified a relatively small number of Western her bal medicine and naturopathy practitioners in South Australia, compared to New South Wales, Vi ctoria, Queensland and Western Australia. 12 Consistently, based on the current survey, the low est prevalence of both Western herbal medicine use and naturopathy use were estima ted in South Australia. Homeopathy is the only CAM modality for which the h ighest prevalence was observed in South Australia. A detailed rationale for the high usage is not clear. However, incidentally, there is a view that the high use of homeopathy in South Australia actually relates to the history of Germany immigration to that state. The l owest prevalence of homeopathy use was reported in Queensland. However, this seems to be i n contrast with the general trend observed in the current survey that Queensland residents fav oured the use of most forms of CAM. So there is an aspect of interpreting intra-Australian differences which requires further work 172 around the social, cultural and historical developm ents in different states (just as these factors influence differences across countries). At the time of conducting the survey, Victoria was still the sole Australian state in which acupuncturists and Chinese herbal medicine practiti oners were subject to statutory registration. Thus, it is not surprising to see tha t the prevalence of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine use in Victoria was amongst the hig hest. In particular, the proportion of Victorian residents who had visited acupuncturists was three to four times higher than in South Australia and Western Australia. This implied that statutory registration could impact greatly on the public's confidence in using Chinese medicine, thus impacting on the proportion of residents from this region seeking Ch inese medicine care. The general opinion of the impact on public confidence in Chinese medic ine practitioner mandatory registration was also sought, and is presented in 7.1.5.2. In Western Australia the prevalence of each individ ual form of CAM was generally lower than those for other states. However, the proportion of Western Australia adults who used energy healing such as reiki, and the proportion of Wester n Australia adults who had visited practitioners for energy healing were the highest a mong all states. In addition, the proportion of Western Australia adults who used meditation was higher than the prevalence in New South Wales and South Australia, but similar to the prevalence in Victoria and Queensland. A large regional variation of CAM use was found in the prevalence of aromatherapy. The extraordinarily high prevalence in Victoria may ind icate a greater aromatherapy market there than any other states. In all, there is evidence to conclude that there are regional differences in the use of certain forms of CAM in Australia. Howev er, factors that may contribute to such differences cannot be answered by the current surve y. 173 CHAPTER 6. USE OF FOUR SPECIFIC FORMS OF CAM: ACUPUNCTURE, CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINE, CHIROPRACTIC AND OSTEOPATHY As part of the study, specific questions were desig ned to investigate the usage and related issues on four specific forms of CAM. These are acu puncture, Chinese herbal medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy. The methodology has be en described in Chapter 3.3. This Chapter provides results on these therapies and dis cusses implications of the findings. 6.1 Results 6.1.1 Chinese Medicine (Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Me dicine) 6.1.1.1 Overview In this section, data on overall Chinese medicine u tilisation and detailed information on specific forms of Chinese medicine, for example, ac upuncture and Chinese herbal medicine are presented. The definition of Chinese medicine u ser (CM user) refers to a person who uses any one of the five major forms of Chinese medicine : acupuncture (ACU), Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), Chinese therapeutic massage (CTM), Chinese medicine dietary therapy (CMDT), and Qigong, martial art and Tai Chi (QGMATC ). This definition also applies to those who had visited any one of the five types of Chinese medicine practitioners. Additional details on acupuncture and Chinese herba l medicine in relation to economic consideration, the rationale for use and the percei ved and actual benefits and adverse events are also presented in this Chapter. Results on regu lation and health insurance related to Chinese medicine are presented in relevant sections of Chapter 7. 174 6.1.1.2 Total and Specific Prevalence of Chinese Medicine U se Overall, a total of 210 participants (weighted perc entage, 19.3%, 95%CI: 16.9% - 21.7%) reported using Chinese medicine (CM) in the 12-mont h preceding the survey. As expected, the most common CM modality was acupuncture (9.2%, 95%CI: 7.5% - 10.9%). The use herbal medicine ( 95%CI: 1.4% - 3.2%) and Qigong, martial art and Tai Chi (6.0%, 95%CI: 4.6% - 7.4%). There were two participants (both female from Austr alia and from New Zealand) who had used all these five forms of CM. A total of 16 part icipants (7.6% of all CM users) had used all three major forms of CM (i.e. Acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine and Chinese herbal medicine). Among those who had used Chinese medicin e dietary therapy, five out of 28 (17.9%) had used Chinese medicine dietary therapy o nly but had not used other forms of CM (see Table 4.4). A total of 131 participants (11.9%, 95%CI: 10.0% to 13.9%) had visited at least one type of CM practitioner. Most acupuncture users (81.1%) had visited an acupuncturist, while the majority (75.2%) of Chinese medicine dietary therap y users did not visit a practitioner for the therapy. Among all survey participants, a total of 7.5% (95%CI: 5.9% to 9.0%) had visited an acupuncturist, while the prevalence of visits to CH M, Chinese therapeutic massage, Chinese medicine dietary therapy and Qigong, martial art an d Tai Chi practitioners was 2.3% 1.0%), respectively (see Table 4.8). 175 For both prevalence of CM use and visits to CM prac titioners, there were some large differences between states (Table 6.1 and Figure 6. 1). The lowest prevalence was always observed in Western Australia (Table 6.1), whereas New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria appeared to have a greater prevalence of C M use and visits to CM practitioners. It is worth-noting that although 17.2% of South Australia adults had used CM, only 6.5% had visited CM practitioners. Specifically, these signi ficant differences in visiting CM practitioners were also found in visits to both acu puncturists and Chinese herbal medicine practitioners (p<0.05, see Table 5.1 and Table 5.2) .

Together with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM, 5.98 visits per annum) and Ch inese therapeutic massage (5.43 visits per annum), a total of 105 people (9.5% of total su rvey participants) had visited practitioners for any one of three forms of Chinese medicine. Thi s can be transformed into a total of 14.94 million visits for the adult Australian population (10.16 million, 2.12 million and 2.66 million for acupuncturists, CHM practitioners and Chinese t herapeutic massage practitioners, respectively). The average out-of-pocket expenditure of visiting a CAM practitioner, as estimated in the current survey was A$25 (see Chapter 4.1.7.1). When extrapolating this to the estimated national visits to Chinese medicine practitioners, it suggests that a total of A$373.5 million was paid out-of-pocket to Chinese medicine practiti oners per annum. Of this, A$254 million was spent on visiting acupuncturists, A$53 million was spent on visiting CHM practitioners and, the remaining A$66.5 million was on Chinese th erapeutic massage therapists. Apart from the costs related to practitioner consul tation and treatment, both acupuncture and CHM users had also estimated additional costs relat ed to their treatment. And for CHM, users had separated the costs of herbal medicine and/or o ther items related to CHM, such as books or equipment. A total of 17 acupuncture users spent additional costs related to acupuncture. The estimated cost from one user is considered as o utlier ($6,000), applying the same protocol in calculating CAM costs (see Chapter 4.1.7.1), thu s, among those had spent additional costs related to acupuncture, the adjusted median cost wa s A$88.14. Nationwide, this equals to A$21.80 million acupuncture-related costs. 178 Of the total CHM users who had spent additional cos ts to the actual Chinese herbal medicine (71 users, or 6.4% of total participants) and CHM-r elated products (22 users, or 2.2% of total participants), the median cost was A$100 and A$60, respectively, excluding extreme values (A$4,500 or above, two were herbs and two were CHM- related items). Thus, the national expenditure can be estimated as A$103.11 million fo r Chinese herbs and A$21.83 million for CHM related costs (see Appendix G9 for the original cost and G10 for a summary statistics of the adjusted data). 179 6.1.1.4 Acupuncture Treatment Provided by Medical Doctors Given that there is evidence that a considerable pr oportion of registered medical doctors (GPs) is providing acupuncture treatment to their patient s, acupuncture users were asked whether at least one of the practitioners they visited for acu puncture treatments was a medical doctor, such as a GP or a medical specialist. Of the 82 par ticipants who had visited a practitioner for acupuncture treatment, well over one quarter (29.1% ) had received acupuncture treatment from their GPs. Of these, over half (59.1%) had rec eived acupuncture from their GPs only but not from non-GP acupuncturists. In terms of the frequency of visits to acupuncture practitioners, either to GPs or to traditional acupuncturists, participants provided estimations f or the 12-month preceding the survey. Of the total of 24 adults who had received acupuncture from their GPs, a total of 9.3 visits were estimated for the 12-month period, with a median of 4.0 visits per year (two participants mentioned they visited their GPs once a week for a spinal injury and arthritis). On the other hand, 67 participants had received acupuncture trea tment from non-GP acupuncturists, including nine persons who had received treatment f rom both GPs and non-GP providers. Among these (67 participants), the average number o f visits during the 12-month period was 7.44, and the median was 4.0. The two highest numbe r of visits were 60 and 45, which were estimated by a patient with broken spine and by ano ther patient with chronic fatigue syndrome. When combining all visits to GPs and non-GP acupunc turists (considered as visiting a practitioner for acupuncture), the mean number of v isits per year was 8.75, with a median of 4.0. The mean number of visits was used to estimate the national total number of visits for acupuncture treatment in Australia (see Table 4.9). 180 6.1.1.5 Characteristics of Chinese Medicine Users The common characteristics for Chinese medicine (CM ) users are consistent with most previous findings on CAM users. In general, relativ ely young, with a secondary education and employed contributed significantly to a relatively high prevalence of CM use (p<0.05). Furthermore, the most significant factor related to the use of CM and visits to CM practitioners was educational background. Compared to those without post-secondary education, people having a post-secondary education appeared to be more likely to use CM (22.4% vs. 15.3%) and to visit CM practitioners (14 .8% vs. 8.1%) (p<0.01) (Table 6.2). For each CM modality (see Table 4.6), the demograph ic statistics related to individual prevalence were different. The above noted marked e ducational difference in CM use was also found in the use of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine (any of the modalities, p<0.01), but not in other forms of CM. Surprisingly, Austral ian-born adults were more likely to use acupuncture (10.2%) than those born overseas (6.5%, p<0.05), but less likely to use CHM (5.5% vs. 4.7%, p<0.05). A low prevalence of CHM use was also observed in th ose aged 65 or above (2.6% compared to 8.1% among those aged 18-34, p<0.05) and those u nemployed (4.6% compared to 8.1% among employed participants, p<0.05) (Table 4.6). M oreover, for Chinese therapeutic massage, the only significant difference in use was found between younger adults (aged 18-34 5.7%) and older adults (65 and older, 2.4%, p<0.05) . Interestingly, 28 participants (2.8% of total participants) had used Chinese medicine dieta ry therapy, all of whom were from the group of people who rated their personal health as good or better; whereas, no participants who rated themselves in poor health had used Chines e medicine dietary therapy (p<0.01). Not 181 unexpectedly, younger people were more likely to pr actice Qigong, martial art and Tai Chi (9.5%) than the middle-age group (4.7%, p<0.01) and older people (2.9%, p<0.01).

With an interest to produce a mode l that best describe the characteristics of Chinese medicine (CM) users. Separate regression mo dels were developed. These are on overall CM use (of any one of the five modalities), on acupuncture use and on Chinese herbal medicine use. Again, unless otherwise indicated, th e regression results presented are unweighted. Variables that significantly (p<0.05) related to CM or acupuncture or CHM use were summarised in Table 6.3. These were the variables t hat had been entered into each individual regression model. The best-fit significant results of the multivariate analysis are presented in Table 6.4. They show post-secondary education, had consulted a GP in the preceding 12- month and coverage of CAM influenced the private in surance purchase contributed significantly to a participant's decision to use ac upuncture. In addition, for the use of CHM, the factors pertaining to a participant's age range s and country of birth were also significant predictors. Considering the overall use of CM, similar to the f indings on acupuncture users, the factors of educational background and the belief that coverage of CAM influenced the private insurance purchase were statistically significant. It is also worth noting that being resident in different regions in Australia may also impact significantly on the possibility of CM use. As shown in Table 6.4, when using Western Australia as the refe rence group, the Victoria adults and the Queensland adults were respectively 2.5 and 3.0 tim es more likely to use CM than adults in Western Australia. 183 Table 6.3 Predictor variables employed in the regre ssion models on Chinese medicine use Predictors ACU CHM CM Demographic factors (block 1) ... group ...

The vast majority (92.0%) said it was for the purpose of tre ating medical conditions, including 14.1% who used it for both general health improvement and medical conditions. The remaining 8.0% used acupuncture for improving general health and w ell-being only. Among those who used acupuncture for a medical condition, the most commo n conditions were back pain and related problems (20.7%), shoulder pain and problems (15.5% ), arthritis (8.5%), injury (7.0%) and knee-related problems (5.1%). The detailed medical conditions related to the use of acupuncture are presented in Table 6.5. Specificall y and significantly, the majority of those who used acupuncture for treating medical condition s were aged 35-64 (97.2%) and 65 and older (92.0%), while only 80.6% users aged 18-34 us ed acupuncture for this purpose (2=6.258, p=0.044).

About two thirds (60.4%) used it to treat medical conditions, includ ing 29.7% who used it both for general health improvement and medical conditions. Thus, ov er 39.6% used CHM to improve general health and well-being only. Among those who used CH M for a medical condition, the most common conditions were colds and flu (11.6%), and p roblems related to energy level (8.5%). There were at least 30 different conditions for whi ch people had used CHM (Table 6.6). Specifically, the highest prevalence of CHM use for medical conditions was among those aged 35-64 (72.0%), followed by those aged 18-34 (5 1.0%), while only 14.8% of those aged 65 and older used CHM for treating medical conditio ns ( 2=7.292, p<0.026). In addition, those having private health insurance were also mor e likely to use CHM for medical conditions (73.0%) than those without it (41.6%, 2=6.935, p=0.008).

Expectations of and Actual Outcome of Using Acupunc ture Table 6.7 summarised the responses (number and perc entage) from acupuncture users on their expectations and outcomes. Nearly half (48.5%) of u sers expected acupuncture could cure their disease. After receiving treatment, over half (59.2%) of these users considered acupuncture had cured their disease or had solved t he health problem they had before the treatment. In addition, seven out of 30 (23.3%) use rs who did not consider acupuncture would cure their disease found acupuncture did provide su ch an outcome. A further six users who had been unsure whether acupuncture would cure thei r disease/solve their problem had also experienced a positive outcome, thus, the total pos itive outcome of curing diseases or solving health problems was 41.6%. More users considered the outcome of acupuncture wo uld be a relief of symptoms (72.3%) or that it would improve general health and well-being (71.3%) than cure the diseases (48.5%). Among those who considered acupuncture would reliev e their symptoms of illnesses, the majority (89.0%) had experienced a positive outcome . A high proportion of users who did not believe the outcome would be a relief of symptoms, or who were uncertain about this outcome, also reported a positive outcome (90.0% an d 77.8%, respectively). This represented a total positive outcome of 87.1% in the use of acu puncture to relieve symptoms. 188 In all, nearly four out of five (78.2%) users consi dered acupuncture likely to improve their general health and well-being. The percentage was h igher among those who had a positive expectation of using acupuncture to improve their g eneral health (i.e. 86.1%). When taking no consideration of users' expectations towards acupun cture before treatment, about one-third (33.7%) users considered that acupuncture had helpe d them achieve all three outcomes. However, six acupuncture users responded that there was no effect after treatment. Demographic information of none of these six users had been found to be particular noticeable, although these users resided in four di fferent states other than Victoria.

Similar to the expectation of acupuncture curi ng disease, just over half (53.2%) of users expected CHM would cure their disease. After receiving treatment, over two thirds (70.7%) of these users considered CHM had cured the ir disease or had solved the health problem they had before treatment. In addition, nea rly one in five (16.7%) users who did not consider CHM would cure their disease had found CHM did provide such an outcome. A further eight users who were unsure whether CHM wou ld cure their disease/solve their health problem had experienced a positive outcome, thus, t he total positive outcome of curing diseases or solving problems was 51.9%. More users considered the outcome of CHM would be a relief of symptoms (79.2%) or would improve general health and well-being (84.4%) than cure the diseases (53.2%). Among those who considered CHM would relieve their symptoms of illnesses, the majority (90.2%) experienced a positive outcome. A high proportion o f users who had not believed a relief of symptoms was possible or who had been uncertain abo ut such an outcome also reported a positive outcome (75.0% and 66.7%, respectively). T his represented a total positive outcome of 85.7% towards relieving symptoms by CHM. In all, nearly nine out of ten (89.6%) users consid ered CHM was favourable in improving their general health and well-being. The percentage was h igher among those who had a positive expectation of using CHM to improve their general h ealth (i.e. all but two users, or 96.9%). When taking no notice of users' expectations toward s CHM before treatment, a total of 33 (42.9%) users considered that CHM had helped them a chieve all three outcomes. In contrast, there were two CHM users who reported there was no effect after treatment. Neither of these had expected CHM would cure their disease or reliev e their symptoms. 190 Table 6.8 Expectations of and actual outcomes of us ing Chinese herbal medicine After treatment (outcome) Before Treatment (expectation) Yes, n (%)* No, n (%)* Not sure, n (%)* Cure the disease/solve the problem, n (% of users)* * Yes 41 (53.2%) 29 (70.7%) 7 (17.1%) 5 No 18 (23.4%) (16.7%) (83.3%) (0%) sure 18 (23.4%) 8 (44.4%) 2 8 Total 77 40 (51.9%) 24 ( 1.2%) 13 (16.9%) Relief of symptoms, n (% of users)** Yes 61(79.2%) 55 (90.2%) 3 (4.9%) 3 (5.2%) (75.0%) (25.0%) (0%) sure 12 (15.6%) 8 (66.7%) 4 (33.3%) 0 (0%) Total 77 66 (85.7%) 8 (10.4%) 3 (3.9%) Improve general health and well-being, n (% of user s)** Yes 65 (84.4%) 63 (96.9%) 2 (3.1%) 0 4 (5.2%) (0%) (75.0%) (25.0%) sure 8 (10.4%) 6 (75.0%) 0 (0%) 2 (25.0%) Total 77 69 (89.6%) 5 (6.5%) 3 (3.9%) * Numbers and percentages are of users within each row category ** Numbers and percentages are of total acupuncture users General Helpfulness of Acupuncture and Chinese Herb al Medicine All users also rated their experience on the overal l general helpfulness of acupuncture and CHM. A great proportion of users considered acupunc ture treatment they had used was very helpful (60.0%) or somewhat helpful (30.1%), while a small proportion of users considered the outcome was not very helpful (six users, 5.1%) or not at all helpful (three users, 2.7%). These proportions were similar among the rating tow ards CHM. The vast majority of CHM users believed CHM treatment they had used was very helpful (55.6%) or somewhat helpful (39.3%), while two persons considered CHM was not v ery helpful or not at all helpful. 191 6.1.1.9 Safety Concerns of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal M edicine Use Adverse Events after Acupuncture and Chinese Medici ne Treatment Among all acupuncture users, four persons reported adverse events (patient self-perceived) after having acupuncture treatment, but one of the answers was not recorded by the interviewer. Three users referred to the pain of th e needle (whether or not it should be considered as an adverse event is debatable), and o ne of them also mentioned having a bruise on the skin. This corresponds to an incidence rate of adverse event of 3 in 100 acupuncture users. Alternatively, among all participants who ha d visited acupuncturists, a total of 699 consultations had been made. This reflects an adver se event incidence rate of 4.3 per 1,000 consultations. For Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), seven persons me ntioned adverse event but one of the answers was not recorded by the interviewer. Two us ers experienced nausea after taking CHM; another two users considered the taste of the herbs as unpleasant or too strong. One person felt dizzy, and another user stated that \"th e liver cleansing power played havoc with me\". Thus, this corresponds to an incidence rate of 7.8% among CHM users. More strictly, when the definition of adverse event excludes mild gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, unpleasant taste and discomfort), the incidence rat e can be estimated as approximately 2.6%. However, whether the participants who encountered C HM adverse events used herbs that had been prescribed by their CHM practitioners or were self-prescribed was not established (a total of 160 consultations had been made among all CHM users, but the rate of self- prescription was considerable high). Thus, an adver se event incidence rate per 1,000 consultations seems inappropriate for CHM users. 192 6.1.1.10 Referral Pattern and Future Use of Acupuncture Referral Pattern Most commonly, acupuncture users had received advic e from their friends or relatives (40.8%). Advice from a medical doctor accounted for just over one fifth (20.7%) of the total responses. Some users had also received advice from a complementary medicine practitioner (18.7%), or from a newspaper, television and the In ternet (4.2%). Only one user was referred by another health professional, such as a nurse. It is of safety concern that one in six users (17.8 %) did not receive advice from any source. In particular, the use of acupuncture without receivin g advice was more common in those aged 35-64 (27.1%) than the younger group (18-34, 9.3%) and those aged 65 and older (none did not receive advice, 2=8.230, p=0.016). In addition, middle-age users wer e also less likely (11.0%) to receive advice from a friend or a relati ve than the younger (46.3%) and older (49.2%) users, ( 2=6.953, p=0.031). those with private health insuran ce were more likely to receive advice from CAM practitioners to use acupun cture (25.7% with insurance vs. 5.7% without insurance, 2=5.915, p=0.015). Future Use of Acupuncture Among all survey participants, nearly two thirds (6 2.4%) reported they would consider acupuncture as an option for their health care in t he future, while nearly one third (30.4%) would not consider; 7.2% of users were not sure whe ther or not they would consider this option. More specifically, among the total of 991 p articipants who indicated they would consider acupuncture in the future, younger adults, those with postsecondary education, private health insurance and a higher income range were more likely to use acupuncture again 193 (Table 6.9). In addition, compared to other states, a relatively lower proportion of South Australia residents said they would consider using acupuncture in the future, although this is not statistically significant ( 2=8.552, p=0.073). On the other hand, among acupunct ure users, the vast majority (94.7%) indicated they would use acupuncture again. Of the three users who indicated they would not consider using acupuncture in the future, none had previously experienced side-effects after using acupuncture, b ut two acupuncture users found it had not been very helpful for their health conditions (i.e. arthritis and osteoarthritis). 194 Table 6.9 Consideration for the use of acupuncture treatment in the future Consider using acupuncture in the future Statistical difference Characteristic Yes (%) No (%) Chi Square p Gender 0.216 0.642 Female 66.5 63.1 36.9 State 70.6 29.4 Victoria 67.3 32.7 Queensland 69.0 31.0 South Australia 2.569 0.109 Employed 69.1 30.9 Unemployed or not in labour 64.0 36.0 Private Health Insurance 10.176 0.001 Yes 71.6 28.4 69.8 30.2 >A$40,000 71.7 28.3 195 6.1.1.11 Referral Pattern and Future Use of Chinese Herbal M edicine Referral Pattern Similar to the referral pattern for the use of acup uncture, most commonly, CHM users had received advice from their friends or relatives (45 .4%). Advice from CAM practitioners accounted for just over one quarter (25.4%) of the total responses. However, only 6.5% users had received advice from a medical doctor. Receivin g advice from a newspaper, television and the Internet (8.5%) and other health profession als (7.3%) constituted a relatively high proportion of responses. It is a safety concern tha t nearly one in 10 users (9.9%) did not receive advice from any source. In all, none of the demographic information was remarkable in relation to the referral pattern for CHM use. Future Use of Chinese Herbal Medicine Among all survey participants, over half (52.9%) sa id they would consider CHM as an option for their health care in the future, while over one third (35.0%) would not consider it as an option; 12.1% users were not sure whether or not th ey would consider this treatment. More specifically, among the total of 941 participants w ho had answered definitively about whether or not they would consider CHM in the future, those female, younger adults, who resided in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, and who w ere employed were more likely to use CHM again (Table 6.10). Similar to acupuncture use, the lowest rate of future projected CHM use among states was also reported in South Austral ia. On the other hand, among CHM users, the vast majority (97.5%) reported they would use C HM again. Of the two users who said they would not consider CHM in the future, one had previ ously experienced a side-effect after using CHM (dizziness). Another person had used CHM for his back pain and high blood pressure problem, but mentioned it had not been ver y helpful. 196 Table 6.10 Consideration for the use of Chinese her bal medicine treatment in the future Consider using CHM in the future Statistical difference Characteristic Yes (%) No (%) Chi Square p Gender 8.004 0.005 Female 64.7 35.3 Male Non-Australia 57.1 42.9 State 17.086 0.002 New South Wales 62.4 37.6 Victoria 66.5 33.5 Queensland 61.6 38.4 South Australia 42.8 57.2 Western Australia 6.687 0.01 Employed 63.4 36.6 Unemployed or not in labour force 54.6 45.4 Private Health Insurance 2.905 0.088 Yes 63.2 36.8 No 57.7 herbal medicine 197 6.1.2 Chiropractic 6.1.2.1 Overview As noted above, the overall prevalence of chiroprac tic use in Australia was 16.1% (95%CI: 13.9% - 18.3%), being one of the most popular forms of CAM in Australia. The vast majority (90.6%) of chiropractic users had visited practitio ners for therapy of all forms of CAM users. Chiropractic users had the lowest proportion (9.4%) who self-administrated the therapy. This also implies that approximately one in seven adult Australians (14.6%, 95%CI: 12.4% - 16.7%) had visited a chiropractor in the 12-month p receding the survey in 2005. In general, those born in Australia who had private health insurance and higher household incomes were more likely to use chiropractic (p<0.0 1, Table 4.6). Gender, age and educational background did not appear to be major factors relat ed to chiropractic use. On the other hand, there were smaller variations in users in different states, although the prevalence in Queensland (14.4%) and Western Australia (14.9) was slightly lower than the national average (not significant) while slightly higher tha n national average prevalence was reported in New South Wales (17.0%), Victoria (17.4%) and So uth Australia (17.0%) (see Table 5.1 and Table 5.2). In terms of the frequency of visiting chiropractors , an annual rate of approximately 8.4 times per user was estimated for all users, which approxi mates to 19.05 million visits per year in Australia (see Table 4.9). The average out-of-pocke t expenditure of visiting a CAM practitioner, as estimated in the current survey wa s A$25 (see Chapter 4.1.7.1). This suggests that a total out-of-pocket expenditure of A$476 mil lion on chiropractor visits. In addition, of those users, 23 had incurred additional costs such as books and equipment related to their 198 chiropractic treatments. The median total chiroprac tic-related expenditure was A$200. Thus, nationwide, A$68.37 million would had spent on chir opractic-related items other than costs related to practitioner visits. This suggests, Aust ralia nationwide, the total out-of-pocket expenditure spent on chiropractic services in the 1 2-month period was approximately A$544 million. (see Appendix G9 for the unadjusted expend iture and G10 for a summary statistics of the adjusted data). 199 6.1.2.2 Rationale for the Use of Chiropractic After being identified as chiropractic users, parti cipants were also asked about their main reasons (multiple responses) for using chiropractic . In all, well over two thirds (68.6%) used chiropractic for the relief of symptoms, with nearl y half (42.5%) using chiropractic for the purpose of relieving symptoms only and not for any other purpose. Approximately one third (32.3%) used chiropractic for improving general hea lth and well-being, with over 11.9% using it, exclusively to improve general health and well- being. Also, about one third (36.2%) of chiropractic users used it to improve the ability t o undertake normal daily activities, while nearly one in 10 (9.4%) users also used chiropracti c to improve their sporting performance. About 5.3% used chiropractic for all four purposes. More specifically, cross-tabulation analyses reveal ed that the only gender difference in the reasons for using chiropractic was to improve sport ing performance. Not surprisingly, the use of chiropractic to improve sporting performance by male users (15.7%) was much higher than female users (4.0%) ( 2=6.828, p=0.009). Among different age groups, the o nly difference in the reasons for using chiropractic was to improve t he ability to undertake normal daily activities. More than half (51.9%) of those 65 year s of age or older used chiropractic for this purpose, compared with 38.2% of those aged 35-64 an d 24.3% of those aged 18-34 ( 2=6.292, p=0.043). Other factors, such as education level, e mployment status and personal health status did not appear to influence choosing chiropractic. In terms of the specific symptoms for which users h ad sought chiropractic, nearly two thirds (65.7%) had used it for back pain or back-related p roblems. Other common conditions for which users had resorted to chiropractic were neck pain and related problems (20.7%), non- 200 specific musculoskeletal problems (14.9%), headache and migraine (9.3%), and shoulder pain and related problems (5.3%). In addition, among tho se had used chiropractic to relieve symptoms, near half (43.9%) did so solely to reliev e back pain or back-related problems and not for any other health conditions. On the other h and, only one person reported using chiropractic for a condition/symptom unrelated to a musculoskeletal problem (a gynaecological condition). 201 6.1.2.3 Use of Chiropractic-Regression Analyses Bivariate analyses revealed that nine predictor var iables were significantly associated with chiropractic use: income range, country of birth, h ad consulted a GP in the preceding 12 months, consulted a GP four times or more in the pr eceding 12 months, covered by private health insurance coverage of CAM influences the pur chase of health insurance, visited a GP for back problems, visited a GP for cancer, and vis ited a GP for diabetes. These were entered into the logistic regression model by the stepwise method. Table 6.11 presents the results of the significant regression model for chiropractic users. It was not unexpected that those had visited a GP for back problems were 3.5 times more likely to have also used chiropractic than those who had n ot visited a GP for back problems. Also participants' household income status substantially influenced their use of chiropractic. Compared to the low-income participants, people wit h a household income A$20,000 - A$40,000 were 3.3 times more likely to use chiropra ctic. The odds ratio increased to 3.8 times more likely to use chiropractic among those with a household income higher than A$40,000. 202 Table 6.11 Multivariate analyses of predictor varia bles for chiropractic use ratio range 1.0 Country of birth Australia 2.070 (1.241-3.454)** No 1.0 Consulted a GP in the past 12 months Yes 1.995 (1.133-3.513)* No 1.0 Coverage of CAM influences health insurance purchase Yes 2.325 (1.560-3.463)** No 1.0 Visited a GP for back problems Yes 3.494 (1.447-8.437)** Omnibus Tests of Model Coefficients Chi square (degree of freedom, p value) 60.236 (6, <0.0001) Percentage accurate in classification 83.4 * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; CI: confidence interval. 203 6.1.2.4 Outcomes and Safety Concerns of Use of Chiropractic Users were asked the specific outcomes after their use of chiropractic. Almost three quarters (71.9%) mentioned that it relieved pain; half (50.2 %) found it improved their ability to undertake normal daily activities; nearly half (45. 5%) also found it improved their well-being; an additional 23.1% of users also considered chirop ractic had decreased a disability. In total, nearly one in five (19.5%) users found that, after seeking chiropractic treatment, they had achieved all four outcomes. Older people (58.2%) and those from the middle-age group (aged 34-64, 58.9%) were more likely to use chiropractic to improve their ability to undertake normal daily activities than the younger adults (aged 18-34, 30.7%) ( 2=11.08, p=0.004). Also, a higher proportion of user s with poor or fair health reported a helpful outcome of decreased disability (38.6%) and improved normal daily activity (67.5%) than those w ho considered themselves to be in better health (19.5%, 2=5.481, p=0.019; and 46.4%, 2=4.751, p=0.029, respectively). It may be of particular interest that there were fe wer users in Victoria (58.4%) and Queensland (65.6%) who provided a positive answer to the outco me of pain relief than users in New South Wales (82.3%), South Australia (81.3%) and Western Australia (83.9%) ( 2=9.852, p=0.043). No additional regional difference was observed in o ther outcomes. On the other hand, more users with private health insurance believed chirop ractic had improved their general health (51.6%) than people without private health insuranc e (33.0%) ( 2=5.303, p=0.021). All users also rated their experience on the overal l general helpfulness of chiropractic. The majority of users believed the chiropractic treatme nt they had used was very helpful (71.4%) 204 or somewhat helpful (21.6%), while a small proporti on of users received a less helpful outcome (not very helpful, 2.6%, and not at all hel pful, 2.4%). Among all users, a total of nine persons reported a dverse events (patient self-perceived) after having chiropractic treatment. These included pain after treatment (three persons), headache/migraine immediately after treatment (two persons), and tiredness (one person). The worst scenario was aggravation of a major back inju ry (treatment was provided without an x- ray). Two reported adverse events which could be co nsidered as \"dissatisfaction of treatment\", were \"it does not do any thing\", and \"you tend to g o back and they fix it\". Thus, this (7 reported adverse events) corresponds to an incidenc e rate of 4.0% among users. Alternatively, among all participants who had visited chiropractor s, a total of 1,352 consultations were made. This reflects an adverse event incidence rate of 5.2 per 1,000 consultations. With respect to the general opinion on the safety a spect of chiropractic, over 81.0% of all survey participants either strongly agreed (16.5%), agreed (43.6%) or partially agreed (20.9%) that chiropractic is safe. Perception of safety was even more convincing when the opinion of chiropractic users is considered. Those who strongl y agreed that chiropractic is a safe form of treatment increased from 16.5% of all survey partic ipants to 43.2% of chiropractic users. On the other hand, those who did not agree that \"chiro practic is a safe form of treatment\" decreased from 9.6% of all participants to approxim ately 1.9% (three users) of chiropractic users. In the latter category, one had encountered an adverse effect (i.e. severe pain). 205 6.1.2.5 Referral Pattern and Future Use of Chiropractic In terms of using chiropractic on the advice of oth er people, the most common response was from users' friends or relatives (43.6%). Advice fr om a medical doctor accounted for exactly one fifth (20.0%) of the total responses. Some user s also received advice from a complementary medicine practitioner (7.2%), from a newspaper, television and the Internet (1.3%) or from another health professional such as a nurse (2.6%). It is of safety concern that over one quarter (27.2 %) of chiropractic users did not receive advice from any source. In particular, the use of c hiropractic without receiving advice was much more common in those aged 65 and older (45.6%) and those aged 35-64 (31.2%) than in the younger group (18-34, 9.6%, 2=13.505, p=0.001). As may have been expected, those having a better health (self-rated) were more likel y to receive advice from a friend or relative (47.0% vs. 27.8%, 2=4.051, p=0.044), while those having poor or fair h ealth were more likely to receive advice from their medical doctor (36.9% vs. 16.1%, 2=7.208, p=0.007). In contrast, those who had private health insurance we re less likely to receive advice from their medical doctor to use chiropractic (15.6% vs. 29.0% , 2=4.286, p=0.039), but more likely to use chiropractic without any advice (32.7% vs. 16.7 %, 2=4.957, p=0.026). Among all survey participants, well over two thirds (68.1%) said they would consider chiropractic as an option for their health care in the future, while 26.9% would not consider it. More specifically, among the total of 1,015 partici pants who had made a definitive answer of whether or not they would consider chiropractic in the future, the younger, male adults, who resided in the states of New South Wales and Wester n Australia, were in a better health, employed and in the higher income range, were more likely to use chiropractic (Table 6.12). On the other hand, among chiropractic users, the va st majority (93.3%) said they would use 206 chiropractic again. Of the ten users (5.1%) who sai d they would not consider using chiropractic in the future, two had previously expe rienced side-effects after using chiropractic, including severe pain and aggravation of a major ba ck injury.

As a provider-based therapy, most osteopathy users (76.4%) had visited practitioners for treatment. Surprisingly, the proportion of self-administrating users (23.6%) was quite high . In total, approximately one in every 28 adult Australians (3.5%, 95%CI: 2.4% - 4.6%) had vi sited an osteopath in the 12 months preceding the survey in 2005. There are different forms of osteopathy in clinical practice, of which the most commonly known and reported by the survey participants was a s a form of massage therapy (66.1%). At least half the participants also considered that th e type of osteopathy treatment they had used was the mobilisation or \"popping of joints\" (58.6%) , stretching (58.5%), or a gentle technique (may be called functional or cranial, 51.3%). Over 57.3% also mentioned that they had received exercise advice from their osteopathy prac titioners. Consistent with the characteristics that related to overall CAM use, female (5.8%) participants were more likely to use osteopathy than male partic ipants (3.3%, p<0.05). Interestingly, those in the middle household income range used the least osteopathy (1.3%), while those in the lower and higher income ranges used osteopathy much more (6.7% and 5.5% respectively, p<0.05) (Table 4.6). In addition, osteopathy use ap peared to vary between states. Participants from New South Wales and Victoria were more likely to use osteopathy than those from any other states (p<0.05, Table 5.1). In relation to th e characteristics of those who visiting an osteopath, in addition to the differences in the us e of osteopathy, educational background and 208 private health insurance coverage also appeared to be determinants of osteopathy use (Table 5.2). Users of osteopathy visited practitioners approxima tely 5.9 times per annum. Thus, a total of 3.08 million visits were estimated per annum in Aus tralia (see Table 4.9). Using the average out-of-pocket expenditure of visiting a CAM practit ioner, as estimated in the current survey (A$25, Chapter 4.1.7.1), this equals A$77 million s pent on osteopath visits in the 12 months preceding the survey. In addition, ten osteopathy u sers indicated that they had spent additional money on items such as books and equipments related to their osteopathy treatments. The median cost was A$50.0. Thus, nationwide, the total out-of-pocket expenditure on osteopathy in the 12-month period can be estimated as A$83.47 million, with A$6.47 million spent on items other than practitioner visits (see Appendix G9 for the unadjusted expenditure and G10 for a summary statistics of the adjusted data). 209 6.1.3.2 Rationale for the Use of Osteopathy Osteopathy users were asked the same questions as w ere put to chiropractic users about their main reasons for seeking treatment (see Chapter 6.1 .2.2), and they also provided multiple responses to their rationale for use. In all, over three quarters (75.9%) used osteopathy for the relief of symptoms, including nearly two fifths (38 .0%) who used it solely for the purpose of relieving symptoms. Over two fifths (40.6%) used os teopathy to improve general health and well-being, including 14.5% who used it for the pur pose of improving general health and well-being only, rather than for other purposes. Mo re than two fifths (41.9%) of participants used osteopathy to improve their ability to underta ke normal daily activities, while nearly one in six (17.1%) used osteopathy to improve their spo rting performance. Cross-tabulation analyses revealed an interesting f inding. Those born overseas used osteopathy to improve general health and well-being much more than those born in Australia (70.6% vs. 33.5%, 2=4.297, p=0.038). On the other hand, the only gende r difference in the reasons for using osteopathy was to improve the abi lity to undertake normal daily activities. In this respect, female users were three times (54.2%) more likely to use osteopathy than male users (19.7%, 2=5.443, p=0.020). Among users who had resorted to osteopathy for the relief of symptoms, 48.4% had used it for back pain or back related problems, 35.2% had used it for non-specific musculoskeletal problems (eg. restricted movement), 22.9% had used it for shoulder problems, and 10.7% for neck problems. Osteopathy users had also used it fo r other conditions, such as headache, spinal or knee problems. In addition, among those h ad used osteopathy to relieve symptoms, nearly one quarter (24.7%) had used it solely to re lieve back pain or back-related problems only. 210 6.1.3.3 Use of Osteopathy-Regression Analyses Bivariate analyses revealed that five predictor var iables were significantly associated with osteopathy use: gender, income range, coverage of C AM influences the purchase of private health insurance, visiting a GP for back problems, and visiting a GP for heart-related problems. These were entered into the logistic regr ession model by the stepwise method. As presented in Table 6.13, those who had visited a GP for back problems were 4.3 times more likely to have also used osteopathy than those who without back problems. It is worth further investigating why the highest odds ratio of osteopathy use was those with the lowest household incomes. Compared to those with a househo ld income of A$20,000 A$40,000, people who earned less than A$20,000 were up to 18 time more likely to use osteopathy. The odds ratio of people with the lowest incomes using osteopathy was high, (1.6 times higher, but not statistically significant) compared to those wi th household incomes higher than A$40,000 (see Table 4.6). This finding may be somewhat unrel iable due to the relatively small sample size (45 osteopathy users) entered into the regress ion analysis. Table 6.13 Multivariate analyses of predictor varia bles for osteopathy ratio range >A$40,000 0.624 (0.298-1.306) No 1.0 Coverage of CAM influences health insurance purchase Yes 4.760 (2.139-10.592)** No 1.0 Visited a GP for back problems Yes 4.318 (1.137-16.402)* Omnibus Tests of Model Coefficients Chi square (degree of freedom, p value) 34.817 (4, <0.0001) Percentage accurate in classification 95.0 * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; CI: confidence interval 211 6.1.3.4 Outcomes and Safety Concerns of Use of Osteopathy In regard to the outcomes of osteopathy use, over t hree quarters (79.5%) of users mentioned that it relieved pain; three out of five users (60. 5%) found it improved their ability to undertake normal daily activities; nearly half (45. 6%) also found it improved their well-being; an additional 40.6% of users considered osteopathy had decreased a disability. In total, nearly one in three (29.7%) users found that, after seekin g osteopathy treatment, they had achieved all four outcomes. None of the particular user char acteristics was found significantly related to different outcomes. All except two users rated their experience on the overall general helpfulness of using osteopathy. The majority of users believed their os teopathy treatments were very helpful (64.2%) or somewhat helpful (28.4%), while only two users reported a less helpful outcome (one did not believe it was very helpful, while ano ther believed it was not at all helpful). Importantly, a total of four users (an incidence ra te of 7.8%) reported adverse events (patient self-perceived) after having osteopathy treatment. These included more pain, soreness, \"very tired'' and \"neck cracks a lot more after treatment ''. However, it is important to note that all of these were controversial in terms of whether or not they should be considered as adverse events. The adverse event incidence rate per 1,000 consultations was not calculated against the osteopathy treatment. 212 6.1.3.5 Referral Pattern and Future Use of Osteopathy The most common referral channel for using osteopat hy was from users' friends or relatives (38.1%). Advice from complementary medicine practit ioners accounted for over one fifth (21.5%) of the total responses, closely followed by advice from a medical doctor (16.1%). Two additional users were referred by other health professionals, such as a nurse (one person) and through newspapers, television and Internet (on e person). However, there were six users (13.2%) did not receive advice from any source. Fou r of them were from New South Wales and five of them were female. Among 32 osteopathy users who were employed at the time of the survey, only two (weighted percentage, 6.4%) had received advice from their me dical doctors while six out of 18 (29.5%) unemployed osteopathy users had received advice fro m a medical doctor ( 2=4.686, p=0.030). One third (ten out of 28, 33.7%) of the users aged 35-64 had received advice from a complementary medicine practitioner, while only one user aged 65 and older and none from the group aged 18-34 had received advice from a CAM practitioner (not statistically significant, 2=5.899, p=0.052). Among all survey participants, just over half (52.0 %) said they would consider osteopathy as an option for their health care in the future; 24.9 % would not consider, and the remaining 23.1% were not sure about osteopathy (e.g. lack of knowledge of osteopathy and did not respond to the current question). On the other hand , among osteopathy users, five users (12.4%) said they would not consider using osteopat hy again. This included one person who had experienced a side-effect (pain) after using os teopathy. 213 Finally, among the total of 814 participants with a definite response to whether or not they would consider osteopathy in the future, there was no difference between participants' socio- demographic characteristics and their decision to u se osteopathy in the future (Table 6.14).

For example, through an integrative health-care approach, the Center for East-West Medi cine within the Department of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles believ ed that Chinese medicine has much to offer to patients with cancer. 161 The increasing popularity of Chinese medicine in W estern countries has been accompanied by concerns about its efficacy 162,163 and safety, 164,165 both when used alone and in combination with Western medical treat ments. The information available on the use of Chinese med icine in Australia comes from a landmark study completed in 1996 (and the publication of \"To ward a Safer Choice - the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Australia\"). 166 It is important to note that the 1996 study was a Chinese medicine national workforce survey for wh ich the CM participants were practitioners and educators, and the focus was on e ducation, the risks and benefits associated with the practice of CM, and regulatory frameworks. The study provided a profile of patients who choose to use CM by asking practitioners to com plete a questionnaire for every patient treated on a specific day. Since the study subjects had chosen to use CM, it was not able to 215 provide information on the prevalence and patterns of CM use in the general population. It also did not provide insightful information on publ ic perceptions of CM. The study was conducted a decade ago and there would seem to have been dramatic changes since then in the public use of CM in Australia. The use of Chinese medicine, as a defined health-ca re approach, was not specifically researched in most surveys in Australia and oversea s, and consequently there is a lack of nationwide, population-based representative data on Chinese medicine use in Australia. Addressing this deficiency, the current study inclu ded the major modalities of Chinese medicine (acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Chi nese therapeutic massage, Chinese medicine dietary therapy, Qigong, martial art and T ai Chi) as the totality of CM. With the above broader definition of CM, the curren t study presents an estimation of the national and regional prevalence of CM use among th e general population in Australia. Nearly one in five adult Australians had used any one form of CM in the 12-month period preceding the survey, and one in nine had visited CM practiti oners in the 12-month period. These findings again echo the increasing popularity of al l forms of CAM in Australia. There is a lack of accurate information of CM use among the general population in other Western countries. Systematic literature searches (see Chapter 2) have identified only one similar study which investigated such CM information in Western countri es. The estimated CM prevalence (17.2% visited CM practitioners in the two-year per iod) in New York City's Chinatown is higher than the current Australian estimation. 100 However, this New York study was based on randomly selected Chinatown residents. According to the current national survey, the lowes t prevalence of CM use was found in the state of Western Australia, and the lowest prevalen ce of visits to CM practitioners was found 216 in Western Australia and South Australia. Specifica lly, the marked differences between different states, in fact, were for the two major C hinese medicine modalities: acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine, both in overall use and pr evalence of visits to practitioners (see Table 5.1 and Table 5.2). Thus, the current survey confirmed two research hypotheses: 1) certain forms of CAM are more prevalent in some sta tes within Australia and, 2) among all states and territories, Chinese medicine, including acupuncture and CHM, is more prevalent in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. The current study also found acupuncturists were vi sited more frequently than practitioners of the other 16 forms of CAM. The result is not surpri se, as numerous reports have suggested the popularity of acupuncture use both in Australia and overseas. 5,6,17,102,167,168 With the continuing increase in scientific evidence relating to the mechanism and efficacy of acupuncture in treating certain chronic diseases, 169-172 there is little doubt that acupuncture is one of the most popular forms of CAM in Western cou ntries. It is being used by millions of patients, and is practiced by traditional acupunctu rists, medical doctors, 95 and by many other health professionals, such as licensed chiropractor s and nurses. The total estimated number of visits to acupuncturi sts in Australia is substantial in terms of the frequency of visits and the cost to the Austral ian health system. As mentioned earlier, the Australian national health insurance, Medicare, onl y covers the cost of acupuncture services provided by registered medical practitioners. Thus, the current estimated millions of acupuncture treatments were mainly borne by the use rs. The cost implications and non- claimable acupuncture services provided by non-GP a cupuncturists meant that in the current study, one in five people who had received acupunct ure treatment, received it from GPs only. Secondary analysis of the 1996 Health Insurance Com mission data reveals that there were 960, 000 Medicare claims for acupuncture in the 199 6-97 financial year, totalling $17.7 217 million in reimbursements. 167 It is worth noting that these approximately one mi llion claims did not include acupuncture treatments funded by Wo rkers Compensation and the Department of Veterans Affairs, or treatments provided in publ ic hospitals. After 10 years of growing popularity of acupuncture use and practice in Austr alia, the current estimated 10.16 million visits to acupuncturists, including services provid ed by GPs and non-GPs, seems to be consistent with the data and reflects the increasin g trend of using acupuncture. The current survey also estimated that the combined total number of practitioner visits by adult Australians for acupuncture, CHM and Chinese therapeutic massage was about 15 million. However, the figure must be interpreted wi th extreme caution. Based on the nature of Chinese medicine, most CM practitioners practice bo th acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. This is also evidenced by a report of the Chinese Medicine Registration Board of Victoria in June 2006 that, nearly 60% of registere d CM practitioners in Victoria are registered for both acupuncture and CHM. 173 In addition, the application of Chinese therapeutic massage in CM practitioners' practice i s not unusual. The current survey found that the characteristics o f CM users are similar to the general characteristics of CAM users. However, for both CM users and people who had visited CM practitioners, there was no gender difference or di fference in whether or not they had private health insurance. However, the use of acupuncture a nd Chinese herbal medicine between adults who were born in Australia or overseas was s ignificant. Acupuncture appears have been more accepted than CHM by Australian-born adults. T hat is, a significantly higher proportion of Australian-born adults used acupuncture, but a s ignificantly lower proportion of Australian- born adults used CHM, when compared to those born o verseas. Furthermore, multivariate analyses found those born overseas were 2.3 times m ore likely to use CHM than the Australian-born residents. 218 In clinical practice, Chinese medicine treatment is typically highly individualised and based on a holistic philosophy value. It was also expecte d that people have used acupuncture and CHM for varied health conditions. Thus, the current survey participants mentioned that they used CM for over 30 different health conditions. Wh at the common forms of herbs that are being used for specified health conditions were not researched. However, about three-quarters of acupuncture users used acupuncture for musculosk eletal- related conditions, notably for back pain and shoulder problems. It is interesting to note that over one third of CH M users actually used CHM for general health and well-being. The individual names of each of the CHM modalities that were used by survey participants are beyond the scope of the cur rent survey. However, there were a large proportion of people who self-used CHM, particularl y for general health, rather than specified health conditions. This implies that a number of pe ople may use herbal supplements to improve their health, such as Ginseng to enhance th e immune system, which is based on Chinese medicine theory, (to \"tonify\" the Qi of the body). Consumers are asserting their rights to choose diff erent modes of health care. As one of the most commonly used forms of CAM, Chinese medicine i s used by consumers from diverse cultural backgrounds. Since the publication of a re view of Chinese medicine practice in Australia by Bensoussan, Myers et al ., 166 CM has experienced significant development. Firstly, the introduction of the statutory regulati on of Chinese medicine practitioners in Victoria, enforced by the Victorian Chinese Medicin e Registration Act 2000, made Victoria the first state in Australia to register Chinese me dicine practitioners. Implementation of Chinese medicine practitioner registration in Victo ria is an important initiative for the profession and should lead to enhanced public safet y and confidence in Chinese medicine use in Australia. Secondly, it is highly likely that ot her states will follow Victoria's lead in the 219 future. For example, the discussion documents on re gulatory considerations in the states of New South Wales and Western Australia. 174,175 Thus, the current survey has investigated the impact of the CM Registration Act on public attitud es to Chinese medicine (see regulation section, Chapter 7.1.5). In all, participants sugge sted that a much more stringent surveillance system in all states and territories is necessary t o protect the public from unregistered and unqualified Chinese medicine practitioners. It is of safety concern that one in six acupuncture users and one in ten CHM users did not receive advice from any source in using these thera peutic treatments. As mentioned above, there are increasing concerns about the adverse eve nts that may relate to the use of CAM therapies and products. This safety concern extends if the CAM use was not supervised or had been used concurrently with other CAM products and/ or conventional medicines. The results also suggest an educational approach should be deve loped by government authorities, such as the TGA and, professional registration bodies, such as the Chinese Medicine Registration Board, to improve the awareness of the potential ri sks among therapies and products, which are not exclusively related to any individual forms of CAM or conventional medicine. In summary, the utilisation of different forms of C M in Australia is more prevalent among the general population than had been generally assumed. There are marked differences in the overall CM prevalence among different states. The v ariations between states are found mainly in the utilisation of acupuncture and Chinese herba l medicine. While more research must to be undertaken to improve the understanding of the mech anism and efficacy of CM, strategic health planning is also necessary to keep consumers and health professionals informed about the safety aspects of different forms of CM. 220 6.2.2 Chiropractic Both chiropractic and osteopathy are manipulative t herapies, for which practitioners use their hands (as well as modern technology) to diagnose an d treat abnormalities of the structure and function of the musculoskeletal system of the body. 176 One does not need to look very far to search for the popular use of such manipulative the rapies in different countries. According to previous CAM surveys, at least 11% of Americans, 3 13% of Canadians, 6 and 16.7% of Australians 11 used chiropractic in a 12-month period. The curren t survey revealed a similar prevalence: 16.1% of adult Australians used chiropr actic. The current survey found a higher overall CAM preva lence compared to previous regional surveys. 11 Individual prevalence of most forms of CAM estimat ed in the current survey was also relatively higher than those found previously in Australian regional studies. Perhaps, with the exception of multivitamins, that is, different definitions were used in different surveys and a comparison was not available, the only higher pre valence observed in previous surveys compared to the current survey was the use of chiro practic. In fact, the prevalence of 16.7% estimated in the South Australian study was based o n the proportion of people who had visited chiropractors. This was higher than the current nat ional estimation of people who had visited a chiropractor (14.6%). A small proportion of chiropr actic users self-administrated, and details were not collected in the current survey. Again, th e finding may be reasonably explained by the regional differences among different states. Th e current survey found that the states of South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales had a higher than national average prevalence of chiropractic use, whereas the prevalence of chir opractic in other states was slightly lower than the national average. The chiropractic prevale nce in South Australia (17.0%) in the current survey seems to be consistent with a 2004 S outh Australia regional estimation (16.7%). 11 221 In all states and territories of Australia, chiropr actic is subject to practitioner registration. Despite the evidence of high prevalence of use in A ustralia, 11 little is known about who the chiropractic users are in Australia, why they use i t, and the perceptions and consequences of chiropractic treatment. On the other hand, these ma tters were investigated in the US, 177 Canada, 178 Denmark, 179,180 the Netherlands, 181 and in Sweden. 182 Nevertheless, the profile of middle-aged Australian women who consult a chiropra ctor or osteopath has been published recently, based on a large-scale longitudinal study on women's health. 183 It revealed that women living in non-urban areas and women with a lo wer level of education were more likely to use chiropractic or osteopathy. Such findings we re not supported by the current survey. However, the current survey suggests Australian-bor n adults are significantly more likely to use chiropractic than those born overseas (odds rat io=2.07). Similar to the mean number (9.8) of chiropractor vi sits per annum in the US in 1996, 3 the current survey also reveals that chiropractors are the second most-frequently visit of all forms of CAM practitioners. The average of 8.4 visits per year per chiropractic user represents over 19 million visits by all adult Australians. As note d, the costs related to chiropractor visits are still mainly borne by consumers. In addition to con sultation and treatment costs, approximately one in eight chiropractic users indic ated that they also spent money on books or equipment related to chiropractic treatment. Thus, the economic burden borne by chiropractic users in Australia seems substantial. It is interes ting to note, based on one year health service records from over 2,000 low-back pain patients, a U S study suggested that the mean costs associated with chiropractic patients were signific antly higher than those patients treated by medical doctors. 184 The use of chiropractic for back pain and back-rela ted problems is well documented in the literature. 177-179,181 The current survey further confirms such a finding among the Australian 222 general public. Nearly two thirds of chiropractic u se was for back pain or back-related problems. Thus, multivariate analysis estimated tha t the chance of Australian people using chiropractic was about 3.5 times higher among those with back problems, compared to those without back problems. Furthermore, the use of chir opractic treatment for a specific health condition, rather than for the musculoskeletal syst em, is not common in the current survey. Of 176 chiropractic users, only one person used it for a gynaecological condition. In contrast, a much higher prevalence of non-musculoskeletal compl aints in chiropractic practice was found in a multinational study, which accounted for about one in ten (10.3%) of all chief complaints. 185 A previous survey found similar proportions of Aust ralian adults with lower back pain had consulted GPs (22.4%) or chiropractor (19.3%), whic h was considerably higher than the proportion of consultations with physiotherapists ( 13.4%). 186 Thus, the researchers further suggested that visits to chiropractors may have a g reater \"market share\" in Australia, while due to historical and other reasons, physiotherapis ts have been much more commonly accepted as a form of allied health in the national health system in Australia. Nevertheless, the Australian Government is increasing the exclusive a ncillary position of chiropractic, including osteopathy treatment, the Australian national healt h system (Medicare) now provides limited rebates for people with chronic conditions and comp lex care needs. 187 In the current survey, after receiving chiropractic treatment, almost three quarters of the users considered it was very helpful, and a similar propo rtion of users also agreed chiropractic had relieved various forms of pain. Although nearly hal f of all users considered chiropractic had also improved their general health and well-being, detailed non-musculoskeletal responses to chiropractic treatment have not been investigated i n the current study. A multinational survey of chiropractic patients in seven countries estimat ed that positive non-musculoskeletal 223 reactions to chiropractic were not rare, with an im provement in breathing (27%), digestion (26%) and circulation (21%) being most common. 188 The specific benefits of chiropractic are necessary in future chiropractic research in Austra lia. It is worth mentioning that one in five chiropracti c users received advice from their medical doctors to use chiropractic. In past decades, many efforts have been made to integrate conventional medicine and CAM therapies. 95,189,190 Many health professionals are now working in a multi-disciplinary environment. For ex ample, one in 10 chiropractors in the US is practicing as a member of a multi-disciplinary t eam that includes medical doctors 191 and, most chiropractors had received a referral from med ical doctors in the US. 192 Such information is limited in Australia, so future stud ies may concentrate on a strategy to improve the communication between these two professions (i. e. chiropractor and GP). Follow-up studies should reveal the barriers and motivations of patient referral. A moderate proportion of users (27.2%) did not rece ive any advice in seeking chiropractic care. This seems to be consistent with the fact tha t most survey participants considered chiropractic treatment to be safe and the adverse e vent rate reported by all users was less than three per 1,000 consultations. Limited Australian l iterature provides information on concerns about adverse events and safety issues relating to chiropractic. It has been suggested that adverse events were more commonly reported if a pra ctitioner applied cervical spine manipulation rather than mobilisation. 193 On the other hand, a previous study revealed that some people experienced dizziness, nausea or other \"abnormal reaction\" after treatment. 194 In addition, although rare, serious adverse events suc h as stroke and vertebral artery dissection after cervical spine manipulation continue to be re ported. 195 In the current survey, a major back injury, due to chiropractic treatment provided without performing an x-ray, was reported by one of the participants. Chiropractic practition ers should be alerted in terms of precautions. 224 6.2.3 Osteopathy As noted, osteopathy is one of the major forms of m anipulative CAM therapies. More popularly, a study in Scotland found 12% osteopath use in 1999. 196 A 1998 UK study found a 4.3% use of osteopathy in a 12-month period, and a 13% lifetime use. 5 The use of osteopathy was found to be not very common in Canada (less tha n 4%). 6 According to two UK studies, 5,17 the prevalence of osteopathy in the UK was higher than the prevalence of chiropractic. The proportion of Australians who use d osteopathy treatment, however, is far less than chiropractic, as evidenced in previous Au stralian regional CAM surveys (0.4% visited osteopaths and 16.7% visited chiropractors) , 10,11 and current survey shows visited osteopaths compared to 16.1% who visited ch iropractors). According to the second Osteopathic Survey of Healt h Care in the US in 2000, the prevalence of the use of osteopathy then was 7%, with a lifeti me use of 16%. 197 It is important to note that osteopathic medicine was not included as a for m of CAM in the US surveys. 1,3,4 Practitioners of osteopathic medicine in the US are fully trained as doctors of osteopathic medicine (D.O.). They are licensed medical physicia ns with the same professional level as other physicians in the US health system. 116 According to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, the practice of osteopathic medicine i s included in the definition of allopathic family medicine (commonly known as Western medicine ). 198 Thus, osteopathy practitioners in the US can do anything that a conventional medical doctor can do, in all 50 states in the US. 199 For historical and other reasons, osteopathy treat ment may not be considered as a form of CAM in the US. 200 However, it is still classified under one of the f ive NCCAM domains of CAM (i.e. the umbrella of manipulative and body-bas ed practices). 36 In most countries, including Australia, osteopathy is commonly include d as part of the CAM definition. This definition is used in the current study. 225 Unlike the small variations in the use of chiroprac tic between different states in Australia, the prevalence of osteopathy in different states seemed to vary significantly. The proportion of adults in the states of South Australia and Western Australia who used osteopathy was lowest among the other states. This finding, however, must be interpreted with caution, due to the small number of survey participants who had used os teopathy across all states. Osteopathy, chiropractic and other manipulative the rapies, including certain allied health professions (e.g. physiotherapy), share some common functional techniques, such as mobilisation. The current survey revealed that most commonly, about two thirds of osteopathy users considered the forms of osteopathy treatment they received were massage-like. In addition, at least half of osteopathy users also de scribed the treatment as mobilisation, \"popping of joints\", strength, or cranial therapy. Thus, a variety of the techniques used by osteopaths are highly associated with techniques th at deal with musculoskeletal systems. A US national survey with osteopathy practitioners re vealed that the of majority practitioners used the high-velocity thrust technique, and, toget her with the soft tissue technique, these were the most frequently used. 201 However, high-velocity thrust, was not mentioned b y osteopathy users in the current study. This may be due partially to the technical term, known by the practitioners rather than patients. Confirming a common finding, 183,202 the current survey also found that about half of t he osteopathy users saw osteopaths for the purpose of back pain or back-related problems. The current survey estimated that those who had visited a GP for back problems were more than four times more likely to use osteopathy. On the ot her hand, among all demographic factors that related to osteopathy use, it is of interest t o note the lowest prevalence was among those with a middle range of household income (A$20,000-A $40,000). However, such information 226 was not commonly reported in previous CAM studies, including the noted CAM study in the US, 197 and an Australian osteopathic study. 183 Similar to the other CAM therapies, the costs relat ed to osteopathy use in Australia are still borne mainly by the consumers. Very little research has been published on the economic aspects of osteopathy therapy, compared to such lit erature on acupuncture and chiropractic. Despite the legal status of osteopathic practitione rs who form part of the managed health-care system in the US, it was suggested that studies on the cost-effectiveness of osteopathy are not consistent with conventional medical literature. 203 Osteopathy users in a national survey in the US con sidered osteopathy was more beneficial for musculoskeletal conditions than other internal cond itions. 204 The overall satisfaction of patients who attended ambulatory osteopathy clinics was found to be significantly associated with the relief of pain or discomfort. 205 Consistently, over three-quarters of osteopathy us ers in the current survey considered osteopathy to be v ery helpful in terms of relieving pain. The surveyed osteopathy users also mentioned the useful ness of improving normal daily activities and general well-being. However, the specific benef its after osteopathy treatment are poorly understood in Australia. In the current survey, a few osteopathy users repor ted they had experienced discomfort after treatment, such as pain, soreness and tiredness. As noted above, such reports deviate from the commonly discussed adverse events related to manipu lative therapies. Issues relating to the safety of users are important in promoting the use of osteopathy treatment among the general population, and should be properly addressed in fut ure integrative medical care in Australia. Again, very little literature is available. 227 Similar to the overall use of CAM and the use of ch iropractic and acupuncture in the current survey, the most common referral channel for using osteopathy was from a user's friends or relatives. Only one in five osteopathy users had re ceived advice from other CAM practitioners and about one in six had received advice from a GP. These data were self-reported by the survey participants. The referral pattern between o steopathy practitioners and GPs, as well as between osteopaths and other CAM practitioners, is unknown in the Australian health context. Such referral information to osteopaths, as well as to other CAM practitioners is significant, in terms of the implications for health resources plan ning and of safety interest to consumers, practitioners and the government. 228 CHAPTER 7. FACTORS RELATED TO CAM USE In this Chapter, matters related to CAM use, such a s rationale for using CAM, benefits and risks related to CAM use, concurrent use of CAM and Western medicine, health insurance coverage of CAM and, regulatory issues on CAM use a re presented. 7.1 Results 7.1.1 Rationale for CAM Use All CAM users were asked to respond to seven pre-de fined statements about complementary medicine and its comparison with Western medicine. These statements were based on previous studies on the rationale for CAM use. Surv ey respondents agreed/disagreed with such statements, or provided a neutral answer (\"no comment\"). Nearly half (44.1%) of the CAM users agreed that We stern medicine would improve their medical conditions but would not cure them. This pr oportion was not significantly different among different socio-demographic groups of people. However, it is not surprising that those users with a relatively poor health condition tende d to agree more with this statement than those in better health (55.3% vs. 42.0%, 2=9.76, p=0.008). Nearly one in nine users (11.5%) considered Western medicine would not improve their medical conditions, although over three quarters (7 5.4%) disagreed with this. Among those who considered Western medicine would not improve t heir medical conditions, there was no difference between those who had visited a medical doctor in the 12-month preceding the survey and those who had not visited one (11.1% vs. 13.3%, 2=0.983, p=0.612). 229 Of particular concern is the proportion (24.8%) of participants who considered the services provided by their GPs as generally unsatisfactory. Typically, a relatively higher proportion was reported by those without post-secondary educat ion (28.9% a lower income range (34.3%, 32.4% and 19.4%, respectively, among people with incomes of less than A$20,000, between A$20,000 and A$40,000; and h igher than A$40,000, 2=17.307, p=0.002), health insurance (3 2.2% vs. 19.9%, 2=15.193, p=0.001), and those with condition (35.9% vs. 22.8% , 2=9.366, p=0.009). Over half of all CAM users (56.4%) considered that Western medicine had a relatively high risk of side effects, while over three quarters (76 .0%) considered CAM to be relatively safe. On the other hand, among all users, approximately 5 .4% considered neither Western medicine nor CAM as safe. There was no significant differenc e among gender and age groups with respect to these safety statements. However, fewer old people agreed that CAM is relatively safe, while a relatively high proportion of them di d not respond to this statement (p<0.05). Over three quarters (75.9%) and over four fifths (8 0.5%) of CAM users considered that CAM provides a more holistic approach to health or is a more natural approach to treatment. Most significantly, the proportions of females or of you nger adults who agreed with both these statements were much higher than males or older peo ple. For example, 83% of females agreed that CAM is a holistic approach, while only 67.4% o f males agreed with this statement (p<0.05). In total, 3.6% disagreed that CAM provide s more holistic care or a natural approach to treatment, with the majority of them (83.2%) bei ng male participants. 230 7.1.2 Regression Analyses on CAM Use In Chapters 4.1.4.2 and 4.1.5.3, cross-tabulation a nalyses and tests of significance were carried out with each of the variables considered o ne at a time, in order to identify the general pattern of the overall association of participants' characteristics and their CAM utilisation status. Using the same approach (see Chapter 3.6.4. 3), multivariate regression analyses on CAM use and on visits to CAM practitioners were con ducted. 7.1.2.1 Variables that Related to the Use of CAM In the initial step, the inter-correlations of pote ntial predictor variables were examined (Appendix G11). In general, the inter-correlations of these variables are not highly correlated with each other, and thus fulfil the general requir ement of avoiding collinearity prior to regression analysis. Similarly, the inter-correlati ons among other blocks of predictor variables and CAM use were also examined, with similar findin gs. Secondly, guided by the findings of the characteristics associated with CAM use (see Ta ble 4.5), a bivariate analysis of all predictor variables and CAM use was conducted by cr oss-tabulation chi square tests (Table 7.1). It shows that 11 variables (where p<0.05) are significantly related to CAM use. This will assist the development of the regression model. Det ailed statistics are presented in Appendix G12. The development of the regression model proceeded b y entering stepwise (based on Wald statistics), four blocks of predictor variables (wh ere significant at the bivariate level): block one was demographic factors; block two, health fact ors; block three, external factors and block four, the 18 specific health conditions for w hich participants had visited GPs (Table 7.1). The best-fit significant results of the multi variate analysis are presented in Table 7.2. 231 After all demographic variables were statistically controlled, it is apparent that gender, age and educational background are significant predicto rs for CAM use. Female participants were 1.9 (95% CI: 1.4 to 2.6) times more likely to use C AM than male participants. Similarly, the odds of those aged 18-34 being CAM users was 1.8 (9 5% CI: 1.1 to 3.0) times higher than those aged 65 and older. In addition, people with p ost-secondary education were 2.0 (95% CI: 1.5 to 2.7) times more likely to use CAM than those without post-secondary education (Table 7.2). After entering the second block of predictor variab les, the above noted demographic results remained significant (Table 7.2). Additional predic tor variables were estimated. Those participants who had consulted a GP in the precedin g 12 months were 1.7 (95% CI: 1.5 to 2.8) times more likely to use CAM than those who had not visited a GP in the preceding 12 months. Consistent with this, those participants wh o had consulted a GP four or more times in the preceding 12 months were also 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.1) times higher than those had visited a GP less than four times. The percentage o f accurate classification (PAC) increased slightly from 70.1 to 70.7. The results in block three further suggest that tho se agreed with the statement of \"insurance coverage of CAM influences the decision to purchase health insurance\" were 3.0 (95% CI: 2.2 to 4.2) times more likely to use CAM than those who did not agree with the statement, after all other predictor variables were statistically co ntrolled. The Omnibus Tests, which provided an indication of how well the model executes, incre ased to a chi square value of 102.823 (df=7, p<0.0001). The percentage of accurate classi fication further increased to 72.0 (Table 7.2). 232 Table 7.1 Bivariate analyses of predictor variables for CAM use Predictors 2 (degree of freedom) p value Demographic factors (block one) Gender (female=0, male=1) 15.119 (1) 0.0001 Age group (18-34 year old, 35-64, 65+) 17.494 (2) 0.0002 Residential area (New South Wales, Victoria, Queens land, South Australia, Western Australia) 4.604 (4) 0.33 good/good , fair/poor) 0.659 (1) past 12 months (yes/no) 10.468 (1) 0.001 Visited GP 4 or more times in past 12 months (yes/n o) 6.434 (1) 0.011 External factors (block three) Covered by private health insurance (yes/no) 6.458 (1) 0.011 Coverage of CAM influences insurance purchase (yes/ no) 84.285 (1) <0.0001 Believe CAM should be regulated as rigorously as We stern medicine (yes/no) 1.987 (1) 0.159 Health conditions (block four) Visited GP for 18 specific health problems (dichoto mous measures: yes/no): 1.

Table 7.4 prese nts the multivariate analysis results. Similar to the findings on CAM use, for visiting CAM practitio ners, it was shown that, in addition to gender and educational background, household income ranges and participants' country of birth are significant predictors for CAM practition er visits. Among these predictor variables, household income appeared to be the most significan t factor. Participants with an income range between A$20,000 and A$40,000 were 2.0 (95% C I: 1.2 to 3.2) times more likely to use CAM than participants with an income of less than A $20,000. In addition, the odds of those having an income higher than A$40,000 being CAM use rs was 2.3 (95% CI: 1.5 to 3.5) times higher than those with an income of less than A$20, 000. Again, similar to the findings on CAM users, after entering block 2 and block 3 variables, two variables were found to contribute significantly to the model for visits to CAM practitioners: consulted a GP in the past 12 months and how insura nce coverage of CAM influences insurance purchase. Among demographic, health and e xternal factors, the influence of insurance coverage of CAM on the purchase of health insurance was the most significant factor associated with visiting a CAM practitioner. Those who believed that insurance coverage of CAM would influence their purchase of h ealth insurance were 3.5 (95% CI: 2.6 to 4.7) times more likely to visit CAM practitioners t han those without such a belief. The above regression model (Table 7.4, block four) also suggested that two additional factors were associated with CAM practitioner visits. Peopl e who had consulted a GP for back problems or for trauma/injury problems were 2.0 to 2.6 times more likely to have visited CAM practitioners than people with other specific h ealth conditions. 235 Table 7.3 Bivariate analyses of predictor variables for CAM practitioner visits Predictors 2 (degree of freedom) p-value Demographic factors (block one) Gender (female=0, male=1) 11.510 65+) 8.749 (2) 0.013 Residential area (New South Wales, Victoria, Queens land, South Australia Western Australia) 2.497 (4) 0.645 good/good , fair/poor) 0.515 (1) past 12 months (yes/no) 17.077 (1) <0.0001 Visited GP 4 or more times in past 12 months (yes/n o) 7.712 (1) 0.005 External factors (block three) Covered by private health insurance (yes/no) 13.616 (1) 0.0002 Coverage of CAM influences insurance purchase (yes/ no) 101.357 (1) <0.0001 Believe CAM should be regulated as rigorously as We stern medicine (yes/no) 2.313 (1) 0.128 Health conditions (block four) Visited GP for 18 specific health problems (dichoto mous measures: yes/no): 1.

The mean number of visits to a GP per respondents in this su rvey was 5.53 times in the 12-month period. When this figure was projected to the whole Australian adult population, the total estimated visits to GPs were 69.29 million times. Among these respondents who had visited a GP, almos t one fifth (19.1%) consulted a GP only for a general health check-up, to receive a prescri ption or immunization and/or, for travel or work-related medical examination purposes. Over six in ten respondents (60.1%) visited for a single medical problem and 20.8% for at least two m edical problems. The most common medical problems for which respondents visited a GP were cold/flu or virus infection (12.2% of total visits), (high) blood pressure (10.3%), in jury and trauma (6.6%), arthritis and gout (5.4%), and heart problems (5.1%). 238 7.1.3.2 Concurrent Use of CAM and Western Medicine Almost two out of five participants (38.1%) had vis ited both a medical doctor and a CAM practitioner in the preceding 12-month period, wher eas 42.7% had visited a medical doctor only and 6% had visited a CAM practitioner only. Th e remaining 13.2% of participants had not visited a medical doctor or a CAM practitioner (Figure 7.1). A relatively high proportion of people who had visited a medical doctor for back problems or trauma/injury had also visited a CAM practitioner (71% and 66% respectivel y). Among all participants, those who had visited a med ical doctor in the preceding 12 months were more likely to have also used any one of the 1 7 forms of CAM (71.1%) than those who had not visited a medical doctor (59.5%, 2=10.468, p=0.001). Consistently, those participants who had visited a medical doctor in the preceding 1 2 months were more likely to have also visited a CAM practitioner (47.2%) than those who h ad not visited a medical doctor (31.2%, 2=17.077, p<0.001). Figure 7.1 Visits to CAM and W estern medical practitioners Visited CAM practitioner only, 6.0% Did not visit CAM and WM practitioners, 13.2% Visited both CAM and WM practitioners, WM CAM: complementary and altern ative medicine 239 With respect to concurrent use, all identified CAM users were asked to respond to whether they had always used CAM alone, always used it toge ther with Western medicine or sometimes used the two together. Approximately one in five (21.8%) CAM users had always used CAM and Western medicine together, only one in eight (13.2%) CAM users always used CAM alone, and over half (54.1%) had used CAM somet imes together with Western medicine (the remaining 10.9% did not respond to this questi on). The total proportion of CAM users who mentioned that they sometimes or always used CA M and Western medicine together (75.9%) was similar to the above noted proportion w ithin CAM users who had also visited a medical practitioner in the preceding 12 months (71 .1%). Cross-tabulation analyses further revealed that the most significant difference of always using CAM together with Western medicine had been found b etween different age groups (Figure 7.2). That is, a relatively higher proportion (37.9 %) of those aged 65 or older had always concurrently used both CAM and Western medicine tha n those younger groups ( 2=22.079, p<0.001). Figure 7.2 Concurrent use of CAM and W estern medicine among different age groups 18.4 15.7 65.9 12.2 26.9 60.9 use CAM together with WM Always use CAM together with WM Always use CAM alone Note: proportions were calculated excluding people who did not respond to this question. 240 7.1.3.3 Communication between Consumers and Practitioners Among the 865 participants who had visited a medica l doctor in the preceding 12 months, almost three quarters (71.2%) were CAM users. Of th ese, less than half (44.9%) indicated that they always informed their medical doctors about th eir use of CAM, but almost one in five (17.9%) participants never informed their medical d octors about their CAM usage. An additional one third (30.3%) had sometimes informed their GPs. Significantly, female CAM users were more likely to discuss their CAM use with their GPs than male users were (52.2% vs. 40.4%), whereas a r elatively higher proportion (27.4%) of male users than female users (14.5%) had never done this ( 2=18.279, p<0.001, Figure 7.3). Perhaps surprisingly, users who were unemployed at the time of the survey were more likely to always inform their GPs than those who were empl oyed (55.0% vs. 42.9%, 2=8.793, p=0.012). Surprising also, a higher proportion (59. 2%) of older users (aged 65 and older) always informed their GPs than those in the younger age groups (35-64 years, 49.4% informed a GP; 18-34 years, 37.8% informed their GPs, 2=18.870, p=0.001). Figure 7.3 Gender difference in informing general p ractitioners about CAM use 52.2 33.3 14.5 40.4 32.2 27.4 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Female Male Never inform GP about CAM use Sometimes inform GP about CAM use Always inform GP about CAM use Note: proportions were calculated excluding people who did not respond to this question. 241 The most common reasons given by the surveyed CAM u sers for discussing their use of CAM with their medical doctors were that they considere d it necessary to do so (66.9%). Nearly one quarter (23.3%) of the CAM users had received advic e from their GPs to use CAM, whereas an additional 13.9% informed their GPs because thei r GPs had asked about their CAM use. Interestingly, the only significant difference in t he proportions of informing GPs among different socio-demographic groups was in users' em ployment status. A relatively higher proportion of those employed (16.0%) than those une mployed (9.4%) had informed their GPs because their GPs had asked them about their CAM us e ( 2=4.093, p=0.043). The most common reasons given by the CAM users in t he survey for not discussing their use of CAM with their medical doctors were that they di d not consider it necessary to do so (58.1%), and that they had not been asked by their doctors (22.4%). In addition, 10.1% of the CAM users considered that their GPs may not have be en happy to know that their patients had used CAM. Nearly one in ten CAM users (9.6%) furthe r responded that they had just forgotten to mention their CAM use to their GPs. Fu rthermore, there were two users whose GPs had advised them not to use CAM; the specific r eason for this was not collected. Not surprisingly, male users (70.8%) did not consid er it necessary to inform their GPs compared with (47.8%, 2=6.926, p=0.008) female users. Not unexpectedly, mo re female CAM users (21.3% compared to 3.2%, 2=10.69, p=0.001, of male users) were concerned about their GPs being unhappy if they knew about th eir patients' use of CAM. The view that GPs may not be happy was more common among those wi thout post-secondary education (17.1%) than .8%, 2=4.228, p=0.040). 242 7.1.4 Health Insurance and the Use of CAM 7.1.4.1 National Health Insurance Coverage of CAM Currently, the national health care system (Medicar e) in Australia does not cover the costs related to nearly all CAM products and practitioner s, with the exception of acupuncture treatment provided by a registered medical doctor a nd very limited allied health services (including chiropractic and osteopathy treatments) for patients with chronic diseases. All survey participants were asked about their percepti ons towards the possible extension of Medicare coverage to the four common provider-based and regulated CAM therapies: acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy. Participants were informed prior to the questions that \"realising the re is limited amount available to fund Medicare, do you think ...?\". This was an effort to m inimise the possible bias of \"more free coverage is always welcomed\", as commented on by so me researchers prior to the survey. Visits to Acupuncturists Over three quarters (82.4%) acupuncture users respo nded that Medicare should cover acupuncture treatment provided by acupuncturists, i n addition to that provided by GPs. The view was also supported by a large proportion of su rvey participants (71.4%). Of this number, 11.9% said this was conditional on the acupuncturis t being registered with the relevant government body. Cross-tabulation further revealed that the biggest variation in proportions of participants responding affirmatively to this quest ion was regional difference. In general, South Australia residents did not consider that Med icare coverage be extended to acupuncture (60.3% compared to 76.1% in New South Wales, 79.7% in Victoria, 84.5% in Queensland, 78.5% in Western Australia, 2=18.898, p=0.001). However, among acupuncture users , this 243 regional difference was not found ( 2=3.479, p=0.481). No other additional marked differ ence was found in other demographic information. Visits to Chinese Herbal Medicine Practitioners With respect to Medicare coverage of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) practitioners, over half of participants (57.4%) considered Medicare should also cover visits to CHM practitioners; 8.4% of this number believed this should be conditi onal on the CHM practitioner being registered with the relevant government body. It is worth noting that the Medicare coverage to CHM practitioners was demanded by vast majority of the current CHM users (90.2%). Cross- tabulation analysis further revealed that several d emographic characteristics were significantly related to the participants' response to this quest ion. Notably, those (69.1%) without post- secondary education were more likely to suggest cov erage than those with post-secondary education (58.7%, 2=11.103, p=0.001). In contrast, the proportion (57. 6%) of participants with household income more than A$40,000 who expres sed a positive coverage was less than the proportion of those with a lower household inco me (A$20,000-A$40,000, 71.5%, and <A$20,000, 67.0%, 2=12.83, p=0.002). Among different age and gender groups, the proporti ons of participants responding to the question on national health insurance coverage of C HM were significantly different. Female adults (66.1%) were more in favour of extending the coverage to CHM than male adults (60.0%, 2=3.856, p=0.05). In contrast, the younger adults (a ged 18-34, 56.0%) were less in favour of extending the coverage to CHM than the ol der people (35-64, 66.0% and 2=9.830, p=0.007). Among CHM users, a marked differe nce was not found, or the sample size was too small, to draw a significance f inding on cross-tabulation analysis. 244 Visits to Chiropractors As with acupuncture, a relatively high proportion o f participants considered it necessary for chiropractic treatment to be covered by Medicare (7 3.6% among all participants, or 87.1% among current chiropractic users). As could be expe cted, a higher proportion of positive suggestions came from those without private health insurance coverage (83.2% compared to those with private health insurance, 73.9%, 2=12.287, p=0.0005), and among those with a poor or fair health condition (84.8% compared to th ose with better health, 76.9%, 2=4.658, p=0.031). Furthermore, those without post-secondary education were more likely to be in favour of Medicare coverage of chiropractic than th ose with post-secondary education (83.7% vs. 74.0%, 2=13.705, p=0.0002). In general, there was no region al difference between the proportion of people who agreed and disagreed with Medicare coverage for chiropractic. However, among those who had used chiropractic, no such marked socio-demographic differences were identified. Visits to Osteopaths Regarding Medicare coverage of osteopathy treatment , compared to the above three CAM therapies, a relatively lower proportion (56.7%) of survey participants considered it should be covered. Among users, the proportion was increased to 85.8%. Marked differences were found in participants' responses towards osteopathy treatment. Similar to covering chiropractic treatment, a higher proportion of posi tive suggestions came from those without private health insurance (74.7% compared to those w ith private health insurance, 64.6%, 2=10.42, p=0.001), and among those without post-seco ndary than those with such education (65.1%, 2=8.884, p=0.003). When it came to the monetary aspe ct, it was not unexpected that the proportion (81.3%) of lower -income participants (<A$20,000) who were positive about Medicare coverage was much high er than those among the higher-income participants (A$20,000-A$40,000, 73.0%, and >A$40,0 00, 64.1%, 2=15.979, p=0.0003). Similar to acupuncture, there is a significant regi onal difference of the proportions of people who considered Medicare should cover osteopathy. In general, South Australia and Western Australia residents were more reluctant to suggest that Medicare coverage should extend to osteopathy (57.3% and 61.4%, respectively, compared to 70.2% in New South Wales, 73.2% in Victoria and 72.2% in Queensland, 2=9.770, p=0.044). For cross-tabulation analysis among osteopathy users, the sample size is relative ly small to draw a significant conclusion. 246 7.1.4.2 Private Health Insurance Coverage of CAM Information on participants' private health insuran ce coverage (PHI) status, has been analysed earlier as one of the key demographic characteristi cs in making comparisons of a series of questions on the possible correlation of private he alth insurance and the utilisation on CAM. Subgroup analyses on private health insurance among users of 17 specific forms of CAM, as well as on those who had visited relevant CAM pract itioners were presented in Table 4.5, Table 4.6, Table 4.10 and Table 4.11. In addition, participants' insurance claim history on CAM, as well as detailed opinions on private health insurance coverage of four regulated forms of CAM: acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy are presented. Overall, more than half (55.7%) of the survey respo ndents had private health insurance cover in the 12 months preceding the survey. A much small er proportion (28.1% among all participants, or 50.4% among respondents with priva te health insurance cover) indicated that their health insurance provided rebates on their ex penditure on CAM, and approximately one quarter (25.4%) of the participants did not remembe r or were not sure about CAM coverage. Among all participants, less than one in seven (13. 9%, or 24.9% among participants with private health insurance cover) actually received s ome form of CAM rebate from their insurance companies in the preceding 12 months. Among the 150 participants who had received health insurance CAM rebates, nearly half (49.5%) were for visits to chiropractors, one in th ree (35.2%) were for Western massage therapy. Visits to acupuncturists were the third (1 8.8%) most popular form of complementary therapies for which CAM users claimed a health insu rance rebate, closely followed by claims for visits to naturopaths (12.2%) and osteopaths (1 1.2%). A number of CAM users had also 247 claimed for other forms of CAM or visits to CAM pra ctitioners. These included Chinese herbal medicine (5 people), homeopathy (5), aromath erapy (5), Western herbal medicine (4), Chinese therapeutic massage (3), clinical nutrition (3), yoga (2), meditation (1) and energy healing (1). In addition, three persons had claimed for other forms of CAM, rather than the 17 investigated. Among those who had received a CAM rebate, nearly o ne third (31.0%) had claimed for two or more forms of CAM in the preceding year. However , among those who had received at least one rebate from their private health funds, l ittle variation between different demographic characteristics was found. An exception is those wi th post-secondary education, who were more likely to have claimed for CAM (30.9%) than th ose without post-secondary education (16.3%, 2=14.203, p=0.0002). Consistent with the high frequencies of people rece iving rebates for chiropractic and massage therapy, people having private health insurance wer e more likely to choose chiropractic treatment (19.0%) than those without (12.4%, 2=8.234, p=0.004), and were more likely to use massage therapy (32.5%) than those without (20. 9%, 2=17.625, p<0.0001). Participants' attitudes toward the possible influen cing factors that may have attracted them to purchase insurance are important considerations for the health insurance industry. Participants were asked: \"If a particular private health insuran ce company offered coverage of CAM for no or little additional cost, would that influence you to buy insurance from that company?\" Among all participants, nearly half (45.0%) agreed that coverage of CAM would influence their decision on purchasing health insurance; a fu rther 10.4% said it would probably influence their decision, whereas the remaining 44. 5% would not consider this to be an influencing factor. When examining specific charact eristics of all participants, it is clear that 248 the younger adults with post-secondary education, e mployed, with private health insurance and with a higher household income would be more li kely to consider that this would influence their purchase of health insurance (Table 7.5). In addition, those identified as CAM users in the current study appeared to be more infl uenced than non-CAM users (Table 7.5). Table 7.5 Will CAM coverage influence the purchase of private health insurance?

However, nearly one in five (18.9%) participants believed it did not need to be covered by private health insurance. The proportion who agreed acupuncture sh ould be covered by private health insurance increased to 81.7% among current acupunct ure users, while the proportion (13.0%) who believed acupuncture should not be covered rema ined relatively high. Among all participants and among all acupuncture users, no ma rked difference was observed between different characteristics in responding to whether or not acupuncture should be covered by private health insurance. Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) Nearly two thirds (64.9%) of all participants consi dered visits to CHM practitioners should be covered by private health insurance, even they had to pay a slightly higher premium. This number included 4.1% who were in favour of such cov erage only if the practitioners were registered. However, more than one quarter (25.6%) of participants believed CHM did not need to be covered by private health insurance. The proportion of participants who agreed that visits to CHM practitioners should be covered by pr ivate health insurance increased to 81.0% 250 among current CHM users, while the proportion (15.0 %) who considered visits to CHM practitioners should not be covered was also relati vely high. Among all participants, a few marked differences we re observed in the characteristics in responding to whether visits to CHM practitioners s hould be covered by private health insurance. Surprisingly, the proportion (75.9%) of participants without private health insurance who believed that visiting CHM practition ers should be covered was higher than the proportion among those currently having private hea lth insurance (68.8%, 2=5.887, p=0.015). On the other hand, CHM users were more li kely to suggest private health insurance coverage for CHM (84.3%) than non-CHM users (70.7%, 2=6.018, p=0.014). (79.9%) of all participants consi dered visits to chiropractors should be covered by private health insurance, even they had to pay a slightly higher premium. However, the proportion of participants (14.1%) who believed chiropractic did not need to be covered was also relatively high. The proportion wh o agreed chiropractic should be covered increased to 90.4% among chiropractic users, wherea s the proportion of people who believed chiropractic should not be covered decreased to 6.4 %. Consistent with this, chiropractic users in the current study appeared to request chiropract ic to be covered by private health insurance more than non-chiropractic users (93.4% vs. 83.4%, 2=10.987, p=0.001). Specifically, the younger adults without post-secon dary education and without private health insurance were more likely to agree that chiropract ic should be covered by private health insurance (Table 7.6). When examining the attitude towards chiropractic coverage among chiropractic users only, these marked differences h owever, did not exist. 251 Table 7.6 Should visits to chiropractors be covered by private health insurance? Should be covered by private health insurance? Statistical difference Characteristics Yes (%) No (%) Chi Square p Age (year) Health Insurance 6.085 0.014 Yes 82.9 17.1 No 88.4 11.6 Osteopathy Nearly two thirds (65.7%) of all participants belie ved visits to osteopaths should be covered by private health insurance, even they had to pay a slightly higher premium; 17.0% believed it did not need to be covered. The proportion of parti cipants who agreed osteopathy should be covered by private health insurance increased to 84 .2% among current osteopathy users, while one in ten (9.3%) believed osteopathy should not be covered. The percentage of those osteopathy users in the cur rent study who considered that osteopathy be covered by private health insurance was greater than for non-osteopathy users (90.0% vs. 78.9%, 2=3.301, p=0.069, not statistically different). On t he other hand, a higher proportion of participants without private health insurance (8 3.0%) considered that visits to osteopaths should be covered by private health insurance than those currently having private health insurance (77.2%, 2=4.568, p=0.033). Among all participants and among all osteopathy users, no additional marked difference was observed between different characteristics in responding to whether or not osteopathy should be c overed by private health insurance. 252 7.1.5 Regulation and the Use of CAM 7.1.5.1 CAM Products and Government Regulation Currently in Australia, the regulation of therapeut ic products, including CAM products, is separated from CAM practitioner regulation (mandato ry registration). All survey participants were asked whether CAM prod ucts should be subjected to rigorous regulation, similar to the standards set for Wester n medicine. A total of 944 participants (unweighted figure) responded to this question, whi le 123 participants did not respond. Among all participants, nearly three quarters (73.6 %) considered that CAM products should be regulated as rigorously as Western medicine prod ucts, whereas 15.3% did not consider this necessary. Of the 944 participants, a higher propor tion of female adults (86.2%) than male participants (79.3%, 2=7.977, p=0.005) were in favour of such regulation. Age and other demographic factors seemed to have little influence on the proportion of those in favour of regulation of CAM products. Among CAM users, a very similar proportion (74.0%) agreed that CAM products should be regulated in the same way as Western medicine produ cts. A proportion of CAM users (16.6%) did not agree with this statement, which was slight ly higher than the proportion of all participants (15.3%). The above noted gender differ ential between people who agreed and disagreed with the regulation statement remains sig nificant among CAM users, although such variation is smaller (84.8% among female CAM users compared to 78.0% among male users, 2=5.189, p=0.023). 253 7.1.5.2 CAM Practitioner Registration Acupuncturists Participants were asked to respond to a question of relatively recent mandatory registration of two types of CAM practitioners: acupuncturists and Chinese herbal medicine practitioners in Victoria. These two types of practitioners are only subjected to government registration in Victoria, however, such registration will be implem ented in the states of Western Australia and New South Wales in the near future. Public atti tudes towards the implementation of registration in Victoria and the necessity for impl ementing it in all states and territories around Australia were sought from all participants. Well over four fifths (86.0%) believed that the man datory registration of acupuncturists in Victoria provided for greater public safety and con fidence in acupuncture. When excluding those who did not respond to this question, the big gest disagreements were between female and male participants and between people with and w ithout private health insurance. A higher proportion (95.8%) of female participants agreed wi th the public safeguards provided by government regulation than male participants (91.4% , 2=7.924, p=0.005), and people with private health insurance appear to be more likely t o agree with government regulation (95.8%) than those without private health insurance (90.8%, 2=9.898, p=0.002). When examining the responses of acupuncture users o nly, there is no gender difference, whereas there is a marked difference between people having and not having private health insurance. That is, all but one acupuncture user wi th private health insurance (98.6%) agreed with the safety viewpoint, while only 84.6% of acup uncture users without private health insurance agreed ( 2=6.920, p=0.009). 254 Given the existence of regulation in Victoria, it i s of particular interest to examine the possible regional difference in response to the question on acupuncture regulation provides public safety. However, for all participants, there is no marked difference among states; the proportion (93.8%) of Victoria participants who agr eed with the statement ranges in the middle among all states (from 91.9% to 97.4%, 2=3.38, p=0.496). In addition, a similar trend is also observed among acupuncture users only. Similar to the proportion of people who believe tha t mandatory registration of acupuncturists in Victoria would provide greater public safety, a high proportion (86.4%) of participants believed that all states and territories should req uire government regulation of acupuncturists. While there was less variance of gender difference, a statistically significant difference was observed between different age groups. A relatively higher proportion (95.3%) of middle-aged (35-64) participants agreed acupuncturists in all s tates and territories should be regulated than younger adults (18-34, 91.1%) and older adults (65+ , 91.5%, 2=6.602, p=0.037). The age differential, however, did not exist among acupunct ure users only. The above noted difference between people with and without private health insurance towards the statement on public safety and confidence is al so observed in the statement on the implications of government regulation on acupunctur e in all states and territories. Among those participants with private health insurance, 9 5% responded positively, while only 90.6% of those without private health insurance ( 2=9.134, p=0.003) responded positively. Among acupuncture users, the positive response was 98.6% among those with private health insurance but only 84.3% among those without privat e health insurance ( 2=6.970, p=0.008). 255 Chinese Herbal Medicine Practitioners The regulation of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) pra ctitioners in Australia is in the same situation as that relating to acupuncturists, that is, the registration of CHM practitioners is mandatory only in Victoria. In general, visits to a cupuncturists are more common than visits to Chinese herbal medicine practitioners (Table 4.8 ). In an attempt to validate possible similarities and/or differences in attitudes toward s the regulation of acupuncturists and CHM practitioners, all participants were also asked to respond to regulatory questions on CHM practitioners, similar to that regulatory question on acupuncturists, discussed above. Similar to the findings on the regulation of acupun cturists, well over four fifths (82.7%) believed the mandatory registration of CHM practiti oners in Victoria provided for greater public safety in CHM. When excluding those who did not respond to the regulatory question, the biggest variation in responses was between fema le and male participants and between people with different income ranges. A higher propo rtion (94.3%) of female participants agreed with the public safeguard on CHM than male p articipants (88.9%, 2=8.832, p=0.003), and those participants with middle-range household income (A$20,000-A$40,000) were also more likely to appreciate government regulation (96 .0%) than those with an income of less than A$20,000 (88.5%) and those with an income high er than A$40,000 (91.9%, 2=6.395, p=0.041). When examining the responses of CHM users only, none of these differences was observed. In terms of the possible regional difference in res ponding to current regulation on CHM practitioners in Victoria, both among all participa nts and among CHM users, there was no significant regional difference. However, surprisin gly, the proportion (81.8%) of CHM users in New South Wales who believed that regulation of CHM practitioners would enhance public 256 safety was considerable lower than the proportions in other states (95.0% to 100.0%), although it is not statistically significant ( 2=4.505, p=0.342). With respect to the implementation of CHM regulatio n in all states and territories, a high proportion (85.0%) of participants believed all sta tes/territories should require government regulation of CHM practitioners. However, both amon g all participants and among CHM users, there was no marked difference between diffe rent demographic information. Nevertheless, the proportions of CHM users in New S outh Wales and South Australia (77.7% and 85.4%, respectively) who considered all states/ territories should regulate CHM practitioners were considerable lower than the prop ortions in other states (94.5% to 100.0%), although it is not statistically significant ( 2=5.584, p=0.232). 257 7.1.6 Lifetime Use of CAM In addition to the 737 (weighted percentage 68.9%) participants who have been identified as CAM users in the current study, 42 (4.1%) used pray er (when considered as a form of CAM) and three (0.34%) used other forms of CAM only. Thu s, when these are included, a higher proportion (73.4%) of CAM prevalence is estimated b y the current survey. The remaining 285 participants who did not use any form of CAM (this also excluded prayer and other forms of CAM) in the 12 months preceding the survey were asked about their lifetime use of CAM. Of these, a further 39.3% had used CAM at some time. Thus, among all participants in the current survey, 83.7% had used CAM products or had visited CAM practitioners at some time in their lives. On the o ther hand, among the lifetime-only CAM users (i.e. not a current CAM user, 110 in total), the demographic characteristics are similar to the above-noted characteristics among those CAM use rs (Table 7.7). 258 Table 7.7 Socio-demographic characteristics of life time-only CAM users Lifetime CAM user Statistical difference Characteristic Yes (%) No (%) Chi Square p Gender 10.644 0.001 Female 52.2 47.8 Non-Australia 33.4 66.6 State 9.864 0.043 New South Wales 41.8 34.2 65.8 Queensland 43.7 56.3 South Australia 8.589 0.003 Employed 47.2 52.8 Unemployed or labour 29.2 70.8 Private Health Insurance 0.852 0.356 Yes Future Use of CAM Among all survey participants, over four fifths (81 .0%) reported that they would consider using CAM for their health care in the future, whil e a relatively small proportion (11.2%) would not consider using it; the remaining 7.7% pre ferred not to respond to this question or were unsure about their future use of CAM. More spe cifically, of the 988 participants who made a definitive answer as to whether or not they would consider using CAM in the future, those who were female, younger adults, in a better health condition, employed and with higher income range were more likely to use CAM in the fut ure (Table 7.8). On the other hand, among CAM users, the vast majori ty (93.4%) indicated they would use CAM again, whereas 3.4% users would not consider us ing CAM in the future. Of these 25 CAM users who would not consider using CAM in the f uture, none, surprisingly, had previously experienced side-effects after using acu puncture, Chinese herbal medicine, chiropractic or osteopathy. Furthermore, the propor tion of people who would consider using CAM in the future increased to 95.4% of those who h ad visited a CAM practitioner in the previous 12 months. 260 Table 7.8 Consideration for CAM use in the future Consider using CAM in the future Statistical difference Characteristic Yes (%) No (%) Chi Square p Gender 10.717 0.001 Female 91.3 8.9 Male 84.3 5.9 88.8 11.2 Non-Australia 84.8 15.2 State 8.062 0.089 New South Wales 88.3 11.7 Victoria 89.6 10.4 Queensland 89.8 10.2 South Australia 78.2 21.8 Western Australia 87.9 12.1 10.6 Employment 19.666 0.0001 Employed 91.3 8.7 Unemployed or not in labour force 81.6 18.4 Private Health Insurance 2.794 0.095 Yes 89.3 10.7 No Discussion 7.2.1 Rationale for CAM Use Apart from the characteristics discussed above rela ting to CAM use, there are factors that are often reported to be associated with a high prevale nce of CAM, such as \"perceived holistic approach of dealing with general health and disease s by CAM products and therapies\", \"perceived unmet health-care needs\", \"perceived hig her risk of conventional medicine, or perceived lower risk of non-conventional medicine\", and \"belief in the efficacy of conventional medicine and/or the actual experience of the efficacy of the therapies\". 46 This survey asked all CAM users about their attitud es towards some common beliefs and attitudes to CAM use. However, in the survey, data on such beliefs and attitudes were not collected from those who were not CAM users. This c onsequently limits the extent to which the current survey can interpret the attitudes towa rds the use of CAM and conventional medicine. A comprehensive rationale for CAM use, in particular the rationale for not using CAM in Australia, remains unclear at this stage. Ne vertheless, over half of CAM users believed Western medicine had a relatively high ris k of adverse events, while less than a quarter of CAM users did not agree CAM is relativel y safe. On the other hand, a relatively high proportion of CAM users (well over three quart ers) agreed that CAM is a holistic or a natural approach to treatment. When it comes to medical/health services, there is evidence of people using CAM because they have a poor perception of other health service s. 206-208 A small proportion of the current study's participants also expressed this view. Near ly one in four CAM users in this survey believed that the service provided by their GPs was generally unsatisfactory. However, again, 262 whether such a viewpoint differed between CAM users and non-CAM users is unknown, as non-CAM users were not asked whether or not they we re satisfied with medical services. The association between the attitudes towards, and expe rience of, Western medicine and their use of CAM is non-conclusive in the literature. Astin's US study found that negative attitudes towards, and experience of, conventional medicine w ere not predictive of CAM use. 46 In contrast, some earlier studies, based mainly on cli nical patients, found a positive association towards CAM use. 209-212 Thus, in a recent study, it was suggested that alt hough being \"very satisfied\" with overall care was significantly asso ciated with much less CAM use, satisfaction with doctor-patient interaction was not associated with CAM use. 213 There is ample evidence to suggest that those who a re female and in a relatively higher social class are more likely to use CAM. This was also con firmed in the current survey. However, these characteristics of CAM users should not be co nfused with the rationale for CAM use. In addition, it would be more appropriate to describe attitudes and perceptions towards CAM use as factors that may relate to CAM use, rather than the \"rationale\" or \"why\" people use CAM. Grzywacz et al . suggested that adults of different ages and races are using different forms of CAM to treat illnesses or prevent them. 153 The demographic characteristics related to CAM use, such as age range and income range, refer, in fact, to individuals' spending power (income), and the fact that the current middle-age adults were highly exposed to CAM during its rapid proliferation during the past two decades . 153 Thus, rather than concluding that a group of factors may have contributed to overall CA M use, there may have been numerous factors that could have contributed to different CA M modalities. CAM therapies aimed primarily at treatment, such as alternative-medicin e systems (e.g. Chinese medicine), may be better explained by a health-behaviour model, guide d by scientific evidence of efficacy and safety, and the health conditions of the users. Whe reas, CAM therapies that are generally used 263 for the promotion of health (e.g. meditation and ot her mind-body therapies) may be better explained by a health-belief model, guided by a hol istic approach and perceptions of use. 153 As noted above, CAM utilisation studies are commonl y conducted with cancer patients. Studies on rationale or on why patients choose CAM are also more commonly conducted with cancer patients. This has been emphasised in a rece nt published systematic review of 52 cancer studies. 214 The review revealed that such results are more pro mising in terms of clinical implications of CAM use. It found that frequently r eported factors influencing CAM use were the belief that conventional medical treatment (e.g . chemotherapy) had harmful side-effects, 215 that CAM could control the side-effects believed to be caused by Western medicine 216-219 and that CAM was a non-toxic or less harmful therapy th an Western medicine. 63,220-224 However, it is still important to note that the definition o f overall CAM is still a major barrier to a generalisation of the above findings. Thus, perhaps the rationale for CAM use may be particularly important for health-care professional s in clinical practice, if such a model of the rationale for using CAM was established on the basi s of a single cohort of clinical patients. Finally, given the increasing emphasis on scientifi c evidence for both CAM and Western medicine, it is important to evaluate the resources where people receive information (particularly evidence of efficacy), and what types of resources or health interventions would influence the choices of CAM therapies. Ideally, th ese should be based on the use of CAM for specific health conditions, to better comprehend th e complex trend of health-seeking behaviours. 264 7.2.2 Regression Analyses on CAM Use Participants' characteristics of CAM use discussed above were based on statistical analyses at a bivariate level. Therefore, such findings have no t been adjusted for potential confounders that may influence the associations of CAM with som e particular characteristics. Such an approach is commonly used in the early stages of ex ploring the factors that may relate to CAM use, or as confirmatory analyses of previous fi ndings, which is consistent with the objectives of the current survey. On the other hand , multivariate regression analyses were conducted to further confirm previous findings in A ustralia and overseas, and to discover the likelihood of individual factors that were related to CAM use among adult Australians. In terms of demographic information, gender, age an d educational background were found to be statistically associated with CAM use among curr ent survey participants. In this respect, the odds ratio of females versus males using CAM wa s estimated as 1.6 in the current survey (the final predictive model, see Table 7.2), which is the same as the 2000 South Australian survey, 10 is very similar to an earlier 1993 South Australia study (odds ratio=1.7), 9 and is slightly higher than a 1999 Canadian study (odds ra tio=1.3). 48 The current survey also estimated that educational background is highly associated with CAM use. That is, those people with a post-secondary ed ucation are 1.9 times more likely to use CAM than those without a post-secondary education. This significant finding was also reported in the 2000 South Australia study, althoug h the odds ratio was less significant. 10 It is of interest to note that in an in-depth US study on why patients use CAM, education also emerged as the only significant socio-demographic v ariable that will predict CAM use. 46 265 In the current survey, age also emerged as another significant factor that predicts CAM use. While this was not reported in the 2000 South Austr alia study, 10 it had been previously estimated in a 1993 South Australia study 9 conducted by the same group of researchers. The estimated odds ratios were similar. The oldest age range (55+ in the South Australia study or 65+ in the current survey) appeared to have the sma llest odds ratio (i.e. less likely to use CAM). Again, this was consistent with the 1999 Cana dian study. 48 The health behavioural model (HBM) 225 is one of the conventional models used to study hea lth behaviour as a predictor of health care use. Thus, this may be particularly relevant in predicting the use of CAM services. Some researcher s have taken this model into consideration. 226 It has been hypothesised and confirmed that indivi dual believes the philosophic of CAM use related to holistic and natu ral characterises are more likely to use CAM.46 In addition, individual with \"perceived unmet heal th care needs\" was also found to be 1.5 times more likely to be CAM users than those wi thout such a perception. 48 Unfortunately, in the current study, data related to health behavi our was collected from CAM users only, and not from all surveyed participants. Therefore, it i s not possible to include such data into a predictive model for this study. Nevertheless, othe r perceptions that are possibly associated with the use of CAM by adult Australians were colle cted, and emerged from the regression analysis. Notably, the view of health insurance cov erage of CAM influences the decision to purchase of such insurance was frequently reported only among those CAM users. Finally, although specific health conditions were n ot found significantly as predictor variables in the model of CAM use, back problems and trauma/i njury were found to be significantly associated with those who had visited CAM practitio ners over a 12-month period. The odds ratio (2.6) of people with back problems seeking CA M practitioners in the current survey was similar to a previous US study (2.3). 46 266 7.2.3 Impact of Health Insurance on CAM Use National Health Insurance CAM has become a vast resource for health care inte rnationally. The increasing popularity of CAM is also echoed by the increasing involvement of health insurance companies. In the US, based on a national survey, 227 Wolsko reported that full or partial coverage of C AM by health insurance providers is strongly associated with hig h-frequency use of CAM services. In the United Kingdom, there is a growing trend for the Na tional Health Service to cover complementary medicine services. 228 As CAM becomes widely available and acceptable in A ustralia, there is greater public interest in CAM being included under the cover provided by t he national health insurance system (Medicare). For example, a study conducted over 10 years ago found that acupuncture services in Australia have risen steadily over the past two decades, and 15.1% of GPs in Australia have claimed Medicare rebates for acupuncture treatment.167 Certainly, with the increasing evidence of a large proportion of GPs in Australia now practicing acupuncture and other CAM therapies, 95 the number of Medicare claims for acupuncture serv ices performed by GPs is considerable. In 2002-2003, as estimated by the Aus tralian Institute of Health and Welfare, the Australian Health Insurance Commission (HIC) pr ovided A$13.5 million for 595,000 acupuncture Medicare procedures performed by medica l practitioners. 147 However, research on national health insurance and private health insurance and CAM use in Australia is extremely limited. Previous health sur veys and surveys on CAM in Australia failed to investigate the possible correlation betw een insurance and CAM use, and did not explore the perceptions of, and attitudes towards, insurance and CAM use among Australians. 267 Thus, it is important to note from the current surv ey that approximately three quarters of participants who considered visits to practitioners of acupuncture and chiropractic should be covered by the Australian national health care; eve n though the surveyed participants were asked to take into account that there is limited mo ney to fund Medicare for all Australians. Well over half of all participating adults consider ed Medicare should also cover visits to practitioners of Chinese herbal medicine and osteop athy, regardless of their status as current CAM users. A recent endorsement from the Australian Government is promising for the future integration of CAM in the national health system. Thus, from 1 July 2005, new items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) will make it easier for GPs to manage the health care of patients with chronic medical conditions, including patients needing multidisciplinary care. Eligible Australian patients are now allowed to receive up t o five Medicare rebates from certain allied health practitioners, including chiropractors and o steopaths. 187 As Pelletier and Astin pointed out, an increasing n umber of health providers, including hospitals, in the US are incorporating CAM to meet the high demand from consumers; however, the uncertainty about the profitability of CAM is a primary obstacle to such integration. 229 Thus, a representative national survey in Australi a should be carried out to assess the true consumer demand of CAM coverage and reimbursement from Medicare. Optimistically, it will derive a set of commonly de manded CAM to be included in the Medicare system, which is rapidly growing in use an d which is supported by growing rigorous scientific evidence. 268 Private Health Insurance The \"legitimisation\" of a number of forms of CAM pr actice through statutory regulation in states or nationwide in Australia, for example, chi ropractic, osteopathy, Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture, and approval by the Thera peutic Goods Administration to market certain complementary medicines, raises considerati ons of relative access and equity for CAM and mainstream health care. As noted, in Australia, CAM treatments do not qualify for Medicare rebates, with the exception of limited ref erral services for chiropractic and osteopathic treatments, and acupuncture delivered b y medical practitioners accepted by the Health Insurance Commission. Nevertheless, at prese nt, some forms of CAM have attracted limited coverage from most major private health ins urance funds in Australia. In Australia, in March 2006, nearly half (43.1%) th e Australian population were covered by private health insurance. 230 Most health insurance providers in Australia, incl uding the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia (HCF), New castle Industrial Benefits (NIB) private health funds, Medibank Private Limited and the Medi cal Benefits Fund of Australia Limited (MBF) had benefit packages, which included rebates for some forms of CAM (generally chiropractic, remedial massage, osteopathy and acup uncture). However, detailed availability and public demand for private health insurance reba tes for CAM in Australia is unknown. In the current study, although over half (55.7%) of survey participants had private health insurance, less than one in seven (13.9%) had recei ved a rebate from their insurance companies for CAM services in the previous 12 month s. It appears that the cost of using CAM is mainly borne by individuals. With some 1.87 mill ion Australians being recipients of the age pension (low household incomes), 149 the socio-economic implications of high levels of CAM use in the elderly needs to be considered. 269 The use of chiropractic remains one of the most sub stantial CAM services in Australia and overseas. 11,231 A considerably high prevalence of chiropractic has also been found in this study, and it was for the most popular forms of CAM , together with remedial massage and acupuncture, that CAM users had lodged health insur ance claims. In particular, nearly half of those people who had received private health insura nce rebates on CAM were for chiropractic services. This may be partially explained by the fa ct that, the practice of chiropractic in Australia, which has a history of over 100 years ag o, 232 and which has been subjected to mandatory registration with regulatory bodies in al l states and territories of Australia, is one of the earliest and most common forms of CAM services covered by private health insurance in Australia. Perhaps, it is not surprising that, in t he US, a large telephone interview study revealed that virtually all the insurance providers in three states in the northeast of the US cover chiropractic services in some form, whereas o nly less than half of the insurance companies cover acupuncture or massage therapy. 233 Perhaps one can also expect that people with privat e health insurance are more likely to choose chiropractic and remedial massage, as at lea st part of these services are currently covered by private health insurance in Australia. T he present study has confirmed this supposition. Similarly, it is clear that a much hig her proportion of people with private health insurance are likely to choose acupuncture services than those without such coverage. Given that the mandatory registration of acupuncture prac titioners has been in place in Victoria, and is soon to be introduced in some other states in Au stralia, the association of private health insurance and acupuncture use also needs further in vestigation. Among all participants in this survey, nearly half agreed that insurance coverage of CAM would influence their decision on purchasing health insurance. It is of interest to n ote that a four-year retrospective data analysis on insurance claims suggested that people with chir opractic insurance coverage had lower annual health-care expenditure, compared to those w ithout such coverage. 234 270 Based on existing literature, there is strong evide nce that many cancer patients will seek CAM therapies if insurance covers the cost. 235 More specifically, the use of naturopathy and acupuncture were more common, while the use of chir opractic was less common for cancer patients than people without cancer. 235 Detailed information on which forms of CAM have been claimed for which specific health conditions w ere not researched in this survey. Australian literature in this area has not been rep orted. Nevertheless, the majority of the current survey participants suggested private healt h insurance should cover the common forms of CAM, such as acupuncture and chiropractic. Thus, private health insurances in Australia cover certain common forms of CAM to a certain exte nt (approximately A$400-A$600 per year for a single person). However, it is not compr ehensively understood whether consumers are fully utilising such coverage and what their at titudes towards the extent of the coverage are. Finally, the consequences (particularly the economi c aspects for the consumers and insurance companies) of including CAM in private health insur ance policy have been poorly researched in Australia and overseas. This suggests the need f or a representative national survey in the near future to meet the demands of rapidly growing CAM use and the potential requirements of insurance coverage in Australia. 271 7.2.4 Impact of Regulation on CAM Use A regional Australian study in 2000 suggested that there has been a steady increase in the use of CAM by the South Australian population in the pr evious 10 years. 10 However, researchers also suggested a decline in the CAM market in 2004,11 which could be attributed to consumer response to the adverse publicity generated by the TGA recalling Pan Pharmaceutical products from the market in 2003. 236 In contrast to this finding, the current survey fo und an increase in CAM use, when compared to these South Australia stu dies in 1993, 2000 and 2004. 9-11 However, the CAM classification used in these surve ys was inconsistent, the targeted population were divergent (regional and national), and importantly, the current survey suggests the lowest CAM prevalence was, in fact, fo und in the state where the regional studies were conducted (South Australia). 9-11 Thus, whether the Pan Pharmaceutical product recal l would have impacted on the popularity of CAM use in Australia is unclear. As a cross- sectional survey, the current survey is not able to confirm the trend of CAM use over time. To strengthen the framework of CAM regulation in Au stralia in 2005 the Australian Government accepted most of the recommendations mad e by the Expert Committee on Complementary Medicines in the Australian Health Sy stem. 26 It is essential that a safety guide be established for the Australian general public to address continuing concerns of CAM use. Therefore, importantly, the Therapeutic Goods Admin istration has recently published a series of Australian regulatory guidelines for complementa ry medicines (ARGCM) to ensure that all therapeutic goods, including complementary medicine s use and practice in Australia, are subject to rigorous standard. 237-241 Whether such regulatory guidelines will contribute to the future increased use of CAM is unclear and will be hard to determine. As Weir sugg est, there are many factors that may 272 contribute to the increasing use of CAM, including the higher cost of conventional medicine and the inability of science to provide a cure for all illnesses with a single form of medicine. 242 From a sociological perspective, Coulter and Willi s also suggested that the \"baby boomers\" in Australia will age with a variety of ch ronic diseases, which are often considered to amenable to treatment by some forms of CAM. 243 The increasing availability of health insurance coverage for CAM will also increase the l ikelihood of people choosing a CAM service. 243 Some three quarters of participants in the current survey considered CAM products should be regulated as rigorously as Western medicine. This f igure includes those who did not identify themselves as CAM users. This, perhaps, further ref lects a demand from the general public to have safer CAM products in Australia. In addition, this also echoes the findings of a recent South Australia survey that about half the survey p articipants assumed that a government agency tested CAM products. 11 Currently, the practice of Chinese medicine in Aust ralia, outside the jurisdiction of Victoria, is not subject to statutory registration. Nationwide, with the exception of chiropractic and osteopathy, there is no statutory registration requ irement for other CAM professions. Over the past decades, some CAM professions in Australia hav e developed a self-regulatory system. Such regulatory mechanisms have been established in the absence of, or to complement legislation requiring mandatory registration, and r ely on voluntary compliance by members of the relevant professions and industry organisations . 244 In Australia, the Australian Self- Medication Industry (ASMI) is the highest profile o rganisation representing industries involved in the manufacture and distribution of non -prescription consumer health-care products, such as over-the-counter medicines and co mplementary medicines. 273 In the interests of comprehending better the potent ial impact of the introduction of the statutory registration of Chinese medicine in a sta te of Australia (Victoria), this study specifically asked participants' about their percep tions toward this regulation. This study found that well over four fifths of survey particip ants considered that the statutory registration of Chinese medicine practitioners, including acupun cturists and Chinese herbal medicine practitioners, provided for greater public safety a nd confidence in these forms of CAM. Significantly, there were similar proportions of su rvey participants from other states and territories. Furthermore, when asked whether acupun cturists and Chinese herbal medicine practitioners should be subject to registration wit h government authorities in all states and territories of Australia, again, well over four fif ths of all survey participants considered it necessary. Such a proportion was observed both amon g the Victorian participants and participants from any other states/territories. Thu s, as Carlton and Bensoussan commented, the Victorian Chinese Medicine Registration Act provide s a model for regulating those CAM professions where the practices are potentially int rusive and dangerous. 244 A previous study in Melbourne in 2002 found a large proportion of survey participants would consult a Chinese medicine practitioner who was not registered, and only 20% considered that such a registration system would make them more con fident about consulting Chinese medicine practitioners. 62 As noted above, a large proportion of participants from this survey considered that statutory registration of Chinese m edicine professions was important. Thus, it appears that Chinese medicine has been valued in Vi ctoria since its introduction. Unfortunately, whether people are still prepared to consult an unregistered Chinese medicine practitioner was not asked in current study. 274 7.2.5 Risks Associated with CAM Use The risks associated with the use of CAM are growin g concerns for consumers, health professionals and governments. There is a widesprea d and misguided belief amongst consumers of many types of CAM products that since they are derived from natural sources they must be safe. However, herbal therapies are fr equently complex mixtures of potentially biologically active ingredients. Such remedies may have multiple actions and may carry a high risk of both direct adverse effects and of adverse effects arising from interactions between their constituents and concurrent conventional ther apeutic agents. It is of particular importance to note that nearly half of a survey pop ulation in Australia wrongly believed that CAM had been independently tested by a government a gency before being sold. 11 Surprisingly, those younger than 35 years old, who were better educated and had a relatively high income comprised a higher proportion of people who held this belief. 11 Additional concerns relate to the quality/purity of CAM products, the training of CAM practitioners, and the possibility that patients ma y discontinue beneficial conventional treatments. These concerns are particularly relevan t to the elderly and to victims of chronic illness, due to factors such as the high prevalence of chronic diseases of the elderly, greater use of conventional medication, and their likely gr eater susceptibility to adverse effects and to therapeutic interactions. These issues may be compo unded by poor communication between patients, CAM practitioners and conventional health -care practitioners, and indeed, by a lack of understanding by patients and practitioners of t he potential adverse effects of CAM use. 275 Adverse Events of CAM Use The potential risks associated with the use of medi cinal products are not completely avoidable. These apply to all forms of medicines an d therapies, including both Western medicine and CAM. Adverse events may occur with the use of products that have problems of contamination, toxicity, lack of quality control an d inappropriate labelling, 11 as well as problems related to the advice provided by health p rofessionals (it could be negligence). In addition, reports on interactions between CAM and W estern medicine are not unusual. 245-248 It is important that consumers should be aware of t he potential negative effects of all medicines or treatments they are taking. Current su rvey participants were asked about their experiences of encountering adverse events after us ing acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy (only if such a partici pant used one of these four forms of CAM). As noted-above, four participants claimed they expe rienced adverse events after acupuncture treatment. However, when the definition of adverse event relating to acupuncture was specified according to standards developed in colla boration with the British Medical Acupuncture Society,249 there was only one case which qualified as an adve rse event (bruise). An adverse event rate per 1,000 or per 10,000 pract itioner consultations have been reported. 250-252 Survey participants in the current study provided an estimated incidence of 14 adverse events per 10,000 acupuncture consultations , which is much lower than the adverse event rate estimated by a prospective survey of 32, 000 acupuncture consultations in the UK (i.e. an incidence of 684 per 10,000 consultations) . 249 However, the current estimation was based on self-reported cases from those surveyed ad ults, whereas the UK study was based on reports from acupuncture practitioners over a 21-mo nth period. The data are not directly comparable. 276 In the current survey, users of CHM, chiropractic a nd osteopathy also provided information on adverse events that may have been related to such C AM use. For the reasons mentioned in Chapters 6.1.1.9 and 6.1.3.4, the commonly estimate d incidence rate per 1,000 consultations was not available for CHM and osteopathy. The curre nt survey participants reported a relatively high incidence (2.96 per 1,000 consultat ions) of adverse events related to chiropractic treatment. Comparable data reported am ong Australian chiropractors were not identified at the time of writing this thesis. Neve rtheless, it is important to point out that safety issues have attracted continuing safety concerns in previous studies in Australia. Thus, it has been commented that the practices of forms of CAM a re not risk-free, and fatalities have occurred. 12,164,253 The incidence reported by Chinese medicine practit ioners (including acupuncture and CHM) was estimated at 1.6 per 1,000 consultations. 164 Adverse events associated with herbal medicines, nutritional subst ances and homeopathic medicines was estimated at 2.3 per 1,000 consultations. 12 In Australia, reports of suspected adverse reaction s to drugs/medicines are sought from health professionals and are also received from consumers. Section 29A of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 requires sponsors of medicines registered or listed in Australia to report adverse reactions. 237 However, as stated in the report submitted by the Expert Committee on Complementary Medicines in the Health System to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Australian Commonwealth Government, \"the current ad verse reaction reporting system may be biased away from complementary medicines, becaus e complementary medicines are usually self-prescribed and problems may not be rep orted, should they arise\". 14 Recently, a special \"1800\" telephone number has been establishe d within the Therapeutic Goods Administration to facilitate reporting of adverse r eactions 26 in an effort to strengthen the collection of adverse event. 12 277 Concurrent Use of CAM and Western Medicine Some consumers are so committed to CAM products and therapies that they actively self- prescribe or self-administer CAM. In the current st udy a high proportion of participants used CAM and conventional medical services concurrently, and that many CAM users did not inform their medical doctors (and the medical docto rs did not ask) about their use of CAM. Clearly, these findings are of concern, given the i ncreasing reports of side-effects of CAM products 254 and other problems, such as contamination of CAM p roducts. 255 A Canadian study conducted over a decade ago found users of chiropractic tended to also be concurrent users of conventional health care. 256 However, most studies in the current literature failed to investigate the concurrent use of specifi c forms of CAM and Western medicine. 11,47,257-259 Perhaps, one of the biggest limitations of the cur rent literature on the concurrent use of CAM and Western medicine is that it has failed to collect detailed information on which specific forms of CAM have bee n commonly used concurrently with Western medicine, and to what extent (e.g. used on the same day, for the whole duration of the illness, or only used intermittently). Addressi ng these limitations, in a recently published South Australia study, 11 CAM and Western medicine use on the same day was i nvestigated, and the study found that about half of CAM users ha d concurrently used Western medicine. Due to the time and resource limitations, the curre nt survey was not designed to collect such data. It is worth noting that the pattern of concurrent u se has been found to be related to some specific characteristics, such as gender and age. 260 In addition, some studies have also suggested that the greater the value the participan ts attached to spirituality, the greater the likelihood of users to use both treatments. 46,210,260 A national survey in the US further revealed 278 that adults who used both CAM and Western medicine appeared to value both, and were less concerned about their medical doctor's disapproval than about the their doctor's inability to understand or incorporate CAM therapy use within th e context of their medical management. 259 Supporting this finding, a relative lower proporti on of CAM users in the current survey was concerned that their medical doc tors may not approve of their use of CAM. The concurrent use of CAM and Western medicine amon g those over 65 years old is becoming a matter of concern, as the proportion of concurrent was about 80%, being the highest among all ages. 11 Similarly, in the current survey, a significantly higher proportion of participants aged 65 and above had concurrently use d both CAM and Western medicine than those of younger ages. The rationale of users for s uch concurrent use certainly warrants investigation in further studies. The high prevalen ce of concurrent use also suggests the need to educate older people to understand better the po tential risks of concurrent use, and increase the awareness of voluntary communication of such us e between older people and the health professionals. 279 Communication between Consumers and Practitioners The concurrent use of both CAM and Western medicine may increase risk, as the pharmacological action and therapeutic mechanism of most forms of CAM products and therapies are inadequately understood to allow heal th professionals to identify possible interactions. The use of CAM does not, in general, suggest dissatisfaction with conventional medicine. 259,261 Thus, more recently, researchers have addressed th e communication gap between conventional and alternative medicine. 262-266 In an interest to keep patients, CAM practitioners and medical doctors informed, and to provide better guidance to patients regarding the safety and efficacy of the concurrent use of CAM and Western medicine, the disclosure of CAM use to health professionals seems to be a critical step in future integrative health-care. Thus, comprehensive information to adv ise patients to use CAM is particular welcome. 267 The reported non-disclosure rates are significantly high. About half of the current survey participants had only sometimes, or never informed their medical doctors about their CAM use. A national US survey estimated that nearly two thirds (63%) of CAM users did not disclose at least one of their CAM therapies. 259 Furthermore, qualitative studies on clinical patients also discovered a high proportion of non-d isclosure. For example, a study on women with breast cancer found that nearly half (46%) did non disclose their use of CAM, 266 while another study on cancer patients revealed 34% non-d isclosure. 264 The lowest disclosure rate, in the literature, was 23% among older, rural women . 268 Although, as noted above, a significantly high prop ortion of participants aged 65 and older concurrently used both CAM and Western medicine tha n those in the younger age groups, these older CAM users, in fact, had a significantly higher proportion of always informed their 280 medical doctors of their CAM use than younger CAM u sers. This may be partially explained by the increasing popularity of CAM which has occur red in the past two decades, and most forms of CAM are relatively new to older people. Wh ile they are sensitive to CAM treatment to improve their health conditions, older people ma y be more proactive in informing their GPs, to optimise their health-care outcomes. In the current study, the main reasons for non-disc losure volunteered by survey participants were, \"medical doctors did not need to know\", and t he \"doctor did not ask\". Similar findings were commonly reported, 269-271 and have also been summarised in a recent review. 98 However, such \"don't know\" or \"don't ask\" results a re no longer acceptable in modern health care, and a proactive management system is needed t o approach individualised personal health. 261 It is of interest to examine the perspectives of co nventional health professionals about the communication of CAM use with their patients. A stu dy conducted in the state of Ohio, in the US, found that none of the physicians would termina te the physician-patient relationship if a patient used CAM, in addition to the prescribed con ventional medicines. 263 This should not be unexpected, as the use of CAM by conventional medic al doctors themselves was quite high, 265 and there are increasing debates about the benefits of conventional doctors proactively asking patients about their use of CAM. 261,267,272 As a greater understanding develops about the quest ion of the interaction of CAM with conventional medicines and the matter of full discl osure of such use, various ethical and legal issues are raised. 273,274 Even more contentious than ignoring patients' use of CAM, is the possibility that conventional medical doctors may b e at risk of potential malpractice liability. 275 For example, as scientific evidence of CAM is incr easingly acceptable to the 281 conventional medical system, there is a strong argu ment that medical doctors should advise patients about the CAM treatment options, in additi on to other medical treatment options, to satisfy the duty of care of a medical doctor. 276 On the other hand, on the basis of existing US laws, \"a physician referral to a CAM provider could be considered a \"negligent\" decision if it delays or eliminates the patient's opportunity to o btain necessary medical treatment\". 277 However, the risk of litigation for medical doctors ' failure to provide adequate information on CAM to patients is probably low at this stage. 278 In Australia, according to the General Guidelines f or Medical Practitioners on Providing Information to Patients, published by the National Health and Medical Research Council, a \"medical doctor should encourage patients to reflec t on opinions, ask more questions, and should be assist patients in seeking other medical opinion where this is requested\". 279 Thus, in 2002, the Australian Medical Council posted a posit ion statement (Section 4.4): \"the medical practitioners should specifically ask patients abou t their use of complementary medicine and take account of this in their management of conditi ons. Medical practitioners should be sufficiently well informed about complementary medi cine to be able to provide advice to patients when appropriate.\" 280 In summary, the fact of concurrent use of CAM and W estern medicine, and possibly other un- named forms of medicines or therapies, is no longer uncommon in today's health-care system. The trend of such use may increase over time. A bet ter understanding of the benefits of complementary and alternative medicine, and the pot ential risks of using these medicines is critical to improve the communication of such use b etween patients and health professionals. 282 7.2.6 Lifetime Use and Future Use of CAM In addition to investigating the prevalence of CAM use over a 12-month period, the current survey has also investigated the lifetime usage of CAM, that is, its use at least once at any time previously. Approximately five out of six adul t Australians have used CAM at some time in the past. The prevalence is comparable to a prev ious regional study in New South Wales, where three-quarters of the adults reported on a li fetime use of CAM. 38 In addition, consistent with noted regional differences of CAM use found in the current survey, the prevalence of lifetime use only (precluding current users) varied among different states. For example, the prevalence of lifetime use only in South Australia was found to be significantly lower about half the prevalence found in New South Wales, Queen sland and Western Australia. However, there may be a recall bias for lifetime CAM prevale nce, as participants may have used non- Western medicine years ago, and not able to recall the details. Lifetime use of CAM is occasionally reported among CAM surveys. In general, a significantly higher prevalence of lifetime use was reported, com pared to the prevalence over a 12-month period. This is evident in several frequently cited CAM surveys. For example, the prevalence rose from 42.1% for a 12-month period to 67.6% for a lifetime period in the 1997 US national survey. 281 The prevalence of lifetime use also increased from 50% to 73% in the 1997 Canadian national survey, 6 and from 28.3% to 46.6% in the UK survey. 5 Furthermore, the UK and Canadian studies also provided detailed informa tion on the lifetime use of each of the individual forms of CAM. The lifetime use of these therapies was generally consistent with the popularity of use for each modality in a 12-mon th period. 5,6 Limited information of such lifetime CAM use is available in the Australian lit erature, and has not been investigated in the current survey. 283 It is apparent that the use of complementary medici ne is more popular in Australia and in many Western countries than it was a decade ago. It is not hard to find reasons why this type of medicine is becoming more popular. The increasin g scientific evidence of the efficacy and safety of certain CAM therapies, and perhaps the re cognition of the cost-effectiveness of some specific forms of CAM would partially explain its p opularity. Thus, for various reasons (not investigated in the current survey), a large propor tion of the surveyed participants indicated that they would use CAM in the future, and a vast m ajority of the current users will use CAM again. 284 CHAPTER 8. GENERAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS 8.1 Overview of the CAM Survey The detailed outcomes of conducting the survey are presented in Chapter 4.1. In brief, a total of 1,067 interviews were conducted with a represent ative cohort of adult Australians. By employing a random-digit telephone dialling method to contact potential participants, and by applying a national quota to ensure representativen ess, the study population can be regarded as representative of the national Australian adult pop ulation. In addition, the representativeness of the study population is further confirmed though a series of statistical analyses (see Chapter 4.1.3). Using a predefined quality assurance protocol, the survey information was captured during interviews and recorded in a computer-assisted tele phone interview system. Thus, missing data were minimised. The validity of the data was e xtended after scale reliability analyses were carried out for different sections of the inst rument, which confirmed its internal consistency of items measured by the scale. Finally , after all data were collected, a data- weighting process was applied before generating the survey results and performing consequent analyses. Thus, all data were adjusted t o represent the national population. Although the current study was conducted with an ap propriate sample size and a national representative population, it is also important to note the study limitations when interpreting the results, in particular those concerning state d ifferences. These are discussed below. 285 8.2 Limitations of the CAM Survey The response rate is always a major concern for sur vey researchers, and is dependent on what is considered to be a completed interview. The rate can vary significantly according to some experienced survey companies. The response rate of the current survey is lower than for some other population surveys of its kind and could be c onsidered as a significant study shortcoming. It seems likely that the employment of national quotas for gender and age-range during the recruitment stage limited voluntary part icipation and impacted significantly on the final response rate. This is further evidenced by t he fact that when a particular quota category was filled (at an advanced stage of the recruitment process), a large number of potential participants was rejected (see Figure 4.1). The increasing use of telemarketing from call centr es making it harder for non-commercial telephone health surveys, such as the present surve y. In addition, the short period of survey may have influenced the response rate. Hence, the n umber of call-backs was limited, and there was not enough opportunity for optimising follow-up s. A large number of unresolved call- back numbers (76 appointments in total) would also have impacted on the final response rate. Finally, recognised government authorities administ er most population health surveys, and people may have a greater tendency to participate i n these. The low response rate may have introduced a non-response bias. If those refused to participate were less likely to use CAM or had negative attitudes towards CAM, this could resu lt in a decrease of the current overall estimation of CAM prevalence. The relatively small sample size in a number of sta tes and territories (i.e. Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and Tasmania) may hav e limited the results that can be generated at a state level. With a larger sample si ze, additional information would have been 286 generated. The most important information would be the definitive differences on regional use of CAM, and on the use of each of the 17 forms of C AM. The current survey suggests marked regional differences among states. However, the sam ple size was too small to draw conclusions from Tasmania, Northern Territory and A ustralian Capital Territory. Similarly, some questions relating to specific CAM therapy (in particular, osteopathy) were administered to a relatively small group of users and restricted the reliability of the findings. In terms of outcome measures, perhaps the biggest l imitation was that data on the specific medical conditions treated by each form of CAM were not collected. Such specific questions on each of the 17 CAM therapies would have been tim e-consuming, and it was impossible to collect adequate relevant data in the relatively sh ort interview time available. Information about the medical conditions for which CAM, as a wh ole, is being used is of general interest but more specific data about each individual form o f CAM would have been of greater interest. On the other hand, data were collected on medical conditions that resulted participants visiting a GP. Analyses were then perf ormed to examine the association between participants having such a medical condition and vi siting a CAM practitioner or using CAM. In addition, data were also collected on which acup uncture, Chinese herbal medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy were used to treat spec ific medical conditions. Due to the limitation on interview times, it was no t possible to obtain detailed data on the perceived benefits and risks of using each of the 1 7 forms of CAM. This information should be particularly valuable for regulatory bodies and policy makers. Nevertheless, general opinions on the overall helpfulness of CAM and the actual benefits and risks after using the four regulated forms of CAM were collected. 287 Several common problems encountered in similar CAM studies remain unsolved. Previous researchers have commented on the fact that discrep ancies in CAM classification have led to discrepancies in the data relating to CAM prevalenc e even within a specific country. 18 This creates great difficulties in interpreting survey r esults and comparing data from different studies. 282 There is no general agreement on what constitutes the totality of CAM therapy. In particular, the matter of precisely classifying dif ferent forms of vitamins and supplements as complementary medicine products or non-CAM products is critical and impacts on the overall prevalence significantly. The argument being that m ost studies found that the highest prevalence of a single form of CAM was generally in the use of vitamins and minerals. For example, the current study found 45.8% participants used multivitamins, and the majority (86.4%) of these users had not visited a CAM practi tioner. If self-administered multivitamins are excluded, a lower overall CAM prevalence will c ertainly be estimated. This situation becomes more complicated when consid ering the modality of multivitamins included in the definitions of CAM in previous stud ies. For example, people may purchase supplements over the counter on the recommendation of friends or relatives who had originally received prescriptions from their medica l doctors or CAM practitioners. The indirect \"prescription\" is contradictive with the d efinition being used in the 1996 US CAM study -CAM was defined with the exclusion of vitami ns prescribed by a medical doctor and daily vitamins. 3 Another US study employed an alternative definitio n of self-measurement of vitamins in terms of \"overdose in excess of the Rec ommended Daily Allowance\". 1 The issues about vitamins and supplements also presented dilem ma for the current survey in regard to participants making a decision about what constitut es CAM and what doesn't. This implies that arriving at a precise and acceptable definitio n of each CAM modality requires further research. 288 There are substantial differences between countries and regions in the relative popularity of many therapies usually considered as CAM, presumabl y reflecting different social and health care contexts. A pilot study of the current study t o determine the types of CAM used most commonly in Australia revealed the relatively high popularity of aromatherapy (subsequently confirmed by the main survey), which concurred with previous Australian regional surveys 9- 11 . Surprisingly, aromatherapy was not included in th e total CAM prevalence of relevant US national health surveys. 1,4 Through this study, other issues that need to be ad dressed in future studies are identified. These problems and limitations are consistent with existing literature on population surveys 283 (e.g. the difficulty of accessing mobile phones). T his may be justified, based on the fact that fixed telephones are used by over 97.5% of househol ds in Australia. 284 In this respect, gaining access to mobile phone has only been incorporated i nto limited numbers of Australian population surveys. Another complexity is that the use of multi-phone lines within households. This is relevant, because more than one line in a household, will increase the chances of that household being selected. It was determined that English would be used as the language for the interviews, therefore people from ethnic groups that do not speak English have not been included in this study. Fortunately, throughout the interviews very few peo ple were excluded due to language barriers. To date, no study has been conducted in A ustralia to examine CAM use in the indigenous population. Future follow up studies sho uld address the above matters, and possibly include participants from diverse social c ulture backgrounds. 289 8.3 General Conclusions Prior to the conduct of the survey, three systemati c reviews were completed to summarise the current overall utilisation of CAM, and the specifi c use of Chinese medicine in general populations around the world. CAM use in different regional and clinical populations in Australia has also been systematically evaluated. A s noted above, the uncertainties of CAM definitions and classifications may affect estimate s of the true prevalence of CAM. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the prevalence of most forms of CAM (e.g. herbal medicine and acupuncture) in many countries has inc reased steadily. This study took an important step in initiating a n ational population-based survey in Australia to provide critical data on the current use of CAM in Australia. The findings indicate that the use of CAM in Australia is considerably higher than that extrapolated from previous regional studies. National expenditure on CAM appears to acc ount for almost half the total expenditure on non-subsidised health-care products. Moreover, i t was estimated that Australians made almost the same number of visits over a 12-month pe riod to CAM practitioners as they did to conventional medical practitioners. This study agai n raises serious concerns about the concurrent use of Western and CAM therapies, and th e lack of communication between patients and medical practitioners with regard to C AM use. In addition to estimations of the utilisation of CA M from a national perspective, this study also explores possible regional differences, which shows that there were marked differences between states, for example, South Australia has lo wer overall prevalence of CAM use when compared with other states. In addition, the presen t survey also suggested that regional differences in the use of several specific forms of CAM were apparent. Thus, extrapolation of national CAM use based on regional studies should b e undertaken with caution. 290 As Straus (2005) stated, understanding who uses CAM and why they do so informs the research goals, initiatives and collaborations of t he NCCAM.8 Thus, the current study provides a useful national resource base for furthe r research, including intervention studies. The outcomes of this investigation will be relevant to a broad range of health-care professionals and researchers, therapeutic regulato rs, and educators in the areas of public health, health policy, general medicine, and comple mentary medicine. In all, in Australia, what was known previously in the field of this stud y and what this study adds can be summarised in the table below (Table 8.1). Table 8.1 What was known previously and what this s tudy adds What was known previously on this topic There has been no previous national Australian stud y on the use of CAM. National estimates of CAM use have been extrapolated from a regional study in 2004. There is evidence from studies in the US and the UK of increasing CAM use. Previous studies have highlighted major concerns about the c oncurrent use of CAM and conventional medical treatments. What this study adds A reliable estimate of CAM use by the Australian po pulation. Evidence of marked regional differences in CAM use in Australia. Evidence of significant regional differences in the use of specific forms of CAM Expenditure on CAM products by Australians is estim ated to account for almost half of their \"out-of-pocket\" expenditure on non-subsidi sed health-care products. Comparison of national expenditure on CAM and conve ntional medical services. Specific benefits and risks perceived by the users of common forms of CAM Specific benefits and adverse events that users of common forms of CAM considered they have experienced. The discussion of CAM use between CAM users and the ir medical doctors. The extent, the demand for and consequences of heal th insurance cover for CAM. Public attitudes towards statutory CAM product and practitioners regulation. 291 8.4 Policy Implications The findings of the current study have a number of implications for ongoing health policy development. Firstly, given ongoing shortages in th e medical workforce, particularly general medical practitioners, and the increasing public an d private costs of medical services, the increasing popularity of certain CAM therapies may offer opportunities to reduce the burden of heath-care services. This could be done by ident ifying CAM modalities which, based on evidence of their safety and effectiveness, could e ffectively contribute to health service delivery, in concert with conventional health-care services. To achieve such outcomes would require understanding by practitioners of the relev ant CAM and conventional therapies of how the two systems could be effectively harmonised to achieve agreed health-economic outcomes. Such \"harmonisation\" could probably best be achieved through the curricula of CAM and conventional health practitioner training p rograms, and would need to be updated and strengthened by ongoing professional educationa l programs. In some cases, specific forms of CAM might prove be more cost-effective, either a lone or in combination with conventional therapies, than conventional treatments alone. Howe ver, little is known about the economic implications of CAM from a macro and/or a micro lev el. Cost-effectiveness studies on CAM should be part of a future research program. Secondly, the increasing popularity of CAM therapie s offers alternative avenues to patients who have not been effectively managed by convention al medicine. However, there is inadequate research that produces critical data con cerning the quality, efficacy and safety of these CAM therapies. And critically, the current fu nding model of National Health and Medical Research Council does not provide a mechani sm to support such research. In addition, there is no national policy that recognis es the role of CAM in the health care system and as a result, these therapies were not managed i n the same manner as western medicines 292 with respect to quality, safety and efficacy. Conse quently, patients who use these therapies may be exposed to additional risks due to the inade quate information available. The contribution by consumers to these therapies is sub stantial, thus, it should be the government's role to ensure research in CAM therapies are suppor ted to ensure public safety. Thirdly, comprehensive knowledge of the forms of CA M that are most commonly used within the community, the purposes for which they are bein g used, and the demographics of the users are essential for effective health service planning . It is also important to understand how much consumers know about the efficacy and safety of the CAM products and therapies they choose to use, particularly in regard to the concurrent us e of multiple therapies, irrespective of whether these are CAM or conventional. Based on thi s information, appropriate strategies can be developed to educate CAM users about the appropr iate use of the therapies, their benefits and risks, and the importance of discussing the use of concurrent therapies with qualified practitioners. Fourthly, quality of CAM practitioner training need s to incorporate sufficient Western medical knowledge and clinical assessment skills to ensure timely identification of risks and proper referral is made. In addition, practitioner training should also incorporate recent research findings. Furthermore, compulsory continui ng professional education is needed to ensure that practitioners are providing the best po ssible care to their patients by applying new research results into practice and to ensure public safety. Finally, the issue of health insurance coverage of CAM products and services requires further consideration. It is clear from the current study a nd a number of previous studies in Australia and overseas, that there is a high demand for insur ance cover of CAM from users, both through the national health insurance system and pr ivate health insurance. Such demand is 293 likely to increase with increasing evidence of effi cacy of certain forms of CAM and the introduction of regulation of both CAM products and services by governments. However, increasing access to insurance cover for CAM will c ertainly have major economic implications which will need to be fully considered in the context of overall public and private health expenditure. 294 8.5 Recommendations and Future Studies In relation to further regulatory control of CAM th erapies, products and practitioners, a large proportion of the participants in the current surve y considered that regulation of CAM should be as rigorously as that for Western medicine and o ther conventional health services. Whilst several CAM therapies, are already subject to statu tory regulation, in the interest of public safety and confidence in CAM, it is desirable that regulation be extended to other CAM modalities, particularly substance-based therapies such as naturopathy and types of herbal medicine in addition to Chinese herbal medicine. Considerable efforts were to make the current study on CAM use by the Australian population as comprehensive as possible and to ensure that the validity of the data obtained. However, some issues related to CAM use could not be investi gated in the current survey, such as the specific medical conditions for which each individu al form of CAM was being used, and the outcomes of the treatments. To address the safety a nd efficacy concerns, these are perhaps the next aspects of CAM use that need to be investigate d. In extending the study in this way it would be appropriate to give particular considerati on to the use of specific CAM therapies for the treatment of chronic diseases, particularly in the elderly. It is often proposed that conventional medical treatments are not coping well with chronic illnesses and that forms of CAM for which treatment is based \"holistic\" princip les may achieve better outcomes. At this time, rigorous evidence for this contention is lack ing. Prevalence of use data for most forms of CAM is pat chy, even within specific countries and comparisons between surveys and between countries a re difficult and often not meaningful. Future studies might focus on a group of common for ms of CAM (e.g. the current 17 forms of 295 CAM investigated in the current study) in a particu lar region or country. Rather than exploring general demographic characteristics related to CAM use, such a study could focus on the factors that influence people's choice and use of C AM, such as, access to health insurance cover, regulatory controls, referrals from health p rofessionals, and user's knowledge of evidence of efficacy, and safety. Future Australian studies should also address the c urrent lack of information about the use of CAM by population sub-groups, such as older people, children, adolescents, and the indigenous population. It would be important to est ablish an Australian national resource database to better comprehend matters surrounding C AM use, such as perceived and actual benefits and risks, as experienced by consumers. Id eally, these should be on an individual CAM modality basis, rather than overall CAM. From t his aspect, consumer knowledge and beliefs of CAM is another area for further investig ation. 296 REFERENCES 1. Barnes PM, Powell-Griner E, McFann K, Nahin RL.
