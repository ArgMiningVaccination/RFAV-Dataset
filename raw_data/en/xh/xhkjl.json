Addiction comes in many forms, and it affects everybody differently. Finding the right treatment options can make the difference between life-long recovery and relapse. If you or someone you love is struggling with addiction, you don't have to go it alone. Here at Matthew's Hope Detox & Recovery Program, we provide a variety of therapies that can help you gain and sustain sobriety for life. Addiction Is a Disease That Affects the Mind, Body, and Spirit You can find a holistic solution to a complex problem. Addiction is a complex disease that profoundly affects a person's entire being. It can negatively impact mental and physical health, personal relationships, work, and family life. It can also be deadly and is frequently a factor in accidents, violence, and overdoses. Successful treatment will address the whole person, not just their harmful behaviors. Addiction is frequently accompanied by a range of other mental, emotional, psychological, or physical issues, making it essential to find proven, supportive programs to help restore life balance, physical health, and mental well-being. Matthew's Hope Detox and Recovery Program provides a range of collaborative treatments to heal the mind, body, and spirit. From medical detox to sober living, clients get individualized treatment plans that can include family engagement, group and individual counseling, Spiritual Connection Therapy, advanced neurofeedback, and supportive aftercare. Treatment for Addiction is Possible When it's time for a change, it's important to seek help. Knowing the signs of addiction may help you recognize the need for professional help. Seek treatment if you or a loved one experience the following behaviors: - Inability to stop using - Needing to increase the dose to get the same effects - Cravings - often triggered by events, people, times, or places - Spending more time and effort in obtaining the substance - Choosing the substance over normal activities - Impacts safety - Continued use despite negative impacts on personal and professional life - Irresponsible behavior - Needing to use the substance more frequently - Withdrawal when stopped Acknowledging harmful behaviors is the first step on the path to recovery. Matthew's Hope wants you to know that recovery is possible with the proper support, therapies, and guidance. You just have to take the next step. Achieving Life-Long Recovery Matthew's Hope Detox and Recovery Program offer a unique, holistic treatment approach for sustained, long-term recovery. From detox through post-discharge, we provide all the tools needed to help our clients achieve sobriety. Customized treatment plans can include individuals, families, and caregivers and involve counseling in individual and group therapies. With physical, emotional, and spiritual support, client's gain the knowledge and power needed to achieve success. Group Therapy Support Increases Commitment Gain confidence with peer-based feedback, social support, and acceptance. Group therapy assists recovery by helping you stay on track. Group therapy offers peer support to develop healthy coping mechanisms and social skills. It helps people deal with recovery's emotional ups and downs and increases the commitment to getting better. Individual Therapy for One-on-One Guidance The focus is on you and your individual challenges. Individual therapy is an important step in the recovery process. It explores the causes and triggers of addiction while facilitating the skills needed to sustain sobriety. Individual Therapy is personal and confidential counseling in a safe space. It can help with addiction as well as concurrent mental or physical afflictions. No case is too much. At Matthew's Hope Detox and Recovery, we specialize in complex multi-diagnosis treatment solutions. Spiritual Connective Therapy for Hope and Healing A greater meaning to life - finding your connection. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution to addiction, Spiritual Connective therapy aims to connect our clients with something larger than one's individuality. It can include religion or religious components or a feeling of belonging in the universe to provide hope and healing for those struggling with addiction. There Is Hope - Life-Long Recovery Is Possible Sustained long-term recovery for a healthy life is waiting for you. Addiction is a chronic disease that requires ongoing treatment and support. Traditional programs have an estimated 95% relapse rate, so many people don't believe they can succeed. However, at Matthew's Hope, our success rate is as high as 80%. We show clients that life-long recovery is possible, but the journey to recovery takes time and effort. Keep fighting the good fight, and never give up on yourself or your loved ones battling addiction. With time and patience, you can all get to a place of lasting recovery.
