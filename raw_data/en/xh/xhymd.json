Vaccine Court denies all claims in the Autism Omnibus Hearings -\"This case is not a close case. The overall weight of the evidence is overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners' causation theories \". -Plaintiffs were \" misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment\" -\"To conclude that Colten's condition was the result of his MMR vaccine, an objective observer would have to emulate Lewis Carroll's White Queen and be able to believe six impossible things before breakfast .\" \u00a9 2009 Autism Science Foundation, Inc.

Altered brain activity is also seen prior to onset of behavioral symptoms Postmortem data indicate that brain structure differences originate in gestation2. There is an overproduction of brain cells in the frontal lobe, creating patches of functional abnormality. \"Failure to prune\" Have discovered genes responsible for \"dysregulation\" or failure to govern and sort the number of cells generated.
