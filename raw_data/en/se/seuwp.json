This program is administered by American Bible Society and Good News Jail & Prison Ministry , two faith -based , not-for-profit organizations that partnered together to equip chaplains and volunteers to facilitate the program. Background Many scholars, correctional experts, and policy makers agree that our current correctional system is failing , and that the field of corrections is in a state of crisis. Correctional leaders continue to struggle with how to implement rehabilitation programs in the context of overcrowding, recruitment and retention of correctional staff, inmate violence, suicide, threats of litigation, and perhaps most significantly, limited funding for offender treatment programs. T he pursuit of rehabi litation is further impeded by rising mental health, substance abuse, chronic illness, and infectious disease problems in jails and prisons. Perhaps more than ever , there is a crucial need for effective and scalable interventions that help reform prisoners , reduce recidivism, improve the safety of correctional environments, and to do so in a cost -effective and replicable way. In 2017, American Bible Society partnered with Good News Jail & Prison Ministry to train chaplains and volunteers around the country interested in implementing correctional trauma healing programs . As of the publication of this study, over 250 individuals h ave received training and are certified to lead Correctional Trauma Healing in jails, prisons, and re -entry centers. These trained chaplains and volunteers have delivered the program to over 2, 600 inmates and previously incarcerated people in 29 states. The program is positioned to significantly expand in the U .S. as more correctional ministry organizations a dopt the program model. Methodology For the current longitudinal study, 349 inmates participat ed in the study (210 in treatment group and 139 in control group) and completed a survey at multiple time points from September 2018 to March 2020. The survey included measures of: (a) the negative consequences of trauma exposure (i.e., PTSD, complicated grief, depressed mood , depressed malaise , anger, suicidal ideation, and interpersonal aggression); and (b) primary outcomes that the Correctional Trauma Healing Program is design ed to promote (i.e., forgiveness, compassion, resilience, reasons for living, and religiosity) or reduce (i.e., vengefulness and blaming God for trauma) , as well as secondary ones that it may influence (i.e., perceived support from family and friends, mean ing in life, gratitude to God, spiritual transformation, and Bible reading). The main goal was to examine whether inmates who completed the Correctional Trauma Healing Program were the beneficiaries of better outcomes compared with a control group of priso ners that did not participate. 6 Key Takeaways and Findings: 1. Many correctional leaders, government officials, and citizens support the goal of rehabilitation for prisoners, but treatment efforts to date have achieved limited success. 2. The pursuit of rehabi litation is further impeded by widespread exposure to trauma (e.g., sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect, nonsexual assault, emotional abuse, witnessing violent death or injury, etc.) among incarcerated individuals. 3. Tightening budgets and associated funding problems make it difficult for correctional decision -makers to expand rehabilitation programs, and thus significantly elevates the need to rely heavily on volunteer -led programs. 4. A random sample of inmates at the Riverside Regional Jail in Virginia reported they had experienced, on average, three out of 10 types of traumatic events, and 86% (87.6% in the treatment group and 83.5% in the control group) said they experienced at least one. 5. The Correctional Trauma Healing Program reduced po st-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among inmates who completed the program. 6. Completing t he Correctional Trauma Healing Program enhanced emotional well -being among inmates. 7. The salutary effects of the Correctional Trauma Healing Program may well extend t o a number of behaviors as well as emotional states. 8. Completing t he Correctional Trauma Healing Program decreased the negative consequences associated with trauma by promoting virtues (e.g., forgiveness, compassion, and resilience), positive perceptions a bout God (e.g., God's engagement and purpose in life), and other desirable characteristics (e.g., moral objections to suicide), while also reducing undesirable attributes (e.g., vengefulness). 9. The Correctional Trauma Healing Program reduced the effects of trauma by enhancing positive beliefs about the Bible (e.g., a guide for life) and by drawing benefits from using the Scripture (e.g., a sense of connection to God), as well as perceived social support, presence of meaning in life, and gratitude to God. 10. The Correctional Trauma Healing Program significantly reduced PTSD, trauma -related grief, and negative emotions , and these effects were still significant three months after program completion. 11. The impact of the Correctional Trauma Healing Program was also o bserved one and three months after completion for additional effects including forgiveness, vengefulness, compassion, resilience, God's engagement, blaming God for trauma, support from family and friends, and meaning in life . 12. Over the study period, PTSD and other negative consequences of trauma were reduced , in part, by positive changes in desirable characteristics (e.g., forgiveness, resilience, and meaning in life, among others), as well as declines in negatives ones like vengefulness. 13. In an age o f evidenced -based governance , this longitudinal s tudy of the Correctional Trauma Healing Program \u2014a program consisting of five , two-hour sessions facilitated by volunteer s in a one -week period \u2014generated statistically significant healing outcomes and provide s preliminary evidence that this Bible -based intervention should inform more holistic 7 approaches to offender reform , as well as serve as a model for scalable and cost -effective interventions for incarcerated individuals. 8 I. Introduction and Roadmap This report examines the effectiveness of a trauma healing program that was recently implemented at the Riverside Regional Jail in North Prince George, VA. It begins with a discussion of the current state of offender rehabilitation in U.S. jails and prisons. Several impediments to rehabilitation are noted, including budgetary constraints a nd a rise in mental health and substance abuse problems among inmates . Possible solutions to these problems, including the mobilization of trained and dedicated volunteers, are then summarized. A relatively new faith-based program \u2014American Bible Society's Correctional Trauma Healing Program , which was administered with the help of Good News Jail & Prison Ministry chaplain s and volunteers \u2014is then outlined. This is followed by a rigorous scientific assessment of the program's effectiveness for reducing the negative emotional and behavioral consequences of trauma among inmates at the regional jail . After t he results are summarized, the report ends with a discussion of policy implications. II. Why Does Offender Rehabilitation Remain So Elusive and What Can Be Done ? In general, there are four major goals associated with correctional policies and the supervision of prisoners : retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.1 Retribution refers to just deserts \u2014a philosophy grounded in the belief that people who break the law deserve to be punished. The other three emphasiz e different approaches and methods for achieving public safety . Deterrence focuses on the oppressive nature of punishment , where offenders are deterred from committing crimes because of a rational calculation that the cost of punishment is too great. The punishment is so harsh that neither the punished offender (specific deterrence) nor others (general deterrence) will commit crimes in the future. Incapacitation de nies people the ability to commit crimes because they are physically detained in prison. Rehabilitation attempts to change the thinking and behavior of offenders so that they do not commit additional crimes. Although e ach goal is important, a number of studies confirm that the public is particularly support ive of rehabilitation,2 especially when people are ask ed to rank the importance of rehabilitation versus punishment .3 Not only do a majority of Americans support the pursuit of rehabilit ation for offenders ,4 there is empirical evidence that effective rehabilitation program s can indeed reduce recidivism.5 At the same time , there is widespread consensus that recidivism rates remain too high. For example, a 2018 Bureau of Justice Statistic s study found that 83% of state prisoners released in 2005 across 30 states were rearrested at least once during a nine year follow -up period.6 These recidivism statistics are a constant reminder to policymakers that widespread effective rehabilitation of prisoners continue s to elude correctional leaders. There are many reasons why rehabilitat ion is difficult to achieve , but shrinking correctional budgets are at or near the top of th e list. The failure to widely implement effective corre ctional treatment programs has often been met with the perception that correctional leaders oppose treatment in favor of more punitive approaches. The reality, of course, is that w ardens and correctional administrators overwhelming ly value the pursuit of rehabilitation . They simply struggle with how to fund these approaches in the context of many budget and safety constraints , 9 including overcrowding, security, recruitment and retention of correctional staff, inmate violence, suicide, threats of litigation, and perhaps most significantly, limited funding for offender treatment programs .7 If these weighty issues were not enough, the pursuit of rehabilitation is further exacerbated by the alarming rise of mental health and substance abus e problems in jails an d prisons , the deleterious effects of unaddressed trauma experienced by most offenders in correctional facilities , the scarcity of rehabilitative programs , and the shortage of volunteer -led programs and trained volunteers to staff existing rehabilitati on programs . Each of these issues is discussed in detail below . A. The Rise in Mental Health Problems in Jails and Prisons In the early 1960s, states embarked on an initiative to reduce and close publicly operated mental health hospitals, a process that became known as deinstitutionalization. Advocates of deinstitutionalization argued that it would result in the mentally ill living more independently , with treatment provided by community mental health progr ams. The federal government, however, did not provide sufficient ongoing funding for community programs to meet the growing demand. Concomitantly, states reduced their budgets for mental hospitals but provided no proportionate ongoing increases in funding for community -based mental health programs. As a result, many thousands of mentally ill persons were released into communities that were not prepared to meet the ir treatment needs . A report from the Surgeon General's Office indicated that: \"Even more than other areas of health and medicine, the mental health field is plagued by disparities in the availability of and access to its services.\"8 Consequently, many of the individuals released into the community without support ended up incarcerated in jails and prisons. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a bout 20 % of prison inmates suffer from a serious mental illness ,9 10 while another 30 -60% have substance abuse problems .11 12 Serious mental illness is often defined as a cognitive , behavioral, or emotional disorder resulting in serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities.13 If one includ es broad -based mental illnesses, the percentages increase significantly. For example, 50% of male and 75 % of female inmates in state prisons experience mental health problem s requiring treatment in any given year . The numbers are 63% of male and 75% of female inmates in jails .14 Inmates are a lso more likely to suffer from chronic health conditions and infectious diseases.15 Moreover, many people experience serious medical and mental health crises after they are booked into jail, including withdrawal, psychological distress, and th e \"pains of imprisonment.\"16 Serious mental illness has become so prevalent in U .S. correction al facilities that jails and prisons have been referred to as \"the new asylums.\"17 In fact, the Los Angeles County Jail, Chicago's Cook County Jail, and New York 's Riker's Island Jail , each hold more mentally ill inmates than any remaining psychiatric hospital in the U .S.18 Approximately one in five inmates in jails and state prisons are now estimated to have a serious mental illness. Based on the total inmate pop ulation, this means that approximately 383,000 individuals with severe psychiatric disease s were behind bars in the U .S. in 2014 .19 10 Because of their impaired thinking, many inmates with serious mental illnesses present behavioral problems , and t his is a contributing factor to the ir over-representation in solitary confinement. Relatedly, suicide continues to be a tragic problem within the correctional system. In fact, s uicide is the leading cause of death in jails, and multiple studies indicate that as man y as half of all inmate suicides are committed by those with serious mental illness es.20 B. Unaddressed Trauma and Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder Among Prisoners Adding to the problem of mental illness is the realization that t rauma exposure and trauma - related symptoms are prevalent among prisoners . In fact, trauma has been described as a near universal experience among incarcerated men.21 Rates of current post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD ) symptoms and lifetime PTSD are significantly higher (30 -60%) among male inmates compared with rates found in the general male population (3 -6%). Moreover, l ifetime rates of trauma and PTSD are known to be associated with psychiatric disorders.22 Various types of potentially traumatic events (PTEs) occur throughout the life course , including child or adult sexual abuse, physical abuse or neglect in childhood, nonsexual assault, emotional abuse, witnessing violent death or injury (including criminal victimization), disaster or fire, and accidents. While no one is immune from PTEs, prior research shows that offenders in jail and prison tend to report s ignificantly higher rates of PTEs than those in the general population. For exampl e, one study found that jail inmates were 7.5 to 11.3 times more likely to have a history of homelessness than those in the general U.S. adult population,23 whereas the prevalence of childhood victimization by physical or sexual abuse and neglect was as hi gh as 68.4 % according to a study of male inmates in a New York State prison.24 In a study of five prisons in California, the prevalence of childhood trauma (emotional abuse and neglect, physical neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse) among female inmat es was significantly higher than that in a comparison sample from a health maintenance organization in a metropolitan area.25 Not surprisingly, experiencing PTEs has been linked with poor physical health, substance abuse, and psychiatric disorder s includi ng PTSD, depressed mood , and suicidality among offenders.26 These are all significant social and public health problems that reduce the likelihood of rehabilitation of offenders , as well as their successful reintegration back into society. Unless there is authentic healing f rom the trauma suffered by so many offen ders, they will unnecessarily remain at risk of going back to the ir previous li ves of crime, drug use, and mental illness. In sum, prisoners are much more likely than the general population to have serious mental illness es, and a substantial portion of t he prison population is not receiving treatment for mental health conditions. This treatment discontinuity has the potential to affect not only inmate safety and security within the prison, but recidivism and health care costs upon release from prison. Moreover, the presence of trauma is widely acknowledged to be pervasive among inmates in jails and prisons. Developing trauma testing , and then implementing various interventions for those incarcerated , is essential to improve behavioral health outcomes as well as reduce recidivism. Because trauma is a near ubiquitous condition among correctional populations , it would be a logical first step in the pursuit of offender rehabilitation to recommend implementing 11 effective intervention program s to address the issue of past and present trauma . The next section discusses this issue in detail. III. Next Steps in Pursuit of Offender Rehabilitation Any far-reaching decision to implement offender rehabilitation programs in jails and prisons across the country would require increasing correctional budgets. A simple look at state by state correctional budgets over the last decade provides evidence that, in fact, this has clearly not been the case. Rehabilitative programs represent a very small percentage of corre ctional budgets . According to a 2019 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics , criminal justice system expenditures were $295.6 billion in 2016, which include d $88.5 billion for the cost of operating the nation's jails, prisons, and parole and probation systems .27 The total cost for corrections has only slightly increased since 2011, when total correctional expenditures were $83 billion.28 Controlling for inflation, therefore, correctional budgets have been in slight decline over the last decade. The U.S. prison population experienced dramatic growth from the early 1970s to the mid-2000s , with the number of people confined to state prisons increasing by more than 600 % by the end of 2009. Between 2010 and 2015, nearly half of all states cut their spendi ng on prisons.29 With correctional budgets now flat or shrinking, it is important to know if the percentage of correctional budgets dedicated to supporting offender treatment programs is increasing or decreasing . A recent national survey on prison spend ing indicates that personnel costs make up 68% of total spending for state prisons, followed by 11 % for prison health care, and 17 % for a residual category that includes facility maintenance , debt service, legal judgments , and offender programming costs .30 Unfortunately, w e do not know the breakdown specifically for offender programs. In fact, the cost for offender treatment programs also includes educational and vocational programs. There can be little debate that offender treatment programs such as therap eutic communities for drug treatment , as well as other treatment modalities, represent a very small percentage of existing correctional budgets. Coupled with this reality is the fact that since the mid-2000s , correctional leaders have had to struggl e with ever-tightening budget s while simultaneously addressing other difficult correctional problems like overcrowding, aging prison populations, and increasing medical costs, a s well as new concerns arising from the pandemic , to mention just a few . In light o f these development s, how might rehabilitation actually become a viable and a chievable correctional goal in these challenging times ? We believe that such a prospect will require two related developments : (1) the intentional recruitment and retention of many new ly trained volunteers, as well as the implementation of scalable effective treatment interventions that are volunteer -led; and (2) understanding and embracing the role of religion in achieving prosocial behavior. In or der to understand the critical role volunteers may play in pursuit of offender rehabilitation, we begin with an historical account of volunteerism in the U .S., and follow with a discussion of how faith-motivated communities provide active social networks t hat foster not only social capital , but also what social scientists call prosocial behavior . The intent of prosocial behavior is to help other people , and is characterized by a concern for the rights, feelings, and 12 welfare of other s. Therefore, offender rehabilitatio n can be viewed as a byproduct of the prosocial behavior exhibited by volunteer -led treatment programs and interventions. Moreover, there is evidence that prisoners who participate in programs that promote prosocial orientations are more likely to experience an identity transformation that makes them less likely to commit additional crimes , as well as exhibit prosocial behaviors not only while incarcerated, but also following release from jail or prison.31 The next section discusses the important role of voluntary activities in America, especially those that are motivated by religious practices and beliefs. C. Capitalizing on The Role of Volunteers in Pursuit of Offender Rehabilitation 1. The Historical Roots of Faith and Volunteerism in America Alexis de Tocqueville , a French political scientist, visited the United States in 1831 to study the American penal system. Over the course of his visit, he was inspired by a number of intriguing factors that appeared to distinguish American society from other countries , including the uniquely American tendency toward volunteerism. He wrote extensively about the American phenomenon of forming voluntary associations of all types , including professional, religio us, social, civil, and political organizations . In his ground -breaking book , Democracy in America , he stated:32 In the United States, as soon as several inhabitants have taken an opinion or an idea they wish to promote in society, they seek each other out and unite together once they have made contact. From that moment, they are no longer isolated but have become a power seen from afar whose activities serve as an example and whose words are heeded (Tocqueville, 1840, p. 599) . Tocqueville's obser vations of the role of v olunteerism continue to play out in the civic life and culture of America . Tocqueville also observed the critical role that religion play s in American society. He drew a connection between the formation and effectiveness of associations in solving social problems. Often bolstered by the influence of religion and religious awakenings, the rise of social reform movement s around issues like poverty, temperance, and th e abolition of slavery would be mobilized by a new generation that had not previously been involved in civic life, including women and young people. He witnessed that associating with other like -minded people to improve the common welfare requires personal sacrifice. What contemporary social scientists now refer to as the virtue of other -mindedness , Tocqueville observed and wrote about in the 1830s: The love and respect of your neighbors must be gained by a long series of small services, hidden deeds of g oodness, a persistent habit of kindness, and an established reputation of selflessness... I have seen Americans making great and sincere sacrifices for the key common good and a hundred times I have noticed that, when needs be, they almost always gave each other faithful support (Tocqueville 1840, 593 -595). Tocqueville also noted that associating for the common good is not done without concern for one's own self-interest . He argue d that American s do not claim to sacrifice oneself for another solely because it is a good thing to do , but also because such sacrifices are as necessary to the person who makes them as to those who gain from them . Moreover, Tocqueville claimed that 13 American s were unique in going beyond the call of duty to prove that it is in each person 's interest to be virtuous : Enlightened self -love continually leads them to help one another and inclines them to devote freely a part of their time and wealth to the welfare of the state (Tocqueville 1840, 611). Since America's founding, a host of important organizations \u2014driven largely by volunteers \u2014 have sought to address difficult -to-solve problems that have plagued society. Moreover, the majority of these organizations were founded by individuals motivated by faith to pursue ac ts of service to others . In their book, The Churching of America , 1776 -2005 , Roger Finke and Rodney Stark examine d how religious freedom allowed religious congregations to compete for adherents and to subsequently grow and thrive in the great American experiment.33 Using historical and sociological data, they were able to document the dramatic growth experienced by many religious denominations in early America. Th ey provide d evidence that tracks with Tocqueville's observation some 175 years ear lier\u2014the growth of American religion was very much connected to the important and positive contribution of faith-motivated volunteers in providing acts of service that lifted their neighbors and subsequently advanced the common good.34 The influence of A merica's houses of worship for more than 200 years has been unprecedented and profoundly consequential , ultimately leading to the founding of organizations like the YMCA, Salvation Army, American Red Cross , and American Bible Society .35 But the impact of religion and religious freedom in America has been felt far beyond the realm of social service delivery . Indeed , the history of medicine and hospitals in America has also been inextricably tied to religio us freedom and the rise of religio us pluralism . When Ben jamin Franklin promoted the founding of the Pennsylvania Hospital in the 1750s, he made an explicitly Christian argument for why it was needed. Citing Matthew 25:36, Franklin reminded readers that Jesus commended those who visited the sick, as if they were visi ting Jesus himself. Even though Franklin never claimed to be a devout Christian, he certainly endorsed the Christian ethic of serving those who were suffering.36 Many American hospitals and health systems today remain visibly connected with the Catholic, J ewish , or Protestant traditions out of which they were born.37 In many ways, the growth of religion in America resembles the rise of Christianity two millennia earlier. A s documented in the book, The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries , Rodney Stark br ought to light the historical accounts associated with the early Christian church and the rapid rise of Christianity in the decades following Jesus' res urrection by documenting how Christianity taught adherents to be concerned for the welfare of others.38 He show ed that the dramatic growth of early Christianity was fueled by pagan leaders who did not have adequate answers or responses to why a devastating epidemic (probably smallpox) swept through the Roman Empire in the year 165, taking the lives of roughly one -fourth of the population. Fewer than 100 years later, another equally lethal epidemic (probably measles) again ravaged the empire. Christianity of fered a more satisfactory account of why these epidemics happened. It also projected a more hopeful and optimistic picture of the future. Christian values of love and charity were translated into norms of social service and community solidarity. Care for w idows 14 and orphans became an essential part of the rise of Christianity. As Stark document ed, Christians were able to better cope with the epidemics than other religious groups, which resulted in higher rates of survival. Thus, caring for one's neighbor was a feature linked to religious freedom as well as the churching of America . As discussed below, this continues today. 2. Volunteerism in Contemporary American Society Social scientists have noted that volunteerism continues to play a significantly larger role in enhancing American life than it does in other countries.39 The contribution volunteers make to civil society, civic engagement , and volunteerism in the U.S. is profound.40 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, volunteerism peaked between 2003 and 2005, when 28.8 % of Americans reported having volunteered in the previous year.41 The nonprofit sector, which relies heavily on volunteers as a strategic resource , has become increasingly important in the engagement of local communities. This is particularly true in the human services sector, which relies heavily on the support of volunteers to fill the gaps in federal, state, and local funding. They provide a host of community services that the formal sector is either unwilling or unable to effectively provide , such as remedial education, sporting and recreational programs, medical and health services, mentoring of at -risk youth, shelters for the homeless, subs tance abuse counseling, offender treatment programs, educational programs for prisoners, and prisoner reentry initiatives . The 2018 Volunteering in America study found that more than 77 million adults volunteered their time through an organization in the previous year. In total, Americans volunteered nearly 6.9 billion hours, worth an estimated $167 billion in economic value.42 These extraordinary figures do not even account for the millions of Americans \u2014some 43 %\u2014who voluntarily serve and support friends a nd family, or more than half of American adult s (51 %) who do favors for their neighbors and other acts of \"informal volunteering.\" In sum, volunteers provide a staggering economic benefit to American society. In addition, the contribution of volunteering goes beyond the value of services provided. Volunteering has been linked with the formation of social capital \u2014social connections that help to build trust and collective action within the community.43 Robert Putnam argues that a community that is more connected is likely to have a greater level of trust and reciprocity among its citizens, leading to a more cohesive and stable society with economic as well as social benefits.44 Barbara Stewart, CEO of t he Corporation for National and Community Service, nicely summarized t he role of volunteers in making a difference: Each and every day, ordinary Americans are stepping up to support their fellow citizens to help with needs both great and small because the y understand the power service has to change communities and lives for the better...The fabric of our nation is strengthened by the service of its volunteers. When we stand side -by-side to help others, our differences fade away and we learn that Americans ha ve more in common than we realize.45 Research also shows that Americans are generous with more than just their time. Volunteers donate to charity at twice the rate as non -volunteers. In one study, n early 80 % of volunteers donated to charity, compared with 40% of non -volunteers.46 Overall, half of all citizens (52.2 %) 15 donated to charity last year. Across all categories in the study, volunteers engage d in their communities at higher rates than non -volunteers. They more frequently talk ed to neighbors, participate d in civic organizati ons, fix ed things in the community, attend ed public meetings, discuss ed local issues with family and friends, d id favors for neighbors, and vote d in local elections. Here are some of the key findings of the Volunteering in America study: Parents volunteer at rates nearly 48 % higher than non -parents and working mothers give more time than any other demographic, with a volunteer rate of 46.7 %. Generation X has the highest rate (36.4 %) of volunteering, while Baby Boomers are giving more hours of service (2.2 b illion). Veterans are among the most neighborly Americans. They do something positive for the neighborhood, spend time with and do favors for their neighbors, and donate to charity at higher rates than their civilian counterparts. Americans most frequently gave their time to religious groups (32 %), while a quarter volunteered most often with sports or arts groups (25.7 %), and another nearly 20 % support ed education or youth service groups. Building on the foundational writings of Alexis de Tocqueville discussed above, scholars have attempted to identify factors that shape voluntary activities. As it turns out , the more religious people are , the more likely they are to volunteer .47 The next s ection reviews our knowledge in this area. 3. Understanding the Link Between Religion and Volunteering Numerous studies have documented a positive relationship between multiple aspects of religi ous life (e.g., service attendance, a religious social identity , various beliefs ) and a variety of social and civic outcomes including : philanthropic giving, community group membership, and volunteering.48 For example, in the Americans' Changing Lives Study, Joseph Johnston found that religious participation was associated with increased voluntary service to others throughout adulthood using four waves of longitudinal data that examined trends over time .49 Further, relig ious practices and beliefs not only made it more likely that one would volunteer in religious institutions , they also increase d the likelihood that one would participate in other forms of volunteering as well .50 In a separate study of more than 37,000 individuals conducted in 2008 -2009 \u2014the U .S. Congregational Life Survey \u2014Jennifer McClure examined whether participation in a congregation was associated with the provision of social support to non -family members.51 She found that having close friends in one's congregation made a difference, but that the most consistent predictor of social support was private devotional activities. Adherents who spen t more time praying , meditatin g, or reading the Bible were more likely to give loans, care for the sick, and help people find job .52 Additional research suggests that Americans who volunteer for religious groups are two to three times more likely to volunteer for secular groups as well compared with Americans who do not 16 volunteer for religious groups . These findings were published as part of the Faith Matters Surveys , which were led by Robert Putnam of Harvard University and David Campbell of the University of Notre Dame. In their book, American Grac e: How Religion Divides and Unites U s, they note d that: Religiously observant Americans are more generous with time and treasure than demographically similar secular Americans ...This is true for secular causes (especially help to the needy, the elderly and young people) as well as for purely religious causes. It is true even for most random acts of kindness (p. 453) . In our recent work, we interviewed a group of faith -motivated volunteers who regularly travel ed to a correctional facility in a rural area where they work ed with prisoners in a faith -based trauma and healing program operated through Good News Jail & Prison Ministry ,53 which was supported by American Bible Society .54 The volunteers were all senior ci tizens , and some of them dr ove several hours to reach the correctional facility . They stay ed in a local hotel for several days a week , where they work ed with prisoners each day before returning home. The expenses of this weekly routine were covered by the volunteers themselves. Without exception, the volunteers claimed that they were the real beneficiaries of working with prisoners.55 Given these findings, it is important to ask: Why does reli gion promote volunteer work and the helping of others? A major reason cited by Putnam , Campbell , and other s is that religious social networks are key. Churches, synagogues , and mosques are places that encourage volunteerism and other -mindedness and expose individuals to religious as well as secular opportunities for service that create social bonds , making it more likely that individuals will respond to requests to volunteer . Indeed, t hese ties can extend well beyo nd houses of worship . There is even empirical evidence that non -religious people with strong ties to people who are highly active within a congregation are likely to be encouraged to volunteer.56 Out of a concern for the welfare of others, religion can be seen as a catalyst that stimulate s and generates volunteers through a variety of social networks. Whether through classes, retreats, small groups, mission trips, church -sponsored volunteer work, or any number of related group functions, religious activities connect people to networks of s ocial support that have the potential to be meaningful. Research documents that social support in congregations has been linked to better coping skills,57 increased life expectancy,58 stress reduction,59 and better self -reported health.60 In fact, according to Putnam, churches are enormous repositories of good will and social capital .61 In his words: Houses of worship build and sustain more social capital \u2014and social capital of more varied forms \u2014than any other type of institution in Americ a. Churches, synagogues, mosques and other houses of worship provide a vibrant institutional base for civic good works and a training ground for civic entrepreneurs. Nearly half of America's stock of social capital is religious or religiously affiliated, whether measured by association memberships, philanthropy, or volunteering .62 If this estimation is accurate, houses of worship are training ground s for good works and civic engagement. In his more recent work, Putnam goes further in his assessment, arguing that people 17 with religious affiliations are more satisfied with their lives mainly because they attend religious services more frequently and build social networks with people who share their faith and religious expe rience, thus building a strong sense of belonging to a community of religious faith.63 Faith-based networks are so significant , he argues, because they generate unique effects that cannot be explained in any other way. Simply put, faith -infused networks of support \u2014in and of themselves \u2014are powerful independent predictors of beneficial outcomes.64 Putnam is not the only influential scholar making such arguments. In an important study using multiple national surveys , Stephen Monsma f ound that religiously committed individuals who give to philanthropic causes and volunteer are also more active and civically engaged citizens.65 Moreover, the highly religious were much more likely to support secular ly-based causes than secular respondents we re to support religiously -based community ones. In addition, the religiously involved were much more likely to exhibit behavior that Monsma refer red to as responsible citizenship . He goes on to point out the irony of these findings: Since deeply religious people believe that they know the truth, it is often argued, their minds will be closed to discussion and accommodation. It is thus presumed that rational secularists are the natural and best carriers of the democratic tradition. Being unfettered by a fai th-based religious tradition and otherworldly values and aspirations, they presumably are inclined toward making this world a better place \u2014and toward doing so in a moderate, rational, open manner. Thus they ought to be the backbone of a free, democratic so ciety. This study seriously challenges such conventional wisdom. In fact, it is the religious among us, not the irreligious, who are more likely to give to and volunteer for community causes. And people who give and volunteer tend to vote and in other ways to be politically informed and active. Even evangelical Protestants \u2014whose growing influence some social critics characterize as a threat to normal democratic processes \u2014are more likely to give and volunteer than are the irreligious.66 In sum, religious individuals and congregations are important repositor ies of social capital , good will, and voluntary activities. This key aspect of American life, which is supported by mounting empirical evidence, has considerable implications for the field of correction s. These are discussed below. A. Understanding the Role of Religion in Prosocial Behavior Religion promotes \"prosocial behavior\" well beyond volunteering. In The Handbook of Social Psychology , C. Daniel Batson explain ed that prosocial behavior refer s to \"a broad range of actions intended to benefit one or more people other than oneself \u2014behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing and cooperation. \"67 Behavior that can be described as prosocial include s not simply feeling empathy and concern for others, but actually behaving in ways that help or benefit other people. The term prosocial behavior originated during the 1970s and was introduced by social scientists as an antonym for antisocial behavior . However, in recent years it has come to mean far more than merely the opposite of antisocial behavior. As criminologists, w e have argued that scholars have been preoccupied with only \"half\" of a field.68 Criminology's general focus has been 18 limited to understanding antisocial behavior, with almost no attention given to prosocial activities. Scientists tend to ask why people commit crimes , and they rarely ask why people do good deeds . Rather than neglecting half of human behavior, criminologis ts should be interested in studying a number of important questions that focus on positive and prosocial factors. For example, the subfield of positive criminology is interested in understanding the following questions : (1) W hy do the vast majority of peop le choose to obey rather than break laws ? (2) Why do most people reared in disadvantaged neighborhoods turn out to be good, law-abiding citizens? (3) How is it that offenders who previously exhibited antisocial patterns of behavior can undergo transformati ons that result in consistent patterns of positive behavior , accountability, and other -mindedness ? (4) W hat is the role of religion in guiding behavior in positive ways and fostering prosocial activities ? The motivation for organized prosocial helping behaviors is often shaped by religious practices and beliefs . For example, t he world 's three primary monotheistic traditions \u2014Judaism, Christianity , and Islam \u2014generally t each that helping others, particularly th e less fortunate , is a religious obligation. There are also numerous examples of God commanding Jews to aid the poor throughout the Old Testament. In the parable of the \"Good Samaritan,\" Jesus provides the example of the good neighbor who aided a poor beat en man previously ignored by other passers - by, including a priest. According to some scholars, t he emphasis on giving and helping within the Judeo -Christian religions is a primary reason prosocial behavior is considered a social norm in Western culture .69 In addition, t he compulsory alms tax, or zakat, is one of the five pillars of Islam . Unfortunately, it has received relatively little attention from scholars compared with teachings and practices from the other two Abrahamic religions . At this point, it is important to ask: Exactly how does religion foster prosocial behavior? The next section addresses this issue. 1. Faith -Based Community Networks Foster Prosocial Behavior Involvement in religious practices and related activities can foster the development of and integration into personal networks that promote prosocial behaviors and provide both social and emotional support.70 When such personal networks overlap with other networks , it is reasonable to expect that these networks will not on ly constrain illegal behavior , but may also protect one from the negative effects of social and economic disadvantage .71 In other words, an individual 's integration into a community -based religious network may actually weaken the effects of other factors that might otherwise promote deviant or other undesirable behavior s. In this way, religious network s can buffer against, or shield individuals from, t he harmful effects of negative influences .72 For example, church -attending youth from disadvantaged communities are less likely to use illicit drugs compared with youth from suburban communities who attend church less frequently or not at all.73 In a similar vein, growing up in a religious family appears to function as a protective factor against criminal activities among children .74 Through networks of social and emotional support, the learning of self -control through the teaching of religious moral beliefs, and the condemning of inappropriate behavior, regular church atte ndance appears to discourage antisocial behavior and promote prosocial outcomes . 19 This is a likely result of religious networks that emphasize concern for others' welfare and encourage appropriate behavior . Attending church and participating in religious activities help individuals internalize values , and involvement in such networks likely contribute s to the acquisition of positive attributes that give those involved a greater sense of empathy toward others, which in turn makes them not only less likely to commit acts that harm others , but also more likely to engage in behaviors that help them . This is one reason why religio n helps promote resilience in the face of poverty, unemployment , or other social ills.75 Building on these ideas, scholars have produced an impressive and mounting body of evidence showing that religious participation is linked to important outcomes such as: overall flourishing and well -being,76 social integration and support,77 delivery of social services to disadvantaged populations,78 mental and physical health,79 forgiveness,80 voluntary sobriety,86 health care utilization,87 coping strategies for stressful conditions,88 and even longevity/mortality.89 According to a 2016 study that quantifies the economic value of religious individuals, organizations, and businesses, religion adds 1.2 trillion dollars to the U.S. economy each year.90 All of this suggests that religion is a powerful force for positive outcomes in the world. In reference to social justice issues such as poverty and crime, Oswald Chambers provide d some critical insight long ago . He argue d that people who look for justice can easily become sidetracked by any number of distractions . He went on to invok e the teaching s of Jesus from the Sermon on the Mount, suggest ing that a better way of correcting injustice is to simply give or do justice at every opportunity. In his words: \"Never look for justice in this world, but never cease to give it. \"91 One can make a compelling argument that t his is the very essence of what countless volunteers \u2014often motivated by faith \u2014do every day without fanfare . 2. Faith -Based Approaches and Positive Criminology How does all of this information tie into the current study? Recent research in an emerging sub - field referred to as \"positive criminology\"92 suggests that more positive and restorative approaches \u2014including those that foster social connectedness and support, service to others, spiritual experience, personal integrity, and identity chang e\u2014may be more effective than prevailing punitive tactics.93 Consistent with traditional and contemporary restorative justice practices, these approaches seek to develop active responsibility on the part of individuals who have been living a lifestyle of irresponsibility.94 From this perspective, correctional pract ices should be explicitly designed to promote virtue.95 The goal is not to inflict pain or exact revenge , but rather to reconstruct and make better.96 Although this is rare in our current system, a concrete example has been provided by a program at the L ouisiana State Penitentiary ( a.k.a., Angola), the largest maximum -security prison in the United States. Once known as one of the most violent and corrupt prisons in America, Angola is now known for its many inmate -led churches and a fully operational semin ary that was launched in 1995. In recent years , adjudicated juveniles from New Orleans have been given the option to serve their sentence at Angola and to participate in a unique mentoring project. The former head of the Angola seminary noted that this res torative, faith -based program effectively: 20 ...de-institutionalizes the dehumanization of punitive justice [because it gives a person] the responsibility of making the right choices for the right reasons. Whereas dehumanization within a punitive system de mands simply making choices for the wrong reasons \u2014because they fear punishment [emphasis in the original].97 Other r esearch shows that visitation s from family or friends can help reduce recidivism of former prisoners .98 One study examined whether visits from community volunteers \u2014specifically clergy and mentors \u2014had an impact on recidivism by examining 836 offenders released from different prisons in Minnesota . The results show ed that community visits significantly reduced three measures of reoffending : rearrest, reconviction, and reincarceration . The salutary effect on recidivism grew as the proportion of community visits to all visits increased. The findings suggest community volunteer visits should be conceptualized as a programming resource to be used with offenders who lack social support.99 This highlights Braithewaite's100 crucial distinction between the concepts of passive and active responsibility . The passive responsibility inherent in the phrase \"serving time\" implies the state holding a n offender accountable for his or her past actions, whereas the active responsibility , which is at the heart of restorative justice processes , focuses on \"taking responsibility for putting things right into the future.\" This active responsibility is brought about by a \"redemption script\"101 that allows a n offender to claim a \"coherent and convincing\" narrative supporting a significant identity tr ansformation from a selfish delinquent and/or addict to a responsible and helpful \"new person.\" Rather than being view ed as a set of risks to be managed or a bundle of needs to be met (which is well illustrated by the \"risk and needs assessment\" of offende rs in the criminal justice system) , the offender is understood to have strengths that can be deployed for the benefit of self and others.102 The paradigm case is the \"wounded healer ,\" a former addict who is uniquely effective in helping other addicts precis ely because of prior experience in active addiction and addiction recovery. 3. Bringing a Faith -Based Trauma Healing Program to Jail Inmates The current study builds on th is positive criminology model by examining the effectiveness of American Bible Society's (ABS) Correctional Trauma Healing Program (CTHP ), a volunteer -led program for inmates housed at the Riverside Regional Jail in North Prince George, VA , which is supporte d by Good News Jail & Prison Ministry (Good News) . Founded in 1816, ABS is a United States-based non -denominational Bible society that publishes, translates, and distributes the Bible. Good News exists to place Christian chaplains in jails and prisons to minister to the spiritual needs of inmates and staff. It believes that the most effective tool for ministering to the needs of inmates and staff is the daily presence of a chaplain. The chaplain serves as evangelist, pastor, counselor, mentor , and friend to those who are incarcerated and the staff who guard and protect them. Although correctional chaplaincy has existed for many decades in federal and state prisons, on -site chaplains were virtually non -existent in jails in the 1960s, and Good News was, in part, launched to remedy this oversight. The ABS and Good News partnership relies upon the book , Healing the Wounded Heart: An Inmate Journal , and adjoining program model . Chaplains and volunteers in 29 states are now 21 delivering the program. The Bible is a central component of the program, which is grounded in Scripture -based stories and examples. Here is a description of the program : This unique method of trauma healing un ites proven mental health practices and engagement with God through the Bible . Trained facilitators empower participants to identify their pain, share their suffering, forgive their oppressors and bring their pain to the cross of Christ for healing. As the y release their pain, they are often able to forgive and sometimes can be reconciled with those who have inflicted the pain. They are freed to care for themselves and serve others. Healing the Wounded Heart , ABS's contextualization of the program for those in correctional ministry, contains a set of practical lessons that lead incarcerated people and those transitioning back to their communities, on a journey of healing. In the current study, t he CTHP was offered throughout the jail facility in Virginia on a rotating basis ensuring that inmates of every security classification level (i.e., minimum, medium, and maximum) and all housing units (each of which consist ed of five \"Pods\" with a capacity of 60 to 90 inmates each) had access to the pro gram. Two healing groups were offered (monthly on average), one for females and another for males. About a week before the start of each group, a flyer about a recruitment day was posted and a verb al announcement was made inviting interested inmates to att end a presentation explaining the program and how they could benefit from it. After the presentation, questions were answered and inmates expressing interest were given an application/commitment form. About three days before a group started, chosen inmates and alternates confirm ed their acceptance into the program , and were also offered the opportunity to participate in survey research related to the program . The CTHP was implemented primarily by Good News volunteers at the jail who sought out training to meet the mental and spiritual needs of inmates . Volunteers interested in helping others in this Bible -based trauma healing program attend ed an equipping session. This session invite d them to: (a) experience the program themselves, explore trauma they may be carrying , and bring it to Christ for healing; (b) experience and practice participatory learning; and (c) learn basic biblical and mental health best practices. Then , they develop ed their own plans for using the material in their facility . At the end of the training, they were given feedback on whether they could continue in the process. Those who were certified to continue return ed to their communities to apply what they ha d learned through a practicum. During the practicum period, they facilitate d the five lessons of Healing the Wounded Heart at least two times and to a minimum of three people. After the practicum, they attend ed an advanced equipping session, which enabled them to hone skills, receive more feedback, and care well for traumatized individuals. 4. Research Questions This report addresses four interrelated questions : 1. Does the Correctional T rauma Healing Program work? In other words, i s the CTHP an effective treatment intervention that helps incarcerated individuals who have previously experienced traumatic events cope with the negative consequences of their trauma? For 22 example, do inmates diagnosed with post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) repo rt a reduction in PTSD symptoms after completing the CTHP ? Additional outcomes, including depressed mood , depressed malaise , suicide , and interpersonal aggression , will be examined as well. 2. How does the program work? In other words, i f the CTHP works, why is it effective and what are the mechanisms that promote healing from trauma ? Phrased in a different way, what are the anticipated outcomes of the CTHP that are likely to help victims cope with trauma consequences in prosocial or positive way s? For example, after completing the CTHP , are participants more forgiving and less vengeful toward a person who caused a traumatic event than before? Does the CTHP help the participants become resilient or regain a sense of meaning in life that they may have lost as a result of trauma? A variety of mechanisms will be examined. 3. Does the impact of the Correctional T rauma Healing Program last? In other words, i f the CTHP is effective, how long does the effect of this intervention last? This is an important question since the effect of certain program s\u2014especially interventions of short duration \u2014may be short -lived, disappearing relatively soon after a program has ended. Relatedly, correctional decision -makers need to know not only if the negative consequences of trauma are reduced after the program , but also whether they remain at a reduced level for a given period or soon return to the previous level . For example , if PTSD decreases after the program, does that reduction hold for a month or even long er after completing the CTHP ? 4. Is the observed pattern of reduction in trauma consequences attributable to the pattern of the program's outcomes? In other words, r egard less of how long the impact lasts, are changes in trauma consequences over time after the program attributable to changes in the program's outcomes? This is a longitudinal version of the second question. For example, if the level of PTSD symptomology decre ases after participation in the CTHP , is the effect due to increased forgiveness or resilience among CTHP participants? Alternatively, did it decrease as participants became less vengeful toward a person who caused a traumatic event? 5. Methodology To addre ss these questions, American Bible Society awarded a research grant to Baylor University's Program on Prosocial Behavior at the Institute for Studies of Religion. Our subsequent research relied upon a longitudinal survey that was conducted from September 2 018 to March 2020 at the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George County, Virginia (see Appendix A for details). The following summary provides a brief description of the research design, methodology, and demographic profile of the sample (see Tables A1 an d A2 for additional information ): The s urvey was conducted with a sample of 349 inmates (178 males and 171 females) housed at the Riverside Regional Jail, North Prince George, VA. 23 The total sample consists of a treatment group of 210 inmates (106 males and 104 females) who participated in the CTHP , and a control group of 139 inmates (72 males and 67 females) who did not participate. The program was run in small groups, each of which began with 12 inmates on average . The treatment group was comprised of 22 h ealing groups (10 male and 12 female groups) , each of which completed four surveys: a pretest (before the program started), a posttest (soon after the program ended), and two follow -ups (one and three months after completing the CTHP ). The control group was created based on random sampling of inmates who did not sign up for the CTHP and participated in two surveys : a \"pretest\" and a \"posttest,\" with a two - week interval. The study participants were, on average, about 38 years old , with the youngest a nd oldest being 18 and 65, respectively . The sample was split almost equally between two rac e groups : 48% white and 52% black. About eight out of 10 study participants were single, and 85 % reported a religious affiliation : 71.8% Christian (61.2% Protestan religion , and about 15% no religion. One third of the participating inmates were pre -trial detainees . The most common charge was a technical violation of probation or parole (65% of the sample), but some were charged with violent (28%), property (36%), and drug offenses (26%) as well. More than eight out of 10 (86%) inmates had experienced at least one traumatic event, and, importantly, the treatment and control groups did not significantly differ in terms of the average number of traumatic event s experienced (i.e., roughly three events). About 70 % of the sample was screened as PTSD positive , with treatment group inmates being more likely to be positive for PTSD than their control group peers. The sur vey included items measur ing a variety of concepts (e.g., PTSD symptoms, depressed mood , depressed malaise , suicide, interpersonal aggression , etc.), mostly using multi -item scale s (see Appendix B for the actual survey) . Information on sociodemographic and criminal justice - related backgrounds came from official data provided by the Riverside Regional Jail. The following three groups of concepts/variables were included in analysis (see Figure 1 for relationships among the three groups of variables) : Sociodem ographic, criminal justice -related, and trauma exposure (exogenous variables): age, sex, race, marital status, religious affiliation, number of admissions to jail, security classification, types of offenses committed, etc. Outcomes of the CTHP (mediating e ndogenous variables): forgiveness, resilience, religiosity, perceived social support, a sense of meaning in life, Bible impact , etc. Negative consequences of trauma (ultimate endogenous variables): PTSD, complicated grief, negative emotional states ( depressed mood , depressed malaise , and anger), suicidal ideation, and intended aggression (the self -reported probability of engaging in interpersonal aggression) . 24 For scale construction , the validity and reliability of survey items were examined based on factor analys es and inter -item reliability scores before combining items into composite measure s by averaging or summing them. All scales ha d good to excellent measurement quality across surveys (see Table A3) . The data were analyzed using va rious statistical methods to answer the research questions: one - way and two -way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), structural equation modeling, and random -effects models (see Appendix A for details). All of the results summarized in the next section are statistically significant at the level of .05 or less unless noted otherwise. Results from all of the analyses that were conducted are available in the appendices. 6. Findings B. Research Question #1: Does the Correctional Trauma Healing Program Wor k? 7. Negative Consequences of Trauma According to the National Center for PTSD: \"About 6 of every 10 men (or 60%) and 5 of every 10 women (or 50%) experience at least one trauma in their lives .\"103 While a direct comparison between these estimates and the current data is problematic due to potential measurement differences, the inmates analyzed here reported that they had experienced, on average, three out of 10 types of traumatic events, and 86% (87.6% in the treatment group and 83.5% in the control group) said that they experienced at least one. This suggests that the inmates in the current study may have suffered from more trauma than members of the general population. 25 The National Center for PT SD also provides the following statistics about PTSD in the U.S. population: \"About 7 or 8 out of every 100 people (or 7 -8% of the population) will have PTSD at some point in their lives.\"104 A similar lifetime prevalence rate of PTSD was found in the Natio nal Comorbidity Survey, 6.8%.105 PTSD positive cases in the current sample was 70.0% (ranged from 60.9 -65.1% in the control group and 72.3 -76.2% in the treatment group; see Table C1) depending upon how PTSD positive was determined (see the Measurement secti on of Appendix A). Once again, direct comparisons are problematic, but PTSD appears to be much more common among jail inmates in comparison to individuals in the general population. If the CTHP is effective, the negative consequences of trauma exposure (i.e., PTSD, complicated grief, depressed mood , depressed malaise , anger, suicidal ideation, and interpersonal aggression ) are expected to diminish among the treatment group inmates after completing the CTHP compared with their control group counterparts who did not complete the CTHP (see Appendix C for a description of the statistical analys es). This expectation was largely supported by the data. Specifically, w e found that the treatment group's average post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scores were sign ificantly higher before the CTHP , but substantially reduced after the CTHP , becoming significantly lower than the control group's average after the program (see Figure A1). The effect size was \"medium\" ( see Table C1 for details ). In contrast, PTSD did not significantly change between the pretest and posttest among those who did not participate in the CTHP . Even though only one figure is shown here, t he same basic pattern was observed regardless of whether PTSD was measured using modified or original versions of an instrument called the \"Short PTSD Rating Interview (SPRINT).\" A total of four different measures of PTSD were examined, and the results were similar for all of them. In addition to PTSD, the negative consequence s of trauma w ere also measured in terms of \"complicated grief,\" which refers to a denial of what happened, negative affect interfering with one's life, and functional impairment (e.g., avoiding things one used to do before trauma and 19.7 18.722.4 14.8 14.015.016.017.018.019.020.021.022.023.0 Pretest PosttestFigure A1. PTSD Control Treatment 26 feeling distant from other people). Complicated grief showed a similar pattern (see Figure A2). That is, the treatment group inmates reported, on average, a higher score on complicated grief than their control group peers at the pretest but scored significantly lower at the posttes t. Similarly, while the treatment and control group inmates were no different in negative emotions (i.e., how often they felt depressed, anxious, and angry/frustrated during the last week prior to the survey) before the CTHP , program participants reported a s ignificantly lower average of negative emotions than the non -participants after completing the CTHP (see Figure A3). The effect size was \"medium.\" When state depressed mood , state depressed malaise , and state anger (feeling frustrated as well as angry) were examined separately, their observed patterns were consistent across the different types of negative emotions (see Figures A4 to A6). Another measure of inmate's mental health is suicidal ideation: that is, thinking about committing suicide. The treat ment and control groups did not differ in the average of suicidal ideation at the pretest, but the treatment group's average significantly decreased between the pretest and posttest, whereas the control group's average did not significantly change Fig ure A7). PosttestFigure A3. Negative Emotions Control Treatment 27 While the above measures of the negative consequences of tramua were all affective, one additional question tapped inmate behavior, or to be precise, behavioral intention. Specifically, inmates were asked to indicate how likely or unlikely it would be that they engage in interpersonal aggression (i.e., arguing with a fellow inmate over a seat) as a character did in a scenario included in the survey (see survey item #11 for details). Although the CTHP participants and non -participants did not differ at the pretest, the former reported a signifigicantly reduced chance of reporting that they would engag e in interper sonal aggression at the posttest, whereas the latter's reported likelihood did not change between the pretest and PosttestFigure A7. Suicidal Ideation Control Treatment 28 1. Outcomes of the Correctional Trauma Healing Program Anticipated outcomes of the CTHP were also examined to se e whether the group average of program outcomes changed in a way that was anticipated. That is, the treatment group's average of prosocial outcomes were expected to increase bet ween the pretest and posttest, whereas the control group's average w as not expe cted to significantly change over time. If the program's impact was measured in terms of an antisocial factor, the treatment group's average was expected to decrease after the CTHP , while the control group's average was expected to statistically remain the same over time. CTHP outcomes were examined in two groups : primary and secondary outcomes . Primary outcomes are what the CTHP is designed to generate , and what is specifically addressed in the material/curriculum . These included : forgiveness, a reduction in vengefulness, compassion, resilience, reasons for living, religiosity, images of God (a decrease in perceived God's judgment and an increase in perc eived God's engagement), a reduction in blaming God for trauma experienced, God's forgiveness, God's purpose in life, and lament in prayer. Secondary outcomes are what might reasonably result from the primary outcomes or the CTHP 's long -term impact , includ ing: perceived social support from family and friends (e.g., as a result of reconciliation that may take place after completion of the CTHP ), a sense of meaning in life (due to an enhanced sense of God's purpose in life), gratitude to God (in response to t rauma healing in God), spiritual transformation (as a result of enhanced religiosity), positive beliefs about the Bible, Bible usage, and Bible impact . C. Primary Outcomes Although the treatment and control groups did not differ in the average of forgiveness of a person who caused a traumatic event at the pretest, the treatment group exhibited a higher level of forgiveness at the posttest than the control group, whose average did not significantly change over time (see Figure A9). Conversely, while the two gro ups were not significantly different in 3.633.64 3.52 3.16 2.903.003.103.203.303.403.503.603.70 Pretest PosttestFigure A8. Intended Aggression Control Treatment 29 vengefulness toward that person at the pretest, the treatment group's averge vengefulness was significantly lower after completion of the CTHP , whereas the control group's average did not change over time (see Figure A10). The effect size was \"medium\" for both forgiveness and vengefulness. Like forgiveness, the treatment and control group did not differ in compassion at the pretest, but after completion of the CTHP , the posttest confirms that the treatment group r eported, on averge, higher levels of compassion than the control group, whose average remained practically the same over time (see Figure A11).106 Before participating in the CTHP , inmates in the treatment group reported, on average, significantly lower levels of resilience than those in the control group. However, after 2.842.99 the CTHP , the treatment group's average resilience increased significantly, becoming no different fro m the control group's average, which remained essentially unchanged over time (see Figure A12). The effect size was \"medium.\" Since the CTHP intends to address suicidal tendency among individuals who have experienced trauma, a 12 -item scale was used to measure six types of reasons for living (2 items per type) to see whether participation in the CTHP influences these various reasons for living: (1) survival and coping beliefs ; (2) responsibility to family ; (3) child -related concerns ; (4) fear of sucide ; (5) fear of social disapproval ; and (6) moral objections. The treatment and control groups did not differ in the average of the 12 items at the pretest, but the posttest revealed a significant group difference, where the treatment group's average was high er than the control group's average , as anticipated (see Figure A13). When the six types were examined separately, two of them were found to contribute to the observed pattern: (1) survival and coping beliefs ; and (2) moral objections (see Table C1). The i tems of the former were found to have poor inter -item reliability across surveys (see Table A3), so the subsequent analysis focuse d on the dimension of moral objections, which showed the same pattern of group differences found above for the average of 12 items (see Figure A14). 4.484.464.694.93 4.204.304.404.504.604.704.804.905.00 A14. Moral Ojbections to Suicide Control Treatment 31 When five different religiosity items were jointly examined \u2014two measures of subjective religiosity (perceived closeness to God and importance of religion or relationship with God) and three indicators of objective religiosity (fr equency of service attendance, prayer, and reading a sacred text) \u2014the treatment group was found to be more religious than the control group before the CTHP started .107 Between the pretest and posttest, the average religiosity significantly increased among the treament group inmates but did not significantly change among their control group peers (see Figure A15). When each religosity item was examined separately, import ance of religion or relationship with God was the only item where a significant group difference in the change of average over time was observed (see Figure A16 and Table C1).108 A key theme in the curriculum was to help CTHP participants understand that Go d is loving, which was expected to decrease the perceived threat of God's judgment and increase a sense of God's engagment. The CTHP did not seem to make a difference in the perception of God's judgment among inmates , as the treatment and control groups we re no different at both the pretest and posttest , with their averages not significantly changing over time (see Figure A17). On the other hand, while the treatment group already reported, on average, higher levels of perceived God's engagment than the cont rol group at the pretest, the treatment group's average significantly increased between the pretest and posttet, whereas the control group's average did not change over time (see Figure A18). In sum, participating in CTHP helped inmates to have an enhancee d perception of God being concerned about them and directly involved in their lives, although it did not reduce their perception of God's judgment. Importance of Religion Control Treatment 32 Inmates in the treatment group were also found to blame God for the trauma they experienced more than those in the control group at the pretest, but they became no different at the posttest , as the treatment group's blaming of God did not increase, while the control group's blaming increased between the tests (see Figure A19). The CTHP material \u2014Healing the Wounded Heart \u2014also addresses God's forgiveness , but the participant's perception of being forgiven by God did not significantly increase after the program completion (see Figure A20). Although they were not different from each other at the pretest, the treatment group inmates reported, on average, higher levels of perceived God's forgiveness than their control group counterparts at the posttest. However, the program's impact on participants' perception of God's forgiveness was not found to be PosttestFigure A20. God's Forgiveness Control Treatment 33 However, participation in the CTHP program did make a difference in terms of a sense of God's purpose in life, which is also specifically addressed by the CTHP material. That is, the treatment and control groups were not different at the pretest in the perception of God's purpose (or a specific plan) in an inmate's life, but they were found to be significantly different at the posttest , with the treatment group reporting, on average, higher levels of perceived God's purpose than the control group (see Figure A21). The treatment group's average increased significantly after the CTHP , while the control group's did not significantly change. Trauma often involves a loss of someone or something (e.g., a family member or a friend, a body part or its function, property, etc.). Since grief and mourning a loss can eventually lead to healing, the CTHP intends to not only help participants understan d that it is normal to grieve , but to also encourage them to talk about how they feel and even express their anger and sadness. For example, the curriculum includes a lesson on laments (us ing a lament psalm from the Bible), which would allow trauma victims to fully express their grief. The frequency of lamenting to God in prayer (i.e., expressing anger, sorrow, bitterness, etc.) did not signifcantly change after the CTHP in either group (see Figure A22). D. Secondary Outcomes People are likely to react more se verely to trauma if they have little or no support from family or friends during and after the traumatic event. Although the CTHP is not designed to directly affect the participant's perception of social support from family and friends, the program -generated healing may enhance that perception. For example, if healing led to family reconciliation, the perception of family support is likely to be increased . Before participation in the CTHP , the treatment group inmates reported, on average, lower levels of perceived family support than their control group peers . However, the treatment group's perceived support significantly increased after the program, becoming no different from the control group's, which did not change significantly over time (see Figure A23). On the other 4.346 4.1774.4994.619 PosttestFigure A22. Lament in Prayer Control Treatment 34 hand, the treatment and control groups did not differ in perceived support from friends at the pretest and postte st, as the average perception of both groups increased between the tests (see Figure A24). The CTHP may also increase a sense of meaning and purpose in life among the participants as a result of enhancing their beliefs about God's purpose and specific plan for their lives. The treatment group inmates reported, on average, significantly lower levels of perceived presence of meaning in life than their control group counterparts before they participated in the program , but significantly higher levels after they completed it (see Figure A25). The effect size was \"large\" (see Table C1), and this magnitude of effect size was found only for this outcome. 3.613.70 3.303.68 3.103.203.303.403.503.603.703.80 PosttestFigure A26. Gratitude to God Control Treatment 35 God is the main source of healing in the CTHP . Thus, to the extent that a participant attributes their h ealing to God, the participant's grateful attitude towards God is expected to increase. Findings were c onsistent with this expectation . Even though the treatment and control groups did not significantly differ in the average of gratitude to God at the pret est, they became different after the CTHP . Specifically, the average gratitude to God among the treatment group inmates significantly increased, while it did not significantly change among their control group peers (see Figure A26). Three additional variables were also explored as potential secondary outcomes of the program: the percentage of inmates reporting spiritual transformation (or religious conversion), positive beliefs about the Bible (e.g., the Bible being a guide for life and a way of knowing God's will), and the frequency of Bible interaction outside of religious services. The average of the first two potential outcomes significantly increased among inmates in the treatment group between the pretest and posttest, whereas no sign ificant change was observed among those in the control group over time (see Figures A27 and A28). As a result, the two groups became different at the posttest even though they were not different at the pretest. However, the CTHP 's overall effect on these v ariables was found to be not signifficant (see Table C1). On the other hand, the treatment group inmates tended to report that they used the Bible outside of religious services more often than the control group counterparts before , as well as after , the CTHP. But, neither group's average changed between the pretest and posttest (see Figure A29). In other words, the CTHP 's impact on Bible interaction was no t significant , indicated by the effect size being zero (see Table C1). Another potential outcome involv ed experiences that inmates were likely to have when they used the Bible, which ABS calls \" Bible impact \" (e.g., feeling a sense of connection to God, becoming more willing to engage in faith, and showing more loving behavior towards others; see Appendix B for details). The treatment and control groups did not differ in the average of Bible impact at the pretest, but they became different at the posttest as the treatment group's average increased significantly between the tests, whereas the control group's a verge did not show any significant 65.2%68.5%74.2%83.3% A28. Positive Beliefs about the Bible Control Treatment 36 change over time (see Figure A30). In other words, the CTHP enhanced Bible impact among inmates. E. Research Question #2: How Does the Program Work? The above results provide empirical evidence that the CTHP is effective for many different outcomes . That is, the negative consequences of trauma exposure were significantly reduced among inmates who completed the CTHP , whereas non -participating inmates te nded to report no significant change s over time , regardless of which trauma consequence was examined (e.g., PTSD, complicated grief, negative emotional states, suicidal ideation, or the likelihood of interpersonal aggression ). The CTHP also worked in that it generated many anticipated outcomes, including increase s in prosocial factors and decrease s in antisocial ones. Primary outcomes were expected because the CTHP specifically targets them, whether being promoted (e.g., forgiveness toward a person who caused a traumatic event) or discouraged (e.g., vengefulness toward the person). Secondary outcomes were likely byproducts of primary outcomes, though not necessarily intended by the program. An important question to ask is whether the observed reduction in n egative consequences of trauma can be attributed to the program -generated changes in the primary and secondary outcomes. In other words, did the CTHP work because it increased prosocial outcomes and decreased antisocial outcomes, which in turn reduced PTSD , complicated grief, negative emotional states, suicidal ideation, and the likelihood of interpersonal aggression? To answer this second research question, we examined whether the primary and second ary outcomes mediated or explained the CTHP 's effect on th e trauma consequences. Overall , findings provide d an affirmative answer to th is question (see Appendix D and Table D1 for details). That is, the CTHP enhanced prosocial outcomes and reduced antisocial outcomes, 3.08 A30. Bible Impact Control Treatment 37 thereby decreasing the negative consequences of trauma and facilitating healing among trauma victims. Specifically, for PTSD and complicated grief, six primary outcomes ( forgiveness, resilience, moral objections to suicide, God's engagement, God's forgiveness, and God's purpose in life ) and four secondary outcomes ( family support, friends support, presence of meaning, and Bible impact ) were enhanced , whereas vengefulness , an antisocial outcome , was reduced . For example, the CTHP enhanced forgiving and resilient attitudes among participating inmate s and helped them reduce vengeful attitudes toward a person who caused them harm through a traumatic event. Similarly, there was an increase in inmate perceptions of God's care and plan for their lives. In addition, though not covered in the CTHP , the part icipating inmates reported an increase in perceived support from their family and friends, a sense of meaning in life, and positive experiences from Bible interaction (e.g., a sense of connection to God, an increased desire to know God, and more loving beh avior towards other people). These changes , in turn, were associated with decreased levels of PTSD and complicated grief. Most of these outcomes, both primary and secondary, also helped to explain how the CTHP aided the healing of participating inmates \u2014by reducing their negative emotions as well as the likelihood of engaging in interpersonal aggression. The healing was found to be attributable to a decrease in vengefulness and increases in God's engagement, God's forgiveness, family support, friends support , Bible impact , and, to a lesser extent, God's purpose in life, presence of meaning, gratitude to God, and positive beliefs about the Bible. On the other hand, none of the primary outcomes explained a decrease in suicidal ideation before or after the CTHP , while four secondary outcomes did: presence of meaning, gratitude to God, positive beliefs about the Bible, and Bible impact . A somewhat peculiar finding was that the measure of moral objections to suicide (which explained the CTHP 's reduction of PTSD and complicated grief) was not significantly related to suicidal ideation. This finding and the relatively limited explanation of the CTHP 's outcomes in this area might be related to the use of a single item to measure suicidal ideation, for which multiple it ems could have been employed. Stated positively, it made sense to see that an inmate's existential belief in life's meaning increased as a result of participating in the CTHP , which significantly reduced his or her thought s about committing suicide. The ot her three significant explanatory factors were related to God or the Bible. That is, the CTHP increased gratitude to God, positive beliefs about the Bible, and Bible impact , which in turn reduced suicidal ideation.109 F. Research Question #3: Does the Impact of the Program Last? While we found a significant reduction in the negative consequences of trauma two to three days after the CTHP, w e were also interested in determining what happened to the initially observed change s one month following completion of the program . Did the levels of trauma consequences return to where they were before the CTHP , remain the same, or continue to decrease? What about the primary and secondary outcomes of the CTHP ? Furthermore, what happened to these outcomes three months after completion of the CTHP ? These are important questions given that a treatment found effective often turns out to have a short -lived effect , with positive changes disappearing soon after the treatment intervention. 38 To answer these questions, data from the two follow -up surveys administered to the treatment groups , as well as the pretest and posttest data , were analyzed to see what happened to those changes observed between the first two survey administrations at one and three month interval s after the CTHP ended . Results presented below are based solely on data from inmates who completed the CTHP . PTSD, which was significantly reduced between t he pretest and posttest (Times 1 and 2), remained at the lower level one and three months after completion of the CTHP (Times 3 and 4) (see Figure C1). The observed changes in the average across Times 1 to 4 were found to be statistically significant, and the CTHP 's effect size was \"large\" for all four measures of PTSD (see Table E1). Even though only one figure is shown here, the results were similar for the four measures of PTSD. Complicated grief and negative emotional states showed a similar pattern ( see Figures C2 and C3). That is, on average, they both significantly decreased between the pretest (Time 1) and posttest (Time 2) , and then showed no significant change afterwards (Times 3 and 4) , with Time 2 to 4 averages not being significantly different from each other. A consistent pattern was observed when negative emotional state s were examined separately for depressed mood , depressed malaise , and anger (see Figure C3). 24.33 14.95 15.0815.23 .005.0010.0015.0020.0025.0030.00 Time 1 Time 2 Time 3 Time 4Figure C1. PTSD 39 On the other hand, inmate's suicidal ideation and likelihood of engaging in interpersonal aggression did not show significant pattern s of change over time (see Figures C4 and C5). Specifically, none of the differences in the average w ere statistically significant (see Table E1).110 In contrast, t he average of forgiv eness increased between the pretest and posttest , and did not change significantly afterwards (see Figure C6),111 whereas that of vengefulness decreased after the CTHP and remained statistically the same over the next three months (see Figure C7). The CTHP 's effect size was \"large\" for both outcomes (see Table E1). 3.47 2.63 2.412.57 1.001.502.002.503.003.504.00 Time 1 Time 2 Time 4Figure C2.

Intended Aggression 40 Significant overall changes across the four surveys were also observed for compassion, resilience, moral objections to suicide, and religiosity, but the observed patterns of change were differ ent among the four primary outcomes. Specifically, compassion and resilience both, on average, significantly increased between Time s 1 and 3 . However, between Time s 3 and 4 , they decreased to a level that was not significantly different from what was obser ved at Time 1 (see Figures C8 and C9). In other words, the CTHP 's positive effects on compassion and resilience were observed only up to a month after the program ended , but tended to disappear afterwards. This finding indicates a need to sustain the CTHP 's impact beyond the one -month period. On the other hand, inmate's moral objections to suicide significantly increased after completion of the CTHP , and the impact te nded to last for three months after the program ended (see Figure C10). However, the pattern of change in religiosity was different. That is, participating inmates' 2.643.18 3.223.47 2.002.202.402.602.803.003.203.403.60 Time 1 Time 2 Time 3 Time 4Figure C6.

Resilience 41 religious involvement did not significantly change after they completed the CTHP , then significantly decreased about a month later and stayed at that level afterwards (see Figure C11). The non -significant change in religiosity before and after the CTHP seems inconsistent with the earlier finding of significant increase between the pretest and po sttest observed among the treatment group inmates (see Figure 18 in the Section VI -A-2-a). However, this inconsistency is likely due to the difference in sample size and its associated statistical power. Regardless, the significant drop in religiosity foll owing the end of the CTHP deserves further investigati on. Similar patterns of change were observed when the religiosity items were examined separately , except for the frequency of religious service attendance, which decreased between the pretest and posttest as well as between the posttest and first follow -up, remaining low afterwards (see Figure C12). 4.155.06 4.794.85 3.503.703.904.104.304.504.704.905.105.30 Time 1 Time 2 Time 3 Time 4Figure C10.

In contrast, the overall change in perceived level of God's engagement was found to be statistically significant, showing a generally linear pattern of increase over time until Time 3, and then leveling off by Time 4 (see Figure C14) . Among the four remaining primary outcomes related to God, only blaming God (for a traumatic event he or she had) had a significant pattern of change . Specifically, it continued to decline after the CTHP ended, and then stayed at the lower level (see Figure C15). On the other hand, perceived God's forgiveness, God's purpose in life, and lament in prayer all had no significant pattern of change (see Figures C16 to C18). 20.42 19.5620.2120.81 16.0017.0018.0019.0020.0021.0022.00 Time 1 Time 4Figure C13.

God's Forgiveness 43 Turning to the secondary outcomes of the CTHP , both measures of perceived social support were found to significantly increase over time, following a generally linear pattern (see Figures C19 and C20). That is, the CTHP 's salutary effect on the perception o f family support and friends support lasted for at least three months after the CTHP ended. This pattern of change in perceived support from family and friends is likely to indicate that the CTHP helped participating inmates gradually overcome their percei ved alienation from their family members and peers. Similarly, the CTHP 's impact on the inmate's sense of meaning in life also lasted for several months after the program ended, showing an increasing pattern over time (see Figure C21). On the other hand, the inmate's gratitude to God showed no significant pattern of change ac ross the four waves (see Figure C22). 4.534.604.75 4.63 4.004.104.204.304.404.504.604.704.80 Time 1 Time 2 Time C17.

However, this finding needs to be interpreted with caution given that fewer than 40 inmates answered survey questions (with the exception of the question about experiencing spiritual transformation) about these attributes since they were not asked of those who indicated they were not Christian s or were not currently interested in exploring what it means to be a Christian. 4.815.705.91 5.87 4.004.505.005.506.006.50 Time 1 Time 2 Time 3 Time 4Figure C21.

Research Question #4: Is the Observed Pattern of Reduction in Trauma Consequences Attributable to th e Pattern of the Program's Outcomes? Just as the third research question was a longitudinal version of the first question, this last question is a longitudinal extension of the second question. That is, the question is whether changes in the primary and se condary outcomes of the program across the four waves were significantly associated with changes in the negative consequences of trauma exposure during the research period. A dynamic analysis of four -wave panel data (see Appendix F for details) confirmed that PTSD, complicated grief, negative emotional states, suicidal ideation, and intended aggression all significantly declined during the study period (see Table F1), followin g a non -linear functional 4.38 4.244.44 4.38 3.603.804.004.204.404.60 Time 1 Time 4Figure C25.

The pattern remained significant when sociodemographic and criminal justice -related variables were controlled (see Table F2). Most of the CTHP outcomes that explained a significant reduction in trauma consequences between the first two waves among participating inmates compared to their non -participating peers were also found to predict changes in those consequences across the four waves (see Table F3). In fact, they tended to have more explanatory power for the prediction than explaining the group differences (cf. Table D1). While their number varied across the measures of trauma consequence, significant predictors included 10 (out of 12) prim ary outcomes and seven (out of eight) secondary outcomes , with 11 of them \u2014forgiveness, vengefulness, resilience, religiosity, blaming God (for trauma), God's forgiveness, lament in prayer, family support, friends support, presence of meaning, and positive beliefs about the Bible \u2014predicting at least three out of five trauma consequences (see Table F4). For example, changes in resilience over the period of study w ere inversely associated with all five measures of trauma exposure . Specifically, an increase in resilience during the study period was significantly related to decrease s in PTSD, complicated grief, negative emotions, suicidal ideation, and intended aggression. To illustrate, Figure D3 shows that the trajectory of resilience (concave down) is close to a mirror image of the trajectory of complicated grief (concave up), visualizing the inverse relationship between the two variables across the four time points . That is, complicated grief decreased as resilience increased after the CTHP ended. This finding implies that CTHP -generated resilience was likely to reduce complicated grief over time . Conversely, Figure D4 shows a positive relationship between changes in vengefulness and negative emotional states across the four waves , with both trajectories (c oncave up) showing a similar pattern of change over time. That is, as vengefulness decreased among CTHP participants following completion of the CTHP , their negative emotional states simultaneously declined .

Vengefulness & Negative Emotions Negative emotions Vengefulness 47 finding suggests that the program -reduced vengefulness was likely to be associated with a reduction in depressed mood , depressed malaise , and anger over the study period.112 H. Summary of Results Overall , findings provide empirical evidence that American Bible Society's Correctional T rauma Healing Program (CTHP) had a significant impact on offenders housed at the Riverside Regional Jail in Virginia by reducing the negative affective consequences of trauma exposure among jail inmates who complet ed the CTHP . Moreover, completing the CTHP was also linked to a decreas ed likelihood of engaging in aggression towards other inmates. When inmates signed up for the CTHP , participants were higher on post -traumatic str ess disorder (PTSD) and complicated grief , and no different in negative emotional states, suicidal ideation, and intended aggression compared to non -participants. CTHP participants reported significantly lower levels of those attributes than non -participan ts after completing the CTHP . The observed reduction in trauma consequences were attributable to the CTHP 's intended outcomes (primary outcomes) and byproducts (secondary outcomes). That is, the CTHP enhanced prosocial attributes and decreased antisocial ones, which in turn reduced the negative consequences of trauma. While they had different roles and power in explaining the CTHP 's impact on negative consequences of trauma, outcomes that significantly explained the impact were: forgiveness, vengefulness, resilience, moral objections to suicide, religiosity, perceived God's engagement, God's forgiveness, God's purpose in life, family support, friends support, a sense of meaning in life, gratitude to God, positive beliefs about the Bible, and Bible impact . These variables indicate the various ways in which the CTHP helped in the healing of trauma victims.113 The healing effect was not short -lived. That is, this salutary impact did not disappear soon after the CTHP ended but was observed for three months follo wing the intervention for several outcomes . In addition, the CTHP 's effects on some primary and secondary outcomes were also observed for three months following the end of the program. The trajectory of prosocial outcomes generally looked like a mirror image of that of trauma consequences, whereas the pattern of changes in antisocial out comes, particularly vengefulness, were found to be similar to the pattern of changes in the negative consequences of trauma. This finding implies that changes resulting from exposure to the CTHP outcomes are likely to explain those in trauma consequences. A dynamic analysis of four waves of panel data revealed that changes in the CTHP outcomes over time were significantly associated with changes in the negative consequences of trauma. This significant association implies the causal influence of the CTHP outcomes on the trauma consequences across the four waves. That is, for example, PT SD decreased between the first two waves partly because a prosocial outcome, like resilience, was increasing during that same period. Then , PTSD remained at the same decreased level at the third and fourth waves because resilience did not significantly cha nge during the remainder of the study period. The changes in PTSD can also be explained partly by changes in an antisocial factor, like vengefulness, which 48 decreased between the first and second waves and remained at that level at the third and fourth wave s.114 8. Conclusion To conclude, even though correctional leaders and the public support the rehabilitation of inmates, programs in jails and prison are underfunded, relatively rare, and achieve limited success. This report has examine d the effectiveness o f American Bible Society's Correctional Trauma Healing Program \u2014Healing the Wounded Heart \u2014which was implemented at the Riverside Regional Jail in Virginia. The results suggest that the program reduces the negative affective consequences of trauma exposure , as well as the likelihood of engaging in aggression toward other inmates. When inmates signed up for the program, participants were higher on post - traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complicated grief compared with non -participants, but there were no diff erences in negative emotional states, suicidal ideation, and intended aggression . At the completion of the program, however, participants reported significantly lower levels of these outcomes than non -participants. Additional analyses suggest that t he prog ram works, in part, by shaping important characteristics such as forgiveness, vengefulness, resilience, moral objections to suicide, religiosity, and a sense of meaning and purpose in life, among others. The healing effect of the program was not short -lived. In fact, i t was observed for three months following the completion of the program for some study outcomes. 9. Implications for Justice System Reform In an age of evidenced -based government, empirical research can provide policy makers and practitioners in government and the private sector with findings and data that can be used to produce better interventions and outcomes. The current push for criminal justice reform has brought together leaders from both sides of the political aisle. However, solutions to criminal justice reform often remain difficult to find because of budgetary constraints. Research in the sub-field of positive criminology suggests t hat positive and restorative approaches \u2014including those that cultivate social connectedness and support, service to others, spiritual experience, personal integrity, and identity change \u2014may well be more effective than traditional approaches to punishment.115 Consistent with restorative justice practices, these approaches seek to develop active responsibility on the part of individuals who have grown accustomed to a lifestyle of irresponsibility.116 From this perspective, correctional practices should be dev ised to promote virtue. Consequently, the goal of justice or punishment should not be to inflict pain or exact revenge , but rather to reconstruct and reform individuals.117 Should trauma -healing programs like the current one continue to be found to foster rehabilitation and identi ty transformation, as well as reduce recidivism, there may be significant potential for faith-based approaches to create safer prisons and communities, and to do so in a cost-effective 49 manner. Thus, it would seem to make sense to p ay more attention to faith -based approaches like the one examined here, and to promote them as potential aids for the common good. The sheer pervasiveness of religious programs within correctional institutions provides an opportunity to better utilize po sitive criminology approaches. In addition, trauma healing programs provide a platform and ready -made environment to make treatment more accessible to offenders in various kinds of correctional facilities. Religious activities could easily be expanded to allow inmates time and instruction for completing trauma -healing prog rams . Faith -based activities in prisons and other correctional facilities are very popular. For example, beyond work, education, or vocational training, religious activities attract more participants than any other personal enhancement program s offered i nside prison s.118 These programs foster increased spirituality that is linked to greater personal change when combined with service. For those people who do end up incarcerated, there is hope. Community volunteers , like th ose involved with Good News Jail & Prison Ministry , are value added for correctional entities because they provide a host of services (e.g., mentoring, literacy, life -skills, etc.) , and research has shown that these volunteers are helpful in reducing recidivism.119 For example, groups like Prison Fellowship, Kairos, Alpha, Salvation Army, Alcoholics Anonymous, Delancey Street, and many others, provide a low-cost, low -intensity pathway to such service (and other spiritual virtues) and could provide the institutional infrastructure that is needed to support a theoretically coherent set of evidence -based policies consistent with a positive criminology approach. Additionally, it is important to note that faith -based communities already provide the bulk of community volun teers working with offenders within correctional facilities.120 50 Appendix A: Methodology I. Research Design To address the research questions, a longitudinal panel survey was conducted with inmates housed at the Riverside Regional Jail, North Prince George, VA, where American Bible Society's Correct ional T rauma Healing Program was run. The program was offered throughout the facility on a rotating basis ensuring that inmates of every security classification level (i.e., minimum, medium, and maximum) and all h ousing units (each of which consists of five \"Pods\" with a capacity of 60 to 90 inmates each) had access to the program. Two healing groups were offered (monthly on average) , one for females and another for males . These were held in the second and fourth w eek of each month, respectively. About a week before the start of a group, a Pod was chosen for that month's healing group. A flyer was posted at the Pod prior to a recruitment day when a verbal announcement was made inviting interested inmates to attend a presentation explaining the program and how they could benefit from it. After the presentation, questions were answered, and inmates expressing interest were given an application/commitment form. Applicants were screened, and, on average, 12 inmates were chosen to participate with two to four alternates. About three days before a group start ed, the chosen inmates and alternates were asked to not only confirm their acceptance into the program , but were also given an opportunity to participate in survey res earch. Those who agreed to participate were asked to sign a consent form and complete a pretest survey at that time. The healing group began on Sunday or Monday and ran for five consecutive days , two -hour sessions each day . A posttest survey was administer ed to the participants two to three days after the end of the program, and two follow -up surveys were conducted approximately one and three months after the program ended. The recruitment for the treatment group survey began in September 2018 and ended in February 2020. During the 18 -month period, a total of 22 healing groups of 210 inmates (10 male and 12 female groups of 106 and104 inmates, respectively) participated in the pretest, and 178 (84.8%) of them (95 males and 83 females) completed the posttest. The total number of inmates who participated in the first and second follow -up surveys were 118 (64 males and 54 females) and 70 (40 males and 30 females), respectively. A control group was created based on random sampling of 240 inmates (120 males and 12 0 females) who had not participated in the trauma healing program. Initially , four of 12 male Pods were randomly selected, and then a random sample of 120 individuals from a list of 345 male inmates housed at the four Pods (i.e., 30 inmates per Pod) were selected . For females, 120 inmates were randomly selected from a list of 199 housed at all three female Pods. Control group survey s were conducted twice : a \"pretest\" o n February 19 and 20, 2020 and a \"posttest\" about two weeks later on March 19. More than half of each sample (72 males and 67 females, 60.0% and 55.8% of 120, respectively) participated in the pretest, resulting in a control group of 139 inmates ; 110 participants (79.1%, 59 males and 51 females) returned to complete the posttest. In sum, the total sample consist ed of 349 inmates (178 males and 171 females). 51 J. Sample Profile Table A1 presents descriptive statistics for sociodemographic, criminal justice -relate d, and trauma exposure background variables for the total sample ( n = 349) at the pretest: that is, frequency and percentage distributions for categorical (i.e., nominal level) variables and number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and ma ximum for non -categorical (i.e., ordinal or higher level) variables. The average age of study participants was about 38 (37.57), ranging from 18 to 65, and the sample was 52.0% male and 48.0% white , with everyone else being black. Almost eight out of 10 participants (79.2%) were single (15.0% married, 4.6% divorced, and 1.3% widowed), and seven out of 10 (71.8%) identified as Christian (61.2% Protestant and 10.6% Catholic) , with 13 % being adherents of non -Christian religion s (9.1% Islam, 1.2% Judaism, and 2.7% other religion). About 15 % of the sample said they had no religion. The study participants had been admitted to jail, on average, almost six (5.60) times (including the current commitment ), and two thirds (66.0%) of them were adjudicated, with one thi rd being pre-trial detainees. About two thirds (65.0%) of the sample were charged for technical violation of probation or parole conditions, and the percentage of inmates who had charges for violent, property, drug, and other offenses were 28, 36, 26, and 35%, respectively. A majority (62.9%) of the sample had a classification of \"minimum\" security with misdemeanor charges, whereas about one third (31.3%) had a security level of \"medium\" and about six percent (5.7%) were violent felony offenders with a \"max imum\" security level. Among various instruments of trauma exposure, the Brief Trauma Questionnaire (BTQ), a 10 - item self -report questionnaire derived from the Brief Trauma Interview, was employed. Each item concerns a different type of traumatic event, and exposure to an event is scored positive (i.e., 1) if a respondent says \"yes\" to life threat or serious injury for the event or whether it has ever happened to the respondent. Thus, a total sum of the items varies from 0 (no trauma exposure) to 10 (exposur e to all 10 events). A total of 300 participants (86.0% of the sample; not shown in the table) reported exposure to at least one traumatic event and, on average, three (3.41) events with their trauma exposure ranging from zero to nine. Among the 10 types o f traumatic event s, relatively high percentages of exposure were found for criminal victimization, whether direct (50.0%) or vicarious (60.0%), a close one's violent death (57.0%), and a serious accident (48.0%). Table A2 presents not only the descriptive statistics separately for the treatment and control group but also t-test results from comparing means between the groups. Although the two groups were not created using random assignment or propensity score matching, they were found to be similar in many background variables. For example, the treatment and control groups were not significantly different in terms of age (37.79 vs 36.71), sex (52.0% male in both groups), number of admissions to jail (5.81 vs. 5.27), types of offense (except violent offense), and security classification (2 = 5.26, d.f. = 2, p > .05; not presented in the table). Interestingly, inmates who did not apply for the Correctional T rauma Healing Program were not significantly different in trauma exposure compared to those who did apply (3.36 vs. 3.45). 52 On the other hand, the treatment group inmates were more likely to be white (53.0% vs. 41.0%) and violent offenders (32.0% vs. 21.0%) , and less lik ely to be pre -trial detainee s (72.0% vs. 56.0%) than their control group counterparts. The treatment and control groups were also different in marital status and religious affiliation (2 = 8.31, d.f. = 3, p < .05 and 2 = 16.74, d.f. = 6, p < .05; not pre sented in the table): specifically, inmates who applied for the program were more likely to be married (19.1% vs. 6.0%) as opposed to single (72.8% vs. 86.7%) and to have religion, particularly, Christian religion (79.0% vs. 61.4%) as opposed to no religio n (9.7% vs. 23.0%). K. Measurement The survey included items to measure various concepts (mostly using multi -item scale s), whereas information about sociodemographic and criminal justice -related backgrounds came from official data provided by the Riverside Re gional Jail. The following three groups of concepts/variables were included in the analysis : 1. Exogenous variables (sociodemographic , criminal justice -related, and trauma exposure backgrounds ): age, sex, race, marital status, religious affiliation, number of admissions to jail (including the current incarceration), whether inmate was a pretrial detainee or sentenced, security classification (minimum, medium, maximum), types of offenses charged (violent, property, drug, and other offenses ), and technical violation of probation or parole conditions . 2. Mediating or explanatory endogenous variables (anticipated outcomes of the Correctional Trauma Healing Program ): forgiveness, vengefulness, compassion, resilience, reasons for living, religiosi ty, images of God (perceived God's judgment and engagement), blaming God for trauma exposure, God's forgiveness, God's purpose in life, lament in prayer, perceived social support from family and friends, a sense of meaning in life, gratitude to God, experi ence of spiritual transformation, positive beliefs about the Bible, frequency of Bible interaction , and Bible impact . 3. Ultimate endogenous variables (negative consequences of trauma exposure ): post - traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), complicated grief, negat ive emotional states ( depressed mood , depressed malaise , and anger), suicidal ideation, and intended aggression . To construct scales, validity and reliability of items were examined based on exploratory factor analys es (EFA) and inter -item reliability scores before combining items into composite measure s by averaging or summing them. Table A3 summarizes results from EFA and reliability analys es of items used for scale construction, which show that factor loadings and Cronbach's alpha s () of most scale items were higher than .500 and .700, respectively, in at least one of four surveys. In sum, created scales generally have good to excellent measurement quality. The measurement of a key concept, post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) , requires an explanation because it was measured in several ways using the Short PTSD Rating Interview 53 (SPRINT). The SPRINT is an 8 -item self -report assessment of the core symptoms of PTSD, rated on a 5 -point scale (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = moderately, 3 = quite a lot, 4 = very much) . The sum of the eight items, called \"SPRINT,\" ranges from 0 to 32. Since a cutoff score of 14 was suggested to determine whether an individual was screened positive (i.e., 14 or higher), a dummy variable (1 = PTSD positive, 0 = PTSD negative) was also created as an alternative measure of post -traumatic stress disorder. In addition, because one of the eight items (\"To what extent have you lost enjoyment for things , kept your distance from people , or found it difficult to exp erience feelings ?\"; emphasis added) asked about three specific symptoms of PTSD (i.e., was a triple -barreled question), it was split into three items for a 10 -item version of SPRINT. The 10 items were summed for an alternative total score, called \"PTSD,\" w hich ranges from 0 to 40. Using the cutoff of 17.5 (= 14 x 40/32), an alternative measure of PTSD positive was also created (i.e., PTSD positive if 18 or higher). Based on scores on the original SPRINT, 72.0% of the sample (77% of the treatment group and 65% of the control group) were screened PTSD positive at the pretest, whereas, using its modified version, the percentage was a bit smaller (69%; 73% in the treatment group and 63%in the control group). Regardless of which version was used, the treatment gr oup inmates were more likely to be screened PTSD positive than the control group inmates, although they were not significantly different in the number of traumatic events they experienced. L. Data Analysis Different statistical methods were employed to addres s the four research questions. First, a series of two -way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) w ere conducted to examine whether the Correctional T rauma Healing Program worked by comparing the pretest and posttest averages of endogenous variable s (i.e., the program outcomes and negative consequences of trauma exposure) between the treatment and control groups. For this analysis, SPSS (Version 25) was used. Second, to answer the question of how the program healed trauma victims, path analysis was conducted to test whether the mediating endogenous variables (i.e., the program's anticipated outcomes) explain ed observed differences in the average of ultimate endogenous variables (i.e., negative consequences of trauma exposure) between the treatment an d control groups. The mediation of the program's effect on negative consequences of trauma exposure was estimated separately for each program outcome, controlling for sociodemographic and criminal justice - related background variables. For this analysis, Mp lus (Version 8) was used. Third, a series of one -way repeated measures ANOVA w ere conducted to see whether the program's impact lasted across the four surveys . Specifically, whether the longitudinal pattern of changes in the endogenous variables were signi ficant. SPSS was used for this analysis. Finally, to test whether changes in negative consequences of trauma across the four surveys were attributable to those in the program's outcomes, random -effects models were estimated for the 54 within -individual effec ts of the explanatory endogenous variables on the ultimate endogenous variables. For this analysis, Stata (Version 15) was employed. 55 10. Table A1.

Thank you very much for your participation. 84 Appendix C : Two-Way Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Table C1 summarizes results from two -way repeated measures ANOVA conducted for each endogenous variable. It was \"two -way\" because there were t wo \"factors\" or sources of difference in the average of each variable: one was time (i.e., between the pretest and posttest), and the other was group membership (i.e., treatment versus control group). The analysis test ed (1) whether there was a significant change in the average between the pretest and posttest and (2) whether the change over time differed between the treatment and control groups. Table C1 shows the control and treatment group's average of each variable at the pretest and posttest along with the number of observations (i.e., inmates) included in the calculation of group means (see the \" n\" column). The decimals in parenthesis below the group averages are p-values associated with independent -samples t-tests conducted to see whether the averages were significantly different between the control and treatment groups at the pretest and posttest. On the other hand, the decimals in the \"Paired T -test\" column are p-values associated with paired - samples t-tests conducted to examine whether each group's pretest and posttest averages were significantly different, that is, whether the group average significantly changed between the pretest and posttest. In both t-tests, p-value s smaller than the significance level () of .05 indicates a significant differen ce in the average. The last two columns of \"Tests of Within -Subjects Effects\" show whether there was an overall significant difference between the averages at the pretest and posttest (see the \"Time\" column) and whether there was a significant group differ ence in the overall change in the average (see the \"Time x Group\" column).121 Each column presents an F value (its degrees of freedom in parenthes es) associated with each test of within -individual effects . Below the F value is a partial eta-squared ( 2) that indicates effect size ( R2 in multiple regression). A general rule of thumb on magnitudes of effect sizes is: .01 (small), .06 (medium), and .14 (large).122 More importantly, p- value s show whether there was a significant change over time and whether the change significantly differed between the control and treatment groups. For example, the average PTSD of the control group ( n = 110) w as 19.709 at the pretest and 18.691 at the posttest, whereas for the treatment group ( n = 177) they were 22.446 and 14.791. Independent -samples t-tests show ed that the groups were significantly different in the average PTSD at both the pretest ( p = .016 < .05) and posttest ( p =.000 < .05), whereas paired -samples t- tests indicate d the treatme nt group's average significantly changed, decreasing from 22.446 to 14.791 between the pretest and posttest, though the observed change in the control group's average (i.e., 1.018 = 19.709 - 18.691) was not statistically significant. Finally, according to the last two columns, there was an overall significant change in the group average between the pretest and posttest ( F[1,285] = 60.520, p = .000 < .05) , and the change over time significantly differed between the control and treatment groups ( F[1,285] = 35 .438, p = .000 < .05). This finding provides evidence that the observed group difference in the change of average PTSD between the pretest and posttest was significant: that is, the average PTSD significantly decreased between the pretest and posttest in the treatment group, but the average did not significantly change in the control group (see Figure 1). 85 13.

negative consequences of trauma after program participation (i.e., between the pretest and posttest) is attributable to the program's pr imary and secondary outcomes. To answer this question, a path mode l shown in Figure D1 was estimated separately for 20 program outcomes (12 primary and 8 secondary outcomes) and five trauma consequences (i.e., a total of 100 SEMs) to test whether the outco me mediates the effect of program participation on the negative consequence. If the mediated effect of the program via primary or secondary outcome is significant, it can be concluded that the outcome contributed to the reduction in the negative consequenc es of trauma. Specifically, program outcome and trauma consequence measured at the pretest , as well as sociodemographic and criminal justice -related background variables and trauma exposure , were controlled in the model so the effect of Correctional T rauma Healing Program participation on a program outcome and trauma consequence s (measured at th e posttest ) can be interpreted as causal influence s. Since the mediational model included ordered categorical (e.g., security classification and most outcomes of the program) and continuous variables (e.g., age, religiosity, and PTSD), maximum likelihood e stimation with robust standard error s (MLR) was used for model estimation. Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) was employed to treat missing data, which tends to produce unbiased estimates, like multiple imputations. Since the direction of relations hips among the program participation, mediator, and negative consequence of trauma were predicted, one -tailed as well as two -tailed test s ( = .05) w ere conducted to determine the statistical significance of estimates. 91 Results from estimating the 100 mode ls are summarized in Table D1 (which presents standardized coefficients). Although the background variables were controlled in each model, the table shows only the key findings (complete results are available upon request) .: That is : (1) the direct effects of the Correctional T rauma Healing Program on a mediator and a negative consequence of trauma (coefficients a and b); (2) the direct effect of the mediator on the negative consequence of trauma (coefficient c); and (3) the indirect effect of the program on the trauma consequence via the mediator ( a x b). To illustrate how to interpret coefficients presented in the table , let us focus on the first two sets of results for post -traumatic stress disorder (in the upper -left corner of table). They show that program participation significantly increased forgiveness among participating inmates (.139), which in turn decreased their PTSD (.174) . The program also helped reduce vengefulness (.141) , which is likely to increase PTSD (.268). The indirect effects of the program on PTSD via forgiveness and vengefulness were both statistically significant (.024 and .038, respectively). In sum, the program reduced PTSD in part by enhancing the inmates' forgiving attitudes toward a person who caused a traumatic event they experienced in the past and by decreasing their vengefulness toward the person. The remaining direct effects of the Correctional Trauma Healing Program (.254 and .240) indicate d that there are other factors that contributed to the program's reduction in PTSD as well . 92 14.

It was \"one -way\" because there was one \"factor\" or source of difference in the average of variable: time. That is, the analysis test ed whether there was a significant change in the average across the four surveys administered to the treatment gr oup: the pretest (Time 1), posttest (Time 2), first follow -up (Time 3), and second follow -up (Time 4). The table first shows the average of each variable at each survey along with the number of observations (i.e., inmates) included in the calculation of gr oup means (see the \" n\" column). The decimals in parenthesis below the group averages are p-values associated with paired -samples t- tests conducted to see whether the averages were significantly different between two of the four time points: Time 1 vs. 2, T ime 1 vs. 3, Time 1 vs. 4, Time 2 vs. 3, Time 2 vs. .4, and Time 3 vs. 4. For example, a total of 60 inmates participated in all four surveys, and their average PTSD was found to be 24.333, 14.950, 15.083, and 15.233 at Times 1, 2, 3, and 4. Among the six comparisons of two repeated measures, three were significant ( p < .05): Time 1 vs. 2, Time 1 vs. 3, and Time 1 vs. 4 (all p = .000). That is, the averages at the posttest and two follow -ups (14.950, 15.083, and 15.233) were significantly different, that i s, smaller from their pretest counterpart (24.333) although they were not different among themselves. In other words, average PTSD significantly reduced between the pretest and posttest and remained low at the two follow - ups, indicating the reduced PTSD di d not go back to where it was at the pretest. The next two columns present results from testing the \"sphericity\" assumption that the variances of the differences between all combinations of repeated measures are equal (sphericity is the necessary and suffi cient condition for valid inference pertaining to the standard repeated measures ANOVA). The assumption can be evaluated using the Greenhouse -Geiser epsilon ( ) and/or Mauchly's test. The epsilon being 1 means that sphericity is met, whereas values smaller than 1 indicate departure from sphericity. If Mauchly's test is significant ( p < .05), sphericity is not assumed to be met. A general rule of thumb is: if the Greenhouse -Geiser is smaller than .75, then use the Greenhouse -Geiser test of within -subjects effects; otherwise (i.e., .75 < < 1), use the Huynh -Feldt test for a conservative test of within -subjects effects. Thus, depending on the size of , the last column, \"Tests of Within -Subjects Effects,\" show s either Greenhouse - Geiser test or Huynh -Feldt t est. Effect size and partial eta -squared ( 2) are also shown in that column . A general rule of thumb on magnitudes of effect sizes is: .01 (small), .06 (medium), and .14 (large). For example, for PTSD the Mauchly's test showed the sphericity assumption was met ( p = .120 > .05), and, using the Hyunh -Feldt test given Greenhouse -Geiser (.911) , that it fell between .75 and 1, the differences in the average PTSD across four time points were determined to be significant. That is, the observed pattern of average PTSD decreasing after the program and 97 remaining low afterwards was statistically significant, and the program's effect size was \"large,\" being larger than the cutoff of .14. 98 15.

For example, did PTSD increase or decrease when forgiveness increased or decreased? Or did it increase or decrease when vengefulness changed ? These changes in the trauma consequences and program outcomes across the four waves are \"within -individual\" changes as they r epresent changes in those attributes for individuals across the waves (i.e., how each individual's attributes vary over time), whereas differences between the treatment and control groups are \"between -individual\" differentials as they refer to differences between the two groups of individuals. To examine the effects of within -individual changes in program outcomes on within -individual changes in trauma consequences, a modified version of random -effects models was employed. This approach is more appropriate than conventional OLS regression models when the variables are measured repeatedly from the same individuals over time, and the primary goal is to estimate unbiased parameters of the relationship s between time -varying predictors and an outcome variable. This study's four -wave panel data enable us to decompose the sources of variation in the time - varying predictors into between - and within -individual levels. The between -individual components are generated by taking the average of predictor scores across the waves for each individual, whereas the within -individual components are the deviations of predictor scores from the individual -specific averages at each wave. The sources of error terms can also be decomposed into between - and within -individual levels, and the systematic variation in time - stable sources of unobserved heterogeneity can be explicitly controlled in the estimation of within -individual effects of time -varying predictors. This decomposition makes one of the implicit but unverifiable assumptions o f regression -based models unnecessary. In addition, unlike conventional fixed -effects models, this alternative modeling strategy allows for the estimation of between -individual effects of both time -varying and time -stable predictors as well as cross -level interactions between within -individual and between -individual effects of predictors (e.g., testing whether the within -individual effect of forgiveness on PTSD differs between males and females). Table F1 presents baseline models, which included only time -trend variables (wave and wave - squared) capturing the curve, which was a concave upward pattern of change in the trauma consequences and one time -varying control (time) between surveys (time interval). The results show that PTSD, complicated grief, negative emotional states, and, to a lesser extent, suicidal ideation and intended aggression , significantly declined during the study period, following a non - linear functional form with upward curvature (2.198, .253, .198, .056, and .084). When sociodemographic a nd criminal justice -related background controls were added to the baseline model, the time -trend variables, particularly wave -squared , remained significant in all 107 models (see Table F2). This finding indicates that the control variables had limited impact o n those models. In fact, only background variables had significant effects on negative consequences of trauma exposure. One was being charged for a drug offense, which was inversely related to suicidal ideation: that is, drug offenders tended to report low er levels of suicidality than violent offenders. The other was trauma exposure positively associated with PTSD and complicated grief: that is, the more traumatic events experienced, the higher the score on PTSD and complicated grief. Next, Table F3 summari zes results from estimating the within - and between -individual effects of the program outcomes on trauma consequences, analyzing one outcome at a time while controlling for sociodemographic and criminal justice -related background variables (not shown in the table). For example, the within -individual effect of forgiveness on PTSD was significant in the negative direction (1.609), which means that a change in forgiveness between waves was inversely related to a change in PTSD . Specifically, one unit increase in forgiveness was related to 1.609 decrease in PTSD. Putting this result together with the earlier finding that the program enhanced forgiving attitudes toward a person who caused a traumatic event among participating inmates, it was found that forgiveness had a negative causal effect on PTSD over time. Within -individual effects of outcomes on trauma consequences are directly relevant to answering the last research question. On the other hand, the between -individual effect of forgiveness on PTSD was also significant in the negative direction (2.709), showing that the average of forgiveness across the four waves was inversely associated with that of PTSD: that is, the higher the level of forgiveness, the lower the score on PTSD . 108 16.

Johnson is Distinguished Professor of the Social Sciences at Baylor University and the founding director of the Baylor Institute for Studies of Religion (ISR). He is also a Faculty Scholar in the Center for Spirituality, Theology, and Health at Duke Unive rsity, Senior Fellow with the Witherspoon Institute (Princeton), Senior Fellow at the Sagamore Institute (Indianapolis), and a Senior Advisor at the Religious Freedom Institute (Washington, DC). Before joining the faculty at Baylor University, Johnson dire cted research centers at Vanderbilt University and the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Johnson is a former member of the Coordinating Council for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (Presidential Appointment). He has been the principal invest igator on grants from private foundations as well as the Department of Justice, Department of Labor, Department of Defense, National Institutes of Health, and the United States Institute for Peace. He is the author of more than 200 journal articles, monogr aphs, and books. He is recognized as a leading authority on the scientific study of religion, the efficacy of faith -based organizations, and criminal justice. Recent publications have examined the impact of faith -based programs on offender treatment, drug addiction, recidivism reduction , and prisoner reentry. His most recent books include The Angola Prison Seminary (2016), The Quest for Purpose (2017), The Resilience of Religion (2021), and Restorative Prisons: Peer Ministry and Prosocial Corrections . Dr. Sung Joon Jang is Research Professor of Criminology and co -director of the Program on Prosocial Behavior at ISR. Jang is quantitative criminologist and one of the leading researchers of general strain theory . His research focuses on the effects of religion and spirituality as well as family, school, and peers on crime and delinquency. Jang has published in a diverse group of social scientific journals including sociology (e.g., American Sociological Review and The Sociological Quarterly ), criminology ( e.g., Criminology , Journal of Quantitative Criminology , and Justice Quarterly ), psychology ( e.g., Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology ), and social work. He is a coauthor of two books, The Angola Prison Se minary (2016) and Restorative Prisons (2021). Jang is the founding President of the Korean Society of Criminology in America and has been active in many capacities in the American Society of Criminology. Jang is currently conducting a series of studies on the rehabilitative effects of faith -based programs on prisoners in Colombia and South Africa as well as in the United States . Dr. Matt Bradshaw is Research Professor of Sociology at ISR. Dr. Bradshaw's research examines health and well -being from two diff erent perspectives. The first focuses on the association between religion and health. His published research in this area shows that religious practices and beliefs (e.g., service attendance, prayer, a perceived attachment to God) provide social and psycho logical resources that promote health and well -being, in part by helping individuals cope with stressful conditions. This work has been published in leading journals including: Social Science & Medicine , Research on Aging , Journal of Aging and Health , The Gerontologist , Sociology of Religion , and the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion , to name just a few. Dr. Bradshaw's second research agenda examines the role of early -life social conditions (e.g., religion, childhood SES, parent -child relations, peer influences) in shaping trajectories of health that span adolescence and adulthood. Th is work has appeared in Health Psychology , Youth & Society , and the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction , 117 among others. Overall, his research is interdisciplinary in nature, and is helping to identify social and behavioral factors that can be targeted by healthcare professionals and policymakers to improve individual lives and promote population health. 118 About the Institute for Studies of Religion Launched in August 2004, the Baylor Institute for Studies of Religion (ISR) exists t o initiate, support, and conduct research on religion, involving scholars and projects spanning the intellectual spectrum: history, psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology, political science, philosophy, epidemiology, theology, and religious studies . Our mandate extends to all religions, everywhere, and throughout history. It also embraces the study of religious effects on such things as prosocial behavior, family life, population health, economic development, and social conflict. While always strivi ng for appropriate scientific objectivity, our scholars treat religion with the respect that sacred matters require and deserve. 119 About American Bible Society The mission of American Bible Society is to make the Bible available to every person in a language and format each can understand and afford, so all people may experience its life - chan ging message. ABS took on the role of stewarding the Trauma Healing Institute in 2011 as the trauma healing program and use of Healing the Wounds of Trauma : How the C hurch Can Help gained traction among churches and organizations. THI's unique method of trauma healing unites proven mental health practices and engagement with God through the Bible. THI equips churches and partner organizations, like Good News Jail & Prison Ministry, to use this method in their own ministries and supports the spread of the method around the world, wherever hearts are wounded. Healing the Wounded Heart , ABS 's contextualization for those in correctional ministry, contains a set of practical lessons that lead incarcerated people and those transitioning back to their communities, on a journey of healing.

Collected for the past 15 years, the research is the most comprehensive data on American volunteering ever assembled, and it includes a volunteer data profile for all states and major metropolitan areas. The complete report can be accessed at VolunteeringInAmerica.gov . The data for the report were collected through a supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS): the Civic Engagement and Volunteering Supplement. The CPS is a monthly survey of about 60,000 households (approximately 100,000 a dults), conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on behalf of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The selected supplements collect data on the volunteering, voting, and civic activities of adults age 16 and older. Volunteers are considered individuals who performed unpaid volunteer activities through or for an organization at any point during the 12 -month period (from September 1st of the prior year through the survey week in September of the survey year). 47 Hustinx, L., von Essen, J., Haers, J., and Mels, S.

Good News has developed several practical, life -giving programs that introduce inmates and s taff to Christ and help them grow in their knowledge of Him and His Word. Good News considers it a privilege to minister to serve 300,000 incarcerated men, women and youth daily in 22 states and 25 countries worldwide and more countries being added yearly. Our chaplains share the love of Christ to these inmates and staff, while facilitating the ministry of thousands of volunteers, too. \" 54 American Bible Society is a United States -based Bible society which for more than 200 years has been publishing and distributing translations of the Protestant Christian version of the Bible and provides study aids and other tools to help people engage with it. American Bible Society pioneered the Bible -based trauma healing program, a ministry equipping churches to help hurting people reconnect with God through Scripture. Communities around the world live crushed by emotional shock and pain. Refugees, abandoned children, victims of domestic violence, and so many others feel separated from God. 55 Interview with volunt eers took place at the Riverside Regional Jail, in Prince George County, Virginia, on January 14, 2020. 56 Merino, S.

Social capital is a measure of the value of resources, both tangible (e.g., public spaces, private property) and intangible (e.g., actors, human capital, people), and the imp act that these relationships have on the resources involved in each relationship, and on larger groups. It is generally seen as a form of capital that produces public goods for a common purpose. Social capital has been used to explain the improved performa nce of diverse groups, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, superior managerial performance, enhanced supply chain relations, the value derived from strategic alliances, and the evolution of communities. 62 Putnam, R.

Its focus is limited to antisocial behavior, with almost no attention ever given to prosocial activities. That is, criminologists ask wh y people do, or do not, commit crimes; they rarely ask why people do, or do not do, good deeds. The Program on Prosocial Behavior emphasizes the neglected \"half\" of human behavior. For example, why do so many people generously give money to help those in n eed? Or, why do most of the people reared in 'bad' neighborhoods turn out not only to be law -abiding but to be good citizens? Indeed, how are people transformed from antisocial patterns of behavior to positive patterns? In keeping with the overall mission of ISR, the role of religion in promoting prosocial behavior will be the central concern. Not only the role of religiousness in guiding individual behavior but the role of faith -based groups and organizations in fostering prosocial activities. https://www.baylorisr.org/programs -research/program -on-prosocial -behavior/ 69 Stark, R.

(2008). \"The Descriptive Epidemiology of Commonly Occurring Mental Disorders in the United States.\" Annual Review of Public Health 29:115 -129. 106 Specifically, t he p-value associated with the (time x group) interaction effect wa s slightly larger than the significance level (p = .055 > .05 ; see Table C1) 107 Since the five items of religiosity were standardized (i.e., converted into z score) before summing them, religiosity ranged from -10.29 to 5.53 in the treatment group and from -10.86 to 5.53 in the control group. The control group's average was negative as it was below the overall average, zero. 126 108 The treatment and control groups did not differ in the perceived closeness to God at the pretest (3.74 and 3.52), but the average sign ificantly increased in both groups (3.97 and 3.70) with the treatment group's average being significantly higher than the control group's at the posttest. The treatment group was more religious in terms of all three measures of objective religiosity at the pretest and remained so at the posttest (see Table C1). 109 It is important to note that these findings cannot firmly establish causal ordering among these variables. The interpretation of the results described above is feasible, but alternative interpretat ions are possible as well. For example, one potential causal order (the one implied here) flows from the CTHP to the primary and secondary outcomes (e.g., forgiveness, resilience, etc.), and then eventually to PTSD, complicated grief, negative emotional states, suicidal ideation, and intended aggression. This causal ordering is what was assumed here. However, it is also possible that the CTHP shapes the negative consequences of trauma, which are subsequently linked with the primary and secondary outcomes. T he findings summarized under Research Question #4 below provide additional information, but further research will be required to fully address this issue. 110 Although this finding may come across as inconsistent with the earlier finding of a significant difference between the pretest and posttest average of suicidal ideation and intended aggression among the treatment group inmates (see Section VI -A), it is not necessarily so since the difference is attributable to different sample size. That is, the comparisons between the pretest and posttest averages of suicidal ideation and intended aggression were based on a larger number of participating inmates ( n = 175 and 157, respectively), thereby increasing its statistical power, compared to the pre sent analysis ( n = 60 and 50). 111 The average difference between Times 3 and 4 (3.22 vs. 3.47) was found statistically not significant ( p = .569). 112 As noted above for Research Question #2, we could not fully establish causal ordering among these variables. However, reversed causation and even reciprocal relationships are possible between the primary/secondary outcomes and the negative consequences of trauma. Thus, additional research should attempt to replicate and extend these findings. 113 While we assumed that the CTHP generated first the anticipated program outcomes, which in turn reduced the negative consequences of trauma, it could have been the other way around: that is, the program could have first reduced the trauma consequences, which then increased or decreased the program outcomes. We could not determine which occurred first because the program outcomes and the negative consequences were measured at the same time (i.e., posttest). It would have enabled us to establish causal relationship between the program outcomes and the consequences of trauma if one or more surveys were conducted after the posttest. 114 Even though these results cannot firmly establish causal relationships among these variables, they do strongly suggest that such relationships may exist. 115 Ronel N. & Elisha , E.
