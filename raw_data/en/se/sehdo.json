Click here to learn more about our experience.", "sitename": "emmes.com", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Vaccine Trials and Infectious Diseases As clinical researchers, we are sometimes faced with conditions that cause us to change the ways we typically conduct clinical trials. A viral pandemic is such a condition \u2014 one in which time can be measured in human lives. Conducting infectious diseases research during global pandemics requires us to innovate and meet accelerated timelines for testing vaccine efficacy while assuring all study objectives are met. COVID-19 proved to be no exception. Faced with such requirements, Emmes' expertise in infectious disease enabled study launch in less than 4 days from protocol receipt. Today, the scientific community is accessing the study data as the race to find vaccines and treatments continues. Emmes possesses a broad range of therapeutic area expertise in vaccines and infectious diseases that we tailor to your needs. Our infectious disease team has worked on studies on nearly every major health crisis since the 1980s, including HIV, Zika, Ebola, H1NI, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. We've also helped clients on trials involving influenza, encephalitis, malaria, pneumonia, yellow fever, Avian flu and other diseases. As a CRO, Emmes takes great pride in our work to improve human health; and we seek collaborations with others who feel the same way. Clinical Research Experience Our experience becomes your experience. Since Emmes sits at the intersection of the private and public healthcare sectors, we bring a unique skill set and perspective to your clinical vaccine research. In addition to helping biopharmaceutical companies and disease-based foundations develop therapies, Emmes has conducted over 200 vaccines clinical trials and epidemiological studies for The National Institutes of Health and other government agencies. We are fortunate to be in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) for several decades. This relationship has afforded Emmes an opportunity to learn about the unique scientific, logistical and operational aspects of managing vaccine and infectious disease studies worldwide. We also learn from our clients across biopharmaceutical firms, foundations, universities and government agencies outside of NIH. And we pass our learnings on to others. That is part of the collaborative and problem-solving customer experience Emmes promises to deliver to you. We realize that it takes all of us together to advance human health and protect people around the world from the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases. Phase I-IV Clinical Research Expertise Are your vaccine trials global, complex, rare disease-related or in other ways logistically challenging? Emmes can help. Through our involvement in epidemics and rare tropical diseases, Emmes has formed invaluable relationships with healthcare organizations and professionals to support your Phase I-IV studies across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Our tools are your tools, including Emmes' specialized skill set in getting clinical trials quickly up and running. Reducing time to study start is particularly important when testing a therapy in urgent need, as was the case in studies Emmes conducted involving the Zika virus, COVID-19 and Influenza. Biostatistics Since our founding in 1977 by a biostatistician, Emmes has been known as a \"statistics-driven\" CRO. Our expert [biostatisticians](../biostatistics) can help you with protocol writing, study design, randomization and subject blinding, data collection and analysis, reporting and regulatory submissions (in collaboration with our regulatory team). If your infectious disease or vaccines study requires sophisticated analysis of genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and other \"omics\" data analysis, you may wish to employ Emmes' [biomedical data science & bioinformatics](../bioinformatics) experts who can deliver a variety of solutions for you, including machine learning and other big-data analysis tools. [Contact Us](../connect_with_us) Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Leaders At Emmes, we value the open exchange of communication between our therapeutic area leaders and your team. We encourage you to contact us to discuss your research plan and determine how we can support your development pathway.
