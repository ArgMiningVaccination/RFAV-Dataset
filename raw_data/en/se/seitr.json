IVMP for 3 days was also shown to significantly delay the development of MS within the first two years. High Dose Oral Prednisone A 1250 mg dose of oral prednisone has a bioavailability equal to 1 g IVMP ( [Morrow et al, 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15452302)). Several studies have found high dose intravenous and high dose oral glucorticosteroids to be equally efficacous in accelarting recovery from relapses [(Liu et al., 2017)](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezp.welch.jhmi.edu/pubmed/29176905). However, the lower cost of oral prednisone may be a consideration. Intramuscular adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) ACTH is [FDA-approved](https://www.acthar.com/pdf/Acthar-PI.pdf) and available for the treatment of exacerbations of MS in adults. Although ACTH has been shown to be as effective as IVMP in managing relapses ( [Kalinsik [Milanese et al., 1989](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=milanese%20AND%20ACTH%20AND%201989); [ Barnes et al., 1985](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=barnes%20AND%20ACTH%20AND%201985)), it is prescribed much less often because of its high cost. Plasmapheresis In 2011, the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommended plasmapheresis as a second-line treatment for steroid-resistant exacerbations in (IVIG) IVIG may be considered for relapses during pregnancy (during which time steroids should be avoided if possible), and it may reduce the risk of post partum relapses ( [Hellwig et al., 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21180639); [Achiron IVIG is sometimes used to relapses that don't respond to corticosteroids ( [Thrower, 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19131851)), although the supportive evidence is limited. During [pregnancy](/For-Professionals/Physicians/Managing-MS/Psychosocial-Support/Reproductive-Issues), relapses severe enough to warrant treatment can be safely managed with a short course of corticosteroids after the first trimester. Methylprednisolone is the preferred drug because it is metabolized before crossing the placenta ( [Ferrero et al., 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15223156)). IVIG is safe for use during pregnancy and may provide some benefit ( [Ferrero et "}
