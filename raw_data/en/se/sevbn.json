But thyme also boasts a slew of helpful medicinal qualities. Thyme's benefits include: - fighting acne - lowering blood pressure - helping to alleviate cough - boosting immunity - disinfecting - repelling pests - aromatherapy - boosting mood - culinary uses - preventing bacterial infections - helping to treat yeast infections - possibly helping against certain types of cancer Want to learn more about how this humble spice does so much?

Thyme is known for its antibacterial properties, and it might have a future as an acne-fighting ingredient. When thyme is steeped in alcohol for days or weeks, it turns into a solution known as a [tincture](/health/what-is-a-tincture). In an older [2010 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6263286/) Thymus linearis Benth. is a species of thyme found in Pakistan and Afghanistan. A [2014 study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272894) Still, we need human studies to confirm these effects. Thyme essential oil, which is obtained from its leaves, is often used as a natural cough remedy. In one [older 2006 study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17063641) A [2018 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1094553918300609) found a combination of thyme and primula extracts to reduce inflammation and mucous in an animal model. Next time you're faced with a cough or sore throat, try drinking some thyme tea. Getting all the vitamins your body needs every day can be challenging. Luckily, the [U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/173470/nutrients) - vitamin A - vitamin C - copper - fiber - iron - manganese However, thyme isn't a great source of these nutrients unless you consume it in excessive quantities.

Once you identify it, you'll want to take the necessary steps to get rid of it once and for all. In some cases, thyme oil may be the answer. A [2017 study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316529367_Using_of_endophytic_Saccharomycopsis_fibuligera_and_thyme_oil_for_management_of_gray_mold_rot_of_guava_fruits) showed that thyme may be effective at controlling gray mold rot in guava fruit. These effects may translate to mold in the home as well. An [older 2007 study](https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02032.x) Still, if you find significant mold in your home, it's best to hire a professional to remove it. The [Environmental Protection Agency](https://archive.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/web/pdf/3143fact.pdf) says that thymol, a kind of thyme oil, is also an ingredient in many pesticides \u2014 both outdoor and indoor \u2014 and is commonly used to target: - bacteria - viruses - rats - mice - other animal pests A [2021 study](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/psyche/2021/6684156/) showed thyme essential oil to be effective against adult mosquitoes and their larvae.

A [2013 in vitro study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1082013212442198) found that thyme oil showed potential as a natural preservative of food products against several common foodborne bacteria that cause human illness, even at low concentrations. In addition, a [2011 in vitro study](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?option1=tka&value1=Antibacterial+activity+of+thyme+and+lavender+essential+oils&pageSize=10&index=1) found thyme oil effective against resistant strains of [Staphylococcus](/health/mrsa), [Enterococcus](/health/enterococcus-faecalis), [Escherichia](/health/e-coli-infection), and [Pseudomonas](/health/pseudomonas-infections) bacteria. It's important to note that this doesn't mean that ingesting thyme oil will prevent you from getting food poisoning. Plus, if you were to take thyme supplements on a regular basis, you'd also likely be killing a lot of the [good bacteria](/nutrition/improve-gut-bacteria) in your gut. Thyme isn't just potentially effective against bacteria. It may pack some punch when it comes to fungus too.

Still, human research is needed to know whether ingesting thyme oil can treat Candida. A [2018 in vitro study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12210-018-0672-0) found both thyme and clove essential oils to inhibit breast cancer cell lines. A [2021 study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0972060X.2021.1973575) replicated these results. These studies only provide very weak evidence of a potential benefit of thyme for cancer, and human studies are needed to confirm any potential benefits. Thyme is a versatile herb with a broad wheelhouse of beneficial uses. Still, most of the research has been in lab or animal studies, so the scientific evidence to support these beneficial uses is fairly weak. Using thyme shouldn't replace medical care and treatment.
