In New York City, one of the most prominent hubs for cancer research and treatment, hospitals are simultaneously investing hundreds of mil-lions into new research facilities, labs and personalized medicine technology. Although it can feel uneasy to frame cancer in business linguistics, it can't go unsaid: Hospitals are making serious capital investments within their oncology service lines and they are ex-pecting good returns. Hometown Healthcare Isn't Dead: Why (Most) Smart Community Hospitals Can Still Thrive By Jim McLaughlin Community hospitals sit on fertile ground, some experts say, because while the latest iteration of value-focused healthcare has urban tertiary systems in a tizzy, the hospitals with the smallest patient populations have been practicing their version of the population health since their foundation. continued on page 10continued on page 8 2013's List of 100 Great Community Hospitals p. 16 San Antonio's Children's Hospital Boom: How Alamo City Competitors Are Battling for Pediatric Patients By Jim McLaughlin San Antonio is the seventh-largest U.S. city by population and second-largest in Texas. A year ago, it was one of the only large cities in the country without a free - standing children's hospital; New York City and San Jose, Calif., were the only larger cities without one. But, a flurry of activity from three major health systems has churned up three new plans for pe-diatric acute care \u2014 and is ramping up competition for those service lines. Already, many San Antonio hospitals include dedicated children's wings or buildings, such as Methodist Children's Hospital located on the Methodist Hos-pital campus.

The July issue of Becker's Hospital Review includes several sto - ries on community hospitals and the challenges and opportunities ahead for these organizations. With healthcare reform and continued consolida-tion, many have questioned the long-term viability of community hospi-tals. Others, however, argue they will always be a significant provider of healthcare services, either as focused standalone facilities or as spokes in a hub-and-spoke model of healthcare delivery. This issue also includes our annual list of \"100 Great Community Hospitals,\" a list of leading organi-zations focused on providing patients with top-quality care close to home. Also be sure to check out the issue's cover article: \"Hospitals, Insurers De - vote More Attention to the Cost of Cancer Care,\" which explores insurers' attempts to constrict costs in the once untouchable world of cancer care, as well as the content on hospital-physician relationships and accountable care organizations, hospital finance, and hospital and health system transactions.

Very truly yours, Scott Becker, Publisher Publisher's Letter July Issue; Becker's Hospital Review CEO Strategy Roundtable THE T RNAROUND EXPERTS \u00ae PROFITS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO PARTNERS IN AS FEW AS 90 DAYS SUCCESS IN THE SURGERY CENTER INDUSTRY ISN'T CLAIMED. IT'S EARNED. When many ASC companies were being formed 10 years ago, ASCOA was already delivering outstanding care to patients and the industry's best profit margins to its center partners.

For one thing, they have the ability to achieve low costs. \"Even if a small hospital's cost per discharge looks high, the problem may be in the numerator of volume, not the denominator of cost. The essential chassis delivers efficient throughput. Community hospitals have greater control over patient engagement, too, he says. \"They have always been closer to their patients, who are also their neighbors. Engaging patients is no great revelation to them. My brother-in-law's small-town surgeon stopped by the house after work \u2014 with a pizza \u2014 to see how he was recovering. The surgeon didn't need a con-sultant to tell him about patient engagement.\" Additionally, today's enhanced quality measure - ment tools can evaluate community hospitals on equal footing with tertiary hospitals, rather than in previous decades when hospital rankings were based on features like size, volume and even \"board members' social status,\" Mr. Lupica says. \"Now a small community hospital can surprise the whole region by coming out with great qual-ity scores and great HCAHPS scores [for patient satisfaction].\" Still, many speculate that standalone community hospitals will be overcome by the tide of merg-ers and operating agreements with large systems, Mr. Lupica says, even when they show healthy margins. \"People are pushing so hard on rural hospitals to merge. It's odd, actually, that this is the time people would say to take the jump [into a transaction], when there are so many tools that make issues like geographic isolation less rel-evant,\" he says. \"What a shame it would be for rural hospitals to reach their sunset, just as we've reached the sunrise of technology.\" Staying solo Not all hospitals want to, can or should remain independent, Mr. Lupica says, but if they do decide to merge, they should be picky when it comes to finding the right partner. \"You can say no a thousand times, but you only get to say yes once,\" he says. Mike Williams, president and CEO of Com- munity Hospital Corporation, a consulting and management firm for smaller market hospitals, says community hospitals overall are \"absolute - ly\" in healthy shape right now. He agrees many can remain independent, so long as they meet three criteria: 1. They are geographically essential. 2. They are financially efficient.3. They meet quality outcomes of the top 25 percent of hospitals. Meeting these metrics greatly increases a hos- pital's likelihood of remaining independent or its appeal and value for potential acquirers and partners, Mr. Williams says. For hospitals in states that chose not to expand Medicaid coverage under the optional provision of the health reform law, Mr. Williams says many disproportionate share hospitals will either close or operate on margins less than one percent if Medicaid DSH payments are slashed. \"Of those that have been dependent on those protections, some will be doomed,\" he said. Even those with good cash on hand will run out of money even- tually if they don't execute a strategy to stay in the black. Winning strategy Perhaps the most important piece of any com- munity hospital's strategy is recapturing patients lost to competitors, says David Pederson, JD, board chairman of Great Plains Regional Medi-cal Center in North Platte, Neb. His hospital, after learning community members were driving hundreds of miles away to have cardiac stents put in, completed a feasibility study and began its own cardiology program, which has provided more convenient and cheaper care for patients and increased the hospital's revenue. \"We start by asking ourselves what do we need in this area, what can we afford and what can we do well,\" Mr. Pederson says. Great Plains has grown its medical staff in the last six years from about 50 physicians to 90 today, about half of whom are employed, Mr. Pederson says. The hospital has been fortunate to attract and retain a large number of inter - national physicians, but recruitment has gotten more difficult with time. \"We're in an area where hunting and fishing used to be the main appeal for [physicians] coming out of school. Now we find we need more equipment and investment in our facility to attract new physicians,\" he adds. Patients want to see capital improvements at hospitals as well, Mr. Pederson says. Great Plains is undergoing a $100 million construction proj - ect that will reduce its 120 beds by adding more single rooms, but will increase capacity for out - patient care. \"The advice everyone's giving is 'stay away from brick-and-mortar investments,' but what we find is that people need to feel they're getting their care from a state-of-the-art facility,\" he says. The project is necessary for several reasons, including as a way to market the hospital as a place to deliver top-quality care to an audience of patients who've become used to driving more than 100 miles to get to urban ter - tiary centers they see as more sophisticated. Those capital investments are currently among community hospitals' greatest challenges, Mr. Williams says, since many have lagging financial indicators and have allowed their equipment and facilities to become outdated. That makes credi - tors leery to lend money the hospitals need to make improvements that would improve their credit ratings. \"They'll never achieve credit worthiness to ac- cess capital without the fundamentals,\" Mr. Wil-liams says. Even for hospitals that don't intend to remain independent, he adds, \"no matter what, you've got to be operationally focused so you'll be attractive for someone else to buy. [Commu-nity hospitals] should be evaluating their revenue cycle, supply chain and competitive operational productivity to see if they're performing in the top quartile. And if they're not, what must they do to perform there? Those operational things are the only things that will get them back to a solid bottom line.\" Well positioned Mr. Lupica says community hospitals' nimble-ness to adapt to change is their greatest asset moving forward. At one of his client hospitals, the chief nursing officer, who used to work at a big urban system, told him \"We can get things done here before my old place would have had four of the 17 signoffs they needed to make a decision.\" \"Community hospitals have been more enlight - ened about community than they even realize in the way they deliver efficiency, clinical outcomes and patient engagement,\" he says. Much shorter waiting times at some community hospitals is an underestimated selling point, Mr. Williams says, and can be a powerful message to convince patients accustomed to waiting at other hospitals to stay local. He also cautions against physician employ - ment contracts that rely too heavily on historic and market-based compensation rather than on productivity. \"Community hospitals are making big mistakes for the future when they acquire specialists in the marketplace who will be reimbursed less after changes take effect in healthcare reform,\" he says. Physicians may be seeking employment as a safe haven from those reimbursement cuts, and hospitals should stick to their guns when physicians say they'll go to competitors, he says. Mr. Pederson advises that community hospitals place an equally strong emphasis on non-phy - sician staff satisfaction, because medical pro - fessionals such as nurses are just as difficult to recruit and are essential for a cohesive, efficient and patient-pleasing environment. nHometown Healthcare Isn't Dead: Why (Most) Smart Community Hospitals Can Still Thrive(continued from page 1)Joel T.

The startling diagnosis often leaves patients pursuing the most promising forms of treatment with less consideration for cost. A recent study led by researchers from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, N.C., found few patients ask about the costs of cancer treatments \u2014 many noted they want the best care regardless of its price tag, while others said they thought their physician should not have to worry about cost. While the clinical aspects of cancer have always been substantial, the fi - nancial aspects of the disease are increasingly coming to light. Medical ex- penditures for cancer are expected to reach at least $158 billion by 2020, according to estimates from the National Institutes of Health. Another recent study published in Health Affairs found cancer patients were 2.65 times more likely to go bankrupt than their peers without the disease. Finally, a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in March found no clear association between the survival rate of patients with advanced cancer and the amount Medicare spent on their care. The study also found significant variation in Medicare spending on cancer care \u2014 a difference ranging from 32 to 41 percent, depending on the region. Payors and providers are shining a brighter light on cancer costs Traditionally, payors and providers have been more cautious to manage the costs of cancer care compared to other conditions and specialties. There are two components to this. One is the highly specialized and sophisti-cated nature of oncology. There are more than 200 types of cancer, not to mention the specialty's cutting-edge technology, newly approved drugs, continual study findings and groundbreaking treatment options. The second factor is the sensitivity around the emotionally charged disease. When trying to reign in costs, health plans and providers have generally followed an old saying: Kids and cancer are off limits. Questioning the medical necessity of services in pediatrics and oncology was long treated as a last resort, as payors and providers thought it would be demonizing and stir negative publicity. In some instances, when payors did try this tech-nique, lawmakers intervened, says Igor Belokrinitsky, principal with Booz & Company. \"In some areas where health plans tried to say a treatment wasn't medically necessary, state legislatures would mandate that health plans cover a particular treatment, whether necessary or not.\" But more recently, in the move from fee-for-service to pay-for-perfor - mance, payors and providers seem genuinely interested in meeting each other halfway when it comes to cancer care and costs. Whether through clinical protocols, provider-patient counseling sessions, genetic testing or oncology-specific accountable care organizations and bundled payments, oncology presents several collaborative opportunities for providers and payors to better align incentives. Janene Culumber, senior vice president of finance and CFO for Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla., says she's seen interest on both the provider side and the payor side for cancer care management. \"Because we treat patients from all over the state, a lot of insurers have been approaching us. But we've also reached out to our biggest payors and said we want to participate in this together. We need to be partners.\" Moffitt part - nered with Florida Blue in late 2012 to form a cancer-specific accountable care organization, and Ms. Culumber says the center is currently in active discussions with three other payors and expects to close deals soon. There is an agreed-upon scale by which payors and providers match their priorities. The first consideration is quality, or the effectiveness of the available treatments. Second is the patient experience and comfort of the treatment. Finally is cost. By aligning their concerns, care management ar - rangements can defy criticism of care rationing, as well. Ms. Culumber said care plans will never be altered in Moffitt's ACO for cost purposes; rather, the model is encouraging physicians to keep a closer eye on the prices of certain care processes. As Mr. Belokrinitsky says: \"Cost being last is better than cost not being in the consideration at all.\" Coming soon: Bundled payments, ACOs and quality reporting \u2014 specific to cancer Michael Kolodziej, MD, began his role as national medical director for Aetna's oncology strategies in February. Before then, he worked on the provider side as medical director for oncology services for US Oncology, which Aetna partnered with in 2010. In the past, Dr. Kolodziej says oncol- ogy was not so much a sacred cow to payors and providers as a black box with little transparency or dialogue. \"I think the reason people were afraid to tinker with it was they simply didn't understand how things were done,\" he says. \"That is changing.\" Aetna and US Oncology launched a pilot program for Aetna members treated by physicians with Texas Oncology from June 2010 through April 2012. Under that pilot, providers used guidelines for evidence-based medi - cine. Patients were able to discuss and make end-of-life plans with clini- cians, and nurse navigators were made available to help manage patients' symptoms and side effects. By its end, the Aetna-US Oncology pilot reduced costs for lung, breast and colorectal cancers by 12 percent; decreased emergency room visits by 40 percent; and decreased hospital admissions by 16.5 percent among 184 enrolled members. Aetna found the results promising, and Dr. Kolodziej says he expects the insurer to begin offering bundled payments for subsets of oncology services within the next three years. Aetna also is looking at oncology-specific strategies for ACOs. Dr. Kolodziej also expects more transparency around oncology quality met - rics in the next few years, and for that information to drive more patient decision-making. \"Oncology has had a problem because there have not been formally adopted quality metrics. I think we'll see a very rapid expansion of public reporting to quality measures, including patient satisfaction,\" he says. \"It's something we're experiencing now in the Medicare world, but I think it will go far beyond that. It will be one of the metrics that determines appro-priate reimbursement for practices, and patients will look it up.\" On the provider side, Ms. Culumber says Moffitt has seen more scrutiny from payors for cancer care reimbursement, including more difficulty in obtaining authorizations. Insurers or benefits managers are asking many more questions that require a finer level of clinical detail. \"Oftentimes, our nurses can't quite answer all the questions. We have to go to the physi - cians,\" she says, and payors sometimes request peer-to-peer review process between physicians. Ms. Culumber said the main goal for its cancer-specific ACO with Florida Blue is to both improve the quality of care and reduce the cost of care. \"We're also looking to ensure our physicians are not only following clinical pathways, but also have their eye toward costs. If there are three drug regi- mens and all are equally effective with low toxicity for the patient but one is less expensive, we're trying to drive behavioral change to pick the lower cost drug,\" says Ms. Culumber. Noting that \"once one of anything is created, looks to be successful and meets the needs of organizations,\" Ms. Culumber said she believes cancer- specific ACOs are likely to catch on, as well. Emerging, and mutually beneficial, cost management strategies Cancer care management programs can be structured in a way that is ben-eficial to everyone involved by eliminating processes that have no clinical Hospitals, Insurers Devote More Attention to the Cost of Cancer Care (continued from page 1)11 Sign up for the COMPLIMENTARY Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 benefits, says Mr. Belokrinitsky of Booz & Company. \"By and large, when you talk to stakeholders, it's not so much that they want to cut costs but control how costs are spent and transition them toward more value-based reimbursements.\" Here are a few other avenues payor sand providers are exploring to better control cancer care's costs. Clinical protocols. Back in 2010, Aetna and US Oncology compared treat - ment costs among oncologists who treated certain lung cancer patients with clinical guidelines compared with those physicians who administered treatment independently. The findings? Treatment costs for a year-long pe-riod were 35 percent lower when physicians adhered to clinical standards, with no negative affect on patients.Mr. Belokrinitsky says health plans are going to hospitals and oncology practices more often, asking providers to implement clinical protocols for cancer treatments to reduce variability. The protocols are developed by a third-party central authority and designed to be supple, allowing physicians to prescribe treatments on a case-by-case basis. Also, for these programs, payors typically reward physicians with bonus payments that are process-based, not outcomes-based. For instance, if an oncology practice imple-ments a protocol and complies with it for 80 percent of cases \u2014 the desig - nated threshold \u2014 those providers may receive bonus payments for simply implementing the guidelines in that portion of cases. Clinical guidelines present a few challenges, though. One is simply their com- plexity and a lack of standardization. For instance, a hospital's cancer center might follow clinical protocols from their local Blue Cross Blue Shield. Months Through their vigilance and uncompromising commitment to safety, these organizations maintained the highest levels of vendor compliance out of thousands of healthcare facilities. As the providers of the Reptrax system, IntelliCentrics is proud to have been able to play a role in ensuring the safety of these facilities. As such, we'll be providing each winning facility with a congratulatory financial grant.

Whoever can bring harmony to the process would be the physician's best friend\" Another challenge is hospitals' and oncologists' opposition to attempted standardization. A lot of time and research goes into clinical protocols. Pay - ors typically develop clinical protocols with outside experts who continue to update the protocols regularly as new studies, technologies and treatment options become available. But if a payor calls one of the country's most prominent cancer centers asks those oncologists to use its clinical protocol \u2014 those physicians may not be too pleased, said Mr. Belokrinitsky. Cancer hubs with the top talent, research and cutting-edge technology may be more likely to resist payors' clinical protocols or care management tools. Improved prescription management. A 2011 study published by the Journal of On- cology Practice and the American Journal of Managed Care found 10 percent of patients failed to fill new prescriptions for oral cancer drugs. Researchers found people with high cost-sharing in their insurance plans and those who were on multiple medications were more likely to abandon their prescrip-tions. Roughly 16 percent of patients had an out-of-pocket cost of greater than $500, according to the study. One way to alleviate this problem is through split-fill prescriptions, where patients can pick up a portion of the pills \u2014 maybe 10 of their monthly 30 \u2014 for a fraction of the cost. This way, if the medication causes discomfort or negative side effects, the payor will not reimburse the full cost of a medica-tion that goes unused, the physician will be notified of those side effects and can change the patient's prescription, and the patient will not have to pur - chase an expensive oral drug with high out-of-pocket costs that is ineffective. End-of-life planning. There are also care management costs that are based largely on common sense and practicality, such as patients, physicians and family members having end-of-life discussions early on. \"Once clinical measures have been exhausted, you can shift to less-invasive treatments that will make patients more comfortable and provide [them with] some dignity as they live out the rest of their lives. The earlier the physician has that conversation with a patient and their family, the less likely they are to choose invasive options,\" says Mr. Belokrinitsky. \"If you don't gently but candidly discuss end-of-life planning, patients will likely ask for more care. More health plans will look to deploy these programs to transition patients to less-invasive care when they are ready.\"Genetic testing. One care management tool that holds promise is personal - ized medicine, or genetic testing, which is applicable for subsets of cancer. These tests can be useful when certain types of cancer seem to run in patients' families, but they are not recommended for everyone. The blood tests can identify gene mutations and potentially determine what type of cancer a patient is most at risk of developing, and whether the patient will be responsive to a certain type of medicine. One caveat: There are no laws requiring insurance companies to cover genetic testing, and bills can range in cost, from $100 in out-of-pocket costs or running in the thousands. Actress Angelina Jolie brought wider public understanding to genetic test - ing in May when she wrote a New York Times op-ed about her choice to undergo a double mastectomy after testing positive for a high-risk gene mutation, BRCA1. Physicians estimated she had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although those figures are prone to fluctuation in each woman's case. Ms. Jolie said the price for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing can exceed $3,000 in the United States \u2014 a financial obstacle for many. Shortly after Ms. Jolie's op-ed, Peter Meldrum, president and CEO of Salt Lake City-based Myriad Genetics & Laboratories, wrote a letter to the newspaper. He noted that the company's BRACAnalaysis is widely re-imbursed by insurance companies, with more than 95 percent of at-risk women covered and with an average out-of-pocket cost of about $100. \"And, thanks to preventive care provisions in the Affordable Care Act, many patients can receive BRACAnalysis testing with no out-of-pocket costs,\" Mr. Meldrum wrote. Conclusion Cancer is already a huge part of population health management, and is projected to be even more prominent in the next few years. Today, more than 60 percent of cancer diagnoses affect Medicare beneficiaries, and that number is projected to reach 70 percent by 2030. This growing need for cancer care; hospitals' growing investments in their oncology programs, technology and centers; and increased national attention on the financial costs of cancer all suggest ample opportunity for reform in oncology reim-bursement. It seems this challenge can be addressed in ways that are mutu - ally beneficial for providers and payors, allowing the two to genuinely meet one another halfway. Closer collaborations between healthcare providers and new programs like cancer-specific ACOs, bundled payments and clini-cal protocols have given both sides of the equation sharper tools to reduce variation in cancer care while improving outcomes. n a freestanding hospital is a necessary credential to attract scarce pediatric subspecialists for the area's multiplying patients. Out with the old The eight-county San Antonio metropolitan area has averaged an annual population growth rate of 2.5 percent, or about 43,000 residents each year since 2000. And the area had the largest numeric growth in population of any of the nation's larg-est 10 cities between 2010 and 2011, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As of last July, the area's population sits at around 2.23 million. Noticing the city's patient base was growing, hospitals in the area began to explore expansion opportunities, including in pediatrics. In December 2010, San Antonio-based Christus Santa Rosa Health System and University Health System, the Bexar County-owned hospital af-filiate staffed by faculty physicians of the School of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, initiated discus - sions to partner with one another to build a new standalone children's hospital, which would have been the city's first. Christus and University Health leaders hired a consulting group to help analyze a potential agreement, but the idea was abandoned in early 2012, says Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez-Scarano, MD, dean of medicine and vice president of medical affairs at the Health Science Center. A major reason the plan was aborted was be - cause the two systems couldn't agree on where to locate the children's hospital, Dr. Gonzalez says. Christus pushed to build it downtown near its existing adult hospital, Christus Santa Rosa Hospital, which housed its co-located Christus Santa Rosa Children's Hospital. Uni-versity Health, on the other hand, wanted the new standalone children's hospital to comple - ment the Health Science Center's medical school on its academic campus about 10 miles away. Twenty years before, Christus, Method-ist and the Health Science Center had all ex-plored partnerships with one another to build a standalone children's hospital, but ultimately abandoned those attempts over similar dis-agreements regarding location. That setback led Christus to add pediatric facilities to its downtown hospital some years later. This time, Christus responded to the location dispute stalemate by boldly announcing it would decommission and gut its adult hospital down-town to renovate and convert it into a stand-alone children's hospital, known today as Chil-dren's Hospital of San Antonio. San Antonio's Children's Hospital Boom: How Alamo City Competitors Are Battling for Pediatric Patients (continued from page 1)13 Sign up for the COMPLIMENTARY Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 Christus Santa Rosa CEO Patrick Carrier says the former downtown facility was overbedded, and the two-year, $135 million renovation was the more attractive option than the estimated $450 million the hospital would have spent to build a new hospital. Portions of the hospital closed and some services were relocated to Christus' three other adult facilities in San Antonio last July while some floors were renovated, although the facility has remained open throughout the updates. Cur - rently, half of the hospital is delivering children's services while the other half is renovated. When the project is complete late next year, Children's Hospital of San Antonio will host 215 inpatient beds dedicated to pediatrics. Mr. Carrier says pediatric care quality at its adult downtown hospital was already strong, but mar - ket research showed San Antonio providers were losing many pediatric patients to outside the area, many to the highly specialized care offered at the prestigious Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, ranked fourth nationally in pediatrics by U.S. News & World Report this past year. \"We didn't have the subspecialists to support it,\" Mr. Carrier says. \"Good was getting in the way of great. We were offering good children's services. We had to take that next step.\" Drawing in those subspecialists was one major reason Christus opted for a freestanding children's hospital over one on its adult campus. \"You've got to have the talent, you've got to have the facil-ity that attracts and supports the talent, and this is a goal in process in the sense that it takes years to develop to the point of, for example, Texas Chil-dren's. It's a journey,\" Mr. Carrier says. That process has already made strides, as Chris - tus has partnered with Texas Children's for clini- cal expertise and Baylor College of Medicine, which has a pediatrics department rated third in the nation by the National Institutes of Health, to provide physician staffing and training. In with the new After University Health called off the potential partnership with Christus, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia approached the Health Science Center's leaders to share its plans to expand in partnership with Nashville, Tenn.-based for-prof-it chain Vanguard Health Systems to capitalize on the area's population boom, says the Health Sci-ence Center's Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez, who used to work for the University of Pennsylvania School of Medi-cine, which is affiliated with CHOP . The South Texas Medical Center, where the UT Health Science Center has its campus, has spare land where Health Science Center officials had hoped a children's hospital would be built where they could send medical students, Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez says. \"Children's hospitals are special places, and [CHOP] has enormous expertise in building a network,\" Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez says. \"The way we look at this [partnership] is not just having a hospi-tal and medical center. The number of children who need to be taken care of as outpatients is much greater, and we want to be with a partner that can do this all over South Texas.\" Vanguard, which is backed by private equity firm Blackstone Group, fits the bill. The three-way agreement involves CHOP , the pediatric pow - erhouse; Vanguard, which has the deep pockets to build the anticipated $350 million standalone children's hospital; and the Health Science Cen-ter, which would be the clinical affiliate and can help to broker a lease of the foundation-owned land near its campus where the new hospital would be built, Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez says. Construction on the hospital is slated to begin early next year and could be completed in 2016.Grow from within Methodist has had longstanding plans to expand and invest a \"significant amount of money\" in its children's hospital to create private beds and add capacity in specialty areas, says Gay Nord, CEO of the Medical Center Campus for Meth-odist Hospital and Methodist Children's Hos-pital. Methodist, like other local hospitals, had shown interest in a potential partnership with the Health Science Center and suspended its internal expansion plans while that option was being explored for more than a year, said JoAnn King, Methodist's director of public relations. So when the Health Science Center announced in September it had partnered with CHOP and Vanguard instead, Methodist resumed its inter - nal expansion plans. Still, Methodist is skeptical that patient volumes will grow as much as its competitors claim, Ms. Nord says. Citing some market share growth with Methodist Children's with a slight decline in the competing system, \"our data does not in-dicate the demand to substantially increase inpa - tient beds,\" she says. As a result, rather than build a new facility like its competitors, Methodist is opting to upgrade its children's hospital and continue to benefit from the clinical depth and breadth Methodist pediat - ric physicians feel is an important benefit to pa-tients. Today the attached Methodist Children's Hospital hosts 120 inpatient beds and 32 pedi-atric treatment rooms in its children's emergency department, along with 78 NICU beds. Advancing pediatrics One common motivator behind Christus, the UT Health Science Center and Methodist's children's hospital strategies is the desire to attract more subspecialists to the region. Standalone children's facilities are central to Christus and the Health 14 Sign up for the COMPLIMENTARY Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 Science Center's tactics in hopes the appeal of fresh, up-to-date facilities will draw in pediatric specialists who before might have skipped over San Antonio when deciding where to practice. Methodist, on the other hand, holds the phi - losophy that a freestanding children's hospital is not necessarily better \u2014 or more packed with patients. Instead, Ms. Nord hopes when it comes to recruiting much-needed specialists, it's what's inside the hospital that counts. \"It's really not a question of whether there are enough beds to care for the children of San Antonio, but rather focusing our efforts and our resources on the subspecialties,\" Ms. Nord says. Since the Baylor affiliation was announced, Mr. Carrier of Christus says the response from medi -cal schools and prospective physicians has been astounding. They've already hired a number of subspecialists new to the region and expect an-other 40 in the next three to five years, he says. \"The children's healthcare world is small in terms of number of hospitals, so word gets around a lot,\" he adds. \"One of the many reasons we decided to partner with Baylor and Texas Chil - dren's Hospital is they are world-recognized and [for] their ability to recruit. So far, early on in the process, that looks like it's coming to fruition. We're getting calls and inquiries from subspecial - ists interested in moving to San Antonio.\" Three's a crowd Leaders from the three systems acknowledged that despite the anticipated growth in the mar -ket, competition would be stiff and could drive some stakeholders out. \"Personally, I don't see how three children's hospitals will be successful,\" says Mr. Carrier of Christus. The ones that will thrive will be the most specialized in the region, he adds, making academic partnerships even more important. \"We can't control what everybody else does,\" Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez of the Health Science Center says. \"We think at the end of the day, we'll have suffi - cient volume.\" Additionally, he says the CHOP-Vanguard initiative plans to expand all the way to Texas' southern border, making the alliance with the Health Science Center as strategically ben- eficial as it hopes to be financially beneficial. n REGISTER T ODAy!

In some regards, it makes sense. These institutions treat some of the sickest pa-tients in the country, are hubs for groundbreak-ing research and have resources that few other healthcare organizations can match. However, for most Americans, the community hospital is the prototypical image of a hospital. Babies being born, broken arms being mended, illnesses being treated \u2014 all of this occurs with - in a building that in many ways is the nucleus of each particular community. Community hospitals may not be destination medical centers to treat the global masses, but they can still be \"great\" facilities. Here, three community hospital CEOs explain what these types of organizations must do to take the extra step from merely \"average\" or \"good\" to be-come \"great.\" 1. Create a sense of trust and stabil- ity. When Tim Browne was appointed CEO of Carolina Pines Regional Medical Center, a 116-bed hospital in Hartsville, S.C., in 2011, he became the hospital's seventh CEO in a matter of less than a decade. Hospital employees, physi - cians and the general public were desperate for consistency within the hospital's leadership, and Mr. Browne \u2014 who actually was born and raised in Hartsville \u2014 said he made it his top goal to make the hospital a bastion of stability for his community and gain trust back. \"I spent a lot of time outside the walls of the hos- pital, in addition to inside, just listening and being involved in local events and basically reconnect - ing with local business and industry,\" Mr. Browne says. \"I had been told the hospital had been ab-sent [within the community], and we made a true grassroots effort to get back and reconnected.\" 2. Become an active participant within community affairs. Creating a sense of trust and stability cannot really be done without be-ing fully engaged with the community, as Mr. Browne said. Ken Hutchenrider Jr., president of 209-bed Methodist Richardson (Texas) Medical Center, couldn't agree more. Mr. Hutchenrider says community hospitals are vital to their local economies and infrastructure, meaning hospital leaders have to be proactive and establish good working relationships with city and town leaders \u2014 including mayors, city councils, civic groups, schools, and TV and radio stations. For example, in an effort to lower Meth-odist Richardson's STEMI times, Mr. Hutchen-rider says the hospital worked with the city of Richardson's mayor, fire department, emergency medical services and other stakeholders to cre - ate collaborative protocols and streamline the process for treating heart attack patients. Since Methodist Richardson first engaged the commu-nity in its process, it set a record for door-to-balloon time of 14 minutes. Staying active in community affairs is also neces - sary for community hospitals as they dip their toes more into population health management. Phyllis Peoples, president and CEO of Terre-bonne General Medical Center, a 321-bed hos-pital in Houma, La., says her hospital serves a tight-knit parish community in Louisiana's bay - ou, and their community outreach is \"key in our efforts to provide exceptional health outcomes.\"\"[We] prioritize awareness and prevention of the health conditions identified as most affecting our community \u2014 stroke, diabetes, heart disease and cancer \u2014 and provide educational programs and health screenings for these conditions to residents at little or no cost,\" Ms. Peoples says. 3. Prioritize quality outcomes and pa- tient satisfaction. Quality outcomes and pa-tient satisfaction scores have always been a top concern for community hospitals, but now they will matter even more under CMS' value-based purchasing and readmissions programs, which tie Medicare reimbursements to results. Patient sat - isfaction is an area that community hospitals can especially influence because, as each CEO put it, it's simply a matter of making the right effort. \"Patient satisfaction is job one,\" Mr. Hutchen- rider says. \"We want every one of our patients to be satisfied as they are leaving our building. For example, we have a special subset of volunteers to serve elderly patients. Often times, those el - derly patients just want someone to come up and talk to them \u2014 ranging from the good old days, music in the 1950s, do a Sudoku or crossword puzzle \u2014 and we have this group now that's willing to do that.\" 4. Highlight the hospital's key special- ties. Community hospitals are not tertiary hos- pitals for a reason \u2014 they cannot provide every service within every subspecialty. Mr. Browne of Carolina Pines says community hospitals must focus on clinical excellence for the service lines they do provide and create relationships with bigger hospitals for those they don't. \"The con- tinuum of care process creates a smooth tran- sition for patients, so for [issues] we can't treat here, we're ensuring we have a relationship at a larger tertiary facility,\" he says. Ms. Peoples agrees, saying Terrebonne General has focused on cancer and orthopedic centers of excellence to bring a scaled version of \"world- class\" care to its community. 5. Show physicians, nurses and other staff just how valuable they are. An ax - iom across all sectors: An organization is noth-ing without its employees. This is especially true in healthcare, in which many have said there are looming shortages of physicians, nurses and coders. If community hospitals want to recruit and attract new healthcare professionals to their organizations, it's a prerequisite to have positive workforce programs and benefits. \"[Our] staff treats all patients with compassion and respect, and we cannot thank them enough for being ambassadors of the hospital and our mission,\" Ms. Peoples says. \"Through appre - ciation luncheons, naming an Employee of the Month and bestowing awards for extraordinary nurses, we regularly show our gratitude for our compassionate employees and the exceptional work they do in our hospital each day.\" nFEATURE Nuclei of Local Healthcare: 5 Steps for Community Hospitals to Become Great By Bob Herman25 Focus On Community Hospitals Community hospitals occupy an impor - tant and unique place in the healthcare industry. They are in a position to pro- vide quality care to patients close to home and often develop lasting bonds with the communi-ties they serve. Not only do they take care of the health needs of their communities, but they also provide employment opportunities for them. Here, leaders from reputed community hospitals discuss the unique benefits and challenges of serving a specific population, and also discuss initiatives that their organizations are planning to implement in the near future. Question: What are some of the ben- efits of being a community hospital? Robert Lord, Senior Vice President for System Facility Management, Chief Le-gal Officer and Tradition Medical Center Campus Leader, Martin Health System (Stuart, Fla.): Martin Health System is mission- driven, with its sole focus on serving the needs of the community in which we live. Our organization has always maintained extremely close relationships with local civic and business leaders, governmen-tal agencies and charitable organizations. Through communication and collaboration we work closely with our constituencies to meet their needs. The only reason Martin Health System exists is to pro-vide exceptional healthcare services to our families, friends and neighbors. In return, we receive great support from our community. David Cheney, CEO, Banner Boswell Medical Center (Sun City, Ariz.): Our greatest benefit as a community hospital is that we focus our care on a specific population \u2014 the elderly. This allows us to become experts in that care. This year, Banner Boswell was recognized for the second year in a row as one of the nation's 100 Top Hospitals by Truven Health Analytics, in large part because of our expertise in the delivery of care to our surrounding community. Another benefit of being a community hospital is that we have a close relationship to our community members. This relationship provides the hospital with access to an active volunteer group. Patients can remain close to their homes, families and friends. As a community hospital, we also have a more direct relationship with other providers along the continuum of care, for example, skilled nurs-ing facilities, hospice, home care and assisted living. John Fitzgerald, CEO, Inova Fair Oaks Hospital (Fairfax, Va.): Being a community hospital gives us an opportunity to be focused on delivering care to the community. For the most part, community hospitals are about deliv-ering care to the community as opposed to large research centers or academic centers. It is a very personal one-on-one relationship with the com-munity. We really like that personal relationship we have. They know you and you know them. Together, we work to ensure the health and vital - ity of our friends and neighbors. Q. What are some of the challenges of being a community hospital and serv - ing a specific population? Mr. Lord: Martin Health System serves one of the nation's most Medicare-dependent service areas. We also provide a significant amount of care to Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as provid-ing substantial charity care. We are not a part of a hospital taxing district, limiting local tax sup-port. Recent reductions in reimbursement from Medicare or Medicaid will challenge our ability to meet the future needs of our community and the anticipated requirement of new payment methodologies. It is also a challenge to compete with the large hospital chains when it comes to the costs of supplies, purchased services and large capital expenditures. Mr. Cheney: Banner Boswell is a community hospital in a predominantly Medicare environ- ment. This makes it challenging to attract and re - tain both primary care providers and specialists. As a community hospital, we have limited access to subspecialists. Also, most physicians do not reside in the community and therefore are reluctant to commute to the hospital in the middle of the night. This creates the challenge of having an adequate on-call schedule for our emergency department. The fact that we serve a specific population \u2014 elderly \u2014 presents another challenge for Banner Boswell. Elderly individuals have chronic condi-tions and tend to be complex patients. In addition, these patients require coordination of care, which can also be a challenge. The population we serve also experiences their own challenges. For example, elderly individuals have limited access to transpor - tation for follow-up care, pharmaceuticals, etc. Q. What are your organization's strate - gies for overcoming those challenges?Mr. Lord: One of the key initiatives for Mar - tin Health System in recent years has been our implementation of Lean management tools through our performance excellence program, Community Hospital Roundtable: 3 Leaders Weigh-In on Challenges, Opportunities By Anuja Vaidya Rob LordDavid Cheney John Fitzgerald26 Focus On Community Hospitals which has successfully driven waste from the healthcare delivery system. We have also created alliances with other organizations to increase our purchasing power and control the cost of services and supplies. Martin Health System is working with its medical staff to align interests and use data from its new electronic medical record system to improve patient satisfaction, quality and efficiency. We are also working col-laboratively with the medical staff to establish evidence-based practice protocols and standard-ization of supplies and standard work processes. We have implemented several strategic initiatives that have expanded our service capability and helped us better meet the needs of our growing market. These initiatives include the development of a new hospital campus, a new rehabilitation hospital on the campus of an existing hospital, af- filiations with internationally recognized research organizations, the development of a freestanding emergency department and the diversification of our employed physician practice. Mr. Cheney: Banner Health has implemented innovative solutions like electronic medical re-cords and Banner iCare, which provides 24/7 monitoring of patients in hospital intensive care units. These solutions have resulted in consis - tently higher quality across so many hospitals, large and small. At Banner Boswell, innovative solutions like the EMR play a vital role in assist - ing with the coordination of care for the elderly population that we serve in our community. Banner Boswell is one of 21 Banner Health fa-cilities that has achieved stage 7, the final stage in the adoption of EMR as acknowledged by Healthcare Information and Management Sys - tems Society Analytics, a wholly owned non - profit subsidiary of HIMSS. More and more, Banner Health \u2014 through Ban- ner Health Network \u2014 is placing focus on the risk-based, value-enhanced market. Through our physician network, population health management technology and case management strategy, we are able to tightly coordinate care and deliver on the triple aim. Our capabilities in this area have been at - tractive to both government and commercial pay - ors giving us greater overall market share potential. Q. What are some recruitment strate - gies employed by your organization?Mr. Lord: Obviously, being located in one of the most beautiful places on the planet doesn't hurt. The quality of life Martin Health System is able to offer its associates is a great recruit - ing benefit. Within the organization, we have a culture of professionalism that is dedicated to our mission of providing exceptional care to the community. It is also critical to maintain salaries and benefits that are competitive. Martin Health System has partnered with local colleges and universities to assist in the education of the community's young people, with the hope that they will \"stay home\" and become a locally grown workforce for the future. This is permitting us to better grow our workforce organically. The organization also invests in its current workforce by assisting with educational opportunities, includ- ing internal programs designed to develop future leaders. Finally, shared governance models and a \"bottom up\" approach to continuous quality im- provement through our performance excellence program serves us well in recruitment efforts. Mr. Cheney: For Banner Boswell, it is important that we recruit a workforce that is passionate about gerontology. This ensures that we will hire employ - ees who are passionate about providing care to the population that we serve. We do this by identifying top national geriatric hospital markets and direct recruitment marketing efforts appropriately. We promote Banner's highly regarded orienta- tion program throughout sourcing and interview conversations, as it is known across the region for the unmatched support provided to new gradu- ate employees. New graduates receive training at the Banner Simulation Center, which is the larg- est simulation center in the country. Once at the hospital, novice nurses are introduced to inpa- tient nursing care expectations through the Nurse Education Transition Unit. Each new nurse is as- signed one experienced RN preceptor who men- tors the new RN for his or her first six months of work. Banner Boswell has diligently reviewed staffing ratios to assess where and how many new gradu- ates the hospital can absorb. We do this in an effort to fully engage in growing our own talent. Banner Boswell has been successful in bringing in a high volume of new graduates through the Progressive Care Units, which has turned into a feeder department for the Intensive Care Unit. Mr. Fitzgerald: We spend a lot of time trying to make sure that we hire the right people. We have a system of values called \"shared beliefs\" and we try to hire with regard to those beliefs \u2014 compassion, respect, excellence, dedication, innovation and trust. Since we are a service or - ganization, we want our employees to be a living brand, that is, their word of mouth should bring people into the organization. People come to us because they want to work with us. Q. What are some initiatives your orga- nization is planning to implement in the near future? Mr. Lord: Later this year, we will be opening a new hospital campus to be known as Tradition Medical Center, located in the Tradition Center for Innovation in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Tradition Cen-ter for Innovation is a medical research park cur - rently housing facilities for the Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute (affiliated with the University of Oregon) and the Torrey Pines Institute for Molec - ular Studies. We enjoy excellent relationships with those life sciences organizations and are expanding our clinical research activities to meet their needs. We have a long-standing clinical research program and have enjoyed an affiliation with Moffitt Can- cer Center that has provided access to numerous treatment options for patients that may not other - wise be available. Due to the success of our affili- ation with Moffitt, we are looking to expand that relationship. This summer, we are opening with HealthSouth our community's first ever compre - hensive rehabilitation hospital. The new facility is located on the campus of one of our existing hos- pitals, which will allow us to provide a full range of acute and longer-term care to residents close to home. We expect the two new hospitals and new clinical research opportunities to lead to exciting times for our organization. Mr. Fitzgerald: As part of our challenge to reinvent hospital-based care by increasing value for our patients, we are really excited about our cancer center. It has been in the works for the last five years. Not only will patients not have to leave the campus for any cancer services, but they are assured the highest quality and safety as well as an integrated care network of profession- als dedicated to their success. Opening in early 2014, it will be tremendous for the community who has supported us in terms of philanthropy and volunteer hours. n NEW!

As employment has surged, health systems are faced with creat - ing a new operating model to manage the physician relationship and unlock the promise of clinical integration upon which many employment deals rest. Success in building a cohesive employed physician group, however, is elusive for most health systems. Instead of building an integrated employed physi-cian group, many systems are stuck at the initial stage of development: aggre - gating physicians into a single organization. The systems that are successfully integrating employed physicians are doing so by recognizing the three major development phases, each part of the same process. The three phases are: aggregate, assimilate, integrate Phase 1: Aggregate The first phase is all about growing the scale of the employed group of physicians. In some cases this is an offensive strategy to move into a new market or to garner new referrals going to competitors. In other cases it is a defensive strategy, to ensure specialists are not acquired by competitors. The rapidly aggregation of physician practices over the last decade has been in a response to several factors: Uncertainty of health reform Deteriorating private practice financial models Lifestyle expectations Uncertainty caused by the vague nature of health reform has caused skep- ticism within the physician community; according to the Physicians Foun-dation 2012 survey, 77 percent of physicians are pessimistic about the fu - ture of medicine. 1 Physician groups often view employment as more stable due to the scale a health system provides.Deteriorating financial models have made private practice less rewarding. Ad-ministrative costs are increasing much faster than reimbursement. For instance, practice operating costs per FTE physician increased 63 percent from 1998 to 2008. 2 Moreover, new reimbursement models, such as bundled payments and accountable care organizations, require physicians to look at new partners to be relevant in coordinating care for the populations they serve. Employment becomes an easier solution than direct negotiation with every party. The generation of physicians as entrepreneurs has shifted. Increasingly, younger physicians are less interested in managing the business of a private practice. Almost twice as many physicians under 40 years old (46 percent) are looking for employment compared with their peers age 55 years and older (25 percent). 3 The result is staggering. In 2012, $18.8 billion was spent on physician medi - cal group activity, with the largest deal between HealthCare Partners and DaVita for $4.2 billion. 4 Today, more than fifty percent of physicians are hospital employed, up from twenty percent in 2003.5 Aggregation strategic pitfallsWithin the aggregation phase, some systems are successful while others are cementing failure. Two strategic pitfalls exist in the aggregation phase: Employing physicians simply to create scale without a plan to move to the next phases Building scale for the wrong reasons Employing physicians to create scale without a plan to move to the next phases is a failure to focus on the end goal of integration. If left to the phy - sician recruiters and deal makers, employment models will be customized to each specific situation with promises of no change to operations, prac-tice patterns or staffing. This makes it difficult to assimilate the individual practices into a single \"group.\" Building scale for the wrong reasons is a failure to understand why the employment tool should be used and when. If the organization is hospital-centric, physician employment models focus on the specialists who admit the highest revenue cases to the hospital rather than what the organization needs to capture and serve a specific market area. Aggregate, Assimilate and Integrate Successfully Building an Employed Physician Group Aggregate Assimilate IntegrateBy Kate Lovrien and Luke Peterson, Principals, Health System Advisors 28 Clinical Integration & Physician Issues Phase 2: Assimilate As a system moves into the assimilation phase, system activities focus on how to organize previ-ous independent practices into a cohesive phy - sician enterprise. It is in this phase that most health systems become stuck, often derailed by decisions made in the earlier phase and the in-ability to lose physicians to create a single oper - ating model. Those systems who succeed often do so by fo- cusing on creating common: Governance Operating expectations Financial reward structures A large group of highly trained professionals typically requires a large degree of empower - ment and self-governance to remain engaged. However, education of the operating realities needs to be included in any empowerment ef - fort. Many physician groups are not used to the business and clinical activities of the health sys - tem; similarly, many health systems do not un-derstand the governance of individual practices. To create an effective governance model, the employed physician enterprise must encourage physicians to be active strategic agents in the business of healthcare. While their day-to-day administrative workload is dramatically, and of-ten thankfully, reduced once employed, health systems continue to need their focus on the mar - ket and populations. Practice operations also need to change. Not only do new information systems and HR poli-cies change, but so to must the practice look, feel and external perception. The strength of scale requires that the individual physicians be seen as a common brand. This typically includes: Practice name and identification Hours of operations Mix of services Productivity assumptions Minimum practice size Visual and service standards Staffing Facilities Not dissimilar to other well-known brands, the employed physician group must have a brand and operations that reflect that brand. When it comes to incentives, financial rewards are very tangible. As such, what is financially re - warded will be very visible to the members of the employed group. If the focus is only on volume (e.g., wRVUs), the group tends to shift away from managing payor mix, from focusing on the needs of a population, and instead looks for the volumes to fill its practices. Even in an employed practice setting, the physicians cannot be immune from the macro-economic realities of healthcare. As market-based reimbursement increases for primary care (nurse practitioners up 18 percent, physicians up 16.7 percent 2007 to 2011) compared with special-ists (up 15.7 percent 2007 to 2011), 6 the employed physician group must also respond. In addition, the review of referrals outside the system and cross-subsidization in the managed care contract rates must be carefully managed to ensure that the best patient care is delivered in a fiscally responsible way. Assimilation strategic pitfalls The strategic pitfalls of the assimilation phase generally revolve around two aspects: Leadership InfrastructureSettling for poor leadership is the key pitfall of the assimilation phase for most employed phy - sician groups. Moving professionals from in-dependence to a single operating model is not completed without deft leadership. Because the direct revenues are of a different scale than the hospitals, health systems often underappreciate the need for dynamic leadership to migrate the employed group from a collection of individuals to unified operations. Scale requires infrastructure. Moreover, the in- frastructure needed to run a large multispecialty physician group (employed or otherwise) is not the same infrastructure as is required to run a health system. Employed physician groups must continually invest in the ability to create connec - tivity and communication across the group if it expects to assimilate the individuals to some - thing greater. Phase 3: Integrate Over time, the physician enterprise starts to work as a team, driving consistency in experi-ence and care, and becomes an integral part of the system's strategy and differentiated value proposition. During the integration phase, two elements take on renewed significance: clinical models and multispecialty group culture. The clinical model for primary and specialty care is dramatically changing with the increasing emphasis on population health and risk-based models. Organizations are implementing a more focused approach to specialization, often using a team of providers to better manage patients across their disease/illness journey and ensure care is received and coordinated within the net - work system. When integrating different physician groups, or - ganizations need to define the clinical model(s) they should pursue over the next decade and the implications for the broader enterprise. Phase Key Strategy Indications You Are Headed Off Course 1. AggregateAcquire and recruit a market-balanced mix of physi - cians into an employed physician group under a com - mon set of expectations You have more specialists than primary care (particularly cardiology, neurosurgery and orthopedics) The organization only considers inpatient admissions as the indication of alignment 2. AssimilateBring the disparate physicians into a single gover - nance, operating and clinical model You are heard telling an acquisition target \"you can keep your operations the same as they have always been\" You let the acquired practice keep its name and you refer to it by its historical group name 3. IntegrateCreate a culture focused on the populations' needs such that there is not differentiation between the aims of the physician group and the health system There is no clear expectation about the organization's purpose or how clinical activity will be aligned Finances are about downstream revenue or patient attribution rather than total cost of care The vision is integration rather than population health29 Clinical Integration & Physician Issues Additionally, every successful physician group practice has a strong, well-established culture that acts as a glue to hold the group together. It does not matter if the group practice is physician-led (Mayo Clinic, Virginia Mason), an integrated de - livery system (Kaiser) or a mixed alignment mod-el (Advocate Health Partners), the development of a strong organizational culture by all its diverse constituents is critical to working as a cohesive team. Establishing a multispecialty culture takes determination, resources and time. The amount of resources and time are directly proportional to the diversity of the individuals and indirectly proportional to the consistency of the communi-cation and day-to-day operations. Integration strategic pitfallsThe strategic pitfalls of the integration phase generally revolve around two aspects: Lack of commitment Inappropriate strategic focus Developing the culture of an employed multi- specialty physician group takes time. No matter what controls and incentives are put into place, the formation of a strong culture will not occur in a year. As a result, one of the major pitfalls of the integration phase is the expectation that the em-ployed group will be a cohesive team without going through years of consistent cultural formation. Many employed physician groups will never de - velop a durable culture that leads to integration because their purpose is not bigger than them - selves, the group or the system. Perhaps the larg-est barrier to moving an employed group from aggregation through assimilation to integration is its very foundation. What is the employed physician group's purpose? Too often the em - ployed physician group has its foundational pur - pose tied to the financial success of the health system (generate referrals, fill the beds, capture attribution, etc.) rather than a broader purpose to serve a population base. As a result, the significant pitfall in the end starts at the very beginning. Why is the health system building an employed physician group? Without a clear purpose to serve the customer, the de - velopment of a strong integrated multispecialty group is impossible. Conclusion In summary, employed physician groups have three development phases: aggregate, assimi-late and integrate. The ability to move quickly through these phases depends on the focus of the organization to thinking two steps ahead of the aggregation phase to build a multispecialty physician group culture that is focused on the populations and their needs. nFootnotes: 1 \"Survey of America's Physicians: Practice Pat- terns and Perspectives.\" Survey conducted on behalf of The Physicians Foundation by Mer - ritt Hawkins | Completed September, 2012.

Study: 5 Ways to Improve Physician Satisfaction By Heather Punke Shifting from a physician-centered work distribution model to a shared-care model can lead to improved physician satisfac - tion and greater \"joy in practice,\" according to a report pub- lished in the Annals of Family Medicine. The report, \"In Search of Joy in Practice: A Report of 23 High-Func - tioning Primary Care Practices,\" outlined five specific innovations found in high-functioning physician practices across the country that lead to more-satisfied physicians who get more joy out of their jobs: 1. Reduce work through previsit planning and preappointment laboratory tests. 2. Share clinical care among team members. 3. Use scribes, non-physician order entry and streamlined prescription management. 4. Have a nurse or medical assistant filter electronic and paper information for fewer inbox messages. 5. Use team meetings, co-location and workflow mapping to improve team function. n12 Specialties With the Most Burned-Out Physicians By Heather Punke Nearly 40 percent of the nation's physicians are experiencing at least one symptom of burnout, according to Medscape's Physi - cian Lifestyle Report 2013 . According to the survey, 39.8 percent of physicians feel burned out. The survey defined \"burnout\" as a loss of enthusiasm for work, feelings of cynicism and a low sense of personal accomplishment. The following are the 12 specialties with the highest percentage of burn- out, according to the survey: 1. Emergency medicine 2. Critical care3. Family medicine4. Obstetrics, gynecology and women's health 5. Internal medicine 6. Anesthesiology7. General surgery8. Neurology9. Urology10. Nephrology11. HIV and infectious diseases12. Orthopedics n30 ACOs & Integrated Delivery Models Completing the Medicare Shared Savings Program application can be an arduous, time-consuming task. CMS offers a toolkit to guide ap-plication completion and hosts conference calls for applicants to help ease the process, but for applicants looking for further guidance, three MSSP ACO leaders from two organizations \u2014 Jonathan Nasser, MD, and Scott Hines, MD, co-chief clinical transformation officers at Crystal Run Healthcare in Middletown, N.Y .; and Don Franke, vice president of physician integration at Arlington Heights, Ill.-based Alexian Brothers Health System \u2014 share some anecdotal tips to help MSSP ACO hopefuls complete the application process, based on their successful experiences applying in years prior. Applications for MSSP participation starting Jan. 1, 2014, are accepted through July 31. 1. Discuss what's already been achieved. Chances are, if an or - ganization is preparing to complete the MSSP application, it has already taken strides to provide patient-centered, high-quality, low-cost care. The MSSP application asks for narrative answers on what the organization is doing in terms of evidence-based medicine and providing patient-centered care. Crystal Run Healthcare found taking a group approach to answering these questions worked best. \"We got all leaders in a room and realized that we were already doing a lot of the things they asked on the application,\" says Dr. Nasser. \"Get the leaders together and talk about the mission and ongoing activities of the organization.\" Additionally, hospitals, health systems or physician groups that have achieved patient-centered medical home recognition from the National Committee for Quality Assurance have a leg-up on other, non-PCMH recognized or -ganizations, according to Drs. Nasser and Hines. \"If groups are already a PCMH, a lot of competencies that CMS is looking for are already displayed by achieving PCMH recognition,\" Dr. Nasser points out, and he encourages using that experience to ease answering the narrative application questions. 2. Define the governance. Another big chunk of the application cov- ers the ACO's structure and governance, so it is important to define what the governance structure and the leadership of the ACO is going to be. \"There is some background thinking to be done in terms of how to set up the ACO in a way that will successfully meet the mission of accountable care,\" says Dr. Nasser. \"Lining up the governance and the back-office...capabilities was my pri - mary objective during the application phase,\" agrees Mr. Franke.It is also important to decide how the ACO will incorporate a Medicare fee-for-service beneficiary on the governing board, which is a requirement for participation. For example, Crystal Run developed a patient advisory panel with seven patient members to incorporate the beneficiaries. 3. Decide if the ACO will receive beneficiary-identifiable claims. MSSP applicants have the choice of requesting beneficiary-iden - tifiable claims data from CMS for Medicare beneficiaries who would be attributed to the ACO. \"I would think that most ACOs would want that data, because then you can really decide which patients have the highest opportunity for improved quality and reduced costs,\" says Dr. Hines. How - ever, requesting beneficiary-identifiable claims information adds length to the MSSP application, because the ACO will have to detail how it plans to use the information and keep it safe. n Out of six value-based care models, ac-countable care organizations are set to become the most widespread model among health plans, according to a recent report sponsored by Availity. The report, \"Health Plan Readiness to Opera - tionalize Value-Based Payment Models,\" defined value-based models as ACOs, patient-centered medical homes, payment for coordination, pay-for-performance for physicians and hospitals and bundled payments. Health plan leaders were asked in telephone in- terviews what their implementation plans were for all six value-based models. Of 39 respon-dents, 87 percent said they either had imple-mented or were planning to implement an ACO in the next 12 to 18 months. The following is a breakdown of responses by model.ACO No plans: 13 percent Currently implemented: 47 percentPlanning percentCurrently 62 to for coordination: No plans: 34 percentCurrently implemented: 46 percent Planning to implement: 20 percentHospital pay-for- performance No plans: 37 percent Currently implemented: 45 percentPlanning to implement: 18 percent Physician pay-for-performance No plans: 23 percent Currently implemented: 67 percent Planning to implement: 10 percent Bundled payment No plans: 42 percentCurrently implemented: 24 percentPlanning to implement: 34 percent Tips for MSSP ACO Application Success By Heather Punke Health Plan Survey: ACOs to be Most Widespread Value-Based Model By Heather Punke 31 ACOs & Integrated Delivery Models Implementation of Value-Based Payment Models to Begin With Employee Group Plans, Study Says By Anuja Vaidya Seventy-seven percent of quality management leaders and CMOs report that the most popular target for implementation of val-ue-based payment models is employee group plans, according to \"Health Plan Readiness to Operationalize Value-Based Payment Models ,\" a research study sponsored by Availity, a health information network con-necting providers and payors. The study was administered by independent research firm, Porter Re - search, in 2012. Researchers interviewed qualified participants of 39 health plans who were knowledgeable about their organizations' value-based payment model plans and programs. Target participants included quality management leaders, medical directors and CMOs. Other health plans that are targets for implementation of value-based payment models, according to the study, are: Medicare plans \u2014 54 percent Medicaid plans \u2014 46 percent Individual plans \u2014 44 percent Other \u2014 5 percent 55% of Hospital Execs Say Their Organizations Plan to Participate in an ACO by y ear's End By Anuja Vaidya Almost 22 percent of hospital executives say their organizations participate in an accountable care organization, with 55 percent planning to be in one by the end of 2013, according to the spring 2013 edition of the \"Economic Outlook\" survey by Premier healthcare alli-ance, a performance improvement alliance for healthcare providers. For the survey, researchers polled 530 hospital C-suite executives and ma- terials and practice area managers. Other significant findings of the survey are: Forty percent of respondents are projecting their capital spending to increase over the next year. Almost 37 percent of survey respondents are projecting a capital spending decrease. Twenty-nine percent of survey respondents report that the overuti - lization of products and services is one of the biggest drivers of healthcare costs. Forty-eight percent of survey respondents say that reimbursement cuts have the greatest impact on their health system. n REGISTER T ODAy!

Last week, physician consulting firm Merritt Hawkins released its \"2013 Physician Inpatient/ Outpatient Revenue Survey.\" Merritt Hawkins received responses from 102 hospital and health system CFOs. The CFOs indicated the combined net inpatient and outpatient revenue generated annually for their facilities by a single, full-time equivalent physician across several spe - cialties. Revenue was represented by procedures per - formed at the hospital, tests and treatments or - dered and other factors. (For primary care physi - cians, hospital CFOs were asked to determine revenue generated from direct admissions, pro - cedures performed, lab tests, etc., but not from indirect revenue primary care physicians may have generated from patient referrals to special - ists utilizing the hospital.) On average, a family practice physician brought in $2.07 million of annual net revenue to his or her hospital, behind only orthopedic surgeons and invasive cardiologists, but family practice physicians' compensation was far lower. An or - thopedic surgeon generated an average of $2.68 million per hospital, and average orthopedic surgeon compensation was $519,000 \u2014 mean-ing that for every $5.17 of revenue an ortho-pedic surgeon brought it, he or she received $1 in compensation. Family physicians saw $1 of compensation for every $10.94 of generated revenue, the widest gap of any specialty. Otolaryngologists had the slimmest revenue-to- compensation ratio, as they earned $1 of pay for every $2 of revenue they brought into the hos-pital. Ophthalmologists, neurologists and neuro-surgeons were not far behind. Here are 51 statistics across 17 specialties on physician-generated hospital revenue, hospital salaries for physicians and their correspond-ing revenue-to-compensation ratios based on data from Merritt Hawkins' \"2013 Physician Inpatient/Outpatient Revenue Survey.\" Data is sorted by specialties that generated the most hospital revenue.

Moody's Investors Service recently put out a report that said it is para - mount for hospitals to master the evolving value-based payment and deliv- ery mechanisms because eventually, their credit ratings and financial health will depend on it. \"After decades of following volume-based incentives, measuring and prov- ing value will become necessary for healthcare systems to maintain operat-ing stability and distinguish themselves as market leaders,\" Lisa Goldstein, Moody's associate managing director, said in the report. Here are four management objectives based on Moody's report that hospi- tals should consider during this massive business model shift toward value-based care. 1. Break even on Medicare reimbursements. When it comes to cost reduction, most hospitals have engaged in strategies to find the low- hanging fruit for simpler cost savings. If hospitals want to completely re-design their cost structure and transition fully to a value-based healthcare system, they will need to follow the lead of their most prominent payor: Medicare. According to Moody's hospital medians, Medicare represented 43.7 per - cent of non-profit hospitals' gross patient revenues in fiscal year 2011. In addition, since 2003, the average Medicare hospital margin has been nega- tive, as most hospitals receive between 70 and 90 cents on the dollar from CMS. Ms. Goldstein says despite the lower reimbursements from Medicare, compared with commercial payors, hospitals must make Medicare the new baseline and find ways to break even on it. \"Many hospitals across the country are thinking most payor rates are going to be close to Medicare. Not necessarily single-payor, or national reim-bursement, but rates from commercial payors will retract and hover closer to Medicare rates,\" Ms. Goldstein says. \"Becoming break-even under Medi-care has been one of the guiding objectives we hear across the U.S.\" 2. Build scale through nontraditional methods. Although full- scale mergers and acquisitions are expected to continue in the hospital sec - tor, hospitals are looking at nontraditional ways to consolidate and increase their economies of scale. For example, in February, Irving, Texas-based Christus Health signed an agreement with Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, a Chilean university in Santiago, to form a joint venture for the ownership, operation and expansion of PUC's health network, which di-versified its revenue into a new geographic service area. Also, in April, four Ohio-based hospitals and health systems created the Purchasing Organiza - tion of the Western Reserve to drive down supply cost. \"The contemporary thinking is that under reform, the bigger you are, the more you can spread the costs of your infrastructure over the enterprise's footprint,\" Ms. Goldstein says. \"Long term, you can leverage a less-expen - sive healthcare system to payors, exchanges, employers and all purchasers of healthcare. This is a wait-and-see approach. But many in our meetings are asking, 'What else can we do besides a full-asset merger or acquisition?' And that's where these nontraditional strategies start to innovate.\" 3. Improve the patient experience. Patient satisfaction has become pertinent for hospitals for a few reasons: Consumers are being more selec - tive as they look for the most affordable provider; patient loyalty is at a pre- mium due to tough competition among hospitals; and CMS' value-based purchasing now factors patient experience into Medicare reimbursements. Ms. Goldstein says hospitals are using a number of different strategies to improve this area, such as employing care navigators, care teams or even chief patient experience officers. Information technology is also playing a role in coordinating care to improve the patient experience. David Ebel, director and senior CFO consultant for Warbird Consulting Partners and former CFO of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., adds that the hospital finance team plays a crucial role in this objective. \"Finance professionals are generally the first and last people that patients deal with during their healthcare experience. So they have the opportunity to make both the first and last impression on patients,\" Mr. Ebel says. \"This has always been true but becomes much more important as both the importance of patient experience and the patient's share of costs grows. CFOs need to make sure their finance professionals have strong customer service skills to make lasting, positive impressions. Knowing how to do this can make a big difference.\" 4. Cultivate informed leadership. Hospitals that lack effective gov- ernance will fail at any time, and the current transition phase of health- care reform demands that hospital leaders be even more attuned to trends and innovative thinking. Looking outside the healthcare field has been a common theme lately, as hospitals are recruiting executives, managers and board members with \"atypical\" and corporate backgrounds. \"We've seen several different types of board members serve on not-for- profit boards lately,\" Ms. Goldstein says. \"Folks with engineering back-grounds, manufacturing, M&A expertise, technology \u2014 everything that the health system is going through now, chances are someone else in an-other industry has experienced these challenges already to some degree.\" n4 Objectives Hospitals Must Pursue to Shift Successfully to Value-Based Care By Bob Herman NEW!

DB pensions, in which an organization is re-sponsible for both contributing and investing funds, are a dying breed among many companies today. Many have switched to defined contribu-tion plans, which put more of the investment and funding onus on the employee. However, Moody's said 72 percent of its 460 non-profit hospitals it rates offer DB pension plans . As pension obligations have mounted, hospi-tals have turned to several strategies to mitigate those pension risks. Moody's analysts outlined seven particular strategies that non-profit hospi-tals are engaging most right now. 1. Freeze the DB pension plan, and transition employees to a DC plan. Mov- ing to a DC plan minimizes expenses and liabili-ties, and it also frees up hospital capital for other investments. However, Moody's analysts said this strategy may negatively impact employee satisfaction and result in higher turnover. 2. Increase voluntary employer cash contributions to the plan. Injecting more cash helps maintain a hospital's pension plan funding level and could be more feasible to-day, as many hospitals have higher-than-normal amounts of cash on hand. However, bigger pen-sion cash contributions come at the expense of lower liquidity. 3. Offer a hybrid retirement plan. Cash balance plans, which have elements of both DB and DC plans, have been utilized in many hospi-tals and health systems and reduce the volatility associated with investments. 4. Introduce structural modifications to an active plan. Some hospitals have made changes to their DB plan formulas by increas-ing the number of years of pay, raising the age when employees are eligible to retire or reducing overtime and bonus pay. 5. Change investment allocation of pension assets. Some hospitals and health systems are hedging against interest rate risk by using alternative investment strategies, such as a liability-driven investment. 6. Issue pension funding bonds or pri- vate placement borrowing to fund the plan. States and local governments commonly issue debt to fund their pension liabilities, but when it comes to the healthcare sector, usually this option is reserved for larger health systems with positive credit ratings. Rochester, Minn.-based Mayo Clinic and Boston-based Partners HealthCare, for example, have implemented this strategy in the past few years. 7. Terminate the DB plan. This strategy is usually a last resort, as closing a DB plan re- quires all benefits to be paid out. It can be costly, and according to the report, \"terminating a plan can also create a contentious labor environment, particularly for unionized employees, making it a very difficult strategy to implement.\" n The IRS released a new proposed rule loosening penalties on the health law's requirement for non-profit hospitals to submit a com-munity health needs assessment, granting some waivers for minor infractions and giving hospitals a window of time to repay taxes if they don't meet stiffer criteria to keep their tax exemptions. In the proposed rule, the tax collecting agency agreed it would not penal- ize small errors in community needs filings and would cap excise taxes at $50,000 for inadequate community needs reports. Factors the agency will consider in that determination include: the size, significance or repetition of the failure; existing and adjusted safeguards intended to ensure compli-ance; and correction and self-report of the failure. Multi-hospital non-profit systems and their member hospitals will be per - mitted to retain their tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status, but noncompliant hospi- tals' activities will become taxed as C Corporation. Such a penalty will not by itself affect tax-exempt bond status.Previously, hospitals were required to address all identified health needs, but the latest guidance from the agency requires hospitals to name and draft a course of action for prioritized health needs, including programs and resources allocated to need, the anticipated impact and the intended method to evaluate outcomes, as well as planned collaboration with other healthcare organizations. As in previous guidance, hospitals will need to justify why deprioritized ones will not be addressed in their plan. CHNA reports, in addition to implementation strategies required in earlier guidance, must be approved by an authorized body, including a hospital committee, governing body or an individual authorized by the governing body. The reports will also need to be made publicly available for six years after they are issued, twice as long as earlier guidance required. Adding increased specificity and clarity to its earlier proposed rule, the IRS defined medically underserved populations as those with health disparities or at risk of low use of healthcare services due to their language, income, geographic or other barriers. nTop 7 Strategies for Non-Profit Hospitals to Mitigate Pension Plan Risk: Moody's By Bob Herman IRS Cuts Non-Profit Hospitals Slack, Adds Requirements on Community Needs Assessments By Jim McLaughlin35 Executive Briefing: Leading Alignment Through Data Improvement The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is greatly impact - ing how leadership \u2014 both inside and outside of healthcare or - ganizations \u2014 view healthcare data. To promote transparency, on May 8, HHS published hospital charge data to the public, with no context for understanding that data. Charge data is the information used in hospital and healthcare claim documents, a central part of the revenue cycle. In effect, the publishing of hospitals' charge data served to fan the flames of controversy. This unprecedented action intensifies the urgency that healthcare organizations ensure their data is ready for prime-time examination. The requirement of greater visibility and data governance in healthcare organizations of all sizes is driven by regulations, reductions and reform, coupled with the need to mitigate serious compliance risk from data errors. All in all, this presents an extraordinary opportunity for healthcare leaders to drive change by improving their organizations' data quality and integrity. All healthcare leaders know they must find ways to increase operational ef - ficiency and optimize appropriate revenue while remaining competitive and compliant. Understandably, leaders are challenged in how to best achieve these reform goals, particularly in a transparent way. Where to start? Charge data is an excellent place to begin. Charges re- side in the chargemaster, which is the central control point in the revenue cycle. Charge data must be current, correct, normalized and compliant.

Charge compliance penalties and consequences are already very serious, and they continue to ramp up. The Medicare Recovery Auditor program began in October 2009. Since then, $4.5 billion has been recouped from hospitals and providers in Medicare overpayments, according to the newest RAC figures from CMS through April 2013. Without a reliable charge capture and verification process, poor coding and missed charges continue to cost organizations a fortune, not only in compliance risk and lost reimbursement, but also in the major administra-tive expense of reworking claims, managing denials and audits, and com-municating with payors about data issues and errors. Being prepared for external audits encompasses ensuring that the strategy, process and team are in place for peak revenue integrity performance. Leading an effective revenue integrity initiative will mitigate compliance risk while delivering greater operational efficiency and optimal appropriate reimbursement. Revenue integrity \u2014 Turn-ing data challenges into opportunities In today's healthcare landscape, in order to manage the challenges presented by historic industry change while providing quality care and improving financial performance, it is vital that healthcare organizations imple - ment a well-developed revenue integrity process. This process engages teamwork across hospital departments, and its physi-cian groups, in order to ensure accurate data management and effective documentation. Now is the time to ensure that the cross-functional team, strategic process and tools needed for effective data management are in position for ensuring revenue integrity. Don't sink, get in sync. How? First, deter - mine the right questions to ask and the in- sights needed from your data. To improve performance, you need to define the data reports needed, ob- tain a prioritized list of action items and engage a multidisciplinary team with clear processes and accountability supported by reference, workflow and automated data normalization tools. Examples of key tools needed are software programs that enable health- care provider organizations to score their health data progress and software that produces reports that can be used to show physicians and clinicians how they can improve their documentation for compliance with evolving rules and regulations. Effective use of such data reports enables the building of greater align- ment among clinicians and physicians, which enhances an organization's agility for successfully adapting to a rapidly changing payment environ - ment. Missed charges are a primary source of revenue leakage. The lack of ac- countability and understanding of the compliance impact of these errors are key roadblocks to ensuring all legitimate reimbursement is captured and accurately converted into charges. Successful organization-wide pro - cess improvements for charge capture not only uncover data that enables physicians and clinicians to clearly see the impact of their actions and how to improve their clinical documentation that is required to defend revenue in an audit, but it also improves communication and accountability organi-zation-wide to achieve revenue integrity excellence. The more thorough the data and workflow analysis, the greater the value that can be uncovered while providing a clearer picture of what's working, what's not or what needs to be addressed before it turns into a problem for the organization. From clean data with current, informed, localized context, business insights can be readily derived to support better decisions and apply resources more efficiently. Organizing a data and revenue integrity team The drive for data and revenue integrity requires a cross-functional team with a broad range of knowledge. Because of different roles and exper - tise, a member from each department should be included in the workflow analysis. Engaging diverse staff members in the process and communicat - ing executive leadership's support behind the team's initiative are vital for success. Consider including representatives from the clinical departments, materials management, patient access, pharmacy, revenue cycle, compli- ance and insurance/payment specialists who can work together as a multi - disciplinary team. Data analysis using workflow To help ensure the most effective data analysis possible, there are industry best practices that can be followed: Approach the analysis from a goal-achieving perspective, using established goals at the outset, each one with a specific measure of success. Data analy-sis can help identify where breakdowns are occurring. When initial goals are reached, analysis can help determine ways to reach greater goals. Support your team with an effective automated workflow. Workflow helps ensure that correct data are being collected and that the person collecting and verifying set of data is the appropriate person. Ensure each partici - pants are accountable for their role and that they have access to current reference information and tools for their particular task. Check data flow. An important aspect of workflow analysis is ensuring that data are being moved to the right people at the right time, using the right process. It is important to verify that this transfer of data is taking place. Especially with today's electronic health records, the validation of data for accuracy and charge compliance using software is critical. Without an automated review and validation, for example, how would anyone find a typographical error in a dispensing cabinet, or a lab machine with data capture problems? Both of these issues result in data not making their way into the patient record. Without a reconciliation and verification process The publishing of hospitals' charge data served to fan the flames of controversy. This unprecedented action intensifies the urgency that healthcare organizations ensure their data is ready for prime-time examination.38 Executive Briefing: Leading Alignment Through Data Improvement supported by software tools, no one inside the healthcare organization will know about the recurring errors; yet, when external auditors perform their automated and semi-automated reviews, they will spot missing or error-ridden charges by comparing common procedure charges across multiple healthcare organizations. This results in compliance issues for healthcare organizations that are often expensive to manage. Sustainability Success now and into the future requires people, processes and technolo - gies that are focused on preventing data errors, reducing revenue leakage and ensuring data and revenue integrity. Revenue leakage is the difference between the amount of revenue that providers are entitled to and the amount of reimbursement they eventually receive. Overall, the inconsis-tencies, inaccuracies and inefficiencies in outdated business processes are causing revenue leakage. To ensure that business processes follow the current, industry-defined best practices, it is vital to support people with tools they can efficiently use to prevent data capture errors, and ensure data and revenue integrity. Tools that enable staff and managers to show their results in terms of reduced compliance risks and improved reimbursement, while working more ef - ficiently, empower both an individual's work performance and his or her organization's overall financial performance. The goals for charge data today are that charges are current, accurate, clean and lean \u2014 with nothing more in the chargemaster than absolutely neces - sary, in order that the organization's charges remain an asset, and do not become a liability. Charges require maintenance to remain current with changing rules and regulations. Maintenance is required. Every year end with new code changes Quarterly with OPPS quarterly updates Any time procedures expire or new procedures are added When the facility or auditor detects a pattern of incorrect charging Leadership must evaluate the proper balance between centralized and de - centralized elements in its systems to achieve optimal accuracy, efficiency, compliance and legitimate reimbursement. Many healthcare organizations are consoli-dating and standardizing their internal charge audit process across their enterprise. Their revenue integrity strategy encompasses build-ing a centralized internal audit team; edu - cating on best practices; and establishing a proactive approach to managing audits and compliance through a robust internal audit and monitoring program that encompasses hospitals' departments, physicians' practices and clinics. Achieving both quality and cost goals in a transparent way is challenging, especially in a time of declining reimbursement, rising com-petition, non-standardized metrics and grow - ing demand for services. Using automated tools to ensure the accuracy and complete - ness of EHR data as it translates into charges quickly enables the identification, prioritization and management of issues that directly impact revenue and compliance goals. As a result of a consis - tent revenue integrity program, the data emerges that is necessary to proac - tively implement sustainable process improvements in a changing industry. Ensuring data and revenue integrity supported by automation is integral to optimal financial performance in this new era of healthcare. n Success now and into the future requires people, processes and technologies that are focused on preventing data errors, reducing revenue leakage and ensuring data and revenue integrity.

She wants to get there with just enough time to run on the plane,\" he says. The difference doesn't stir up too many problems, but it does paint a picture of two people with different senses of urgency. To Mr. Studer, getting on the plane is of utmost importance. To Mrs. Studer, however, Mr. Studer is overreacting. The same dynamic plays out in many hospitals. Often, there are dramatic differences in urgency at different levels of leadership. However, C-suite leaders don't always realize this \u2014 they may be - lieve there is more urgency in the workforce than there really is. While mid-level leaders may think senior leaders are overreacting, the senior leaders may be underestimating the degree of compla-cency that exists elsewhere in the organization. \"Complacency is much more common than people may think,\" says Mr. Studer. \"And until recently, that complacency has been very diffi - cult to objectively measure.\" Sometimes, the problem can even manifest itself in subtle ways, such as leaders showing up late to meetings. Mr. Studer recently diagnosed a hospital as complacent when he was lost among its halls. \"It was obvious I was lost, but nobody was anx-ious to show me where I should go,\" he recalls. While missing the occasional flight may not be the end of the world in a marriage, the same isn't true for failing to quickly respond to the de - mands reshaping the healthcare industry. In hos-pitals, an urgency disconnect can be devastating. Even a subtle sign of complacency is a glaring red flag \u2014 especially if it starts in the C-suite and moves its way down. Studer Group has assessed more than 26,000 hospital leaders from small to large systems about their sense of urgency. When C-suite leaders were asked to rate the difficulty of the next five years on a scale of one to 100, they re-sponded with an average rating of 92, meaning \"they almost all think the next five years will be very difficult,\" says Mr. Studer. C-suite leaders were also asked to look back and rate the dif-ficulty of the previous five years. That rating sat closer to 70. But here is where the gap widens. When leaders outside the C-suite \u2014 from supervisors through directors \u2014 rated the difficulty of the next five years, their responses averaged at about 70. When they looked back on previous five years, they rated the difficulty closer to a 60. \"Yes, senior leaders think the next five years will be more difficult, but not near the level of the CEOs' urgency,\" explains Mr. Studer. \"CEOs get frustrated because they're sitting there thinking, 'Where's their urgency?' And the supervisors, managers and directors are thinking, 'Why are they overreacting? Once again, the sky is falling.'\" \"It's like anything in life,\" he adds. \"If people think something is going to be difficult, they'll be better prepared. Then, even if it turns out not as difficult as they thought it would be, they'll be OK. But people who don't think it will be difficult won't be prepared...and that's when damage occurs.\" As part of another assessment, Studer Group asked senior leaders the following question: \"If your organization continues as it is today \u2014 with the same processes, cost structure, efficiencies, patient care volume, productivity, and techniques \u2014 will the results over the next five years will be much worse , worse , same , better, or much better?\" \"Members of the C-suite see that question and think it's obvious,\" says Mr. Studer. \"They say, 'Of course if you stay the same, results are going to get much worse.'\" The scenario is comparable to an adult maintain- ing the same spending habits stay while experi-encing a decline in income, he adds. Obviously, that individual's financial conditions will worsen. But this finding takes CEOs by surprise, some - times to the point of expressing genuine dis- belief, says Mr. Studer: On average, 37 percent of respondents below the C-suite level feel that if they continue to work in the same way, their hospitals' results will stay the same, get better or get much better. And that 37 percent is only an average \u2014 Mr. Studer worked with one hospi-tal where 45 percent of people said that if their performance remained the same, their organiza - tion's results would stay the same. The implication is clear: many organizations are suffering from a complacency epidemic at a time when urgency needs to be at an all-time high. 5 cures for complacency The good news is organizations can prevent, re- duce or cure complacency and get everyone's ur - gency levels more aligned. Mr. Studer offers the following strategies for doing just that. 1. Start by sharing information. Members of the C-suite are surrounded by different dis- cussions, resources and professional events from those of managers, supervisors and other leaders. CEOs frequent roundtable events and conferenc - es, where they discuss the healthcare environment with peers and other like-minded experts. They read extensive literature on healthcare reform, are attuned to statewide hospital advocacy ef-forts and are highly involved in strategic planning. On the other hand, managers and other leaders outside of the C-suite may be pressed enough by keeping up with their day-to-day work. \"Due to their environment, C-suite executives often fall into the trap of believing people see healthcare the same way they do,\" says Mr. Studer. Instead of introducing a medley of improvement initiatives to bridge the gap in urgency, Mr. Studer recommends CEOs and members of the C-suite start from a simple place. First, convince other leaders outside of the C-suite that they actually need to change. For instance, provide them with a resource toolkit or information packet that il-lustrates the root causes for the C-suite's urgency. \"When CEOs attend panels or conferences, they sometimes don't bring detailed information back to other leaders because they assume those lead-ers already see it as they do,\" says Mr. Studer. \"If I see clouds coming overhead, I don't necessarily feel the need to tell people it's going to rain. But maybe they've been trapped inside for a long time and don't see those clouds. We just can't assume that others see the environment the way we see it.\" This packet should be a collection of financial data, healthcare studies, whitepapers and other resources that drive C-suite discussions. Mr. Studer recommends CFOs also put together Urgency Emergency: 5 Ways CEOs Can Cure Complacent Hospitals By Molly Gamble 40 Sign up for the COMPLIMENTARY Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 PowerPoint slides, \"just like they would show to the board of directors.\" The CEO should hold town hall meetings with managers to discuss the CFO's slides, healthcare policy topics and other documents in the informa-tion packet. A combination of resources presented in different formats will accommodate visual and audio learners. 2. Vividly illustrate what will happen to the organization if per- formance stays the same. This dynamic occurs every day in hospitals and physician offices across the country. Medical providers clearly outline the risks patients face if they do not improve their diet, increase their daily exercise or stop smoking, among other habits. It's up to CEOs and other leaders to rou-tinely do the same thing for their organizations in terms of economic health. \"Physicians are really good at this,\" says Mr. Studer. \"They might say to a patient, 'You don't have to change, but if you don't, there will be serious consequences.'\" Like physicians, members of the C-suite need to provide leaders with specific and data-driven forecasts. The fact is, people resist organizational change. To counter this tendency, leaders need to clearly show the repercussions their hospitals face if changes aren't made. For example, one hospital CFO took financial data for his organization and deconstructed the outlook into simple terms for managers. His forecast turned out to be quite eye-opening. \"He said, 'If we continue to work the same way, tomorrow we'll have a 5.2 percent operating margin. In three years, we'll break even. In four years, we'll lose money. Five years? Our bond ratings will lower. And in six years, we'll be in a death spiral,'\" recounts Mr. Studer. After presentations such as this one, leaders will return to their work with a clear understanding of where they are headed if their performance, habits and productivity do not change. 3. Demonstrate changes managers must make and acknowl- edge how uncomfortable the transition will be. Leaders cannot just tell people the future is gloomy and expect that fear to drive change. Senior-level leaders and members of the C-suite must take caution and not overwhelm the workforce. There is a difference between creating a sense of urgency and creating a sense of anxiety. \"If senior leaders are overwhelmed, the rest of the organization feels it,\" says Mr. Studer. Instead of expecting dire forecasts to drive performance improvements, you also need to give people actions they can take after they get afraid. For example, if you're working on patient safety, say 'Here are the steps we can take to ensure patient safety.' Giving them something to do, something that's proven to get results, makes all the difference.\"4. Reevaluate and redesign leader evaluation tools. Over time, Mr. Studer has learned that most hospitals' evaluation tools do not include weights or prioritizations. This is a mistake: Treating goals evenly creates confusion. Weights can help reduce anxiety and clarify what leaders should focus on. A manager might have anywhere from 20 to 30 goals. Mr. Studer says, ideally, managers should have no more than seven, and each of those should be weighted. For example, one organization might be experiencing too many cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia. If 30 percent of the CNO's performance evaluation is based on reducing hospital-acquired pneumonia by a certain percentage point, the CNO will understand the urgency of the problem. This is something that requires more of his or her time and effort. Leaders should create an understanding among managers that if their per - formance remains the same as in years past, they will not have the same evaluation results. Continuing to give positive results when clinical quality has not improved or costs haven't been reduced reinforces the idea that there's no need to change. \"In the past, a leader might have been able to manage labor at a certain cost and received a good evaluation for managing labor at that cost,\" he says. \"But now, knowing costs need to be reduced, the hospital might take 3 per - cent out of that manager's expenses. So if that manager performs the same as last year, his or her evaluation will reflect the lack of improvement.\" 5. Look at the \"door-openers\" in incentive pay. Incentive com- pensation usually includes two or three door-openers. These goals, if achieved, ensure eligibility for incentive pay. The amount of incentive pay each leader receives will differ depending on his or her contribution, but mere eligibility is reliant upon these door-openers. If hospital leaders are frustrated with what they consider to be a lack of urgency throughout their organization, it's time to reexamine what goals will trigger eligibility for incentive pay. In fact, Mr. Studer has adopted a new door-opener for his own organiza - tion this year. For the first time, Studer Group will document whether it saves organizations at least $3 for every $1 spent on the company's services. To determine whether the company meets this three-to-one ratio, client CFOs must sign off on documentation. \"Unless we get three-to-one, 160 people won't be eligible for incentive compensation,\" says Mr. Studer. \"Ev-ery employee is in the same boat.\" Hospital leaders may want to build HCAHPs results into their incentive com- pensation by turning specific metrics into door-openers. For instance, unless HCAHPs results hit a certain level for \"patients who rate hospital nine or 10,\" incentive compensation will not open. \"That's my recommendation,\" says Mr. Studer. \"When you do that, it really shows you're serious about it.\" Mr. Studer cites John P . Kotter, former professor at Harvard Business School in Boston and author of \"A Sense of Urgency,\" when he said that the biggest mistake people, and inherently organizations, make when trying to change is this: They didn't create a high enough sense of urgency among enough people to set the stage to make a challenging leap in a new direction. Hospital and health system executives must strike the perfect cord by ignit - ing a sense of productive urgency within their organizations while prevent - ing anxiety, panic or defeat. To achieve this, executives should bridge gaps in information regarding the external environment, concisely communicate a data-driven forecast for the organization if improvements aren't made, acknowledge the discomfort that lies within change, restructure evaluation metrics and redesign door-openers in incentive compensation to mirror the organization's biggest obstacles. \"These five strategies will help hospitals avoid complacency and forge ahead as engaged organizations prepared for a demanding healthcare envi-ronment,\" says Mr. Studer. n REGISTER T ODAy!

For example, the federal sequester spurred a nationwide 2 percent Medicare cut, and various states also have cut hospital funds. Further potential reduction to hospital and health sys - tem profits and operating budgets stems from the shift from fee-for-ser - vice to a pay-for-performance environment. Healthcare organizations have taken different approaches historically to cutting costs to meet budget constraints, usually focusing heavily on sup-ply chain costs. \"There's always been a sort of piecemeal approach to cost management,\" says Dan Piro, president of Advisory Solutions for MedAs-sets, a healthcare performance improvement company. \"But that was always based on the foundation of having fee-for-service reimburse-ment, which healthcare as a whole is moving steadily away from.\" Because of the dramatic industry shift, Mr. Piro recommends ditching a focus on individual sup-ply chain cost silos and instead going for a com-prehensive approach to lower the total cost of care and better align those costs to reimburse-ment. Comprehensive changes It can seem like staggering task to achieve com-prehensive change in all aspects of a healthcare organization. In order to become more efficient and lower the total cost of care, it involves changing the underlying cost structure and even culture. While comprehensive change is massive, Mr. Piro warns it is important to start now. \"If you don't think about it at the core of the organiza - tion up, you probably won't get to the level of change needed to be suc - cessful in the new landscape,\" he says. \"Making simple cost reductions will no longer be enough. You need to take a system-wide, continuum of care view to controlling costs and improving efficiency and outcomes to gain sustainable long-term organizational success.\" San Antonio-based University Health System is one system that heeded the market's warnings and decided to make some major changes. \"We were seeing state- and federal-level cuts and decided to continue to plan for reductions in payments,\" says Christann Vasquez, executive vice president and COO of University Health System. \"We started looking for answers.\"At first, University Health System considered taking the \"traditional\" ap-proach of cutting costs. \"Initially, we looked at supplies and standardiza - tion,\" says Ms. Vasquez, but then system leaders realized the opportunities for change expanded beyond those traditional cost silos. University Health System eventually teamed with MedAssets to help guide the system in its journey to transform its operations, finances and culture. Vasquez adds, \"A health system can no longer make these significant changes on its own. System-wide changes need to occur simultaneously across the organization in an aligned and proven method. It was the right course to engage a third party with deep expertise to help lead us through this process and significantly augment my team.\" Through the collaborative business relationship, MedAssets and University Health System tackled several initiatives, including: Managing supply expenses Improving clinical resource utilization and standardization Improving labor expense management Changing culture through Lean Enhancing revenue through an expedited claims processComprehensive Healthcare Transformation Requires Comprehensive Change By Heather PunkeSponsored by: \"Making simple cost reductions will no longer be enough. y ou need to take a system-wide, continuum of care view to controlling costs and improve efficiency and outcomes to gain sustainable long-term organi- zational success.\" - Dan Piro, President, Advisory Solutions, is a registered trademark MedAssets 2013. All rights reserved.MedAssets on: 43 Executive Briefing: Total Process Transformation University Health System is a little more than a year into its three year agreement with MedAssets, but it has already seen major improvements in cost and enhanced revenue. In the first 14 months, University Health System has saved $16.2 million in costs, accelerated cash flow by $14 mil-lion, reduced average length-of-stay, increased cash collections by $48 mil-lion over previous year levels, and overall tracked expenses per discharge declined 3.5 percent. Even with all of that achievement, the system is not yet satisfied and is con- tinually looking at ways to further improve. \"We [used to] think we didn't need to find things to fix, but now we always are. That's part of the cultural change,\" says Ms. Vasquez. Partnering up A large part of the transformation success University Health System real-ized is due to its initial decision to bring in a single outside company as op-posed to an endless line of suitors, says Ms. Vasquez. \"It was best to have one partner in this endeavor...instead of introducing flavors-of-the-week,\" she says. \"It also was essential for us to tap into a company with experts that had seen our issues hundreds or thousands of times. We no longer had the luxury of time to figure out answers, or learn from our mistakes.\" Besides bringing consistency to a large ongoing project, a single outside ex- pert can bring many more advantages to a hospital or health system during a comprehensive transformation, including the following: National expertise. Typically, executives and man - agers in a hospital or health system are experts in their field on a local or state level, but few have experience on the national scale. That's where a partner can come in handy: \"[A partner ] can bring in someone who has expertise dealing with operations on a national level,\" says Ms. Vasquez. Ability to retain focus. When a hospital is in the midst of making major changes to its operations and finances, it can be easy to get caught up in the big picture and leave the day-to-day opera - tions in the wayside \u2014 not the ideal for an or - ganization seeking future and current success. \"A pragmatic consulting firm is an extra set of hands, because [leaders] have their day jobs too,\" says Mr. Piro. \"You have to make payroll at the same time as you're making fundamental changes.\" The consulting team can keep a close eye on the overall long-term changes happening throughout the organization, taking some of the pressure off of the organization's own leaders so they can focus on their normal, day-to-day responsibilities without being overwhelmed. What to look for. While an outside firm can provide the benefits detailed above, it is important for hospital and health system leaders to find the right one for the organization. Not every consulting company will be the right fit for every organization. The following are a few key elements healthcare leaders should seek out when looking for a company to help their organizations transform. Trust. It is the most important thing to look for in a potential company. Making comprehensive change with an outside party requires opening up the entire hospital, which can be difficult without a level of trust. \"There needs to be a level of mutual respect and understanding,\" says Mr. Piro, in order for the relationship to be successful. Compatibility. Along with trust, organizations and their potential consul - tants also need to be able to work together in a compatible way in order to achieve success. The consultant firm should not just tell you what you \"should do,\" but help to make the pragmatic changes needed. \"They se - lected people [to work with us] that fit into our culture,\" says Ms. Vasquez of the MedAssets staff selected for the University Health System engage - ment. \"Having the right mix [of people] made it work so well.\" Tools. Mr. Piro encourages healthcare leaders to ask the following question before settling on a company: What are the tools in their tool bag that will augment the relationship and make the change successful? A viable potential outside consultant should bring in data and insights and the analytical tools to help organizations benchmark not only against national data, but against local market competitors and similar organizations in their operating region. Well-rounded knowledge . Success in the new healthcare system requires unlock- ing insight within and the interconnections among financial, operational and clinical performance. Any outside company engaged needs to have the ability to look and work across the organization versus just \"silo expertise.\" Healthcare is making a comprehensive change, and hospitals and health systems should be straying from their usual focus on change within silos to making comprehensive, organization-wide change. Finding the right com-pany to assist in the change can put healthcare organizations on the fast track to future and sustainable success in the new world. n \"System-wide changes need to occur simultaneously across the organization in an aligned and proven method.\" - Christann Vasquez, COO, University Health System MedAssets (NASDAQ: MDAS) helps healthcare organizations to improve financial strength through innovative revenue cycle, spend and clinical resource management solutions that enable improved margins, cash flow, quality of care and patient satisfaction.

Somehow, somewhere, without re-alizing it, that person has developed the habit of not being able to look anyone in the eye. This is off-putting. People who can't \u2014 or won't \u2014 maintain eye contact are handicapping themselves. I don't think this is a rare phenomenon. We live in a world where people are constantly looking at their smartphones, even in the middle of a conversa-tion, at meetings or at home relaxing with their families. And when people put their phones away, they tend to get diverted by something across the room. We are a society full of distractions, and that makes it harder to com-municate well and build strong relationships. When you're in the exam room, your doctor may be staring at the electronic medical record on his or her laptop while taking your physical. How suc - cessful is the doctor going to be in drawing you out? Or at a business meet - ing, potential clients are doodling as you make a proposal. How trusting are you going to feel toward someone who can't look you in the eye? I've even had people show up to talk about a job who avoid eye contact the whole time. Not a winning strategy! Eye contact may seem very trivial. After all, if I can't look you in the eye, aren't we still going to connect in some other way? We might, but it won't have the same impact. Your eyes express the depths of your soul. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"When the eyes say one thing, and the tongue an- other, a practiced man relies on the language of the first.\" Great leaders know how important it is to look people in the eye. Bill Clinton is famous for making you feel that you are the most important person in the room. This skill is not as simple as it may seem. I have a dear friend who knows she has a problem with eye contact, but try as she may, she can't keep it up for long. An article in a recent issue of The Wall Street Journal titled, \"Just Look Me In the Eye Already,\" 1 shows this is complicated and nuanced territory. According to the Journal article, adults make eye contact 30 to 60 percent of the time in an average conversation, but to create an emotional bond, they should be making eye contact 60 to 70 percent of the time. When people withhold eye contact out of carelessness or disrespect, it speaks volumes. Constantly checking your smartphone during a meeting has the same im-pact as not showing up for half the meeting, an expert told the Journal. People have grown accustomed to communicating without making eye contact. They talk on the phone, email, tweet and text-message. When couples converse in the car or watch TV , they look straight ahead. We don't have much face time anymore, and eye contact is becoming a kind of lost art. When we are called upon to do it, it doesn't come so easily anymore. I was raised in a household where I could get into trouble if I didn't look my parents in the eye. When I went into sales, it quickly became appar - ent that if you want to influence people, you better pay close attention to eye contact, because it conveys your confidence in the other person. \"Prolonged eye contact during a debate or disagreement can signal you're standing your ground,\" an expert in the Journal article said. It also indicates your rank in society: Those in a higher status tend to look longer at the people they are talking to. Of course, there can be too much eye contact. The Journal said eye contact lasting more than 10 seconds can seem \"aggressive, empty and inauthen- tic.\" A study showed that when monitors gazed intently into participants' eyes while administering a test, it unnerved them so much that their ability to use their memory was impaired. There are also cultural taboos against eye con-tact. In many Eastern and some Caribbean cultures, looking into someone's eyes is thought to be rude. Asians may regard a person who makes pro - longed eye contact as an-gry or unapproachable. A seemingly simple thing turns out to be most complicated! Here are some things to remember about eye contact: 1. Listening is an important interpersonal skill, and good eye contact clearly shows your interest. 2. Maintaining eye contact can reduce tension in a conversation, show assertion and convey respect.3. When you meet people for the first time, give them your full eye contact and maintain it when you are saying good-bye. It will leave a lasting impression. 4. With any business associate or client, eye contact is mandatory! No excuses, no matter what the temptation is across the room. 5. Eye contact that goes on too long makes people uncomfort - able. Glance down occasionally and then quickly return your gaze.6. Use your eyes to convey emotions such as empathy or even disap- pointment. Not a single word has to be spoken! 7. Maintaining eye contact can be learned, like anything else. But it takes practice and is harder for some people than others. 8. If your gaze tends to wander, learn the discipline of focusing on one person at a time. You can practice in front of a mirror.9. Reduce digital distractions. Checking your smartphone definitely im- pedes eye contact and human interaction. 10. Solid eye contact with a smile is a winning combination that is hard to ignore. Use it as often as you can! In summary, eye contact can make the difference when trying to influence people. It will bring you rich rewards. Conversely, not showing respectful eye contact can cause misunderstandings and make you lose friends. Being aware of it is just a matter of common sense. Here's looking at you! n Footnotes: 1 Shellenbarger, S. (2013, May 29). \"Just Look Me in the Eye Already.' Wall Street Journal.
