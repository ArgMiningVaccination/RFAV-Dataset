Technically, vitamins, minerals, trace elements, amino acids, herbs, or homeopathic remedies are not classified as drugs. However, these substances can have significant effects on physiology and must be used rationally. Using Supplements Here at Richmond Integrative & Functional Medicine we provide nutritional counseling and make individualized recommendations regarding use of these supplements in order to upgrade the quality of foods in a patient's diet and to supply nutrition to support the physiological and biomechanical processes of the human body. Although these products may also be suggested with a specific therapeutic purpose in mind, their use is chiefly designed to support given aspects of metabolic function.
