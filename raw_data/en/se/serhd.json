On Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI September 1, 2020 John C. Neiman, Jr. Counsel of Record Thomas W.H. Buck, Jr. Brandt P. Hill MAYNARD COOPER & GALE, P.C. 1901 Sixth Avenue North 2400 Regions/Harbert Plaza Birmingham, AL 35203 (205) 254-1228 jneiman@maynardcooper.com Counsel for Petitioners i QUESTION PRESENTED To increase the dietary supplements available to the public, the Dietary Supplement Health and Edu- cation Act of 1994 (\"DSHEA\"), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7321(ff), amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. DSHEA's amendments allow manufacturers to sell supplements, without first obtaining FDA approval, if their ingredients are, among other things, \"constitu- ent[s]\" of \"herb[s] or othe r botanical[s].\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7321(ff)(1)(C) & (F). The dietary supplements at issue in this case contain an ingredient known as DMAA, which studies have shown occurs in geranium plants. The courts below held that, even if these studies are accurate, DMAA is not, as a matter of law, a \"constit- uent\" of a \"botanical\"\u2014and thus is not presumptively marketable as an ingredient in dietary supplements under DSHEA\u2014because these studies show that DMAA appears in geraniums only in trace quantities, and DMAA has no prior history of being directly ex- tracted from the plant for medicinal, cosmetic, or die- tary use. The question pr esented is as follows: Did the Eleventh Circuit err in holding that a substance that naturally occurs in a plant is not a \"constituent\" of an \"herb or other botanical\"\u2014and therefore cannot be included in presump- tively marketable dietary supplements under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act\u2014if the substance naturally occurs in the plant only in trace quantities and has no prior history of being extracted from the plant for medicinal, cosmetic, or dietary use? ii PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS Petitioners Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Jared Wheat were appellants below. Respondents United States Food and Drug Administration, United States Department of Health and Human Services, and United States of America were appellees below. Respondent Alex Azar, in his official capacity as Sec- retary of the Department of Health and Human Ser- vices, succeeded to that o ffice on January 29, 2018, at which time Secretary Azar was automatically substi- tuted as a party under Federal Rule of Appellate Pro-cedure 43(c)(2). Upon assuming office, Secretary Azar was an appellee below. Respondent Stephen M. Hahn, in his official capacity as Commissioner of the United States Food and Drug Administration, succeeded to that office on December 17, 2019, after the entry of judgment below, at which time Commissioner Hahn was automatically substituted as a party under Fed-eral Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2). iii CORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is not a publicly traded company. It has no parent company, and no company owns 10% or more of its stock. iv RELATED PROCEEDINGS This case arises from the following proceedings in the United States District Co urt for the District of Co- lumbia, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgi a, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, listed here in chronological order: Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.

Clayton County, Georgia , 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), this Court empha- sized that a statute's unamb iguous text governs even when it yields a result, as applied to a particular fac- tual setting, that a court suspects Congress might not have anticipated. In this case\u2014decided before Bos- tock\u2014the Eleventh Circuit did what Bostock said courts must not do. The Eleventh Circuit placed arti-f i c i a l r e s t r a i n t s o n p l a i n t e x t f o u n d i n t h e D i e t a r y Supplement Health and Education Act and adopted, in the place of the most st raightforward reading of the statute's language, what th e court deemed to be the \"safest conclusion\" about what Congress would have wanted if it had been confro nted with the specific facts of the case. App. A at 11a. The Eleventh Circuit's de- cision is at odds with DSHEA and the overarching principles that govern statutory interpretation, and the issue presented is of gr eat import to the dietary- supplement industry. This case thus would be worthy of review even if this Court had not decided Bostock in the meantime. But Bostock at least makes it appropri- ate to grant certiorari, to vacate the Eleventh Circuit's judgment, and to remand for that court to reconsider its reading of DSHEA. The statutory-interpretation question in this case is whether a chemical comp ound Petitioners syntheti- cally produce for inclusion as DMAA\u2014is a or other botanical\" under \u00a7321(ff)(1)(F) of DSHEA. If so, then DSHEA makes it 2 a \"dietary ingredient,\" which manufacturers may in- corporate into dietary supplements without first seek- ing and obtaining the FDA' s approval. The District Court and a divided Eleventh Circuit both held, on the Government's motion for summary judgment, that DMAA is not a \"constituent\" of an \"herb or other bo- tanical\" as a matter of law. But under any reasonable interpretation of DSHEA's language, Petitioners are entitled to a trial. The Eleventh Circuit recognized that this record reveals \"a genuine factual dispute over whether trace amounts of DMAA are naturally contained in geranium[]\" plants. App. A at 7a. Every- one agrees that the geraniums in which DMAA has been found are \"herb[s] or other botanical[s].\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7321(ff)(1)(C). Yet the Eleventh Circuit major- ity concluded that, even if DMAA naturally occurs in geraniums, it is not a \"const ituent\" of an \"herb or other botanical.\" As Judge Jordan noted in his dissent, that result was driven not by DSHEA's plain text and the ordi- nary understanding of the te rms \"constituent,\" \"herb,\" and \"botanical,\" but instead by the majority's \"policy\" concerns. App. A at 25a. Th e majority theorized that DSHEA makes constituents of herbs or other botani- cals marketable because \"consuming them is ordinar-ily safe\" and posited that \"[t]he fact that DMAA can be found in trace amounts in geraniums, if true, says absolutely nothing about whether consuming the sub- stance is safe.\" App. A at 11a, 12a. On that basis the majority read words into DSHEA, requiring not only that the compound be a \"constituent\" of an \"herb or other botanical,\" but also th at it be present in more 3 than \"trace amounts,\" and that it have a prior history of being \"derived\" from the plant for \"medicinal, cos- metic, or dietary\" products. App. A at 12a. It was of no consequence to the majority that the phrases \"trace amounts,\" \"derived,\" and \"medi cinal, cosmetic, or die- tary\" appear nowhere in the statutory text. Bostock makes clear that the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning cannot stand. Judge Jordan's dissent in-voked almost precisely the same language this Court would use 10 months later in Bostock : \"[T]he fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambi- guity. It demonstrates breadth.\" App. A at 26a (quot- ing Pa. Dep't of Corrections v. Yeskey , 524 U.S. 206, 212 cf. \"the fact that [a statute] has been applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress\" ' does not demon-strate ambiguity; instead, it simply ' \"demonstrates [the] breadth\" ' of a legislative command.\" (quoting Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co. , 473 U. S. 479, 499 (1985)). DSHEA's language broadly encompasses all constituents of botanicals\u2014including those that, like DMAA, appear in plants only in trace quantities and have not previously been extracted for medicinal, cos-metic, or dietary purposes. That should have been dis- positive. The need for this Court to correct the Eleventh Cir- cuit's misinterpretation is paramount, for a great deal is at stake. DSHEA's drafte rs recognized that dietary supplements are an important food source, and the Eleventh Circuit's decision will stifle innovation in the 4 industry. The FDA's record in attempting to take Pe- titioners' DMAA-containing supplements off the mar- ket raises serious concerns about regulatory over- reach. If this Court does not grant plenary review, it should at least grant certiorari, vacate the Eleventh Circuit's judgment, and remand for further consider-ation in light of Bostock. 5 OPINIONS BELOW The Eleventh Circuit's opinion is reported as United States v. Undetermined Quantities of All Arti- cles of Finished and In-Process Foods , 936 F.3d 1341 (C.A.11 2019), and reproduced at App. A at 1a-26a.

Hi-Tech and its CEO, Jared Wheat, intervened as claimants in that action. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71345, which gives \"the district civ il suits or proceed- ings commenced by the United States,\" and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7334(a)(1), which provides that the Government may proceed with Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act condem- nation actions \"in any district court of the United States or United States court of a Territory within the jurisdiction of which the article is found.\" The District Court entered final judgment, finding the DMAA-containing supplements subject to forfei- ture. App. C at 42a; App. B at 27a-29a. Hi-Tech and Wheat took a timely appeal, and the Eleventh Circuit had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71291. The panel en- tered final judgment, affirming the summary judg- ment, on August 30, 2019. See App. A at 21a. The Eleventh Circuit denied Hi-Tech and Wheat's timely application for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc on April 8, 2020. See App. D at 44a. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). Supreme Court Rule 13 made this petition due on July 7, 2020. This Court's Order of March 19, 2020, extended the deadline to file by 60 days, to Sep- tember 8, 2020. Hi-Tech and Wheat are filing this pe- tition within that timeframe. 7 STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED The key text from DSHEA states: For the purposes of this chapter . . . The term \"dietary supplement\" - means a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains on e or more of the follow- ing dietary ingredients: (A) a vitamin; (B) a mineral; (C) an herb or other botanical; (D) an amino acid; (E) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or (F) a concentrate, me- tabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described in clause (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7321(ff)(1). 8 STATEMENT OF THE CASE This case arises from th e FDA's seizure of millions of dollars' worth of DMAA- containing dietary supple- ments from Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The FDA instituted a forfeiture pr oceeding against the supple- ments in the Northern District of Georgia, and Hi- Tech and Jared Wheat, the company's principal owner and CEO, intervened as claimants. The FDA's theory as to why these supplements were not marketable shifted throughout the litigation. As explained below, eventually the FDA prevaile d on a ground that was distinct from the one the agency first advanced to seize these products. A. DSHEA's regulatory structure DSHEA is a 1994 law that reflected Congress's de- sire to make dietary supplements more available to the public. Before DSHEA, the Food, Drug, and Cos- metic Act (\"FDCA\") treated dietary supplements like drugs, in the sense that ma nufacturers had to embark on a costly and time-consuming process of obtaining FDA approval before marketing hem. Among other things, the FDCA required that a manufacturer prove to the FDA that its dietary supplements were safe for public consumption before it could market them. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7355 (pre-marke t approval process for drugs); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7101.13-14; 101.70. DSHEA changed this landscape from drugs. DSHEA categorizes \"dietary supplements\" as \"foods\" rather than \"drugs,\" which allows manufacturers to market them without first going through the FDA preapproval process. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7321(ff). The FDA ma y still remove a dietary 9 supplement from the market after a manufacturer has begun selling it, but only if the agency meets the demanding burden of proving that the supplement or one of its ingredients \"presen ts a significant or unrea- sonable risk of illness or injury under conditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling, or if no condi- tions are suggested or recommended in the labeling, under ordinary conditions of use.\" Id. \u00a7342(f)(1)(A)(i)- (ii). DSHEA thus withdrew what Congress deemed to be the \"unreasonable regulatory barriers\" that treated supplements like drugs. See Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-417, \u00a72(13)-(15)(A), 108 Stat. 4325 (1994). To this end, DSHEA defines \"dietary supplement\" expansively, to include any \"product\" that is \"intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more\" of a list of \"dietary ingredients.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7321(ff). Most critically for the purposes of the case, this list includes any \"constituent\" of an \"herb or other the diet by increasing \"combination\" of any of the aforementioned ingredients. Id. 10 B. DMAA's presence in geranium plants After DSHEA made dietary supplements contain- ing botanical constituents presumptively marketable, evidence emerged that DMAA\u2014a compound that pre-viously had been synthesized in laboratories for use in nasal decongestants\u2014occurs naturally in geranium plants. DMAA has energy-boosting effects much like caffeine's, and its inclusion in dietary supplements helps people work out harder and lose weight. Based on the evidence showing that DMAA is naturally pre- sent in geraniums, manuf acturers began including this ingredient in their dietary supplements. This evidence includes multiple peer-reviewed studies showing that DMAA naturally occurs in plants of the pelargonium genus, including in the oils of those plants. See App. A at 6a-7a; App. C at 34a; Thomas D. Gauthier, Evidence for the Presence of 1,3- Dimethylamylamine (1,3-DMA A) in Geranium Plant Materials, 8 A CHEMISTRY INSIGHTS 29-40 (2013), available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pmc/articles/PMC3682735/); Zang Ping et al., A Study on the Chemical Constituents of Geranium Oil , 25 J.

Li et al. , Identifi- and Quantification in Geranium Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry , 7 A NALYTICAL CHEMISTRY INSIGHTS 47 (2012); HL Fleming et al. , Analysis and Confirmation of 1,3-DMAA and 1,4-DMAA in Geranium Plants Us- ing High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry at ng/g Concentrations , 7 ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY INSIGHTS 59 (2012). These plants have been consumed for hundreds of years in 11 certain parts of the world, often as a dressing on a salad or dessert. C. The FDA's shifting positions on DMAA This case arose when th e FDA seized Hi-Tech's DMAA-containing supplements, claiming that they were not presumptively marketable under DSHEA. The FDA then filed an acti on seeking forfeiture of these supplements in the No rthern District of Geor- gia. But critically and tellingly, the FDA did not prem- ise these enforcement actions on the interpretation of DSHEA that the District Court and Eleventh Circuit majority eventually would adopt: the FDA did not claim that DMAA is not a \"con stituent\" of an \"herb or other botanical\" even if it naturally occurs in gerani- ums. The FDA instead contended that DMAA was not a \"constituent\" of an \"herb or other botanical\" on the premise that, as a factual matter, the studies dis-cussed above were simply wrong\u2014and that DMAA does not naturally occur in geraniums at all. But as the forfeiture action proceeded, the FDA's theory fell apart, and was even shown to have been based on fraudulent resea rch. The FDA had relied on one study funded by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (\"USADA\"), a non-governmental organization that decides which substances American athletes par- ticipating in international competitions are permitted to consume. Discovery revealed that USADA had lob- bied the FDA to ban DMAA for its own reasons and had funded this study to counter the studies finding DMAA in geraniums. See Mahmoud A. ElSohly et al. , Pelargonium Oil Methy l Hexaneamine (MHA): 12 Analytical orting the Absence of MHA in Authenticated Pelargonium Graveolens Plant Material and Oil , J. ANALYTICAL TOXICOLOGY 1 (2012). Discovery also revealed that the researchers who au- thored USADA's studies had, in fact, found low levels of DMAA in geraniums\u2014but had failed to disclose that finding in their final report after USADA officials told them that a \"low level\" should not be enough. Doc. 108-4 at p. 565. The final study instead represented that \"[n]one of the analyzed oils or the plant material (young and mature, fresh and dried leaves and stems) showed any detectable leve l of\" DMAA. Do c. 108-4 at pp. 572, 585. Discovery revealed similar flaws in other studies on which the FDA was relying. The FDA had cited a second paper by the same researchers, Mahmoud A. ElSohly et al. , Methylhexanamine is Not Detectable in Pelargonium or Geranium Species and Their Essen- tial Oils: A Multi centre Investigation , D RUG TESTING & ANALYSIS (2014). But in that study also, the re- searchers had detected low levels of DMAA in certain geraniums. See Doc. 108-5 at pp. 62-67 (email corre- spondence from Min Yang of the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica). As with th e first study, the authors did not report their findings, and instead used a higher \"detection level\" to claim that they had de- tected no DMAA in the plants. Still another study had similar problems. The original version concluded that DMAA naturally occurs in geraniums. See Doc. 108-5 at pp. 2-11. But the final version said, without any acknowledgement of the ear lier results, that it had 13 not found DMAA in the gerani ums \"with a limit of de- tection of 10 parts per billion.\" Ying Zhang et al. , 1,3 Dimethylamylamine (DMAA) and Ge- ranium Products: Natural or Synthetic? , DRUG TEST- ING ANALYSIS (2012). D. The District Court's ruling After the FDA seized Hi-Tech's dietary supple- ments and instituted its forfeiture action, Hi-Tech and Wheat intervened, claiming ownership interests in the seized products. 1 Following discovery, both sides moved for summary judgment. The FDA's claim was that, despite the flaws that had been revealed in the studies on which it had relied, the undisputed evi- dence showed that DMAA does not naturally occur in geraniums and therefore is not a \"constituent\" of an \"herb or other botanical\" under DSHEA. Hi-Tech, on the other hand, argued that the undisputed evidence shows that DMAA is naturally in geraniums, and thus is a \"constituent\" of an \"herb or other botanical.\" The District Court had little trouble discarding the FDA's theory. The District Court rejected the FDA's assertion that there was \"uncontroverted evidence that geraniums cannot make DMAA.\" App. C at 34a- 35a. The District Court inst ead concluded, based on 1 After the Government seized these dietary supplements but be- fore it filed the forfeiture action, Hi-Tech filed an action against the FDA and various federal officials in the District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause. See App. A at 2a-3a. That court transferred the action to the Northern District of Georgia, which consolidated it with the Government's forfeiture action. 14 the studies cited by Hi-Tech, that there is \"fairly sub- stantial evidence that trace amounts of DMAA have been found in a species of a geranium plant.\" App. C at 34a. But despite rejecting the FDA's suggestion that the record conclusively resolved the parties' factual dispute, the District Court nonetheless entered sum- mary judgment for the Government\u2014based on an in- terpretation of DSHEA that the FDA itself had never advanced. The District Court held that the evidence showing DMAA to be present in geranium plants did not establish that it was a dietary ingredient under DSHEA. That was so, in the District Court's estima- tion, because \"to be a botanical, [a] substance must have been extracted from a plant or plant-like organ- ism and used, for example, in or as a medicine.\" App. C at 36a. \"While very small amounts of DMAA might be present in geraniums,\" the District Court found, \"DMAA in the marketplace has never been extracted from geraniums or any othe r plant.\" App. C at 36a- 37a. 2 While recognizing that DSHEA allows dietary- supplement manufacturers to use synthesized ingre- dients in their products so long as those ingredients also occur naturally, the District Court found that, for a substance to be a \"botanical ,\" there must be \"at least 2 Because the Government had not argued that whether DMAA has a history of being derived fr om geraniums wa s relevant, the parties had conducted no discovery on the issue. See App. A at 3a. Hi-Tech and Wheat argued in their motion for reconsidera- tion that the District Court should allow them to conduct discov- ery on this issue. See App. A at 3a. The District Court denied that motion, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. See App. B at 29a; App. A at 17a-19a. 15 some history of the substanc e in question having been extracted in usable quantities\" from a plant. App. C at 37a. Under that standard\u2014and without considering whether DMAA, if not a botanical, is at least a \"con-stituent\" of a botanical\u2014the District Court concluded that \"DMAA is not a botanical and thus not a dietary ingredient.\" App. C at 37a. 3 Hi-Tech and Wheat filed a motion to reconsider, observing that the District Court had not addressed whether DMAA is, at the very least, a \"constituent\" of a botanical. The District Court denied the motion, ex-plaining that its analysis applied \"by extension\" to the question whether DMAA is a botanical \"constituent.\" App. B at 28a. E. The Eleventh Circuit's decision Hi-Tech and Wheat appealed, and a divided Elev- enth Circuit affirmed. See App. A at 2a-26a. The majority opinion, which was written by Judge Hinkle and joined by Judge Tjoflat, adopted a con-struction of DSHEA much like the District Court's. The majority acknowledged that a \"constituent\" of an \"herb or other botanical\" can be a dietary ingredient even when it is \"artificially manufactured\" for use in supplements. App. A at 13a. The majority also acknowledged that \"this record presents a genuine factual dispute over whether trace amounts of DMAA are naturally contained in geraniums.\" App. A at 7a. The majority likewise acknowledged that the term 3 The District Court addressed se veral other issues that are not pertinent here. See App. C at 38a-40a. 16 \"constituent\" could mean \"anything naturally con- tained in\" and noted also th at the term can mean \"an essential part.\" App. A at 10a. Yet after examining the text and ordinary meanings of the terms \"constituent\" and \"botanical,\" the court declared that \"[n]one of this is dispositive.\" App. A at 11a. It stated that the \"safest conclusion\" was that \"it is unlikely that Congress used the term 'constituent' to mean a substance that is pre- sent in a plant in only trace amounts and that has never been derived from a plant for use in any medic- inal, cosmetic, or dietary product.\" App. A at 11a. It reasoned that the \"fact that DMAA can be found in trace amounts in geraniums, if true, says absolutely nothing about whether consuming the substance is safe.\" App. A at 12a-13a. Judge Jordan dissented in pertinent part. See App. A at 22a-26a. Citing various dictionaries, he reasoned that \"the word 'botanical' contextually refers to a plant or part of a plant,\" and the term \"constituent\" means \"a component or element of a whole.\" App. A at 23a, 24a. He stated that the \"statutory text does not provide a basis for the district court's conclusion that a 'constituent' of a 'botanical' must have a history of being extracted in usable quantities, or for the major- ity's holding that to be a 'constituent' an ingredient must have been derived from a plant for use in a me- dicinal, cosmetic, or dietar y product.\" App. A at 24a- 25a. He \"[t]he majority's contrary inter- pretation\" of DSHEA \"seems influenced by policy rea- sons which call for a narrower reading of the statutory text,\" which he argued were \"not ours to consider.\" App. A at 25a. Instead, he concluded, \"[a]lthough the 17 statutory reading advocated by Hi-Tech is expansive, that reading squares with the broad language Con- gress chose.\" App. A at 26a. He therefore would have \"remand[ed] for a trial on whether DMAA\" does, in fact, naturally occur in geranium plants. App. A at 26a. 4 Hi-Tech and Wheat petitioned for panel and en banc rehearing, which the Eleventh Circuit denied. See App. D. 4 The Eleventh Circuit also addressed several other issues that are not the subject of this petition, including Hi-Tech and Wheat's argument that the District Court at least should have allowed them to conduct discovery on whether DMAA previously had been extracted from geraniums. See App. A at 14a-20a. 18 REASONS THIS COURT SHOULD GRANT CERTIORARI Shortly after the Eleventh Circuit denied rehear- ing in this case, this Court decided Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia , 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). The context there, and the question pres ented, were different from the ones now before the Court. But in resolving the specific issue Bostock presented, this Court empha- sized core principles of st atutory interpretation that govern all federal statutes. \"When the express terms of a statute give us one an swer and extratextual con- siderations suggest another, it's no contest,\" this Court explained: \"Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.\" Id. at 1737. There is no \"'canon of donut holes,'\" this Court stated, \"in which Congress's failure to speak directly to a spe- cific case that falls within a more general statutory rule creates a tacit exception.\" Id. at 1747. \"Instead, when Congress chooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule,\" this Court stressed, \"courts apply the broad rule.\" Id. Those statements stand as compelling criticisms of the Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of DSHEA\u2014 which, though not related to the fundamental civil-rights issue presented in Bostock , is important in its own right. In dissenting below, Judge Jordan invoked these same principles. The Eleventh Circuit had given DSHEA a \"narrower reading\" than its plain text al- lowed, he observed, App. A at 25a, based on a suspi- cion that it was \"unlikely\" Congress would have \"mean[t]\" for these terms to include substances that appear \"only in trace amounts\" and do not have a his- tory of being extracted from those plants, App. A at 9a 19 (majority op.). Out of its concern for what Judge Jor- dan rightly characterized as \"policy reasons,\" the ma- jority had effectively invoked what this Court in Bos- tock called \"the canon of donut holes,\" carving an ex- ception into the statute that kept DSHEA's broad text from applying in the specific circumstances of this case. App. A at 25a. The result not only runs contrary to the principles set forth in Bostock , but also will sti- fle innovation in the dietary-supplement industry in ways that run contrary to DSHEA's most fundamen- tal purposes. This Court should either grant plenary review or, at least, grant certiorari, vacate the Elev- enth Circuit's judgment, and remand for further con- sideration in light of Bostock . A. The Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of DSHEA is wrong and fundamentally con- trary to the principles set forth in Bostock The ordinary understanding of the phrase \"constit- uent\" of an \"herb or other botanical,\" as found in DSHEA, encompasses all substances that, like DMAA, naturally occur in geranium plants and their oils. There is no doubt that the geraniums and their oils in which DMAA has been detected are \"botani- cals\" for these purposes. Even the FDA conceded that one definition of \"botanical\" is a \"plant (or part of the plant).\" App. A at 23a (Jorda n, J., dissenting). And the ordinary meaning of \"constituent\" is \"'an element of a complex whole.'\" App. A at 24a (Jordan, J., dissenting) (quoting 1 S HORTER OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 496 (5th ed. 2002); see also App. A at 24a (noting alterna- tive definition as \"'a thing, person, or organism that 20 along with others serves in making up a complete whole or unit'\" (quoting W EBSTER 'S THIRD NEW INTER- NATIONAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE UN- ABRIDGED 258 (2002)). Those considerations mean that DMAA is a \"con- stituent\" of a \"botanical\" so long as it naturally occurs in geraniums and their oils. It is telling that, when the FDA seized these products and sought their forfeiture, it did not contend otherwis e. It did not argue that DMAA is not a \"constituent\" of a \"botanical\" because it appeared in geraniums on ly in trace quantities or did not have a history of being extracted from these plants. Its theory was, instead, that DMAA is not a \"constituent\" of a \"botanical\" because it does not natu- rally occur in geraniums at all . But discovery revealed that the studies on which the FDA based that theory were flawed and even fraudulent\u2014and that other studies stood as substantial evidence that, as the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged, \"trace amounts of DMAA are naturally contained in geraniums.\" App. A at 7a. The right result, as Judge Jordan's dissent ex- plained, was a remand for a \"trial on whether DMAA is,\" as a factual matter, \"a 'constituent' of geraniums.\" App. A at 26a (Jordan, J., dissenting). The Eleventh Circuit, like the District Court before it, headed off that result only by writing new words into DSHEA. The statute's text says that a presump-tively marketable dietary supplement can contain a \"constituent\" of an \"herb or other botanical.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7321(ff)(1). No more, no less . Yet the majority opinion judicially mandated an exception to that text, elimi-21 nating the marketability presumption when the con- stituent is, in the majority's words, \"present in a plant in only trace amounts\" and has previously \"never been derived from a plant for use in any medicinal, cos-metic, or dietary prod uct.\" App. A at 11a. That wordsmithing was the Eleventh Circuit's, not Congress's, and the majority opinion did not anchor this verbiage in any part of DSHEA's text. It did point to one dictionary that defines \"constituent\" as, among other things, an \"essential part,\" and from that defini- tion is \"usually not [as] broad\" as the meaning Hi-Tech had argued, which was \"anything naturally contained in.\" App. A at 10a. But the same dictionary also defines \"constit- uent\" as \"component.\" See \"Constituent,\" M ERRIAM - WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY (2019), https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constit-uent. And the fact that something appears in small quantities, even trace amounts, does not mean it is not \"essential\" in any event. Human bodies contain nu-merous \"trace elements\" that are present \"in only small still are \"vital for maintaining health.\" Sukhsatej Batra, Importance of Trace , S.F. C HRON . (Dec. 12, 2018), https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/importance - trace-elements-human-body-4864.html. If Congress believed that a certain \"essential\" amount of a compo- nent must be in a plant for it to be a \"constituent,\" DSHEA would have pegged that \"essential\" amount at a specific number, as statutes do in innumerable contexts. See, e.g. , 15 U.S.C. \u00a72697(a)(7)(C) (formalde- hyde thresholds in wood products). 22 Nor did the Eleventh Circuit provide a textual an- chor for its requirement that, to count as a \"constitu- ent,\" the plant component must have a prior history of being extracted for \"medicin al, cosmetic, or dietary\" purposes. App. A at 9a, 11a, 12a. What the Eleventh Circuit meant by this is unclear. The majority empha- sized that its ruling did \"n ot mean that DSHEA ap- plies only to products actually derived from plants,\" and did not doubt that, \"[i]f a product is indeed a die- tary supplement because it contains a qualifying die- tary ingredient\u2014including, for example, an herb or other botanical\u2014a manufacturer may,\" consistently with DSHEA, either \"take the dietary ingredient from nature or produce it artificially.\" App. A at 13a. Yet the majority held that, before such an ingredient can be considered a \"constituent\" of a botanical, it must have a history of previously being \"derived from\" that \"plant.\" App. A at 13a. That reasoning makes no sense and has no textual basis. The components of something are its constitu-ents, regardless of whether they have been physically separated from it in the past. Cf. Timothy P. Smith, Hidden Worlds: Hunting for Quarks in Ordinary Mat- ter 51 (P RINCETON UNIV. PRESS 2003) (calling quarks \"the basic constituents of matter\" even though science has \"never isolated a quark\" and perhaps \"never will\"). Although the majority suggested it would be \"awkward[]\" if \"constituent\" had a \"broad[er]\" scope than other substances DSHEA makes marketable\u2014substances that are derived directly from plants, App. A at 11a\u2014Judge Jordan rightly observed that \"words . . . connect[ed]\" in a this one in 23 DSHEA \"'are to be given separate meanings.'\" App. A at 25a (quoting Loughrin v. United States , 573 U.S. 351, 357 (2014)). Much more so than any textual consideration, the majority developed its exception to DSHEA's list of presumptively marketable supplements through the kind of extratextual reasoning this Court rejected in Bostock . Chief among the Eleventh Circuit's cited con- cerns was its belief that it was \"unlikely\" that Con- gress \"mean[t]\" for the term \"constituent\" to encom- pass a substance that, like DMAA, is \"present in a plant in only trace amounts and that has never been derived from a plant for use in any medicinal, cos-metic, or dietary product.\" App. A at 11a. Yet the Elev- enth Circuit cited no text or legislative history that would support any supposition that Congress had spe- cifically considered the matter, and this Court in Bos- tock emphasized that any surmise that \"few in\" Con- gress would have \"expected\" a result is no reason to deny what \"follows ineluctably from the statutory text.\" Bostock , 140 at 1750. As this Court ex- plained, \"it is ultimately th e provisions of those legis- lative commands rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\" Id. (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc. , 523 U.S. 75, 79 (1998) (internal qu otations omitted)). Of similar effect\u2014and in similar tension with Bos- tock\u2014was the Eleventh Circuit's repeated concern that the ordinary meaning of the words \"constituent\" and \"herb or other botanical\" would simply be too \"broad.\" App. A at 10a. In so doing the Eleventh Cir- cuit followed the \"'canon of donut holes'\" that Bostock 24 firmly rejected, \"in which Congress's failure to speak directly to a specific case that falls within a more gen- eral statutory rule creates a tacit exception.\" Id. at 1747. As Bostock emphasized and Judge Jordan's dis- sent echoed, that is not how the law works. \"[W]hen Congress chooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule,\" courts are not to create an exception like the Eleventh Circuit did below, but instead are to \"ap-ply the broad rule.\" Id. \"'[T]he fact that [a statute] has been applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress'\" does not demonstrate ambiguity; in- stead, it simply \"'demonstrates [the] breadth'\" command.\" Id. at 1749 (quoting Sedima , 473 U.S. at 499.) The Eleventh Circuit likewise ran headlong into Bostock 's prohibitions when it offered policy justifica- tions for altering the text. According to the majority, it made sense to narrow the list of presumptively mar- ketable supplements because \"[t]he fact that DMAA can be found in trace amounts in geraniums, if true, says absolutely nothing about whether consuming the substance is safe.\" App. A at 12a-13a. But Bostock makes clear that this sort of atextual reasoning can play no role when the text is plain. To evade a stat- ute's language on the premise that \"undesirable policy consequences would follow\" is to abandon \"any pre- tense of statutory interpretation.\" Bostock , 140 S. Ct. at 1753. \"[T]hat's an invitation no court should ever take up,\" this Court prono unced, because \"[t]he place to make new legislation, or address unwanted conse-quences of old legislation, lies in Congress.\" Id. Judge Jordan made the same point: the \"policy reasons\" that 25 drove the majority's \"narrower reading of the statu- tory text,\" he concluded, were not that court's\u2014or any court's\u2014\"to consider.\" App. A at 25a. Judicially narrowing statutes based on policy cal- culations of this sort is ill-advised\u2014not only because \"people are entitled to rely on the law as written,\" as Bostock observed, but also because a court's \"supposi- tions about\" Congress's \"intentions\" often turn out Ct. at 1749, 1754. The Elev- enth Circuit's decision stands as a stark example of that dynamic. Contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's sur- mise, the DSHEA provision at issue here, which de- fines which dietary supplements are presumptively marketable, \"is not,\" as commentators have empha- sized, \"a safety provision.\" Scott Bass et al. , The New Dietary Ingredient Safety Provision of DSHEA: A Re-turn to Congressional Intent , 31 A M. J.L. & MED. 285, 294-95 (2005). This provisio n draws the line not be- tween substances that are safe and those that are not, but instead between substances that occur in nature and those that do not. DSHEA does have a safety pro- vision, located in a separate statutory section, that al- lows the FDA to take products off the market if it can show they \"present[] a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7342(f)(1)(A). But critically, the FDA has never tried to make that show- ing with respect to DMAA. In light of the evidence showing that DMAA is safe when used in accordance with its intended uses, th e FDA would not succeed in any such endeavor. See App. A at 16a (\"If the issue was whether DMAA is safe, Hi-Tech's evidence would create a genuine issue of fact precluding summary 26 judgment; neither side's evidence is conclusive.\"). The Eleventh Circuit's concern ov er safety not only steered it away from the text's proper interpretation, but also was unjustified in its own right. The Eleventh Circuit's misguided analysis under- scores why, as Bostock reiterated, resort to policy con- siderations is imprudent when the statutory text is broad and plain. \"[S]uppositions about intentions or guesswork about expectations\" of Congress's are not part of the interpretive process. Bostock , 140 S. Ct. at 1754. A court's task is not, as Bostock put it, to \"point out\" any \"application\" of a statute that it believes to be \"both unexpected and important\" and to \"refer the subject back to Congress.\" Id. at 1750. The court's task is to determine if \"the plain terms of the law\" cover the situation at hand and, if so, to \"enforce\" them. Id. That is what the Eleventh Circuit should have done below, and it is what the Eleven th Circuit likely would do now if this Court grants re view, vacates the judgment, and remands for consideration in light of the interven- ing decision in Bostock . B. The Eleventh Circuit's rewriting of DSHEA is important and worthy of review The need for this Court's intervention\u2014and, at the very least, for an instruction that the Eleventh Circuit reconsider the case in light of Bostock \u2014is imperative. The issue of DMAA's marketability is a novel one, and as a result there is no divi sion among the lower courts on this question. But the Eleventh Circuit's decision is of tremendous importance to the dietary-supple- ment industry, and the FDA's pattern of overreach on 27 DMAA may improvidently prevent further lower- court consideration of this significant issue. Consider first the effect th is decision will have on the industry. DMAA is an important dietary ingredi-ent, and supplements containing it have formed a sig- nificant portion of Hi-Tec h's business. Yet Circuit's insertion of this language into DSHEA will call into question not only DMAA's continued vi- ability, but also the processes for producing numerous other beneficial dietary ingredients in the future. Pterostilbene, for example, is an antioxidant in blue-berries, but in \"trace amounts,\" around 10 parts per million. See Denise McCormack et al. , A Review of Pterostilbene Antioxidant Activity and Disease Modi- fication , CELLULAR LONGEVITY (2013), https://www.hindaw i.com/journals/omcl/2013/ 575482/. Resveratrol is the chemical that makes red wine healthy, but there are only 0.3 to 0.5 milligrams per glass. See Ore. State Univ. Linus http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phyto-chemicals/resveratrol. Manufacturers have synthe- sized these compounds to incorporate them into die- tary supplements in larger, more beneficial quanti- ties. See, e.g ., James McNulty, A scalable process for the synthesis of (E)-pterostilbene involving aqueous Wittig olefination chemistry , S CIENCE DIRECT J. (May Bob Yirka, Chemists Figure Out How to Syn- thesize Compounds from Resveratrol , PHYSORG.COM (June 23, 2011), https://phys.org/news/2011-06-chem-ists-figure-compounds-resveratrol.html. Yet even 28 though the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged that bo- tanical constituents can be included in supplements when they are \"artificially manufactured,\" the limita- tions the majority wrote into DSHEA\u2014precluding, among other things, constituents found only in \"trace amounts\"\u2014will call these processes into doubt. App. A at 13a. The Eleventh Circuit's decision will put the brakes on progress in the dietary-supplement industry in ad- ditional ways. The machines used to determine a plant's components are \"still evolving to meet the lat- est demands of biotechnology.\" John Buie, Evolution of Mass Spectrometers , L AB MANAGER (Feb. 27, 2011), https://www.labmanager.com/lab-product/2011/02/ evolution-of-mass-spectrometers#.XZomwvZFw2w. Scientists constantly uncover new and beneficial plant compounds. See, e.g. , Scientists Discover a Can- cer-Fighting Substance in a Common Wildflower , SIL- ICON REPUBLIC (Aug. 2, 2019), https://www.siliconre- public.com/innovation/feverfew-wildflower-cancer- killing-compound. When future technological and sci- entific leaps reveal these compounds in trace amounts\u2014and the compounds have not previously been derived from the plants at issue\u2014the Eleventh Circuit's decision will preclude their use in presump- tively marketable supplements no matter how benefi- cial they may be. These considerations make it im- portant not to delay resolution of this question\u2014or, at the very least, to give the Eleventh Circuit another op- portunity to answer it in light of Bostock . 29 The FDA actions that brought this issue to a head heighten the need for this Court's immediate inter- vention. When the United States Anti-Doping Agency first approached the FD A about DMAA's marketabil- ity, FDA officials took the position that, due to the re- search showing that \"[DMAA] is found in the oil of many geraniums,\" DMAA \"appear[ed] to be a dietary ingredient under [DSHEA] be cause it is a constituent of another dietary ingredient, (i.e., a plant).\" Doc. 108- 4 at pp. 290 & 292. It was only after USADA continued to lobby the FDA\u2014and after USADA funded the fraudulent study, discusse d above, in which research- ers concealed DMAA's presence in geraniums\u2014that the FDA changed its position, and began to claim that DMAA is not in geraniums. See supra at 11-13. In pressing that ultimately unsuccessful claim, the FDA chose enforcement actions that minimized the opportunities for judicial review. The FDA did not, as it has for other dietary supplements, initiate notice- and-comment rulemaking to accept public input on whether DMAA is safe, from which judicial review could have followed. See, e.g., Rule Declaring Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids Adul- terated, 69 Fed. Reg. 6787 (2004), review , Nutraceutical Corp. v. Von Eschenbach , 459 F. 3d 1033, 1043-44 (C.A.10 2006). The FDA instead sent warning letters to eleven of the largest DMAA manu- facturers, and those manufacturers all took their products off the market rather than face the risks that their defense would have entailed. See Doc. 108-5 at p. 26; Doc. 108-7 at p. 112. Smaller manufacturers, like Hi-Tech, then became subject to individualized 30 seizures and forfeiture actions like the one at issue here. But when Hi-Tech and Wheat chose to not wave the white flag as other ma nufacturers had done, the factual premises for the FDA's actions quickly evapo- rated. Discovery revealed that USADA had encour- aged researchers to fudge their results and to conceal DMAA's presence within geraniums. When that be- came apparent, the FDA should have dismissed this case. Still, the agency pressed on, and the lower courts rightly held that the FDA \"fa iled to meet its burden of establishing that DMAA has not been found in gera- niums.\" App. C at 36a. Yet both the District Court and the Eleventh Cir- cuit held that the FDA was entitled to summary judg- ment, based on their belief that Congress would have wanted the statute's meaning to be \"narrower\" than even the FDA had believed its plain text to provide. App. A at 9a, 10a. Bostock shows that parties like Hi- Tech and Wheat, who have a considerable amount to lose if their products are not marketable, should not have to \"fear[] that courts might disregard\" the \"plain terms\" of a statute \"based on some extratextual con- sideration\" of this sort. Bostock , 140 S. Ct. at 1749. The stakes to Hi-Tech and the rest of the dietary-sup- plement industry are thus high, and the FDA's actions will likely prevent further percolation of these issues. At the very least, a remand to the Eleventh Circuit is warranted. 31 CONCLUSION This Court should either grant plenary review or should grant certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand the case to the Eleventh Circuit for fur- ther consideration in light of Bostock .

Docket No. 1:13-cv-03675-WBH UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff-Appellee, versus UNDETERMINED QUANTITIES OF ALL ARTICLES OF FINISHED AND IN-PROCESS FOODS, RAW INGREDIENTS (BULK POWDERS, BULK CAPSULES), WITH ANY LOT NUMBER, SIZE, OR TYPE CONTAINER, WHETHER LABELED OR UNLABELED, et al ., Defendants, HI-TECH PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., JARED WHEAT, Claimants-Appellants. Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (August 30, 2019)Appendix A2a Before TJOFLAT and JORDAN, Circuit Judges, and HINKLE,* District Judge. HINKLE, District Judge: The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 provides favorable treatment for \"dietary supplements,\" defined to include any \"botanical\" or \"constituent\" of a botanical. This case presents the question whether these terms apply to a substance that was invented in a laboratory and is artificially produced for commercial sale but that, entirely coincidentally, may be found in trace amounts in a plant. We hold that the terms do not extend this far. I. Proceedings The Food and Drug Administration seized from Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a substantial quantity of products containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine or \"DMAA.\" DMAA is used in fitness products aimed at bodybuilders and other athletes. The seizure led to two actions that were consolidated in the district court. One was a forfeiture action filed by the United States against the products. Hi-Tech and its chief executive officer, Jared Wheat, intervened as claimants. Hi-Tech filed the other action against the FDA and other governmental defendants. * Honorable Robert L. Hinkle, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.Appendix A3a Hi-Tech asserted that DMAA is a dietary supplement; that under the Administrative Procedure Act the FDA can properly ban DMAA, if at all, only through rulemaking; and that the seizure of Hi-Tech's DMAA violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted the FDA's motion, holding the seizure proper both substantively and procedurally. The district court denied a motion to reconsider that included a request to reopen discovery. Hi-Tech and Mr. Wheat have appealed. The appeal has been fully briefed and orally argued. II. Standard of Review We review de novo the district court's grant of summary judgment. See, e.g., Price v. Comm'r, Dep't of Corr ., 920 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir. 2019). We review for abuse of discretion the district court's denial of the motion for reconsideration and refusal to reopen discovery. See, e.g., Corwin v. Walt Disney Co ., 475 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir. 2007) (reconsideration); Artistic Entm't, Inc. v. City of Warner Robins , 331 F.3d 1196, 1202 (11th Cir. 2003) (reopening discovery). III. The Statute and the Issues The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits the introduction of adulterated foods into interstate commerce. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(a). The FDA enforces the Act. Id. \u00a7 393(b)(2)(A). The agency may bring an in rem Appendix A4a forfeiture action in district court to condemn adulterated foods. Id. \u00a7 334(a)(1). Hi-Tech's DMAA products were adulterated foods if they \"food additives\" but not if they were \"dietary supplements.\" The background is this. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, commonly referred to as \"DSHEA,\" amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide favorable treatment for dietary supplements. The statute's definition of \"dietary supplement\" includes multiple parts. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff). The only part relevant to Hi-Tech's DMAA is this: a product that is intended to supplement the diet\u2014this includes DMAA\u2014is a dietary supplement if it contains \"an herb or other botanical\" or \"a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of\" an herb or other botanical. Id. \u00a7 321(ff)(1)(C) & (F). The statute describes these\u2014as well as other substances not at issue here\u2014as \"dietary ingredients.\" Under DSHEA, and subject to exceptions not relevant here, a dietary supplement can be condemned as adulterated only if the FDA carries the burden of proving that the substance presents a \"significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury\" under recommended, suggested, or ordinary conditions of use. Id. \u00a7 342(f)(1)(A). The FDA did not attempt to make that showing for the DMAA products it seized from Hi-Tech. A ruling that DMAA is a dietary supplement thus would resolve this appeal in Hi-Tech's favor.Appendix A5a On the other hand, a ruling that DMAA is a \"food additive\" would resolve the dispute in the FDA's favor. A substance intended for human consumption is a food additive if it is not a dietary supplement and is not \"generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety, as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures . . . to be safe under the conditions of its intended use.\" Id. \u00a7 321(s). For a substance in common use in food prior to January 1, 1958\u2014this does not include DMAA\u2014the adequate showing of safety can be made not only by scientific procedures but also by experience. There are other exceptions to this definition of \"food additive,\" but none applies here. The FDA asserts that DMAA is not a dietary supplement, is not generally recognized as safe, does not meet any other exception, and is therefore a food additive. Hi-Tech insists that DMAA is a dietary supplement and thus is not a food additive, but that even if DMAA is not a dietary supplement, DMAA is generally recognized as safe and thus still is not a food additive. The issues thus are first, whether Hi-Tech's DMAA products are \"an herb or other botanical\" or \"a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of\" an herb or other botanical, and second, if not, whether the products are generally recognized as safe. Secondary issues are whether the FDA was entitled to seize and forfeit the products without engaging in rulemaking and whether the district court should have reopened discovery.Appendix A6a I V. DM A A The earliest known identification or use of DMAA occurred in 1944. In that year Eli Lilly & Co. synthesized and patented DMAA for use as a nasal decongestant. For marketing reasons, Eli Lilly asked the FDA to withdraw its approval of this use in 1983. At least insofar as shown by this record, DMAA was not used as a dietary supplement or food additive at that time, and no health concerns had been noted. DMAA eventually made a resurgence, this time in fitness products aimed at bodybuilders and other athletes. Because of DMAA's noticeable stimulant effect, the compound made its way into pre-workout energy and fat-burner products around the world. The FDA eventually adopted the position that DMAA is not a dietary supplement but an unsafe food additive. The FDA issued cease-and-desist letters to at least some entities marketing DMAA products. Perhaps unaware of Hi-Tech's marketing of DMAA products, the FDA did not issue a cease-and-desist letter to Hi-Tech. Around the same time, researchers began to find trace amounts of DMAA in geraniums of the genus pelargonium. A 2013 survey concluded that overall, the studies showed that DMAA \"is found naturally in some, but not all, geranium plants and extracted geranium oils.\" Thomas D. Gauthier, Evidence for the Presence of 1,3-Dimethylamylamine (1,3-DMAA) in Geranium Plant Materials, 8 Analytical Chemistry Insights 29-40 Appendix A7a (2013), available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ articles/PMC3682735/. Indeed, the FDA's own expert had previously participated in a study that found trace amounts of DMAA in geraniums. Even so, this record presents a genuine factual dispute over whether trace amounts of DMAA are naturally contained in geraniums. On the one hand, studies have found trace amounts of DMAA in geraniums. On the other hand, some fertilizers contain DMAA that could be a source of trace amounts of DMAA in geraniums, and the record includes competent testimony that there is no known pathway by which geraniums could produce DMAA. Either way, it is clear that DMAA is not contained in geraniums in amounts greater than could reasonably be characterized as trace amounts. No study has found a greater amount. V. \"Herb or Other Botanical\" The first rule of statutory construction is to apply the plain meaning of the statutory language. See, e.g., Bankston v. Then , 615 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir. 2010). Here the meaning is not completely clear. Hi-Tech says DSHEA uses \"botanical\" to mean all plant life, nothing more and nothing less\u2014that is, to mean flora, without limitation. The suggestion is sensible enough\u2014\"botany\" is the study of plants. On the other hand, it would be passing strange for a writer wishing to cover the universe of plant life\u2014to mean all flora\u2014 to achieve that result through the term \"herb or other Appendix A8a botanical.\" Moreover, the usual connotation of \"botanical\" when used as a noun, as recognized in dictionaries in use when DSHEA was enacted as well as those is use today, is a substance derived from a plant used for a limited category of purposes. In 1993, a year before DSHEA became law, Merriam- Webster's defined the noun \"botanical\" as a \"a plant part or extract used esp[ecially] in skin and hair care products.\" \"Botanical,\" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 134 (10th ed. 1993). The current edition defines the noun \"botanical\" as a \"substance obtained or derived from a plant[,] such as . . . a plant part or extract used especially in skin and hair care products[,] a medicinal preparation derived from a plant[, or] plant material used as a flavoring agent.\" \"Botanical,\" Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary 2019, available at https://www.merriamwebster.com/ dictionary/botanical. Neither definition suggests that the noun \"botanical\" includes an artificially produced substance that, entirely coincidentally, may be found in trace amounts in a plant. Nor do they suggest that \"botanical\" includes all flora. Both the Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit have relied on Merriam-Webster's as an aid in construing statutes. See, e.g., Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc ., 572 U.S. 545, 553 (2014); Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States , 556 U.S. 599, 611 United States Cir. LLC , 305 F.3d 1228, 1242 (11th Cir. 2002). This does not make these cited definitions of \"botanical\" dispositive; dictionaries are Appendix A9a not controlling and in any event give examples to convey a term's most common uses, not necessarily to suggest limits. But the narrower connotation suggested by the dictionaries is consistent with DSHEA's use of the term \"herb or other botanical\" rather than a broader term plainly encompassing all plant life. To be sure, the difference between Hi-Tech's broad view\u2014all flora\u2014and the narrower dictionary definitions is not as stark as might appear at first blush. That a substance derived from a plant is used in a dietary product brings it close to the current dictionary definition, which includes a medicinal preparation derived from a plant. Still, the use of \"herb or other botanical\" in the statute, together with the dictionary definitions of a botanical as \"derived from a plant,\" supports a much narrower construction than Hi-Tech proposes. Had Congress meant all plants and anything contained in them, it could have said so. It did not. At the least, the com/dictionary/botanical. Neither definition suggests that the statutory language and dictionary definitions support a conclusion that would be reasonable anyway: it is unlikely that Congress used the term \"herb or other botanical\" to mean a substance invented in a laboratory and artificially produced, that can be found in a plant only in trace amounts, only coincidentally, and that has never been derived from a plant for use in any medicinal, cosmetic, or dietary product.Appendix A10a VI. \"Constituent\" The statutory definition of a dietary supplement extends not only to an \"herb or other botanical\" but also to \"a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of\" an herb or other botanical. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1)(F). Hi-Tech asserts \"constituent\" means anything naturally contained in. The word could be given that meaning, but the connotation is usually not so broad. Indeed, both the 1993 edition and the current edition of Merriam-Webster's define \"constituent\" as \"an essential part.\" 248 (10th ed. 1993); \"Constituent,\" Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary 2019, available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constituent. This definition suggests a connotation much narrower than proposed by Hi-Tech and too narrow to include the DMAA\u2014if there is any\u2014contained in geraniums. For its part, the FDA says Hi-Tech's proposed definition of \"constituent\" would render superfluous the statute's inclusion of the word \"extract.\" The FDA says the meaning of \"constituent\" must be informed by the other words in the statutory list, under the canon noscitur a sociis. (11th Cir. 2013) (discussing this canon); Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts (\"Reading Law \") 195-98 (2012) (same). The \"most common effect of the canon is not to establish which of two totally different meanings applies but rather to limit a general term to a subset of all the things or actions that it covers\u2014but only according to its ordinary meaning.\" Reading Law at 196.Appendix A11a A concentrate or extract of a product is derived from the product in usable form or amount. So is a combination of the product with another substance. A metabolite, too, is physically derived from a product. If, as Hi-Tech asserts, constituent means anything contained in, the word is both markedly different from the others in the list and awkwardly placed\u2014the broadest term in a five-item list but placed not first or last but in the center. None of this is dispositive. The safest conclusion is this: it is unlikely that Congress used the term \"constituent\" to mean a substance that is present in a plant in only trace amounts and that has never been derived from a plant for use in any medicinal, cosmetic, or dietary product. VII. The Reason for the Statutory Presumption As set out above, DSHEA gives a preference to dietary supplements. The FDA can condemn a dietary supplement as adulterated only on a showing that it presents a \"significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury\" under recommended, suggested, or ordinary conditions of use. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 342(f)(1)(A). This is, in effect, a rebuttable presumption that the product is safe when used as intended. A principal reason for rebuttable presumptions, whether in statutes or other legal constructs, is administrative convenience. When a proposition is usually true, it sometimes makes sense to presume it is true, subject only to rebuttal in the occasional instance when it is not true. Perhaps more importantly, at least in the regulatory context, a presumption can avoid unnecessary Appendix A12a expense and delay\u2014a person or entity can go forward with proposed action without awaiting regulatory approval. This approach works best when a proposition is usually true and when the rebuttable presumption is clear and easily applied\u2014otherwise the unnecessary expense and delay is not likely to be avoided. DSHEA well illustrates this approach. Congress thought it better to have a clear, administrable rule\u2014 dietary supplements are presumed safe, subject only to a contrary showing\u2014than to require a particularized inquiry in every case. See S. Rep. No. 103-410, at 21-22 (1994). A fair inference is that herbs and other botanicals and their constituents made the list of favored dietary ingredients because consuming them is ordinarily safe. Consuming most herbs or other botanicals, though surely not all, is safe. The same is true even for most plants, and people have been consuming plants for as long as there have been people. Congress reasonably could choose to treat any product derived from a plant as adulterated only on a showing that it is unsafe. A rebuttable presumption for anything derived from a plant would serve administrative convenience and avoid delay in introducing a product to the market. It is a stretch, though, to apply the same reasoning to a substance invented in a laboratory and artificially produced, that can be found in a plant, if at all, only in trace amounts, only coincidentally, and that has never been derived from a plant for use in any medicinal, cosmetic, or dietary product. The fact that DMAA can be found Appendix A13a in trace amounts in geraniums, if true, says absolutely nothing about whether consuming the substance is safe. Nor does applying a rebuttable presumption to a substance of this kind serve administrative convenience. It is easy enough to identify plants or substances actually derived from plants. But as this case illustrates, it is not always easy to determine whether a product invented in a laboratory and artificially manufactured can be found in trace amounts in some plant somewhere in the world. There is no reason to believe that when it adopted DSHEA, Congress intended to put in place a rebuttable presumption that such a product is safe. We hold that DSHEA does not go that far. This does not mean that DSHEA applies only to products actually derived from plants, not those artificially manufactured. If a product is indeed a dietary supplement because it contains a qualifying dietary ingredient\u2014 including, for example, an herb or other botanical\u2014a manufacturer may take the dietary ingredient from nature or produce it artificially. But there must be a qualifying dietary ingredient. The ability to create a substance in a laboratory and manufacture it artificially does not give a substance that status. Nor does coincidentally identifying the substance in trace amounts in some plant somewhere in the world.Appendix A14a VIII. Generally Recognized as Safe Hi-Tech says DMAA is generally recognized as safe\u2014or, to quote the statute's more exacting standard, DMAA is \"generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety, as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures . . . to be safe under the conditions of its intended use.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(s). The FDA's rule on this concludes that a substance meets this standard only when, based on \"common knowledge throughout the scientific community knowledgeable about the safety of substances directly or indirectly added to food,\" there is \"reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful under the conditions of its intended use.\" 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 170.30(a). As the statutory requirement for general recognition makes clear, the issue is not whether, as an original matter, the factfinder in a legal proceeding would evaluate the evidence and conclude that a substance is safe. The issue is only whether the substance is generally recognized as safe among qualified experts based on adequate studies. To establish the contrary, the FDA \"need only show the lack of the proper reputation . . . for safety of the [substance] among the appropriate experts, or that what reputation there is, is not based on adequate studies.\" United States v. Articles of Food & Drug Consisting of Coli-Trol 80 , F4C-60 Feed Grade, Entrol-S Medicated, Entrol-P , 518 F.2d 743, 746 (5th Cir. 1975). As a pre- Bonner decision of the Fifth Circuit, Coli-Trol remains binding in this court. See Bonner v. City of Prichard , 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). Other circuits, too, have enforced the Appendix A15a requirement for general recognition. See United States v. Article of Food , 752 F.2d 11, 15 n.4 (1st Cir. 1985); v. United States , 629 F.2d 795, 803-05 (2d Cir. 1980). The FDA made the required showing. Multiple sources, including in peer-reviewed publications, call into question DMAA's safety. Among their conclusions: DMAA may cause increases in blood pressure and hemorrhagic stroke; individuals with blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg or higher (much of the American population) should avoid DMAA; use of DMAA has been associated with multiple adverse events, including deaths; and DMAA may inhibit activity of liver enzymes and cause liver toxicity. After four soldiers died with DMAA in their systems, the Department of Defense removed all DMAA products from military exchanges and commissioned a Safety Review Panel. The Panel issued a report finding that \"deaths, hepatic failure, myocardial infarction, heat stroke and rhabdomyolysis, with of [DMAA-containing] products.\" U.S. Dep't of the Department of Defense 1,3 Dimethylamylamine (DMAA) Safety Review Panel 9 (2013). The report said this suggested that some individuals \"may be predisposed to severe health consequences after using DMAA.\" Id. The report said there appeared to be \"significant association of DMAA use, particularly high frequency DMAA use, and multiple adverse events.\" Id. And the report concluded that \"the available evidence supports an elevated health risk associated with the use of DMAA-containing products.\" Appendix A16a Id. The Department continued its ban on DMAA products at military exchanges. Id. at 10-11. With this track record, it is hardly surprising that the FDA's expert in food chemical risk management determined that DMAA is not generally recognized as safe by qualified experts. Hi-Tech asserts, though, that the studies and reports on which the FDA relies involve DMAA use in doses greater than Hi-Tech recommends. Hi-Tech says that use of DMAA as intended does not present the same risks. Hi-Tech cites studies and presents expert testimony concluding that DMAA is safe at the recommended doses. Hi-Tech's submissions are far from conclusive. The studies use small sample sizes and look at short-term results. None measure the effect of DMAA in high-risk populations or on individuals with elevated blood pressure. And while some but not all of the FDA's cited studies involve high doses of DMAA, it seems unlikely that all the adverse events suffered by military personnel and others resulted from abnormal or unintended use. Correlation is not causation, but neither must correlation be ignored. If the issue was whether DMAA is safe, Hi-Tech's evidence would create a genuine issue of fact precluding summary judgment; neither side's evidence is conclusive. See Sparling No. EP-13-CV-323-DCG, 2015 WL 4528759 at (\"It is clear . . . that the scientific literature on DMAA presents insufficient data to conclude that DMAA is safe or that DMAA causes harm because the sample sizes are too Appendix A17a small.\"). But the issue is not whether DMAA is safe; the issue is only whether DMAA is generally recognized as safe. It plainly is not. On the issue of general recognition, the FDA was entitled to summary judgment. IX. The Motion to Reopen Discovery The district court provided ample time for discovery\u2014 the full amount the parties requested. The parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment without asking for more time or asserting that any further discovery was needed. But after the court granted summary judgment for the FDA, Hi-Tech moved to reconsider, taking issue with the court's legal analysis and asserting the court should reopen discovery. Hi-Tech said it needed more discovery because the court's legal analysis did not match up with the position argued by either side. Ours is an adversary system. When, as here, there are two sides, each side is afforded the opportunity to argue its position. But the court is not limited to choosing one side's position or the other's. The court's role is to get it right, not to choose which side's argument is better and adopt it lock, stock, and barrel. See, e.g., United States v. Baston , 818 F.3d 651, 663 (11th Cir. 2016) (concluding that on a disputed legal issue, \"[n]either party is correct,\" and applying the correct standard that neither party advocated); see also Colburn v. Odom , 911 F.3d 1110 (11th Cir. 2018) (resolving an appeal on a ground not addressed in either side's brief but essential to proper resolution of the dispute). Were it otherwise, there would be no plain- error doctrine.Appendix A18a Thousands of cases could be cited illustrating this principle. Indeed, the principle is so well settled that it is rarely mentioned. When a court adopts a view of the law that is not precisely in line with either side's argument, the court usually sets out its view of the law without citing authority for the proposition that it may do so. The Supreme Court has explained it this way: \"[w]hen an issue or claim is properly before the court, the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather retains the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law.\" U.S. Nat'l Bk. of Oregon v. Independent Ins. Agents of Am., Inc ., 508 U.S. 439, 446 (1993) (quoting Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc ., 500 U.S. 90, 99 (1991)). Hi-Tech is correct that the district court did not simply accept either side's view of the facts and law. Nor should the court have done so; neither side had it just right. Similarly, on appeal, we have not simply chosen one side's view or the other's; we have considered the arguments and provided the analysis we believe is correct. One would expect nothing less. Hi-Tech says, though, that it was blindsided when the district court emphasized that DMAA has never actually been derived from geraniums for use in any product. Hi-Tech says it needs more discovery to fully present its position on this issue\u2014to attempt to find evidence that DMAA has in fact been derived from geraniums. The assertion misses the mark for two reasons, either of which would be sufficient standing alone.Appendix A19a First, Hi-Tech could not have been surprised that the court considered whether DMAA has actually been derived from geraniums. The question leaps off the page at anyone first considering the issues in this case. Hi-Tech asserts it does not matter whether DMAA has actually been derived from geraniums\u2014a colorable position\u2014but Hi-Tech could not have missed the possibility that a court would disagree. Second, regardless of whether Hi-Tech recognized or should have recognized that a court might find actual derivation critical, Hi-Tech had every incentive to fully develop the facts on this during the original discovery period. An intensely disputed issue was whether DMAA was contained in geraniums. Hi-Tech said yes; the FDA said no. The best support Hi-Tech could have garnered for its position on this issue\u2014as Hi-Tech surely knew\u2014 was evidence that DMAA had actually been derived from geraniums. The reason one can't get blood from a turnip is that there is no blood in a turnip. The reason one can get juice from an orange is that oranges are full of juice. The reason Hi-Tech found no evidence during the original discovery period that DMAA had actually been derived from geraniums was not because Hi-Tech didn't know to look; it was because no such evidence existed. Or perhaps because, despite every incentive to do so, Hi-Tech couldn't find it in the ample time it requested\u2014and the court provided\u2014for discovery. Hi-Tech is not entitled to more time. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to reopen discovery.Appendix A20a X. The Absence of Rulemaking Hi-Tech faults the FDA for bringing a forfeiture action rather than proceeding through rulemaking. But it is \"well established\" that \"agencies have discretion to choose whether to proceed by rulemaking or adjudication.\" RTC Transp. Inc. v. ICC , 731 F.2d 1502, 1505 (11th Cir. 1984). Not surprisingly, then, we have upheld a forfeiture judgment in favor of the FDA against a food additive without requiring rulemaking. See United States v. Articles of Food & Drug Consisting of Coli-Trol 80, F4C- 60 Feed Grade, Entrol-S Medicated, Entrol-P , 518 F.2d 743, 746 (5th Cir. 1975); see also United States v. Article of Food , 752 F.2d 11, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1985). The FDA was not required to engage in rulemaking but could elect instead to proceed through a forfeiture action against Hi-Tech's DMAA products. Proceeding in this manner did not violate the Constitution. The governing statute provides notice that unapproved food additives are subject to forfeiture. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 334(a)(1). The statute is not unconstitutionally vague, and Hi-Tech doesn't claim it is. As part of the forfeiture proceeding, Hi-Tech was afforded the full range of procedural due process available in a federal court. The issues were joined and fully adjudicated on the merits. Due process requires nothing more. XI. Conclusion DMAA is not an \"herb or other botanical.\" It is not a \"constituent\" of an herb or other botanical. And it is not Appendix A21a generally recognized by qualified experts, as adequately shown through scientific procedures, to be safe under the conditions of its intended use. The district court properly so ruled. The decision is AFFIRMED.Appendix A22a JORDAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. This is a difficult case, and in my opinion there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer to the principal statutory question we confront. The majority opinion sets out one plausible interpretation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff)(1)(C) & (F), but I read the statute differently. So, although I join Parts I-IV and VIII-X of the majority opinion, I respectfully dissent from Parts V-VII. * * * * * As relevant here, \u00a7 321(ff)(1)(C) & (F) provides that a product is a \"dietary ingredient\"\u2014and therefore can be marketed without FDA pre-approval\u2014if it contains \"an herb or other botanical\" or a \"concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient\" in an \"herb or other botanical.\" Hi-Tech contends that DMAA satisfies these definitions because it is a \"constituent\" of a geranium plant and therefore a \"constituent\" of a \"botanical.\" See Br. for Appellant at 8. So we need to figure out what the words \"herb,\" \"botanical,\" and \"constituent\" mean. The principal dictionary definition for the word \"herb\" concerns its status as flora: a plant whose stem is not woody and persistent, and which generally dies at the end of its flowering or growing season. See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 820 (4th ed. 2009); Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 1058 (2002); 1 Shorter Appendix A23a Oxford English Dictionary 1228 (5th ed. 2002). It is also, but secondarily, defined as a part of a plant that is useful for food or medicine. See id. (\"A . . . plant used for flavoring or scent, in medicine, etc.\"). Some dictionary definitions of the noun \"botanical\" refer to a drug, medicinal preparation, or similar substance obtained or derived from a plant or several plants. See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 215 (4th ed. 2009); The Random House College Dictionary 157-58 (1973). Some even refer to the drug or preparation as crude, or maintaining the ingredient more or less in its natural state. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 258 (2002); McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms 272 (6th ed. 2003). But as the FDA concedes, see Br. for Appellee at 16, \"botanical\" also is defined as the plant (or part of the plant) itself. See, e.g., Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 134 (10th ed. 1994) (\"a plant part or extract used sp. in skin and hair care products\"); The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 298 (3d ed. 1993) (\"of or relating to plants or plant life\"). The statute uses \"other botanical\" in conjunction with \"herb.\" It therefore seems to me that the word \"botanical\" contextually refers to a plant or part of a plant, and not a drug or medicinal preparation derived from a plant. See generally Dole v. United Steelworkers of America , 494 U.S. 26, 36 (1990) (explaining that \"words grouped in a list should be given related meaning\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). And a geranium is certainly a plant.Appendix A24a That leaves the word \"constituent.\" It means a component or element of a whole, and\u2014significantly\u2014not all dictionaries require the component or element to be \"essential.\" See, e.g., 1 Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 496 (5th ed. 2002) (\"an element of a complex whole\"); The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 394 (4th ed. 2009) (\"[s]erving as part of a whole; component\"); Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 258 (2002) (\"a thing, person, or organism that along with others serves in making up a complete whole or unit\"). As the majority acknowledges, there is evidence that geraniums contain a trace amount of DMAA. See Maj. Op. at 7-8. There is also evidence, however, that some fertilizers contain DMAA\u2014which could be the source of trace amounts in geraniums\u2014and that geraniums have no known pathways of producing DMAA. Id. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Hi-Tech, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DMAA\u2014even in trace amounts\u2014is a \"constituent\" (i.e., a component or element) of geraniums. * * * * * In my view, the statutory text does not provide a basis for the district court's conclusion that a \"constituent\" of a \"botanical\" must have a history of being extracted in usable quantities, or for the majority's holding that to be a \"constituent\" an ingredient must have been derived from a plant for use in a medicinal, cosmetic, or dietary Appendix A25a product. Indeed, reading \"constituent\" to mean something that has been taken out of a plant in usable amounts may make \"extract\"\u2014another statutory term\u2014surplusage. The statute lists \"constituent\" among several other words: \"a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination thereof.\" \u00a7 321(ff)(1)(F). When Congress uses \"or\" to separate several words in a list, that term's \"ordinary use is almost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given separate meanings.\" Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.S. 351, 357 (2014). As a noun, the term \"extract\" means \"something extracted . . . a preparation obtained by evaporation (as of a solution of a drug or the juice of a plant).\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 806 (2002). Again, \"constituent\" is broadly defined as a part of something else, and ascribing a more narrow definition would eliminate any independent meaning Congress intended by using \"extract.\" See Yates v. United States , 135 S. Ct. 1074, 1085 (2015) (explaining that courts should \"avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words\") (internal quotation omitted). The majority's contrary interpretation of \u00a7 321(ff)(1) (C) & (F) seems influenced by policy reasons which call for a narrower reading of the statutory text. See Maj. Op. at 13-14. I do not challenge those reasons, but believe they are not ours to consider. See Sturges v. Crowninshield , 17 U.S. 122, 202 (1819) (we should not \"infer from extrinsic circumstances, that a case for which the words of an instrument expressly provide, shall be exempted from Appendix A26a its operation\"). Although the statutory reading advocated by Hi-Tech is expansive, that reading squares with the broad language Congress chose. As the Supreme Court has told us, \"the fact that a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates breadth.\" Pa. Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey , 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). * * * * * As I read the statute and the record, the FDA was not entitled to summary judgment. I would remand for a trial on whether DMAA is a \"constituent\" of geraniums.Appendix B27a APPENDIX B \u2014 ORDER DENYING RECONSIDERATION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA, ATLANTA DIVISION, FILED JUNE 2, 2017 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA, ATLANTA DIVISION CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:13-CV-3675-WBH June 2, 2017, Decided June 2, 2017, Filed UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, v.

Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and its CEO (collectively Hi-Tech) have now filed a motion for reconsideration. [Doc. 142].Appendix B28a In its motion, Hi-Tech first argues that this Court improperly \"encroached on the policy making prerogative of Congress,\" [Id. at 14], by determining that in using the term \"botanical\" in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff), \"Congress intended that there must be at least some history of the substance in question having been extracted in usable quantities from a plant or a plant-like organism.\" [Doc. 140 at 9]. This Court disagrees. As noted in the order, there is nothing in the statutory scheme, the legislative history, or the case law that provides even the slightest guidance of congressional intent regarding the use of \"botanical.\" Accordingly, this Court turned to the standard canons of statutory construction to determine what Congress meant by first looking at the term's ordinary meaning. Under that meaning, a botanical \u2014 and by extension, a constituent of a botanical \u2014 is something that comes from a plant, and none of the DMAA ever placed in a product for sale has come from a plant. This Court thus concluded that DMAA is not a botanical, and whether or not the Government advocated that interpretation is of no moment.1 Hi-Tech's next argument is based on its incorrect interpretation of this Court's order. This Court did not conclude that DMAA was not a botanical because there is no evidence that DMAA can be extracted in a usable quantity. Rather, this Court held that, in order for a substance to be a botanical, there must be some history of its having been so extracted. As stated, the DMAA in the marketplace has never come from a plant. 1. In response to Hi-Tech's footnote 4, [Doc. 142 at 17-18 n.4], this Court did not state, or even suggest, that geraniums are an obscure plant.Appendix B29a As to Hi-Tech's argument that, until this Court issued the order, it did not know that \"the ability to extract DMAA from geraniums in a 'usable quantity'\" was in dispute, [Doc. 142 at 22], this Court again points out that the ability to extract usable quantities of DMAA from geraniums is not the issue. The question is whether someone has extracted DMAA from geraniums or some other plant and placed that DMAA in a product, and it is obvious from the record that no one has done that. If someone had, there would not have been a dispute regarding whether DMAA was a botanical in the first instance. For the reasons discussed, Hi-Tech's motion for reconsideration, [Doc. 142], is DENIED , and its motion for a stay, [Doc. 143], is DENIED as moot. IT IS SO ORDERED , this 2 day of June , 2017. /s/ Willis B. Hunt, Jr. WILLIS B. HUNT, JR. UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGEAppendix C30a APPENDIX C \u2014 ORDER OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA, ATLANTA DIVISION, FILED APRIL 3, 2017 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA, ATLANTA DIVISION CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:13-CV-3675-WBH April 3, 2017, Decided April 3, 2017, Filed UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, v. QUANTITIES OF FINISHED AND IN-PROCESS FOODS, et al., Defendants. ORDER Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., sells dietary supplements, including weight loss products containing 1, 3 Dimethylamylamine, commonly known as DMAA. The Federal Food and Drug Administration, contending that DMAA is a food additive that is not generally recognized as safe and that products containing DMAA are subject to seizure under federal law, seized a great deal of Appendix C31a Hi-Tech's product and initiated this in rem forfeiture action. In response, Hi-Tech and its CEO entered the forfeiture action as claimants, contending that its DMAA products were not subject to seizure under the law and demanded that the Government1 return Hi-Tech's products. Hi-Tech also filed suit against the Government, which action was merged into this forfeiture action. Both sides have now filed motions for summary judgment, and this Court now considers those motions. Discussion Summary judgment is appropriate where \"'there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.'\" Wooden v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga. , 247 F.3d 1262, 1271 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq., is a set of laws dating to 1938 that give authority to the FDA to oversee and regulate the safety of food, drugs, and cosmetics. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) amended the FDCA to require the FDA to characterize dietary supplements as food rather than drugs. Further, 1. Hereinafter, \"Hi-Tech\" refers to both Hi-Tech and Jared Wheat. \"The Government\" refers to the FDA, the Commissioner of the FDA, and any other federal entities or individuals involved in this case.Appendix C32a while the FDA may still establish standards for dietary supplements, the DSHEA shifted the burden of proof to the Government to have a dietary supplement declared unsafe and removed from commerce. Under the DSHEA, this Court must first determine whether DMAA is a If DMAA is determined to be a dietary ingredient, the seized Hi-Tech products qualify as dietary supplements which cannot be removed from commerce by the Government unless the FDA establishes that it \"presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under . . . conditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling,\" and this Court so finds \"on a de novo basis.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 342(f). If the substance is determined not to be a dietary ingredient, then this Court must determine whether that substance is \"generally recognized as safe.\" Id. \u00a7 321(s). If the substance is not generally recognized as safe, it is a food additive and presumed to be unsafe so that any supplements containing that substance are adulterated under the statute. Whether DMAA is a Dietary Ingredient Relevant to this case, dietary ingredients include \"an herb or other botanical . . . or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of\" an herb or other botanical. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff). Accordingly, the first issue that must be determined under the statutory scheme is whether DMAA is a \"botanical\" as that word is used in Appendix C33a the statute. The Government stipulates that it bears the burden of proving that DMAA is not a botanical. Nothing in the legislative history of the DSHEA or in the case law gives any guidance regarding what Congress meant by \"botanical\" in \u00a7 321(ff). Hi-Tech does not provide a definition of a botanical under the statute in its summary judgment motion. The Government asserts that a botanical is \"a plant, alga, or fungus, or a physical part or secretion of a plant, alga, or fungus, such as bark, leaves or fruits.\" In support of this assertion, the Government cites to the affidavit of its expert, Cara Welch. In her affidavit, Dr. Welch gives generally the same definition of a botanical and cites to her report. Dr. Welch's report gives that same definition for botanical and cites to an online FDA publication2 that gives the same definition in its glossary without citation to anything. The FDA publication merely purports to provide guidance to industry regarding the requirements of providing notice to the FDA relating to new dietary ingredients. The publication does not appear to be a scientific paper and there is no indication of who wrote it. In short, the Government has failed to provide an adequate basis for its interpretation of Congressional intent in using the term \"botanical\" in \u00a7 321(ff). This Court thus finds that the Government's definition is arbitrary and not entitled to deference under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Resources Def. Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). 2. Dietary Supplements: New Dietary Ingredient Notifications and Related Issues: Guidance for Industry , available at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/ GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/UCM515733.pdfAppendix C34a Hi-Tech has presented fairly substantial evidence that trace amounts of DMAA have been found in a species of a geranium plant in the form of three published papers that provided the details of tests detecting DMAA. The Government has asserted three arguments to dispute the presence of DMAA in geraniums, but this Court finds that those arguments are not sufficient to meet the Government's burden of establishing that DMAA is not in geraniums. This Court is first unimpressed by the Government's arguments regarding the fact that other studies have failed to find the presence of DMAA in geraniums. In particular, this Court takes judicial notice of a paper, Thomas D. Gauthier, Evidence for the Presence of 1,3-Dimethylamylamine (1,3-DMAA) in Geranium Plant Materials , AnAlytic Al chemic insights , 29- 40 (2013) available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc/ articles/PMC3682735/, in which the author surveyed the various studies that either found or did not find DMAA in geranium plants. He concluded that, \"[o]verall, these studies show that 1,3-DMAA is found naturally in some, but not all, geranium plants and extracted geranium oils.\" The author further opined that the studies that failed to find DMAA used extraction techniques that may not have been suitable for retention of DMAA due to its volatility. It is undisputed that at least three different studies found DMAA in geraniums, and the fact that other studies, which may well have used different methodologies, did not detect DMAA is not determinative. This Court is likewise unswayed by the Government's argument that it is impossible for the geranium in question to synthesize DMAA. In its motion for summary judgment, Appendix C35a the Government asserts that: \"The uncontroverted evidence is clear: Geraniums cannot make DMAA. There is no biological process or biosynthetic pathway by which a geranium plant could do so.\" However, the expert that the Government cites for this statement is nowhere near as unequivocal. Rather, she states that it is \"metabolically improbable\" that DMAA naturally occurs in geranium plants, and points out that \"[t]hose suggesting [DMAA] is naturally occurring in [geraniums] have not proposed a biosynthetic pathway by which the compound could be produced nor provided any evidence that such a pathway exists,\" [Doc. 113-1 at 29, 27], which is nothing close to uncontroverted evidence that geraniums cannot make DMAA. Further, the question as presented by the parties is whether DMAA has been detected in geraniums, not how the geraniums happened to put the chemical there. Finally, in response to the Government's argument that the geraniums from one of the studies may have been contaminated by fertilizer that contained DMAA, the argument fails to address the fact that other studies did find DMAA. Admittedly, there are reasons to doubt the veracity of the studies that detected DMAA in geraniums given the questions raised by the Government and the fact that the amounts found were so small. In addition, at least some of the studies upon which Hi-Tech relies were sponsored by companies in the supplement industry, and while this Court has no basis upon which to question the earnestness of the authors of those studies, it is no secret that scientific studies performed on behalf of industry tend to produce Appendix C36a the results that industry wants to see. Nonetheless, this Court would be inclined to find that the Government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that DMAA has not been found in geraniums. That, however, does not end the inquiry in this Court's opinion. As mentioned, if DMAA is in geraniums, it exists there in only trace amounts. The Gauthier article cited above indicated that the studies that detected DMAA generally found concentrations of less than 500 parts per billion, and while one sample was as high as 13 parts per million, that is still a minuscule amount. It is significant to this Court that, while studies might have found the presence of DMAA in geraniums, no one has ever extracted DMAA from geraniums for any commercial, medicinal or other purpose. It has merely been detected. This Court returns to the topic of Congress' intent in using the word botanical in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff), having determined that the Government's definition is not entitled to Chevron deference. In normal usage, a botanical is a plant, a part of a plant, or a substance that is derived from a plant for a medicinal, cosmetic, or other purpose. Oxford Dictionary defines botanical as \"[a] substance obtained from a plant and used as an additive, especially in gin or cosmetics,\" available at https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/ definition/us/botanical, while the web sight Dictionary.com defines it as \"a drug made from part of a plant, as from roots, leaves, bark, or berries,\" available at http://www. dictionary.com/browse/botanical. The clear implication is that to be a botanical, the substance must have been extracted from a plant or plant-like organism and used, for example, in or as a medicine. While very small amounts of Appendix C37a DMAA might be present in geraniums, the DMAA in the marketplace has never been extracted from geraniums or any other plant. This Court credits Hi-Tech's argument that a botanical can be synthesized in a laboratory without losing its status as a botanical under \u00a7 321(ff). Indeed, growing popularity of a substance in a certain plant might endanger that plant's existence if manufacturers were not permitted to synthesize the substance without running afoul of the requirements in the DSHEA, and chemical synthesis is often more economically efficient than extracting a particular compound from a plant. Nonetheless, it is inconceivable that in passing the DSHEA Congress intended for supplement manufacturers to take a chemical that heretofore had only been manufactured in a laboratory and to scour the globe in search of minuscule amounts of that chemical in obscure plants so that they could declare the substance a dietary ingredient under the statute. To hold otherwise would be to open the door to bogus claims that, for example, a given chemical had been detected in a fungus found only in a remote Tibetan river valley, and the FDA would be left to refute that claim \u2014 to prove a negative \u2014 which the instant case demonstrates is not easily done. This Court thus concludes that in using the term botanical, Congress intended that there must be at least some history of the substance in question having been extracted in usable quantities from a plant or a plant-like organism, leading this Court to find that DMAA is not a botanical and thus not a dietary ingredient.Appendix C38a Accordingly, with one possible exception discussed below, DMAA is a \"food additive.\" Relevant to this case, a food additive is presumed unsafe unless \"there is in effect, and it and its use or intended use are in conformity with, a regulation issued under this section prescribing the conditions under which such additive may be safely used.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 348(a)(2). There is no such regulation. The one possible exception is under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(s), pursuant to which the FDCA exempts from the definition of \"food additive\" foods that are \"generally recognized . . . as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures (or, in the case of a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, through either scientific procedures or experience based on common use in food) to be safe.\" This status is referred to as \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" or \"GRAS.\" Substances that are GRAS may be used in food without FDA approval or review. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321(s), 348(b). The burden of establishing that DMAA is GRAS rests with Hi-Tech. As DMAA was not used in food prior to 1958, for it to be GRAS, Hi-Tech must demonstrate \"both technical evidence of safety and a basis to conclude that this technical evidence of safety is generally known and accepted\" among the scientific community. 62 Fed.Reg. 18940 (explaining the requirements of 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 170.30(a-b)); see United States v. Western Serum Co., Inc. , 666 F .2d 335, 338 (9th Cir. 1982); United States v. Articles of . . . Promise Toothpaste , 624 1985), aff'd 826 F.2d 564 (7th Cir. 1987); . . . 1980). Appendix C39a Although unanimity among scientists is not required, there must be a general consensus regarding the safety of the substance in question for it to be considered GRAS. U.S. v. BioAnue Laboratories, Inc. , 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99962, 2014 WL 3696662 at *7 (M.D. Ga. July 23, 2014); see United States v. An Article of Food , 752 F.2d 11, 15 n.6 (1st Cir. 1985) (noting that evidence of a \"genuine dispute among qualified experts\" is \"sufficient to preclude a finding of 'general recognition' of safe use\"). Both sides of this dispute have presented extensive documentation regarding DMAA and the studies that have been performed on the effects of DMAA on humans and animals. This Court's conclusion after reading the various expert reports and other documents is that there is no consensus regarding the question of whether the consumption of DMAA is safe. This Court will avoid engaging in a detailed review of the numerous studies identified and discussed by the parties' experts. However, United States Magistrate Judge Anne T. Berton, in ruling on a Daubert motion in a DMAA products liability case in Texas, provided an exhaustive discussion of the various available studies of the effects of DMAA and noted that \"[i]t is clear . . . that the scientific literature on DMAA presents insufficient data to conclude that DMAA is safe or that DMAA causes harm because the sample sizes are too small.\" Sparling v. Doyle , 2015 (W.D. Tex. July 27, 2015).Appendix C40a This Court further notes that scientists have raised legitimate concerns regarding the safety of DMAA. DMAA is chemically similar to amphetamine, and some scientists have concerns that DMAA may have some of that drug's negative effects. The Government's expert, Dr. Dennis M. Keefe identified \"[e]leven articles [that] described case reports or clinical studies involving adverse outcomes that occurred after the consumption of DMAA-containing products.\" [Doc. 107-8 at 33]. Five reports associated recreational DMAA consumption with substance abuse, [id.], three studies identified liver toxicity, [id.], and several studies showed elevated blood pressure, [id. at 34]. To be sure, Hi-Tech has presented the results of studies that show no adverse (or no significant adverse) effect from DMAA. However, as the Government's expert points out, and as echoed by Magistrate Judge Berton, the sample sizes of those studies is simply too small to provide any convincing evidence regarding the safety of DMAA. Moreover, the safety of DMAA is not really the issue, and it does not matter that concerns about DMAA may be unfounded. The question is whether there is a consensus among experts regarding DMAA's safety, and this Court concludes that HiTech has failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that consensus, leading to the further conclusion that DMAA is not generally recognized as safe under the FDCA. Accordingly, products for human consumption containing DMAA are adulterated foods under the FDCA and subject to seizure pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 334.Appendix C41a This Court's determination that Hi-Tech's products containing DMAA are subject to seizure and forfeiture necessarily requires this Court to further conclude that the officials involved in the seizure and sued by Hi-Tech did not violate the FDCA, the DSHEA, the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702), or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as claimed by Hi-Tech in the suit originally filed in Washington, D.C., and ultimately merged into this action. Conclusion For the reasons discussed, the Government's motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 107], is GRANTED and Hi-Tech's motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 108], is DENIED . The Clerk is DIRECTED to enter judgment as to all claims in favor of the Government and against the Defendants undetermined quantities of all articles of finished and in-process foods, raw ingredients (bulk powders, bulk capsules) containing DMAA with any lot number, size, or type container, whether labeled or unlabeled as listed in the amended complaint, [Doc. 25 as further amended by Doc. 138], and also against Claimants Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Jared Wheat in the forfeiture action. The Clerk is further DIRECTED to enter judgment as to all claims in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs in the suit originally filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia, Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. FDA, et al. , No. 1:13-CV-1747 (D.D.C.), later transferred to this Court as Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. FDA, et al. , 1:14-CV-2479 (N.D. Ga.), and even later merged into this action.Appendix C42a The Defendants in the forfeiture action, undetermined quantities of all articles of finished and in-process foods, raw ingredients (bulk powders, bulk capsules) containing DMAA with any lot number, size, or type container, whether labeled or unlabeled listed in the amended complaint, [Doc. 25 as further amended by Doc. 138], are hereby CONDEMNED , and FORFEITED to the United States for destruction. As this Court did not rely on the testimony of Iklas A. Khan, James P. Kababick, Rick Flurer, or Paula N. Brown, Hi-Tech's motions to strike their testimony, [Docs. 91, 100, 101, 102, 103, 122], are DENIED as moot. The parties' various motions to seal documents, [Docs. 99, 105, 111, 112, 114], and to file excess pages, [Docs. 106, 110, 118], are GRANTED nunc pro tunc.
