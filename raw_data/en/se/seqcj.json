Seventeen diseases are now preventable through vaccines routinely administered to children and adults in the United States [(Table 123-1)](#hpim21_ch123tb1), and most vaccine-preventable diseases of childhood are at historically low levels [(Table 123-2)](#hpim21_ch123tb2). Health care providers deliver the vast majority of vaccines in the United States in the course of providing routine health services and therefore play an integral role in the nation's public health system. [+] [+] The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of a strong immunization program: robust surveillance systems to detect emerging infectious disease threats; public-private partnerships to accelerate the development of novel vaccines; and systems in place to rapidly implement a vaccination program and monitor vaccine safety and effectiveness. As of July 2021, multiple COVID-19 vaccines have received authorization for emergency use in the United States and over two-thirds of adults have received at least one dose. Furthermore, the largest and most comprehensive vaccine safety program in U.S. history has demonstrated the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, and evaluations have demonstrated the vaccines to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infections, including against severe disease that would otherwise result in hospitalization and death.
