The first two years are straight book learning: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry. In the second two years you go through a rotation of pediatrics, internal medicine, and surgery. In 1970, as a third-year medical student, I took a class on pediatrics where I first met Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, who was my professor. We developed a lifelong relationship: he attended the birth of my first child and became the godfather to my six children. Dr. Mendelsohn was beyond brilliant, and had a profound influence on my health philosophy. He was the national medical director of Project Head Start (appointed to this post by President Lyndon B. Johnson), chairman of the Medical Licensure Committee for the state of Illinois, and a director of Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital. Dr. Mendelsohn was a distinguished doctor in every respect...but he did not believe in vaccines! He also warned parents to be wary of allopathic medicine. By 1973, he was convinced that every vaccine causes neurological damage. When I graduated from medical school I started working with Dr. Mendelsohn. I also opened up my own practice, Homefirst\u00ae Health Services. Dr. Mendelsohn was still under a Head Start contract in Chicago and I worked at his clinic for a day or two a week while I was also delivering babies at home. I delivered more babies at County in the six months while I was there than most doctors deliver in a lifetime. The homebirth business started growing, and in 1974 I opened an office on the north side of Chicago. I gave every family the choice to vaccinate or not. That started from the first day I was in practice, and it wasn't something I pushed. A few years later, I attended the University of Wisconsin Medical School and graduated with a Masters degree in Public Health (MPH). The program consisted of courses in infectious disease, bio-statistics, epidemiology, and vaccination. As a private practicing physician, you apply the knowledge that you gained in medical school to your individual patients hoping to make your families healthier. As a public health doctor you look at a population and consider measures that can make a group of people healthier. So, the second degree that I have is a Masters of Public Health and I am Board certified in Preventive Medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) is essentially made up of doctors of Public Health. It means that you have extra training and expertise in looking at what measures in medicine could be implemented to improve the health of many people. I wanted this additional educational background because I thought it would have some value in looking at and interpreting disease data and vaccine statistics. As a practicing physician delivering babies, I felt it was important to widen my perspective on this. By 1976, several doctors had joined my Homefirst practice. Three of them have remained with me for more than 20 years. We delivered hundreds of babies every year. We also provided healthcare. At that time, about half of the families who came to us did not vaccinate their children. (Today, it is less than one percent.) However, even the families that vaccinated chose a modified schedule. We didn't start any vaccines until six months of age, and we would never give anyone a vaccine if they were even remotely ill. By the 1990s, the vaccine issue was becoming more prominent. I had already written thousands of medical waivers for parents opposed to vaccines. Every state has a law that the doctor can write a waiver. I would write them since I believed that vaccines were medically contraindicated. However, the law also said that the school board had a right to send parents to another doctor for a second opinion. I started getting calls from school nurses saying they were sending these children to another doctor. The second opinion was always a rubber stamp claiming there's no medical contraindication. Even death is not a contraindication to vaccines. I realized this was becoming a legal issue so I enrolled in the Law School at John Marshall in Chicago. I was 49 years old at the time. John Marshall is aimed at professionals: bankers, insurance people, business owners. They have a complete night course. So, I worked full time during the day and I would go to classes at night. This went on for four years, until I received my law degree in 2000. In law school, I wrote a paper on confidentiality. Our government doesn't have a right to probe into and control your life; that's not the role of government. So, my paper looked at who you can give confidential information to without worrying about whether it will be divulged to a third party. Clergymen have the strongest protection under the law. You can also talk freely with your lawyer. However, doctors have violated the Hippocratic Oath, which states that you will not reveal anything that a patient tells you in confidence. For example, assume a parent brings a six-month-old child to a physician for a checkup. The physician questions the parent about the child's vaccine history. The parent, believing that her communication is privileged and confidential, acknowledges that the child has not been vaccinated. Can the doctor legally and ethically use this information against the parent? No, this should not occur. Yet some doctors, upon learning that children are not vaccinated, threaten to call Social Services for child neglect. They also share confidential health records with insurance companies. My practice respected the choices that parents made from day one. It is based on the realization that doctors do not have the right to make decisions for families. Our obligation is to lay out the options and let families have the final word. When it comes to healthcare\u2014whether for vaccines, yearly physicals, mammogram screenings, pap smears\u2014families have a right to decide. We're not here to ram our beliefs down anyone's throat. That is not why we became medical doctors. About 15 years ago I started doing complimentary seminars, open to the public. One was on homebirth and the other was on vaccines. The homebirth seminar used to attract 130 or 140 people. The vaccine seminar brought in 50 or 60 people. We would usually have 10 or 15 pregnant women in the audience; many would have their babies at home with us. However, as time went on fewer people were showing up for the homebirth seminar and more people\u2014100, 120, 140\u2014were showing up for the vaccine talk. In the last 10 years, we still have the same number of pregnant women coming to the seminars, but fewer women are choosing to have their babies at home. We have thousands of families come to us who don't vaccinate their children. Frequently, they ask, How do I avoid the hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital? My answer is always the same: Have the baby at home. I do a lot of seminars around the country. Every two or three years I would speak at the La Leche League (an organization that promotes breastfeeding), sometimes as their keynote speaker. They always gave me the same topic: Asthma and the Breastfed Child. The number of breastfed children with asthma had been growing, and it really disturbed me because I couldn't figure it out. These were women who exclusively nursed their babies. Why was there such an epidemic of asthma? Then I read a study from Australia, a small study, but it was something to look at. Babies were divided into four groups: breastfed and bottlefed, with and without vaccines. Researchers looked at respiratory illnesses. The lowest amount of respiratory illness was in the breastfed and unvaccinated group. That was expected. What was unexpected was that the next lowest amount of respiratory illness was in the bottlefed and unvaccinated group. All of a sudden I realized the problem. The next time that I spoke at a La Leche League meeting, there were mothers from all around the country who had children with asthma. I asked how many of their children were vaccinated: 100 percent were vaccinated, no exceptions. Since 1973, our medical practice, Homefirst Health Services, has cared for more than 35,000 children who were minimally vaccinated or not vaccinated at all. A few years ago, a well-known doctor visited me to do a study on autism in unvaccinated populations. This was the first time that I really looked at the figures, and I was astounded. I realized that we didn't have any cases of autism in our unvaccinated population. This wasn't something that I had preconceptions about. It was a retrospective look at what was really going on. Even when we analyzed the records from 20 years ago when we were giving some vaccines\u2014but not starting until at least six months of age\u2014there was no autism. We also have virtually no asthma, allergies, respiratory illness, or diabetes in our unvaccinated children, a telltale revelation when compared to national rates. We could do even smaller samples. For example, in the last ten years we've followed nearly four thousand children who were totally under our care. None of these children were vaccinated and none of them have autism. You would expect to see 25 or 30 cases of autism in a vaccinated population of this size. (The chapter on autism summarizes a few of the notable studies on both sides of the debate.) I tell our families that medical interventions are often unnecessary. For example, scientists looked at whether mammograms are valuable for women between 40 and 50 years of age. Eighteen of the 20 doctors who conducted a thorough review of the literature were obstetricians and radiologists who were die-hard believers in mammograms. Their conclusion was that there is no convincing evidence that it saves even one minute of life. Scientists also looked at breast cancer treatments: mastectomy, simple mastectomy, radical mastectomy. There was no benefit on outcome of survival. They looked at ultrasound: no benefit. They are very expensive baby pictures. So, my families often ask, Well, why am I coming to you? I say, Good question. You're right. Most of the families in our practice are very healthy. I attribute this, for the most part, to home-births, nonvaccination, and breastfeeding. The majority of our moms nursed their babies for at least two years. I want to say something about alternative schedules. Our medical practice never gave the whole gamut of vaccines\u2014DPT, polio, measles, mumps and rubella\u2014and we never started until six months of age. Today, there are a lot more vaccines (16 different vaccines for children), so more parents now wonder whether it's better to deviate from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule. For example, some parents don't want to give the MMR shot to their children. They'd rather have the measles, mumps and rubella shots administered separately, the way they were given in the 1970s. Other parents like to choose vaccines that have the least amount of aluminum (read the chapter on aluminum). These measures are probably more sensible than taking all of the shots at once (read the chapter on multiple vaccines) or loading up the infant's developing neurological and immunological systems with high amounts of toxic additives (read the chapter on vaccine ingredients). However, you're merely mitigating the potential damage. I don't believe you're going to eliminate it altogether. The current schedule of recommended vaccines is so crowded that doctors give babies several shots during a single office visit\u2014up to eight or nine vaccines all at one time. (Babies get 38 doses by the time they are 1\u00bd years old\u2014see chart on the following page.) Parents, and doctors, often forget that vaccines are drugs. How often do we, as adults, take that many drugs at the same time? Would we be more surprised if we did or did not have an adverse reaction? Parents sometimes ask, What if my kid gets one of these diseases and I didn't have him vaccinated? Well, the child could become ill, develop complications, or die. However, each disease is unique and has to be looked at separately. This is why every chapter in this book describes the prevalence of each disease and who is most at risk. Let me tell you something, though: a whole lot of people are injured and killed from vaccines. You will learn about these possibilities as well. There are no guarantees. Authorities claim that vaccines reduced the incidence of disease. However, several diseases\u2014tuberculosis, scarlet fever, plague\u2014infected thousands of people every year but virtually disappeared without any vaccines. How do we explain this? Doctors also claim that parents have a duty to vaccinate their children to protect all of the other kids in the community (read the chapter on Social Obligation). They call this herd immunity. However, this assumes that vaccines work as intended. In this book you will learn how efficacy is measured. In the past few years we have seen outbreaks of measles, mumps and pertussis in mostly vaccinated children. Studies show that immunity from the chickenpox vaccine doesn't last very long, and recently vaccinated children can spread the disease to other people. Authorities call these secondary transmissions. In Africa, the oral polio vaccine is causing polio. This was a problem in the United States until they stopped administering this live-virus vaccine. The FDA and CDC allow important vaccine studies to be conducted by the pharmaceutical companies that make and sell the vaccines being studied. This is like asking foxes to guard the henhouse. You'll rarely read something written by a pediatrician admitting to the true side effects of vaccines. These are documented in numerous studies. Instead, most doctors will recommend that your child receive every available vaccine, under nearly every condition, with few exceptions. Do Babies Get Too Many Vaccines? Today, children receive one vaccine at birth, eight vaccines at two months, eight vaccines at four months, nine vaccines at six months, and twelve additional vaccines between 12 and18 months\u201438 drug doses by the time they are 1\u00bd years old! Source: CDC, Recommended Immunization Schedule 2010. A free society believes in freedom of speech and the right to learn as much about vaccines as possible. There should be no restriction on the information that you have access to, and everyone should be free to accept or reject vaccines. I don't recommend for or against the shots. The information that I am presenting here is to help you look at the scientific literature. Hundreds of important vaccine studies are summarized in this book. Many of them are critical of vaccines. Therefore, this book should be considered supplemental to other information that you gather from both official and alternative sources. As parents, all of us are concerned about our children and grandchildren. We want to do what's absolutely in their best interest. However, the right course of action is not always clear. Is the industry mantra\u2014that vaccine benefits outweigh risks\u2014an established fact or merely an effective marketing tool? After reading this book, I believe you will be more qualified to Make an Informed Vaccine Decision for the Health of Your Child. Mayer Eisenstein, MD, JD, MPH Medical Director, Homefirst\u00ae Health Services Polio What is polio? Polio is a contagious disease caused by an intestinal virus that may attack nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, and vomiting. Some victims develop neurological complications, including stiffness of the neck and back, weak muscles, pain in the joints, and paralysis of one or more limbs or respiratory muscles. In severe cases it may be fatal, due to respiratory paralysis. How is polio contracted? Polio can be spread through contact with contaminated feces (for example, by changing an infected baby's diapers) or through airborne droplets, in food, or in water. The virus enters the body by nose or mouth, then travels to the intestines where it incubates. Next, it enters the bloodstream where anti-polio antibodies are produced. In most cases, this stops progression of the virus and the individual gains permanent immunity against the disease. How prevalent and serious is polio? Many people mistakenly believe that anyone who contracts polio will become paralyzed or die. However, in most infections caused by polio there are few distinctive symptoms.\u00b9 In fact, 95 percent of everyone who is exposed to the natural polio virus won't exhibit any symptoms, even under epidemic conditions.\u00b2 About five percent of infected people will experience mild symptoms, such as a sore throat, stiff neck, headache, and fever\u2014often diagnosed as a cold or flu. Muscular paralysis has been estimated to occur in about one of every 1,000 people who contract the disease.\u00b3 This has lead some scientific researchers to conclude that the small percentage of people who do develop paralytic polio may be anatomically susceptible to the disease. The vast remainder of the population may be naturally immune to the polio virus. Paralytic polio is rarely permanent. Usually there is a full recovery. Muscle power begins to return after several days and continues to improve during the next 12-24 months. A small percentage of cases will experience residual paralysis. In rare cases, paralysis of the muscles used to breathe can lead to death.- The DPT Vaccine and Other Shots Could Cause Polio When diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were introduced in the 1940s, cases of paralytic polio skyrocketed. This was documented in The Lancet and other medical journals.-\u00b9\u00b2 In 1949, the Medical Research Council in Great Britain set up a committee to investigate the matter and ultimately concluded that people are at increased risk of paralysis for 30 days following injections.\u00b9\u00b3,\u00b9 A 1992 study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, validated earlier findings. Children who received DPT (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) injections were significantly more likely than controls to suffer paralytic poliomyelitis within the next 30 days. According to the authors, this study confirms that injections are an important cause of provocative poliomyelitis.\u00b9 In 1995, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study showing that children who received a single injection within one month after receiving a polio vaccine were eight times more likely to contract polio than children who received no injections.\u00b9 These studies and others indicate that injections must be avoided in countries with endemic poliomyelitis.\u00b9 Can polio be treated? Treatment mainly consists of putting the patient to bed and allowing the affected limbs to be completely relaxed. If breathing is affected, a respirator or iron lung can be used. Physical therapy may be required. The polio vaccine: In 1952, Jonas Salk, an American microbiologist, combined three types of polio virus grown in cultures made from monkey kidneys. Using formaldehyde, he was able to kill or inactivate the viral matter so that it would trigger an antibody response without causing the disease. That year he began his initial experiments on human subjects. In 1953, his findings were printed in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\u00b9 In April 1955, the nation's first polio immunization campaign was launched. Shortly thereafter, 70,000 school children became seriously ill from Salk's vaccine\u2014the infamous Cutter Incident. Many of these children contracted polio from the vaccine, were paralyzed and died. Apparently, Salk's killed-virus vaccine was not fully inactivated.\u00b9,\u00b2 The vaccine was redeveloped, and by August 1955 over 4 million doses were administered in the United States. By 1959, nearly 100 other countries were using Salk's vaccine. Nutritional Deficiencies Could Increase the Risk of Polio A poor diet has been shown to raise susceptibility to polio.\u00b2\u00b9 In 1948, during the height of the polio epidemics, Dr. Benjamin Sandler, a nutritional expert at the Oteen Veterans' Hospital, documented a link between polio and an excessive use of sugars and starches. He compiled records showing that countries with the highest per capita consumption of sugar, such as the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and Sweden (with over 100 pounds per person per year) had the greatest incidence of polio. In contrast, polio was practically unheard of in China (with its sugar use of only 3 pounds per person per year).\u00b2\u00b2 Dr. Sandler claimed that sugars and starches lower blood sugar levels causing hypoglycemia, and that phosphoric acid in soft drinks strips the nerves of proper nourishment. Such foods dehydrate the cells and leech calcium from the body. A serious calcium deficiency precedes polio. Weakened nerve trunks are then more likely to malfunction and the victim loses the use of one or more limbs.\u00b2\u00b3-\u00b2 In 1957, Albert Sabin, another American scientist, developed a live-virus (oral) vaccine against polio. He didn't think Salk's killed-virus vaccine would be effective at preventing epidemics. He wanted his vaccine to simulate a real-life infection. This meant using an attenuated or weakened form of the live virus. He experimented with thousands of monkeys and chimpanzees before isolating a rare type of polio virus that would reproduce in the intestinal tract without penetrating the central nervous system. The initial human trials were conducted in foreign countries. In 1958, it was tested in the United States. In 1963, Sabin's oral sugar-cube vaccine became available for general use. Which vaccine is in use today? In 1963, Sabin's oral vaccine quickly replaced Salk's injectable shot. It is cheaper to make, easier to take, and appears to provide greater protection, including herd immunity in unvaccinated people. However, it cannot be given to people with weak immune systems. Plus, it is capable of causing polio in some recipients of the vaccine, and in people with weak immune systems who come into close contact with recently vaccinated children.\u00b2 Thus, in 2000 the CDC updated its U.S. polio vaccine recommendations reverting back to policies first implemented during the 1950s. The oral vaccine should only be used in special circumstances. (Several countries still use the live-virus, oral vaccine.) Otherwise, children should be given the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV): Ipol (the inactivated or killed-virus shot)\u2014A sterile suspension of three types of poliovirus...grown in Vero cells, a continuous line of monkey kidney cells cultivated on microcarriers. The cells are supplemented with newborn calf serum. Each dose also contains 2-phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B. Produced by Sanofi Pasteur. Given in four doses.\u00b2 Other combination (DTaP/Polio/Hib). 1976, Dr. Jonas Salk, creator of the killed-virus vaccine used in the 1950s, testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively in the U.S. from the early 1960s to 2000) was the principal if not sole cause of all reported polio cases in the U.S. since 1961.\u00b2 In 1992, the CDC acknowledged that the live-virus vaccine had become the dominant cause of polio in the U.S.\u00b2 Public outrage at these tragedies became the impetus for removing the oral polio vaccine from immunization schedules. The following story is a firsthand account of one man's experience after his son received the oral polio vaccine: \"Four months ago my son was taken to a local clinic for his polio vaccine. Unfortunately, he changed from that day\u2014high-pitched screaming, smelly stools, non-stop crying, difficulty in breathing, high temperature, and lethargy. He also lost weight. Weeks of sleepless nights for all of us followed. His development ceased. He had been able to stand and move around, but he went back to remaining in basically whatever position we left him in. My wife was six months pregnant at the time, and about a week after our son's polio vaccine, she began to have headaches, loss of balance, muscular weakness, and frequent tiredness. I panicked because everything seemed to be pointing to polio infection. Then, a week after her continuous headaches began, she had to go to the hospital because there was something wrong with the pregnancy; she lost our daughter. I tried to get a polio test, and to find the cause of this tragic series of events, but the medical profession was extremely unhelpful. They laughed at me. I will never know why our son suddenly stopped growing or why his development regressed. I will never know why we "}
