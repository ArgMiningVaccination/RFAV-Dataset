Dangerous toxins can interfere with your body's ability to heal itself or filter out foreign substances efficiently. These toxic substances can damage your DNA and your body's vital cellular components. They can even prevent proper absorption of vital nutrients your body needs to survive and to feel energized and focused. Toxins can cause serious chemical imbalances and even tissue and organ damage. Detoxing may help eliminate these toxins and restore your body to its natural, healthy state. Unchecked toxins in your body may lead to: - Mood disorders - Decreased sexual performance and enjoyment - Skin blemishes - Digestive disorders - Disrupted sleep patterns - Body aches, pains, and cramps What Can Detox Treat? The body naturally removes many toxins on its own. But modern life presents enormous quantities of environmental toxins, and your body may not be up to the challenge of cleansing them on its own. Natural detox can give your body the powerful boost it needs by helping to remove toxins from many sources, both internal and external, including: External Sources of Toxins - Pesticides and herbicides - Air pollution - Environmental toxins - Acid rain - Heavy metals - Prescription drugs - Illicit drugs - Alcohol - Tobacco products Internal Sources of Toxins - Oxidation of fat and cholesterol - Reduced kidney and liver function - Free radicals How is Detox Performed? Two types of detoxing are the most popular: physician assisted or professional detox and holistic (natural detox). Both may be effective and help cleanse your body of unwanted substances. It's up to you to choose which path (or both) you wish to take. If you're in doubt, speak to your doctor, nutritionist, or holistic practitioner to discuss detox treatments in greater detail. Professional Medical Treatment An experienced doctor will guide your professional detoxification treatment. Typically, you'll start with a consultation to review your medical history, any medications you take, and your expected results. This is usually followed by a series of tests to determine the levels of toxins in your body. Then you'll discuss your best treatment options and decide on a course of action. Treatment options generally involve lifestyle changes like improving your diet, increasing your water intake, taking vitamin supplements, and possibly treatments like sauna sessions. Speak with your doctor about what detox program is best suited for your personal case and desired results. Holistic The holistic option usually means you'll manage your own detox program and determine your own methods. While this option gives you more freedom, it can also be less effective or even dangerous if done incorrectly. It's strongly recommended to inform your doctor or health practitioner before starting any home detox regiment. Detoxing generally follows a number of steps to help your body cleanse and recover. These include making dietary changes, starting an exercise routine, improving mental wellness, upgrading air quality, increasing water intake, and possibly colon cleansing. Dietary Decreasing the amount of toxins going into your body is a great way of detoxing naturally. Eating organic fruits and vegetables instead of fast food or heavily processed foods helps your body get the nutrition it needs without burdening it with unhealthy or unnatural substances. GMO products or products contaminated with pesticides or herbicides may also have negative effects on your health. Detox drinks like detox teas may also benefit your health. While you should approach manufacturer claims realistically, teas are unlikely to cause you harm or cause negative side effects, while increasing your healthy fluid intake offers its own set of health benefits. Exercise Exercise helps keep your body healthy and running strong. Besides pumping up your immune system and releasing endorphins (\"feel-good\" chemicals), exercise may help you purge toxins as you sweat. Some studies show sweating may aid in releasing toxic metals like lead and cadmium.1 The amount of daily exercise you need may vary based on your personal medical history and current health. If you're out of shape, it's generally better to start slow to avoid injury or adverse effects. Speak with your medical practitioner before starting any new exercise routine. Air Purification Breathing clean air is an excellent way of purifying your body. You might not be capable of controlling outside environmental factors, but you can clean the air in your home or workplace. Pet dander, mold, mildew, chemical fumes, smoke, and microorganisms can pollute your breathing space and your body at the same time. Home air purifiers can help reduce airborne toxins, while houseplants may help filter the air and remove toxins. Water Intake Water may be the best method of purifying your body. It helps your body produce saliva and sweat, as well as helping to flush out waste. Sources vary regarding how much water you should drink each day, but more is typically better. Aim for about 3 liters per day unless your medical practitioner advises otherwise. Full-body Detox This comprehensive program focuses on cleansing each organ systematically, including your liver, kidneys, and colon. This can be a long and sometimes uncomfortable process, but it may offer the best results. Speak with your medical practitioner to discuss a full-body detox in greater detail and to work out a specific treatment plan. What Are the Benefits of Detox? Detoxing may offer a wide variety of health benefits, including: - Reduced joint and muscle pain - Weight loss - Increased libido - More energy - Clearer skin - Heightened mood - Hormonal balance - Better digestive function Detox programs may not work for everyone. Results vary from patient to patient based on a large variety of factors like age, medical history, and lifestyle. Studies into the effectiveness and health benefits of detox programs are ongoing. Speak with a medical professional before starting any dramatic lifestyle changes or undergoing any program. Reserve Your Appointment Now You don't have to keep feeling run down, exhausted, or moody.
