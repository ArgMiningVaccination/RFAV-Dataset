S.G. presented to Respondent indicating she was happy with the results of the procedure on her face, but not on her arms, and asking for a ref und of $1, 500. and free treatments. According to Dr. Miller -Sickles , the request was refused because the procedure was performed based on protocol settings , and the outcome was satisfactory . Dr. Miller -Sickles stated , at no time did S.G. allege she was ov ermedicated during the procedure. 4 | Page Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board April 12, 2018 Minutes Dr. Sadilek asked Dr. Miller -Sickle if she had explained the procedure and process to S.G. prior to performing the procedure. Dr. Miller -Sickle confirmed she had explained the procedure in detail, and in addition, S.G. had the same procedure performed in 2011 by the other physician in the office, and aware of what to expect. Dr. Popiel asked D r. Miller -Sickle if she had changed her protocol since this complaint , to include allowing a family member or friend in the room during the procedure . Dr. Miller -Sickle stated when it has been requested, she has allowed family members o r friend s in the roo m during the procedure .

Dr. Elizabeth Grady, Case No. 17- 071 - Investigative Interview Dr. Grady was present. Ms. Anthony gave a summary of the case in which B.C. alleges Dr. Grady over- charged her for labs. According to Dr. Grady , B.C. was angry with the office manager, and when there was no recourse there, she filed a complaint against her. Respondent stated B.C. had a lot of anger and she kept making scenes in the waiting room. Dr. Sadilek asked Dr. Grady to clarify the business relationship between Mi Clinica and Northside Naturopathic . Dr. Grady stated her business is named Northside Naturopathic and at the time, she was renting space from Mi Clinica. Dr. Popiel asked why the lab requisition for Mi Clinica has her name on it . Dr. Grady stated the labs had been drawn though Mi Clinica, that they used her name to establish a Sonora Quest account , and at one time she was a silent partner of Mi Clinica . The account had just been established and there was no pricing list available at the time B.C. presented for the lab draw . B.C. was made aware of this fact and was told she could have the labs drawn anyplace she wanted, but that she chose to have them drawn at the office. Dr. Sad ilek asked Dr. Grady what her process is now regarding lab pricing. Dr. Grady stated she now has a list of lab pricing she gives her patients if paying cash, but that most go through their insurance. Dr. Sadilek made a motion to dismiss the case.

Dr. Debora Chelson, Case No. 17 -081 - Continuation of Investigative Interview Dr. Chelson was present. Ms. Anthony gave a summary of the case. Dr. Chelson stated she did log onto the Arizona Controlled Substance Prescription Monitoring Program database to check on each patient she certified for Medical Marijuan, but di d not print them out and put them in the chart . She stated she thought she could access the log in history on the Arizona Pharmacy Board Website if she needed to confirm the process. But that when she needed to provide the information to the Board, she could not access that information because the Pharmacy board changed the site and lost some of her log in information. Dr. Popiel asked Dr. Chelson what type of format she uses to keep her chart notes. Dr. Chelson stated she keeps her chart notes in paper fo rmat, but that some items are also scanned into her computer. Dr. Popiel pointed out that if another physician need ed to review her chart, the written chart notes would be hard to understand, and expressed his concern about her current chart notes and record keeping system. Dr. Sadilek asked Dr. Chelson if she is now making sure her notes are clean enough so another physician could read them. She stated that she was. Dr. Sadilek made a motion to issue a Letter of Co ncern and non- disciplinary order for Continuing Medical Education. Dr. Popiel stated he would like Dr. Chelson to also use IC d-9 codes in her chart notes as well as written diagnosis . Ms. Tibbitts asked Dr. Chelson if she was now printing out the PMP re port and putting in the chart. Dr. Chelson stated she is downloading the report onto her computer and storing it there, and that her chart notes are on paper. Dr. Sadilek made a motion to issue a Letter of Concern for insufficient record keeping.

Ms. Anthony gave a summary of the case in which A.R. complained about a bill she received from the lab , after she had her blood drawn at Respondent's clinic. Dr. Ipson stated the bill was submitted to A .R.'s insurance by the lab and was denied . The insurance company wanted a complete chart note, but becau se A.R. failed to present for a follow up appointment with Respondent, there was not a full chart note to provide. 6 | Page Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board April 12, 2018 Minutes Dr. Sadilek commented that in the future, it would be prudent of Dr. Ipson to have an appointment with the patient prior to any labs being drawn.

Dr. Courtney Cronin, Case No. 17- 085 - Investigative Interview Dr. Cronin was present. Ms. Anthony gave a summary of the case in which patient M.A. alleges she was told by Dr. Cronin that her labs would be covered by insurance, but that her insurance company denied them because there was no medical necessity, leaving her with a bill for over $3,000. Dr. Cronin stated M.A. presented with symptoms of thyroid issues and she had not had labs in a year. M.A. asked Dr. Cronin about her insurance paying for the labs , and that they discussed the options and decided to run it through insurance. Dr. Cronin stated at that time, they were using Gulfstream Diagnostics because they were told it accepted most insurances . However later, once the lab began billing patients, the y found out that was not the case and stopped using them. Mr. Silbert asked Dr. Cronin if she or anyone in her office is an expert in billing i nsurance. Dr. Cronin stated no, that her practice is cash based. Mr. Silbert commented that perhaps it is inappr opriate for her to be discussing the practice of billing insurance companies with the patient. B ecause the patient trusts the physician, they may believe she has enough working knowledge of the billing process to expect the company will pay. However, in this case when the insurance did not pay, it left the patient with no other option by to pay the bill or risk hurting her credit. Additionally, it appears when she reached out for help from the clinic and Dr. Cronin, she did not receive the help she expected . Dr. Cronin stated that she does have the patients sign a waiver ahead of time stating that the clinic does not guarantee insurance will reimburse any expenses. Complainant M.A. was present and stated that she trusted Dr. Cronin when she was told that t he blood work would be covered by insurance . She also stated she thought the blood work would be allergy related, but the testing ordered by Dr. Cronin was primarily for hormones. M.A. stated that since the blood work was drawn at the office, she did not see the lab requisition which had listed many tests, and that if she had gone to a draw station or seen the order ahead of time, she would have questioned the amount of testing being ordered. Dr. Sadilek commented that in the future, if the patient has a primary care provider and insurance coverage, Dr. Cronin may want to request the labs be drawn through the primary care provider. Dr. Sadilek made a motion to dism iss the case. Seconded by Dr. Popiel. 7 | Page Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board April 12, 2018 Minutes Mr. Silbert stated he had a concern regarding the dismissal, that he does not believe the physician was deliberately misleading the patient, but that there was enough of a conversation between Dr. Cronin and the patie nt regarding the insurance , that it was a valid complaint. Ms. Galan stated she does not believe this rises to the level of unprofessional conduct , but does believe a letter of concern should be noted that something did take place. Ms. Anthony took roll call vote on the motion made by Dr. Sadilek to dismiss, and seconded by Dr. Popie l.
