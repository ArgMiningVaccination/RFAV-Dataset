Full Text of the Announcement](#_Part_2._Full) [Section I. Funding Opportunity Description](#_Section_I._Funding) [Section II. Award Information](#_Section_II._Award_1) Eligibility Information](#_Section_III._Eligibility) [Section and Submission Information](#_Section_IV._Application_1) [Section V. Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency Contacts](#_Section_VII._Agency) [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), supports extramural research focused on understanding, controlling and preventing diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. In response to threats presented by bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases, the NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has established research programs to facilitate development of countermeasures for certain pathogens and toxins. Through this FOA, the NIAID invites research applications for projects focused on preclinical development of candidate technologies (including adjuvants) that would improve vaccine effectiveness and/or simplify vaccine delivery to patient populations during a natural outbreak of an infectious disease or following the intentional release of an infectious agent. For the purpose of this FOA \"candidate technology\" is defined as a vaccine technology for which proof-of-concept data have been obtained. Examples of research areas may include, but are not limited to: technology/platform optimization; safety evaluation; stability testing; manufacturing; of technologies or products to biodefense applications; development of broad spectrum platforms and/or production technologies; optimization of product safety, efficacy, or delivery; process development; scale-up; and production of quantities sufficient for preclinical regulatory requirements. Industrial Participation All applications submitted to this FOA must demonstrate substantive investment in the project by at least one industry participant. For the purpose of this FOA, \"industry\" is defined as a large or small, domestic or foreign, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, bioengineering, and chemical company, or a related non-profit entity with an established track record in product development. \"Substantive investment\" is defined as a significant commitment of one or more resources to the project including, but not limited to: product development support/guidance, personnel, in kind contributions of materials and/or reagents (i.e. chemical libraries, innovative biotechnology platforms, scale up of GMP chemical synthesis or production, etc.), provision of animal or other laboratory models for evaluation, subcontracts, data management resources, regulatory support, or alterations/renovations of facilities or provision of equipment to address biohazard concerns. The Program Director(s) /Principal Investigator(s) (PD(s)/PI(s)) of the project may be affiliated with either industry or an academic organization; however, if the PD(s)/PI(s) is from academia, an industrial partner must be identified in the application. Background The NIH and other agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) support development of countermeasures to protect the public from emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorist threats. The NIAID Strategic Plan for Biodefense Research ( [http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/about/Pages/strategicplan.aspx](http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/about/Pages/strategicplan.aspx)) outlines strategies for identifying medical countermeasure requirements and establishes priorities for their research, development and acquisition. One component of this plan is the development of new or improved vaccines against targeted NIAID Category A-C priority pathogens ( [http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm](http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm)). Consistent with this objective is the need for new and improved technologies that would facilitate production, storage, transport, delivery, and efficacy of these vaccines. Research Goals and Objectives The objective of this FOA is to support preclinical development of new or improved vaccine technologies to improve and facilitate the production, delivery, stability and/or efficacy of vaccines. As part of the Research Strategy section, each application must propose a research and development project whose goal is to advance an already identified vaccine technology or adjuvant. Research projects are not required to result in a \"final\" product, nor is it necessary to propose to complete the product development process up to the point of readiness for clinical trials or validation within the time frame of the project. Projects that would benefit production, delivery, stability and/or efficacy of non-biodefense-related vaccines are responsive provided that the targeted technology would be applicable to biodefense-related products. Vaccine Technologies Development of improved vaccine technologies is a high priority. Applications focused on preclinical development of technologies such as delivery platforms, antigen targeting, stability and cold-chain minimization, production characterization or formulation methodologies are encouraged. Proposed projects must pair the candidate technology with one or more appropriately mature, well-characterized vaccine(s)/antigen(s) for which models and assays exist to allow evaluation of the technology. Vaccine technology projects may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following activities: Adjuvants The development of an enhanced immune response may require the administration or co-administration of an adjuvant or immunostimulatory compound. Applications for development of novel adjuvants that could be used in conjunction with specific pathogen components are invited. Adjuvants are broadly separated into two classes based upon their primary mechanism of action: vaccine delivery systems (e.g., emulsions, microparticles, immune stimulating complexes, and liposomes) that target associated antigens to antigen presenting cells, and immunostimulatory adjuvants (e.g., LPS, MLP, or CpG DNA) that directly activate innate immune responses. In order to advance the development of vaccine adjuvants, this solicitation focuses on optimization and preclinical testing of candidate lead adjuvants that previously showed promise in early stages of discovery and development. Proposed projects must pair the prospective adjuvant(s) with one or more appropriately mature, well-characterized vaccine(s)/antigen(s) for which models and assays exist to allow evaluation of enhanced immunogenicity. Adjuvant projects may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following product development activities: NOTE: While clinical development strategies may be included within an overall project, this FOA will NOT support clinical trials. Applications requesting support for clinical trials will be deemed unresponsive to this FOA and will not be reviewed. Utilization of human-derived material with necessary approvals in pre-clinical studies in support of compliance with regulatory requirements is permitted and encouraged. NOTE: PD(s)/PI(s) are strongly encouraged to obtain expertise in the areas of product development planning and target product profile development in general and regulatory matters in particular. Expertise may be retained as defined effort or may be included as periodic consultation on specific issues. NOTE: Applications failing to propose work focusing on candidate technology with proof-of-concept data will be deemed non-responsive and will not be reviewed. NOTE: Applications failing to meet the requirement for industrial participation, as described, will be deemed non-responsive and will not be reviewed. | | Funding Instrument | | Grant | | Application Types Allowed | | New | | Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards | | The NIAID intends to commit $9.3 million in total costs to fund 10-15 applications in response to this FOA. | | Award Budget | | Budgets for direct costs of up to $750,000 per year may be requested.

Applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in [NOT-OD-10-115](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11148). Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers will provide an overall impact/priority score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Is this project likely to advance the development of a highly significant public health vaccine technology? Investigator(s) Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators, or in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD(s)/PI(s), do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Do the regulatory personnel possess the appropriate expertise to guide cGMP manufacture and/or related processes (if applicable)? Innovation Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Does the research proposed in each project leverage multi-disciplinary involvement to accelerate vaccine technology development, many aspects of which may not be inherently innovative? In addition, does the applicant propose an innovative use of current or emerging technologies and appropriate collaborations to achieve the research objectives? Approach Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? If the project involves clinical research, are the plans for 1) protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion of minorities and members of both sexes/genders, as well as the inclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Environment Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact/priority score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Product Development Strategy Is the Product Development Strategy feasible and appropriate and does it adequately align with the Research Goals and Objectives described in the FOA? Are the Milestones and Timeline appropriate and feasible? Is the proposed Product Development Plan feasible and appropriate for proposed and future product development? Is the Plan consistent with achieving the goals of this program? Protections for Human Subjects For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Human Subjects Protection and Inclusion Guidelines](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11172). Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children When the proposed project involves clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for inclusion of minorities and members of both genders, as well as the inclusion of children. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Human Subjects Protection and Inclusion Guidelines](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11172). Vertebrate Animals The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following five points: 1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers to be used; 2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; 3) adequacy of veterinary care; 4) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices; and 5) methods of euthanasia and reason for selection if not consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Biohazards Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. Resubmissions Not Applicable. Renewals Not Applicable. Revisions Not Applicable. As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact/priority score. Applications from Foreign Organizations Reviewers will assess whether the project presents special opportunities for furthering research programs through the use of unusual talent, resources, populations, or environmental conditions that exist in other countries and either are not readily available in the United States or augment existing U.S. resources. Select Agent Research Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Resource Sharing Plans Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: 1) [Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); 2) [Sharing Model Organisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and 3) [Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153). Budget and Period of Support Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](#_1._Criteria).
