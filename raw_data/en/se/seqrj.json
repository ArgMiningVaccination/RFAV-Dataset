The Asch Conformity Experiment In 1951, psychology professor [Solomon Asch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Asch) at Swarthmore College (my alma mater) conducted a study to measure conformity as a result of peer pressure. The study came to be known as the [Asch Conformity Experiment](https://moderntherapy.online/blog-2/asch-conformity-experiment-explained) or the [Asch Conformity Line Experiment](https://simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html). The study design was simple and straightforward (and conducted before Institutional Review Boards and protections for human research subjects came into being). Fifty male students were told that they were participating in a \"vision test\". The unwitting research subject was ushered into a room and seated at the end of a row of seven other students who were secretly in on the plan (what are called \" [confederates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978915002590#:~:text=Confederates%20are%20individuals%20recruited%20by,bystander%2C%20participant%2C%20or%20teammate.)\"). The students were then shown the following images and asked whether the target line in the first image most closely matched A, B, or C in the second image. Saul Mcleod at Simply Psychology explains [what happened next](https://simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html): Each person in the room had to state aloud which comparison line (A, B, or C) was most like the target line. The answer was always obvious. The real participant sat at the end of the row and gave his answer last. There were 18 trials in total, and the confederates gave the wrong answer on 12 trials (called the critical trials). Asch was interested to see if the real participant would conform to the majority view. Asch's experiment also had a control condition where there were no confederates, only a \"real participant.\" The study is like the country song lyric, \"who are you gonna believe, me, or your lying eyes?\" Sadly, peer pressure is a powerful thing: Asch measured the number of times each participant conformed to the majority view. On average, about one third (32%) of the participants who were placed in this situation went along and conformed with the clearly incorrect majority on the critical trials. Over the 12 critical trials, about 75% of participants conformed at least once, and 25% of participants never conformed. In the [control group], with no pressure to conform to confederates, less than 1% of participants gave the wrong answer. At the end of the 1950s, Professor Asch worked for two years at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. Stanley Milgram was his research assistant and Asch also supervised Milgram's Ph.D. dissertation. Milgram later conducted the infamous [electric shock experiment](https://simplypsychology.org/milgram.html) that took Asch's initial idea about conformity to its logical and violent conclusion. The Asch Conformity Experiment (1951), the Milgram Experiment (1961-1963), and the [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://www.britannica.com/event/Stanford-Prison-Experiment) (1971) are generally viewed as warnings about the dark side of human nature and the ever-lurking danger of fascism. But after the events of the last three years I'm starting to see them differently. It seems that somewhere along the way, the CIA, deep state, or various powers that be adopted these experiments as instruction manuals for how to set up totalitarianism throughout the developed world. II. The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System When Congress gave the pharmaceutical industry liability protection via the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was required to set up a tracking system to monitor vaccine injuries in the population. The system became operational in 1990 and is called the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Everyone acknowledges that VAERS is not perfect. Most people, including doctors and nurses, don't know it exists. The interface is clunky. The website for sharing this data with the public, the CDC WONDER system (operated by defense contractor General Dynamics), is intentionally designed to be difficult to use. Independent scholars [estimate](https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf) that VAERS undercounts actually harms by a factor of somewhere between 10 to 100. But VAERS the only yardstick that we have, and it has the benefit of showing 33 years worth of data on vaccine injury in the United States. Liz Willner, a web developer with a vaccine-injured child, was appalled by the bad design of the WONDER system. So in 2019 (pre-Covid) she set up [OpenVAERS](https://openvaers.com/) to take the vaccine injury data from WONDER and make it easily searchable. As you can imagine, the mainstream freaked the f*ck out because now the harms from vaccines were easy to see. So the pharmaceutical industry sent waves of PR mercenaries after Ms. Willner to punish her for the sin of making government data easily searchable. With the introduction of the deadly Covid vaccines, [OpenVAERS](https://openvaers.com/) took on increasing importance. Many of us now turn to OpenVAERS every week to understand the latest casualties from Pharma's war on humanity. OpenVAERS now gets significantly more web visits each month than the original CDC WONDER system. The latest VAERS Covid vaccine [mortality](https://openvaers.com/covid-data/mortality) numbers (people reported dead following a Covid shot) look like this: It strikes me that this is an Asch Conformity Experiment that has now been imposed upon all 330 million Americans. This is no longer an isolated lab experiment, this is the society that we live in today. Sane people look at this chart and observe that the red bars in 2021, 2022, and thus far in 2023 \u2014 that represent vaccine fatalities reported to VAERS \u2014 are larger than the bars in years 1990 to 2020. But if you speak with Tony Fauci, Rochelle Walenksy, Robert Califf, Francis Collins, Ashish Jha, Vivek Murthy, Peter Marks, or President Biden, they will all tell you that every bar on this chart is the same length. If you speak with Rachel Maddow, Anderson Cooper, or Chris Hayes, they will tell you to your face that all of the bars on this chart are the same length. If you speak with any of the so-called \"experts\" on the the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) or the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) they will tell you that all of the bars on this chart are the same length. And if you are a pediatrician, ob/gyn, general practitioner, or work as a professor in a medical school, you are required to say that every bar on this chart is the same length. Like all totalitarian systems, it's not enough to simply repeat the official lie. If you are a medical professional in 2023 and you want to keep your job, you have to genuinely believe that the red bars in 2021, 2022, and 2023 are the same length as the bars in years 1990 through 2020. The powerful pressure to conform that Asch observed in 1951 is ratcheted up all the more in our current system where you will lose your job and be permanently exiled from polite society if you tell the truth. The drug cartel has doctors over a barrel because the hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical school debt that most of them carry is extremely difficult to discharge in bankruptcy. Anyone who fails to conform to this lie faces financial ruin. So what does this tell us? It tells us that western allopathic medicine is dishonest, that western allopathic medicine is a totalitarian system, and that western allopathic medicine is an existential threat to the future of humanity. It tells us that if you listen to the CDC or your doctor you are putting your health at risk. It tells us that our society has already fallen to the fascists. It tells us that when we take power we must [denazify](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/denazify) medicine, denazify public health, denazify government and the media, and prosecute everyone involved in this corrupt and genocidal system. It also tells us that our epistemology must be to trust intuition, trust experience, and trust our own senses in order to survive in a world gone completely mad. Blessings to the warriors. Prayers for the vaccine-injured and everyone fighting to stop the iatrogenocide. Huzzah for everyone working to build the alternative society our hearts know is possible.
