Here we studied the relationship between host genetic variation, vaccine immunogenicity and viral sequences implicating VEM emergence. In a cohort of 1,096 Bangladeshi children, we identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants 55 associated with response vaccine antigens. Using an HLA imputation panel with 9,448 south Asian individuals DPB1*04:01 was associated with higher HBV antibody responses (p=4.5x10- 30). The underlying mechanism is a result of higher affinity binding of HBV surface antigen epitopes to DPB1*04:01 dimers. This is likely a result of evolutionary pressure at the HBV surface antigen 'a-determinant' segment incurring VEM specific to HBV. Prioritizing pre-S 60 isoform HBV vaccines may tackle the rise of HBV vaccine evasion. One-Sentence Summary Host genetics underlying hepatitis B vaccine response in Bangladeshi infants identifies mechanisms of viral vaccine escape, and how to prevent it. 65 .

However, its success depends upon accurate targeting of the immune response against 70 the pathogen and sustained immunogenicity. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines represent a prime example of this. Despite their success at reducing HBV-related disease burden worldwide, there is increasing evidence of vaccine escape mutations (VEMs) emerging because of variants in the \"a\"-determinant region of the surface antigen (HBsAg) gene. A recent study reported that 51% of GenBank Bangladeshi HBV isolates from 2005 to 2017 showed evidence of VEMs ( 1). While 75 selection bias may have inflated this estimate, robust evidence shows that vaccination campaigns lead to increasing VEMs prevalence ( 1-4). In Taiwan, the prevalence of \"a\"-determinant VEMs increased from 7% to 28.1% following universal vaccination ( 5, 6). In developing countries, where delays in vaccination program implementation may occur, a rise in HBV VEMs could hinder our best defense against infection. This is especially worrisome as HBsAg VEMs may 80 lead to mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene, inducing antiviral treatment resistance ( 1). The primary HBV vaccine in worldwide use is the yeast recombinant HBV vaccine( 7), obtained from the adw subtype( 8) of the HBsAg S isoform ( fig. 1) (9 -11). This is now available in many combination vaccines used in national childhood vaccination strategies. A different HBV vaccine 85 construct was developed as part of PreHevbrio (VBI Vaccines Inc., Cambridge, USA) which uses the full HbsAg protein (i.e. including the pre-S1 and pre-S2 segments) ( fig. 1 ) and was approved for adult use in 2021. Pre-S1/pre-S2/S antigen vaccines have proven effective in inducing immunity even in non-responders to S isoform vaccines( 12-17). Non-response to HBV vaccines and its host factors are well described, and is largely explained by genetic variation in 90 the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene cluster ( 18). However, the specific components of this variation have not been defined across populations owing to both technical and population-specific challenges with this complex locus of the human genome. The relationship between the emergence of HBV VEM and variable immunogenicity to HBV 95 vaccines from HLA variants has not been well explored but given that class II HLA receptors are responsible for exogenous antigen presentation, there is likely a relationship between the two. Given that genetics can lead to actionable interventions when supported by replicable evidence( 19-22), it could guide vaccine development and prevent the rise of VEMs. Hence, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of these mechanisms. 100 Here, we identified the genetic determinants of immune response to multiple vaccines including HBV in a cohort of Bangladeshi children for which antibody levels (a strong correlate of immunity) were measured at the same time following vaccination. We built the largest south Asian (SAS) genetic ancestry HLA imputation panel (at 2-field i.e. protein altering variants) 105 using whole-exome the UK Biobank (UKB) to fine-map HLA alleles and amino acid residues associated with antibody levels. We then used HLA receptor binding algorithms to show that antibody levels correlate with a participant's HLA-DP receptors. Importantly, our results correlate well with epidemiological observation of HBV VEMs and with previously published randomized trials of HBV vaccination, suggesting a way forward to 110 translate HLA association studies results into actionable therapeutic targets.

Both cohorts are extensively described elsewhere( 23-30). There were 534 females (n=236 for PROVIDE and n=298 for CBC) and 562 males (n=266 for PROVIDE and n=296 for CBC). Participants were genetically homogeneous ( fig. S1 ) and were pooled for the rest of the analyses. Participants received vaccination against HBV, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB), 120 measles, and rubella as per the national Bangladesh Expanded Program on Immunizations. Blood samples were collected from all the children at the age of 52 weeks for immunoglobulin G (IgG) measurements using validated multiplex immunoassays for the following antibodies: HBsAg, DT, tetanus toxin (TT), pertussis toxin (PT), pertactin (PRN, a Bordetella pertussis virulence factor), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA, another B. pertussis virulence factor), HiB 125 polysaccharide, and measles virus. Henceforth we refer to serological phenotypes using the acronyms listed above, even if referring to antibody levels (e.g. HBsAg instead of anti-HBsAg). Genome-wide association studies After quality control (QC) and imputation with the TOPMed panel( 31), we used Regenie( 32) to 130 perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of each qq-normalized serological trait on 9,581,948 variants, adjusting for 10 genetic principal components, the cohort, and sex. The strongest association was found for HBsAg at chr6:33061456:C:CT This variant was in a haplotype where the only two protein- coding genes are HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 (fig. S2A). These associations were observed in 135 both CBC and PROVIDE ( fig. S3-4). The second most significant association came at chr6:32466021:C:T for DT (beta for T: 0.35, se: 0.04, p: 3.0x10-21, AF for T: 46.7%). This variant Lastly, the pertussis serologies also yielded genome-wide significant associations for two B. pertussis virulence factors: chr6:32602046:AAT:A for PT (beta for haplotype ( fig. S2C-D ). HLA Given our GWAS results, we proceeded with HLA allele association studies. To do this, we 150 needed to impute HLA gene haplotypes for each participant. However, given that publicly available HLA imputation panels have a small number of Bangladeshi or SAS ancestry reference sequences, they have limited accuracy for our cohort. Hence, we used the UKB's whole-exome sequences (WES) and HLA allele calls( 33) from 9,448 155 SAS ancestry participants to build a SAS HLA reference panel. Details are provided in the Methods . Briefly, after QC and merging of the UKB's WES and whole-genome genotyping variants, we used a modified version of the HLA-TAPAS pipeline( 34) to obtain a HLA reference panel at 2-field resolution, and impute HLA alleles for our cohort (see data S1 for tag SNPs). 160 .

Concordance was over 90% all HLA-DRB4 , (table between 86.9% and 89.9%. The slightly lower concordance in those genes is expected given that they are not found 165 in every individual, making it harder to distinguish a missing gene from a poorly imputed one. Importantly, we adjusted concordance values for the difference in technologies, providing conservative estimates of imputation accuracy (see Methods ). Given the high concordance, we moved ahead with these for our HLA association studies. 170 HLA allele association studies We performed HLA allele association studies using the same serology phenotypes and analysis method as for the GWAS ( data S2 ). This yielded allele associations ( table S2 ). The 4.5x10-30). The other four observed 175 with DQA1*02:01 (beta: 0.34, 1.2x10-9). 180 We also performed conditional analyses on alleles associated with DT to determine whether they were independent ( table S2 , data S3 ). DRB1*07:01 and DQA1*02:01 alleles were not independent, as expected by their high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r 2 = 0.99, data S4 ). The signal from DRB4*01:03 was also lessened when conditioned on either of these two alleles, also expected from their mild LD (r2 = 0.33). However, the association between DT and DQB1*06:01 185 was preserved when conditioning on the other alleles. Given the complex LD between HLA alleles at this locus, we also used HLA dimers-based tests to better dissect the HLA-DQ alleles signal (see Supplementary Text and data S5 ). Amino acid residue association studies. 190 To understand the components of each HLA receptor dimer associated with antibody levels, we mapped each participant's HLA allele to their amino acid residues and performed amino acid association analyses ( data S6 ). Results matched those found in the HLA allele associations above. That is, for HBsAg and DT, all HLA genes found in allele association tests above also carried amino acid residues that were significantly associated with the phenotypes ( fig. 3). For 195 example, residues 85G, 86P, and 87M of HLA-DPB1 were residues 98K were the most amino acid uncovered were in the HLA receptors' peptide binding groove ( fig. 3 and fig. S5 ), in keeping with the vaccine's expected biological mechanism. 200 HBV and DT in-silico HLA dimer binding to disentangle HLA linkage disequilibrium We used NetMHCIIpan( 35) to independently validate our HLA associations. We assessed the predicted binding affinities of each HLA haplotype against epitopes from 50 HBsAg and 12 DT protein sequences on Uniprot( 36). This was done for HLA-DPA1-DPB1 haplotypes for HBsAg, 205 and for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1-DQB1 NetMHCIIpan is a validated neural network .

It is therefore not affected by linkage disequilibrium. For HBsAg, the DPB1*04:01 containing HLA-DP receptor dimers were predicted to bind the S 210 protein isoform of the HBsAg protein with greatest affinity compared to dimers containing other HLA-DPB proteins in our cohort ( fig. 4 ). The S isoform of the HBsAg is contained in the yeast recombinant vaccines given to our participants (fig. 1 ). Hence, both genetic association studies and in-silico binding affinity results agreed. 215 For DT, in-silico binding also matched the genetic association tests (spearman correlation rho = - 0.50, p = 0.03), and the HLA-DR allele associated with the highest level of DT (DRB1*07:01) was also the best DT proteins in-silico (fig. S6 ). However, we see instances where LD may have biased our genetic association tests. For example, the DQA1*01:03DQB1*06:01 dimer was associated with the second lowest antibody levels but was the third best in-silico DT proteins 220 binder. DQA1*01:03 is in moderate LD with DRB1*15:02 (r2 = 0.39), while DQB1*06:01 is in moderate LD with both DRB1*15:01 (r2 = 0.25) and DRB1*15:02 (r2 = 0.27). These all showed low antibody levels and poor in-silico binding. Hence, binding affinity disentangled the LD patterns at HLA locus. 225 Pre-S isoforms, a-determinant VEMs, and HBV vaccine design Given the correlation between the HLA association results and the in-silico binding results, we investigated the reasons for these differences between HLA-DPB1 alleles. To do this, we plotted the difference in predicted binding affinity between the best performing HLA-DPB1 allele (DPB1*04:01) and the worst performing allele ( DPA1*01:03 as their 230 common pairing subunit ( fig. 5 ). There were two striking observations. First, DPB1*04:01 bound to more 15-mer epitopes from the HBsAg S isoform than DPB1*26:01. However, the pre-S containing isoforms contained a similar number of strongly binding epitopes for both DPB1 proteins. To confirm this 235 observation, we fitted a beta regression to the in-silico results for the full pre-S containing HBsAg protein ( fig. 4A ). This showed a large difference in binding affinity between S and pre-S containing HBsAg isoforms, and an attenuated difference between HLA-DP dimers. Second, the only region of the HBsAg S isoform that binds to DPB1*26:01 better than 240 DPB1*04:01 was between amino acids 124 to 127. These residues are at the start of the well- known \"a\"-determinant of HBsAg. The a-determinant is of great clinical importance, as variants in this region lead to HBV strains which can overcome vaccines. In particular, mutations R122K, I126T, and P127L are associated with HBV VEMs, especially in Bangladesh( 1-4), and worsened the in-silico binding strength at DPB1*26:01 ( data S7 ). 245 Hence, difference in epitope binding at the a-determinant between the different HLA-DP dimers is associated with VEMs. These VEMs worsen binding with a HLA protein (DPB1*26:01) already lacking other binding target in the S HBsAg isoform and showing decreased antibody response following immunization. More specifically, a single amino acid polymorphism at the a- 250 determinant is the only barrier to VEMs in carriers of non- DPB1*04:01 alleles, providing a potential HBV VEMs concordant with the randomized .

All participants were vaccinated and genotyped using a similar methodology as ours. DPB1*04:01 was also strongly 260 associated with higher antibodies to HBsAg (beta = 0.27, se = 0.08, p = 6.3 x 10-4), but was much less frequent than in our cohort (AF = 4.3% in VaccGene vs 31.2% in the Bangladeshi cohort) (table S3 ). In VaccGene, the most significantly associated HLA-DPB1 allele was DPB1*01:01 , associated with a worse immunization outcome (beta = -0.23, se = 0.04, p = 1.1x10 -10). A similar result was found in our Bangladeshi cohort (beta = -0.44, se = 0.13, p = 265 6.9x10-4), again with a large difference in allele frequencies (AF = 30% in VaccGene vs 2.2% in the Bangladeshi cohort). Hence, despite large differences in allele frequencies, our HLA-DPB1 results are independently validated. We performed the same binding affinity analysis as above to see if the pre-S/S isoform results 270 observed with HLA-DPB1 still held with HLA-DQA1-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 . Again, we found that the binding affinity results mirrored the genetic association studies ( fig. S7-10 ), and most importantly, that 15-mers from the pre-S segment of HBsAg were predicted to improve binding affinity for all alleles of HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 . 275 Discussion In this study, we built the largest SAS ancestry HLA imputation panel ever reported to find strong evidence that children from Bangladesh carrying specific HLA alleles mount a greater antibody response to certain vaccines. Specifically, we found that DPB1*04:01 was associated with a stronger response to HBV vaccination, and that DRB1*07:01 and DQA1*01:03- 280 DQB1*06:01 were associated with a stronger response to diphtheria vaccination. We also found evidence of a biological mechanism involving the HLA epitope peptide binding grooves, identified through the genetic association analysis, and supported by further in-silico analysis. Lastly, and more importantly, we showed that for the routinely administered S isoform HBV vaccines, the HLA alleles associated with worse post-vaccination antibody responses differed 285 from DPB1*04:01 by their stronger binding to HBsAg a-determinant epitopes, and that this binding was decreased by well-known VEMs. Since DPB1*04:01 can bind strongly to other epitopes from the S isoform of HBsAg, salvaging its binding to HBsAg even in the presence of a-determinant VEMs, we hypothesize that the combination of poorer antibody response and low VEMs threshold for the other DPB1 alleles could help explain the appearance of mutants at the 290 a-determinant. These results highlight the potential use of pre-S HBsAg isoform HBV vaccines as a therapeutic option to prioritize in VEMs endemic areas, since non-DPB1*04:01 dimers are expected to bind with higher affinity to pre-S epitopes. Independent replication in VaccGene also supported the use of pre-S HBsAg isoform vaccines. In support of our results and conclusion, pre-S vaccination has already been demonstrated to induce effective immune responses in 295 individuals classified as non-responders to yeast recombinant S isoform v accine in multiple randomized trials( 12-17). .

Multiple factors limit interpretation of HLA association studies including reliance on European genetic ancestry over-represented imputation panels, high LD at the HLA locus, high pleiotropy of HLA alleles, and the difficulty in bridging HLA allele association results to their biological mechanism. These make any therapeutic target inference difficult. In this study, we tackled these problems by using an imputation panel that matched our 305 study population, and by triangulating independent genetic, in-silico, and epidemiological data. Given the explicit knowledge of antigens driving HLA associations with infectious antigenic stimulation, this approach may lead to greater understanding of other HLA associated traits. For vaccination and therapies acting on the HLA epitope presenting pathway, therapy development could be influenced by knowing the HLA dimer binding affinity and its allele frequency in the 310 target population. Nevertheless, this study has limitations. First, while we found a well-reported \"hotspot\" of HBV mutation at amino acid 126 of the HBsAg S isoform, we did not find evidence that the G145R HBV VEMs would be preferentially selected. The G145R polymorphism is another well 315 reported VEM (38). However, it is believed G145R modifies the HBsAg three-dimensional conformation( 39), rather directly decreases its binding affinity to HLA dimers or antibodies. Our methods did not assess differences in protein conformation. Nevertheless, our results concerning the use of pre-S containing HBV vaccines has been confirmed through multiple trials in non- SAS cohorts with likely different genetic architectures, and our main conclusion still holds. 320 Second, we used in-silico results to study binding strength of different antigens and their epitopes. While NetMHCIIpan is a validated well-performing algorithms that has shown great reliability in identifying strong HLA dimer binders, it is not the gold standard method to determine binding affinity. However, the fact that its results mirrored genetic associations and highlighted areas of high mutation risk independent of epidemiological data reinforces our 325 findings. Our negative control results for DT (see Supplementary Text ), where the in-silico locus of VEMs led to decreased pathogenicity, are also reassuring. Ultimately, confirmation of this work will require increased HBV case surveillance and linkage to sequencing and vaccination history, but these are challenging especially in low-to-middle income settings where VEM emergence is more likely. 330 In conclusion, in this Bangladeshi children cohort, orthogonal sources of genetic, in-silico , and epidemiological data showed that the DPB1*04:01 allele improved response to the regular yeast recombinant S isoform HBV vaccine. We find genetic pressure on HBV to induce VEMs at the a-determinant due to human HLA alleles. Trials on pre-S containing HBV vaccines should be 335 prioritized to limit the future rise of HBV VEMs in endemic regions. Methods used here are relevant for other vaccines where human genetic diversity underlies immune response. Methods Study cohorts 340 The participants were recruited from two separate vaccination cohorts( 23, 24): 1) the Performance of Rotavirus and Oral Polio Vaccines in Developing Countries (PROVIDE) study( 25), and 2) the Cryptosporidiosis Birth Cohort( 26) (CBC). The CBC cohort was designed to study the effect of different gastrointestinal pathogens on child growth, while the PROVIDE cohort was an interventional 2x2 factorial design trial or oral rotavirus and polio vaccine 345 .

NCT02764918). However, all participants were v accinated per the national Bangladesh Expanded Program on Immunizations. This included the following: 1) pentavalent vaccine (diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus, adw hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B) at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age, 2) bivalent Measles-Rubella vaccine at 40 weeks of age, and 3) the monovalent measles vaccine at 65 weeks of age. 350 Serology Plasma samples were obtained at an approximate 52-week age point. The assays were described in detail elsewhere( 37). Briefly, three validated multiplex immunoassays were used to measure antibody concentrations against several vaccine antigens. This method measures total IgG 355 against each respective antigen including functional (e.g. neutralizing) as well as non-functional antibodies. Antibodies against DT, TT, pertussis toxin (PT), pertactin (PRN), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), and MV were determined in the MDTaP assay, which is a combination of two previously described assays( 40, 41). Antibodies against Hib polysaccharide were determined in the HiB assay( 42). For MV and DT the correlation of the multiplex immunoassay 360 to gold standard functional assays is high( 43, 44). The final concentration of bound antibody was calculated by determining the median fluorescence intensity of the antigen-specific beads and using diluted standards to calculate the concentration in international units for each antigen. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) responses were measured using the anti-HBs kit on the ABBOTT Architect i2000 using recommended protocols (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago IL, 365 USA). Genotyping All participants were genotyped using the Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA). The quality control steps (QC) were as follows: we removed all samples with a 370 call rate < 97% with heterozygosity more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean, whose genetic sex did not match their reported one (threshold F > 0.8 for males and F < 0.2 for females), or with identity-by-descent > 0.9. We excluded genetic variants with a call rate < 97% or with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) p-value > 5x10-8. For males, we did not remove chromosome X variants based on HWE. After QC, we imputed additional genetic variants with 375 the TOPMed imputation server( 31) (August 8, 2022). Finally, we removed all variants with imputation r2 < 0.6 and minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.5%. HLA imputation panel We used a combination of the UKB's hard-called genotype array data( 45), WES variants, and 380 HLA allele calls from WES( 46) of 9448 unrelated south Asian genetic ancestry participants in the UKB( 33) in order to build a HLA reference panel at 2-field resolution (details of the HLA calling algorithm and QC are described elsewhere in full( 33)). First, we combined the UKB's genotype array hard called variants with the WES calls to form 385 the genetic variant backbone of our reference panel. We only used genotyped hard calls with HWE p-value > 5x10-8, and only used WES calls with HWE p-value > 5x10-8, average genotype quality of 10 or more, average depth of 10 or more, a minor allele count of 2 or more, and who passed the UKB's internal quality check (i.e. \"FILTER=PASS\" in the vcf files). If a variant was found in both the genotype hard calls and the WES calls, the directly genotyped results were 390 retained.

We then used a modified version of the HLA-TAPAS pipeline( 34) to combine the HLA allele 395 calls with the variant backbone above (\"MakeReference\") and to impute HLA alleles in our cohort (\"SNP2HLA\"). No other parts of the HLA-TAPAS pipeline were used. Briefly, major modification to the HLA-TAPAS pipeline included the native usage of GRCh38 as the reference chromosome build (instead of successive lift-overs to hg19 and then to hg18), the use of Beagle v5.4 for phasing( 47) and imputation( 48), the use of a \"decoy\" allele (99*99) to represent a HLA-DRB4 , or HLA-DRB5 alleles, and a the creation of the reference panel, we removed samples with a genotype missing rate of 30% or more, we removed 405 genetic variants with a HWE p-value < 5x10-8 o r a m i s s i n g r a t e o f 5 % o r m o r e . F o r t h e SNP2HLA imputation step, imputed variables from our cohort were used as input (see Genotyping section above). We did additional QC on the SNP2HLA results as follows. First, given that SNP2HLA assumes 410 that HLA alleles are equivalent to biallelic single nucleotide variants, this can lead to situations where a participant will be assigned more than 2 alleles at any given genes. When this happened, we removed all imputed calls at that gene for that participant. Second, after comparing our imputed results with another HLA calling technology (see HLA imputation accuracy below), we selected an r2 threshold of 0.3 for all genes except for HLA-DRB3 , HLA-DRB4 , and HLA-DRB5 , 415 for which a threshold of 0.6 was used. Lastly, except for HLA-DRB3 , HLA-DRB4 , and HLA- DRB5 which are not present in all individuals, genes for which an imputed call were available in less than 30% of participants were removed from any further analyses. Lastly, once the final imputation calls were determined for each participant, we extracted their 420 corresponding amino acid residue sequence using the IPD-IMGT/HLA database( 49) (v3.45.0). HLA imputation accuracy To assess the accuracy of our HLA imputation results, we directly genotyped 541 study participants using 454 sequencing technology (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) on primers for exon 2 to identify the HLA alleles. However, given that our imputation panel uses all exons to assign a HLA allele, this can lead to considerable ambiguity and falsely decrease the concordance between the two methods. Hence, all comparisons between the two methods were done at the G-group level. That 430 is, we compared imputed and 454 sequencing called alleles at the level of exons 2 and 3 for class I genes, and exon 2 only for class II genes. Since these are the most polymorphic exons in a HLA gene, this is sufficient to assess how well the imputation panel performs( 34). Importantly, the concordance values obtained in this way are still also expected to be conservative estimates of the true performance of our imputation panel, since discordant results may still represent 435 correctly imputed HLA alleles. GWAS and HLA association studies . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.26.23291885doi: medRxiv preprint For all association studies, serology levels were inverse qq-normalized to prevent variance inflation. All analyses used the first 10 genetic principal components, the cohort as a factor 440 variable (CBC or PROVIDE), and participant sex as covariates. Age was not a covariate given that all participants were the same age on blood draw. To control for relatedness and polygenic risk, we used Regenie( 32) for all GWAS and HLA allele and amino acid association studies. Regenie uses two steps. In step 1, a polygenic risk score is built to predict the phenotype. For this step, we only selected variants with a MAF > 1%, a minor allele count > 6, a genotype missing 445 rate < 5%, HWE p-value > 10-10, and in linkage equilibrium (--indep-pairwise 200 100 0.2 in Plink v1.9). During step 2, Regenie uses this polygenic risk score with a leave-one-chromosome- out approach as additional covariates for the allele association studies. Only alleles with MAF > 0.5% were used for the GWAS, HLA allele, and amino acid associations studies. 450 For the haplotype association study for the HLA-DQ dimers, we could not use the usual GWAS additive effect model for single variants (i.e. a score of 0, 1, or 2 if the participant does not carry the allele, is heterozygous for the allele, or is homozygous for the allele, respectively). Instead, for any combination of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles, we gave a score of 0 if the participant did not have a pair of these alleles, a score of 1 if the participant is heterozygous for 455 each allele, a score of 2 if the participant is homozygous for one allele and heterozygous for the other, and a score of 4 if the participant is homozygous for both alleles. This corresponds a dosage of allele pairs, mimicking the possible combination expected in an individual. This score was used as the regressor for the serology levels, and the linear regressions were performed in R v4.1.0( 50). The same covariates as above were used: sex, 10 genetic principal components, and 460 Regenie's step 1 polygenic risks. We used a genome-wide significant threshold divided by the number of traits to determine statistical significance (i.e. 5x10-8/8). For the HLA allele association studies, we used the alleles that passed this threshold for conditional analyses. Conditional analyses were also performed 465 with Regenie, with the same options and covariates as for the primary analyses above. HLA dimers visualization HLA receptor dimers and amino acid residue association results were visualized with protein cartoon graphs using PyMOL( 51), then combined with the magick R package( 52). All dimer 470 sequences and 3D structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank( 53): 3LQZ( 54) receptor binding in-silico analyses To determine HLA dimer binding to different HBsAg and DT epitopes, we first extracted their 475 protein sequences from Uniprot( 36) (January 20, 2023). The full search for HBsAG was \"hbsag AND (virus_host_id9606)\", which was further narrowed only to Swiss-Prot reviewed sequences. The full search for DT was '(protein_name=\"Diphtheria Toxin\") AND (length:[550 to 570])'. We then manually extracted sequences from any Corynebacterium organisms or from corynephage ( Diphtheria 's viral bacteriophage which produces the toxin). As the number of 480 available protein sequences was smaller for DT, we did not remove non-Swiss-Prot reviewed sequences. After removal of identical sequences, we were left with 50 HBsAg sequences and 13 DT sequences. We trimmed the beginning of each sequence to a length of 389 amino acids for HBsAg, and a length of 535 for DT, corresponding to the biologically active parts of each protein (pre-S and S for HBsAg( 57), and fragments A and B for DT(58)). Lastly, for DT, all 485 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We used NetMHCIIpan( 35) (v4.0) to determine in-silico HLA dimer binding strength to all HBsAg and DT proteins obtained above. The default peptide length of 15 without context 490 encoding was used. We used the eluted ligand results for all further analyses and their interpretation (i.e. the binding affinity mode was not used given its reduced accuracy( 35)). For HLA-DP and HLA-DQ, analyses were restricted to dimers that were found in at least 5% of participants based on their HLA allele combination. For DRB dimers, analyses were and HLA-DRB5 alleles with frequency > 495 10%. We used beta regression on the rank outputs (divided by 100) to compare relative in-silico binding between HLA dimers. Binding difference plots To plot difference in in-silico binding strength between two HLA dimers, we subtracted the 500 netMHCIIpan ranks of the worse dimer from those of the best dimer at each 15-mer peptide in the corresponding protein (HBsAg or DT). When there were multiple 15-mer for a given position, we used the one with the best binding strength for the subtraction. Hence the result from the subtraction is the difference between the best and the worst dimers for their \"best case\" binding strength at any given location of HBsAg. 505 Ethics For both Bangladeshi cohorts, written informed consents was obtained from either the mother only (PROVIDE) or either parents or guardians (CBC). For the PROVIDE cohort, the protocol and informed consent were approved by the Ethics Review Committee and the Research Review 510 Committee of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), the University of Virginia, and the University of Vermont. For the CBC cohort, the study was also approved by the same review boards at the ICDDR,B and the University of Virginia. The genetic component of the study was also independently approved by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee. 515 For the replication cohorts from Africa studied as part of VaccGene, ethical approval was provided locally by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (reference GC/127/12/07/32) and Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (MV625), and in the UK by London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (A340) and Oxford Tropical Research (39-12 and 42- 520 14) Ethics Committees for the Uganda cohort. Ethical approval was obtained from ethical approval from the University of Witwatersrand and Human Research Ethics Committee (reference M130714) and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (1042-13 and 42-14) for the South African cohort. Lastly, ethical approval was obtained from the Ministere de la Recherche Scientifique et 525 de l'Innovation in Burkina Faso (reference 2014-12-151) and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (41-12).

A) The most restricted S-HBsAg isoform is used in yeast recombinant vaccine production. The pre-S1 segment is crucial for capsid interaction during virion assembly, and for hepatocyte viral entry in the first phase of HBV infection when it interacts with sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). B) Representation of the two HBsAg conformations on the surface of HBV. The primary antigenic domain \"a\"-determinant (where most known vaccine escape variants are found) is located between transmembr ane domains TM1 and TM2, facing the outside of the virion.

For each dimer, the blue chains repre sent the alpha subunits (i.e. DPA1, DRA, and DQA1, from left to right), the green chains represent the beta subunits (i.e. DPB1, DRB1, and DQB 1, from left to right), and the yellow chains show the location of a given epitope in the dimers' peptide binding grooves. See fig. S5 for similar visualization for DT and HLA-DRB5, and for PRN and HLA-DQ. .

Points are the effect coefficien ts from beta regression run on the rank outputs of predicted binding of all 15-mers derived from 50 HBsAg protein sequences. In green, results are shown for the full HBsAg protein sequence . In orange, results are shown from an analysis restricted only to 15-mers within the S isoform of HBsAg. The S isoform is the one used in making ye ast recombinant vaccines, such as those given to our participants. Coefficients and 95 % CIs are shown. The more they are positioned to the lef t, the higher average in-silico binding across the antigen. Dimers in bold contain the DPB1*04:01 allele, to better compare with the HBsAg antibody association tests in the right panel. B) Results from the HLA allele association studies using linear regression with antibody responses and imputed HLA alleles from t he Bangladeshi datasets. Again, coefficients and 95% CIs are shown. Values to the right on the x-axis indicate greater HBsAg antib ody measures. The DPB1*04:01 allele is shown in bold to better compare with the in-silico results in the left panel. .

The x-axis represents bins of 1 amino-acid across the entire HBsAg sequence. The y-axis represents the difference in binding affinity between the top-binding 15-mers binding in this region for b oth dimers. Positive values indicate greater binding for DPA1*01:03-DPB1*04:01 than for DPA1*01:03-DPB1*26:01. Negative values indicate the opposite . The colours of the vertical bars refer to the rank of affinity of binding of the 15-mer to either DPA1*01:03-DPB1*04:01 (positive values) o r DPA1*01:03- DPB1*26:01 (negative values). Small blue bars mean that both dimers are predicted to bind with high affinity (top 10% quantile) at this position. Long red bars mean that the difference in dimer binding to 15-mer is predicted to be large, but weak for both. A long dark blue bar means that the expected binding difference is large and that one of the dimers bind strongly to the 15-mer. For example, 15-mers around positi on 300 of the HBsAg protein are expected to bind strongly to DPA1*01:03-DPB1*26:01 and to bind much better than to DPA1*01:03-DPB1*04:01. Bottom co lored horizontal bar indicates the different section of the HBsAg protein. .
