This network surrounds all the organs, muscles, and joints and is called the fascial system. When stiffness develops in the fascial system, muscle knots form as well as restrictions in range of motion, flexibility, and mobility. This restriction is painful. The Fascial Pain Clinic in Wahiawa, Honolulu, & Lanai can help you move more freely and feel better with the use of fascial adaptive stretch protocols. Fascial restriction can be caused by trauma, injury, or lack of movement. Trauma or injury can occur with repetitive movements, overuse, or even poor posture. Emotional, physical, or mental stress can also affect the fascial network and cause restrictions. Besides tension, reduced mobility, and lack of range of motion, other symptoms can manifest, including headaches, poor sleep, anxiety, and depression. At The Fascial Pain Clinic, we can provide a personalized treatment plan to restore flexibility and improve the function of the fascial system. A routine of stretches will be developed along with lifestyle modifications to rest the body and improve sleep. Adhering to these stretches and lifestyle changes will provide better well-being and performance. If you are dealing with fascial restriction, call (808) 621-6299 for the Wahiawa and Honolulu office and (808) 565-8001 for the Lanai office to make an appointment. "}
