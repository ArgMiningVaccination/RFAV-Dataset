The ideological biases of medical or \"allopathic\" (disease as \"other\" or \"outsider\") practice are identified and grafted onto other perspectives on how people not engaged in modern medicine have achieved healing and health. Alternative forms of healing and health open a consideration of ethnomedicine, many forms of which are unknown and, hence, untested by modern medical research. Ethnomedicine the world over and throughout human history has displayed unique spiritual (vitalism), pharmaceutical (herbs/drugs), and mechanical (manipulation/surgery) approaches to treating illness. The argument is that modern allopathic medicine would do well to consider such \"world medicine\" as having valuable alternative and complementary therapies, the use of which could enhance contemporary medical advice and practice.
