Additionally, by cleaning your retainer with crystals, you can avoid embarrassing stains that would cause you to have an unattractive smile in public. After your [Invisalign treatment](https://patuxentorthodontics.com/spark-aligners-vs-invisalign/#:~:text=INVISALIGN%3A%20WHAT%20IS,are%20continually%20emerging.) is complete, you may be required to wear your retainer for up to 22 hours a day to help stabilize your teeth's new alignment. All Invisalign cleaning crystals are made of entirely non-toxic, completely safe materials and have been specially formulated for use with Invisalign products. Keeping your Invisalign retainer clean is very important for the following reasons: - Food and debris can get trapped in your retainer. - Bacteria are attracted to food debris. - Plaque forms when bacteria accumulate on the teeth. - Cavities caused by plague may require treatment in the future. - By keeping your mouth free of bacteria, you can prevent tooth decay and gum disease. Any teeth or gum issues could affect the duration of your Invisalign treatment. That leads us back to the question of how to use Invisalign cleaning crystals properly to clean an Invisalign retainer. Find out how to get a clean, crystal-clear mouth using the best Invisalign cleaner! Using Invisalign Cleaning Crystals Cleaning crystals with Invisalign are quite straightforward to use. We'll begin with a quick tip about using Invisalign crystals. To help maintain consistency, you should schedule your cleanings at the same time each day. By developing a [cleaning routine](https://patuxentorthodontics.com/what-makes-my-invisalign-trays-and-attachments-stain/#:~:text=INVISALIGN%20ATTACHMENTS%20AND,rinse%20thoroughly%20afterward.), you will be more likely to maintain your Invisalign retainer in optimal condition. The following is a simple step-by-step guide on how to clean Invisalign aligners: 1. Use lukewarm water to gently rinse your retainers. You should only wash your retainer in lukewarm water because hot and cold water can cause the warping of thermoplastic materials. Use water that is as close as possible to room temperature. Running water is best since it gently pushes away debris. 2. Your Invisalign cleaning tub can be filled with warm water if you have one. A cup or bowl will do for those who don't have a cleaning tub. Put just enough water in the container to submerge the retainer. 3. While your retainer soaks, dump a packet of Invisalign cleaning crystals into the bathtub or cup. 4. Allow the retainer to soak for 15 minutes. 5. Wash your retainer with lukewarm water after removing it from the crystal solution. 6. With a wet toothbrush, gently brush your retainers to remove any lingering debris or particles. 7. Clean the retainer one last time by running it under warm water. 8. Voila - You're all set! The Invisalign retainers need to be cleaned twice per day. The best times to clean your Invisalign retainers are in the morning and evening. Maintain a clean, bacteria-free environment for your retainer by regularly rinsing, wiping, and drying your retainer case. Invisalign Retainer Cleaning Tips: What You Should Never Use Invisalign retainers should never be cleaned with toothpaste. Because of its abrasive nature, toothpaste does not work as well as Invisalign cleaning crystals. Additionally, it's best to steer clear of colored or scented soaps to avoid discoloration of your retainer because they can leave grime and residue on your retainer and create lingering odors and tastes in your retainer. While mouthwash is safe to use when cleaning Invisalign retainers, it may not be efficient at reducing bacteria to prevent stains, odors, and tooth decay.
