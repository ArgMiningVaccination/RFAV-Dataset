Lead poisoning can cause learning, hearing, and behavioral problems, and can harm your child's brain, kidneys, and other organs. Lead in the body stops good minerals such as iron and calcium from working right. Some of these effects may be permanent. Lead Awareness and Your Child Children with lead poisoning usually do not look or act sick. The only way to know if your child has lead poisoning is by getting a blood test. Ask your doctor or health care provider to test your child at ages 1 and 2. Where is Lead Found? Lead-based paint is a hazard if it is peeling, chipping, chalking, or cracking. Even lead-based paint that appears to be undisturbed can be a problem if it is on surfaces that children chew or that get a lot of wear and tear. The older your home is, the more likely it is to contain lead-based paint. Contaminated dust forms when lead paint is dry scraped or sanded. Dust can also become contaminated when painted surfaces bump or rub together. Lead chips and dust can gather on surfaces and objects that people touch or that children put into their mouths. Contaminated soil occurs when exterior lead-based paint from houses, buildings, or other structures flakes or peels and gets into the soil. Soil near roadways may also be contaminated from past use of leaded gasoline in cars. Avoid these areas when planting vegetable gardens. Other Potential Sources of Lead Contaminated drinking water from older plumbing fixtures Lead-based painted toys and household furniture Imported lead-glazed pottery and leaded crystal Lead smelters Hobbies such as furniture refurnishing, stained glass work, or art restoration Folk remedies like azarcon and pay-loo-ah Cosmetics like kohl and kajal Candy from MexicoDo not store food in glazed pottery from foreign countries.Lead poisoning occurs without any obvious symptoms.
