General Information [Cannabis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=716285&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), also known as [marijuana](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285927&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), originated in Central Asia but is grown worldwide today. In the United States, it is a [controlled substance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=716287&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and is classified as a [Schedule I agent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with a high potential for abuse, and no currently accepted medical use). The Cannabis plant produces a [resin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642508&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) containing 21-carbon terpenophenolic [compounds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called [cannabinoids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=716077&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), in addition to other compounds found in plants, such as [terpenes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463097&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [flavonoids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=330168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The highest [concentration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683342&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cannabinoids is found in the female flowers of the plant.[ [1](#cit/section_2.1)] Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid, but over 100 other cannabinoids have been reported to be present in the plant. Cannabidiol (CBD) does not produce the characteristic [altered](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44643&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) consciousness associated with Cannabis. It is felt to have potential [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effectiveness and has recently been approved in the form of the pharmaceutical Epidiolex for the treatment of [refractory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350245&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [seizure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45484&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in children. Other cannabinoids that are being investigated for potential medical benefits (CBN), cannabigerol are limited. The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FDA) has not approved the use of Cannabis as a treatment for any medical [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), although both isolated THC and CBD pharmaceuticals are licensed and approved. To conduct [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) research with [botanical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367458&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) Cannabis in the United States, researchers must file an [Investigational New Drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=762975&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (IND) application with the FDA, obtain a Schedule I license from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and obtain approval from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In the 2018 United States Farm Bill, the term hemp is used to describe cultivars of the Cannabis species that contain less than 0.3% THC. Hemp oil or CBD oil are products of industrial hemp (i.e., low-THC cannabis cultivars), whereas hemp seed oil is an edible fatty oil that is essentially cannabinoid-free (see [Table 1](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cannabis-pdq#_331)). Some products contain other botanical extracts and/or [over-the-counter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44696&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [analgesics](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45590&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These products are readily available as [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [topical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45927&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tinctures or other formulations often advertised for pain management and other purposes. Hemp products containing less than 0.3% of delta-9-THC are not scheduled drugs and could be considered as Farm Bill compliant. Hemp is not a controlled substance; however, CBD is a substance. |Name/Material||Constituents/Composition| |CBD living with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) include the following:[ [2](#cit/section_2.2)] [Antiemetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46084&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)effects.

Although few relevant surveys of practice patterns exist, it appears that [physicians](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390246&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caring for patients with cancer in the United States who recommend medicinal Cannabis do so predominantly for [symptom management](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269453&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [3](#cit/section_2.3)] A growing number of [pediatric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46245&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients are seeking symptom relief with Cannabis or cannabinoid treatment, although studies are limited.[ [4](#cit/section_2.4)] The [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/en-us/Pages/Default.aspx) has not endorsed Cannabis and cannabinoid use because of concerns about brain development.

The [National Cancer Institute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44266&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NCI) hosted a virtual meeting, the NCI Cannabis, Cannabinoids, and Cancer Research Symposium, on December 15-18, 2020. The seven sessions are summarized in the [Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs](https://academic.oup.com/jncimono/article/2021/58/35/6446198?login=true) and contain basic science and clinical information as well as a summary of the barriers to conducting Cannabis research.[ [5](#cit/section_2.5)- [11](#cit/section_2.11)] References - Adams IB, Martin BR: Cannabis: pharmacology and toxicology in animals and humans.

O'Shaughnessy, a [surgeon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44306&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who learned of its medicinal properties while working in India for the British East India Company. Its use was promoted for reported [analgesic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45590&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [sedative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450118&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [anti-inflammatory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44187&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), antispasmodic, and [anticonvulsant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46083&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effects. In 1937, the U.S. Treasury Department introduced the Marihuana Tax Act. This Act imposed a levy of $1 per [ounce](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=330174&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for medicinal use of Cannabis and $100 per ounce for nonmedical use. [Physicians](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390246&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the United States were the principal opponents of the Act. The American Medical Association (AMA) opposed the Act because physicians were required to pay a special tax for [prescribing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44711&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) Cannabis, use special order forms to procure it, and keep special records concerning its professional use. In addition, the AMA believed that objective evidence that Cannabis was harmful was lacking and that passage of the Act would impede further research into its medicinal worth.[ [6](#cit/section_3.6)] In 1942, Cannabis was removed from the U.S. [Pharmacopoeia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285980&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) because of persistent concerns about its potential to cause harm.[ [2](#cit/section_3.2), [3](#cit/section_3.3)] Recently, there has been renewed interest in Cannabis by the U.S. Pharmacopeia.[ [7](#cit/section_3.7)] In 1951, Congress passed the Boggs Act, which for the first time included Cannabis with [narcotic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44691&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In 1970, with the passage of the Controlled Substances Act, [marijuana](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285927&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was classified by Congress as a [Schedule I drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Drugs in Schedule I are distinguished as having no currently accepted medicinal use in the United States. Other Schedule I substances include [heroin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641798&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), LSD, mescaline, and methaqualone. Despite its designation as having no medicinal use, Cannabis was distributed by the U.S. government to patients on a case-by-case basis under the [Compassionate Use](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46526&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [Investigational New Drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=762975&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) program established in 1978. Distribution of Cannabis through this program was closed to new patients in 1992.[ [1](#cit/section_3.1)- [4](#cit/section_3.4)] Although federal law prohibits the use of Cannabis, [Figure 1](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cannabis-pdq#_250) below shows the states and territories that have legalized Cannabis use for medical purposes. Additional states have legalized only one ingredient in Cannabis, such as cannabidiol (CBD), and are not included in the map. Some medical marijuana laws are broader than others, and there is state-to-state variation in the types of medical conditions for which treatment is allowed.[ [8](#cit/section_3.8)] The main psychoactive constituent of Cannabis was identified delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In 1986, an [isomer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373084&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [synthetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462950&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) delta-9-THC in sesame oil was licensed and approved for the treatment of [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-associated [nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [vomiting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) under the [generic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44672&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) name [dronabinol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45240&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) determined that dronabinol was as effective as or better than other [antiemetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46084&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) agents available at the time.[ [9](#cit/section_3.9)] Dronabinol was also studied for its ability to stimulate weight gain in patients with [AIDS](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45950&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the late 1980s. Thus, the indications were expanded to include treatment of [anorexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44103&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) associated with [human immunodeficiency virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44366&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in 1992. Clinical trial results showed no statistically [significant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390271&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) weight gain, although patients reported an improvement in [appetite](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454699&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [10](#cit/section_3.10), [11](#cit/section_3.11)] Another important [cannabinoid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=716077&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) found This is a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid, which is an [analog](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44919&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of THC. In recent the neurobiology of [13](#cit/section_3.13)- [16](#cit/section_3.16)] The first cannabinoid [receptor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44958&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), CB1, was identified in the brain in 1988. A second cannabinoid receptor, CB2, was identified in 1993. The highest expression of CB2 receptors is located on [B lymphocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44953&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [natural killer suggesting a possible role in [immunity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=468803&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Endogenous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44026&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) have been identified and appear to have a role in pain modulation, control of movement, feeding behavior, mood, bone growth, and 1:1 ratio of THC:CBD, is approved in Canada (under the Notice of Compliance with Conditions) for symptomatic relief of pain in advanced cancer and [multiple sclerosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44135&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [18](#cit/section_3.18)] Nabiximols is an [herbal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463714&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) preparation containing a defined quantity of specific cannabinoids formulated for oromucosal spray [administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with potential analgesic activity. Nabiximols contains extracts from two Cannabis plant varieties. The extracts mixture is standardized to the [concentrations](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683342&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the psychoactive delta-9-THC and the nonpsychoactive CBD. The preparation also contains other, more minor cannabinoids, [flavonoids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=330168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and terpenoids.[ [19](#cit/section_3.19)] Canada, New Zealand, and most countries in western Europe also approve nabiximols for spasticity of multiple sclerosis, a common symptom that may include muscle stiffness, reduced mobility, and pain, and for which existing therapy is unsatisfactory.

In another study, delta-9-THC, delta-8-THC, and cannabinol were found to inhibit the [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [in vitro](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [in vivo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46352&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [4](#cit/section_4.4)] In addition, other tumors have been shown to be sensitive to cannabinoid-induced growth inhibition.[ [5](#cit/section_4.5)- [8](#cit/section_4.8)] Cannabinoids may cause [antitumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446109&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) various mechanisms, including [induction](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45736&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) death, inhibition of cell growth, and inhibition of tumor [angiogenesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46529&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) invasion and [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [9](#cit/section_4.9)- [12](#cit/section_4.12)] Two reviews summarize the molecular mechanisms of cannabinoids as antitumor agents.[ [13](#cit/section_4.13), [14](#cit/section_4.14)] Cannabinoids appear to kill tumor cells but do not affect their nontransformed counterparts and may even protect them from cell death. For example, these compounds have been shown to induce [apoptosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46524&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in [glioma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45700&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells in [culture](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476357&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and induce [regression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46039&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of glioma tumors in mice and rats, while they protect normal glial cells of astroglial and oligodendroglial lineages from apoptosis mediated by the CB1 [9](#cit/section_4.9)] The effects of delta-9-THC and a [synthetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462950&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the CB2 receptor were investigated in HCC.[ [15](#cit/section_4.15)] Both agents reduced the viability of HCC cells in vitro and demonstrated antitumor effects in HCC [subcutaneous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [xenografts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44095&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in nude mice. The investigations documented that the anti-HCC effects are mediated by way of the CB2 receptor. Similar to findings in glioma cells, the cannabinoids were shown to trigger cell death through stimulation of an [endoplasmic reticulum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=763770&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) stress pathway that activates [autophagy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561319&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and promotes apoptosis. Other investigations have confirmed that CB1 and CB2 receptors may be potential targets in lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45963&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [ [16](#cit/section_4.16)] and [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [17](#cit/section_4.17)] An in vitro study of the effect of CBD on [programmed cell death](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407582&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in breast cancer [cell lines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44016&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) found that CBD induced programmed cell death, independent of the CB1, CB2, or vanilloid receptors. CBD inhibited the survival of both [estrogen receptor-positive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45270&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [estrogen receptor-negative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45272&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) breast cancer cell lines, inducing apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner while having little effect on nontumorigenic [mammary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44560&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells.[ [18](#cit/section_4.18)] Other studies have also shown the antitumor effect of cannabinoids (i.e., CBD and THC) in preclinical models of breast cancer.[ [19](#cit/section_4.19), [20](#cit/section_4.20)] CBD has also been demonstrated to exert effect in a [mouse model](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561606&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of increased [premalignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45846&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and malignant [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the mouse colon. Animals treated with azoxymethane and CBD concurrently were protected from developing premalignant and malignant lesions. In in vitro experiments involving [colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cell lines, the investigators found that CBD protected [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45671&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) from oxidative damage, increased endocannabinoid levels, and reduced [cell proliferation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46479&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In a subsequent study, the investigators found that the antiproliferative effect of CBD was counteracted by selective CB1 but not CB2 receptor [antagonists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350250&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), suggesting an involvement of CB1 receptors.[ [22](#cit/section_4.22)] Another investigation into the antitumor effects role of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).[ [12](#cit/section_4.12)] ICAM-1 expression in tumor cells has been reported to be negatively correlated with cancer [metastasis.](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) In [lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445043&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cell lines, CBD upregulated ICAM-1, leading to decreased cancer cell invasiveness. In an in vivo model using severe combined immunodeficient mice, subcutaneous tumors were generated by inoculating the animals with cells from human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines.[ [23](#cit/section_4.23)] Tumor growth was inhibited by 60% in THC-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated control mice. Tumor specimens revealed that THC had [antiangiogenic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44186&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and antiproliferative effects. However, research with [immunocompetent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44835&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) murine [tumor models](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44091&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has demonstrated [immunosuppression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45727&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and enhanced tumor growth in mice treated with THC.[ [24](#cit/section_4.24), [25](#cit/section_4.25)] In addition, both plant-derived and [endogenous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44026&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cannabinoids have been studied for anti- [inflammatory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373080&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effects. A mouse study demonstrated that endogenous cannabinoid system signaling is likely to provide intrinsic protection against colonic [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [26](#cit/section_4.26)] As a result, a [hypothesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44209&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that phytocannabinoids and endocannabinoids may be useful in the risk reduction and treatment of [colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has been developed.[ [27](#cit/section_4.27)- [30](#cit/section_4.30)] CBD may also enhance uptake of [cytotoxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) drugs into malignant cells. Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 2 (TRPV2) has been shown to inhibit proliferation of human [glioblastoma multiforme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45699&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells and overcome resistance to the [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) agent [carmustine.](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45976&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [ [31](#cit/section_4.31)] One study showed that coadministration THC and CBD over single-agent usage had greater antiproliferative activity in an in vitro study with multiple human glioblastoma multiforme cell lines.[ [32](#cit/section_4.32)] In an in vitro model, CBD increased TRPV2 activation and increased uptake of cytotoxic drugs, leading to apoptosis of glioma cells without affecting normal human [astrocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269436&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This suggests that coadministration of CBD with cytotoxic agents may increase drug uptake and potentiate cell death in human glioma cells. Also, CBD together with THC may enhance the antitumor activity of classic chemotherapeutic drugs such as [temozolomide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45387&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in some mouse models of cancer.[ [13](#cit/section_4.13), [33](#cit/section_4.33)] A [meta-analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=691484&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of 34 in vitro and in vivo studies of cannabinoids in glioma reported that all but one study confirmed that cannabinoids selectively kill tumor cells.[ [34](#cit/section_4.34)] Antiemetic Effects Preclinical research suggests that emetic circuitry is tonically controlled by endocannabinoids. The [antiemetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46084&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) action of cannabinoids is believed to be mediated via interaction with the [5-hydroxytryptamine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335512&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) 3 (5-HT3) receptor. CB1 receptors and 5-HT3 receptors are colocalized on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons, where they have opposite effects on GABA release.[ [35](#cit/section_4.35)] There also may be direct inhibition gated [ion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643017&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) currents through non-CB1 receptor pathways. CB1 receptor antagonists have been shown to elicit [emesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256560&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the least shrew that is reversed by cannabinoid agonists.[ [36](#cit/section_4.36)] The involvement of CB1 receptor in emesis prevention has been shown by the ability of CB1 antagonists to reverse the effects of THC and other [synthetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462950&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cannabinoid CB1 agonists in suppressing vomiting caused by [cisplatin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45230&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the house musk shrew and [lithium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476347&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) chloride in the least shrew. In the latter model, CBD was also shown to be efficacious.[ [37](#cit/section_4.37), [38](#cit/section_4.38)] Appetite Stimulation Many [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have previously demonstrated that delta-9-THC and other cannabinoids have a stimulatory effect on [appetite](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454699&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and increase food intake. It is believed that the endogenous cannabinoid system may serve as a regulator of feeding behavior. The endogenous cannabinoid anandamide potently enhances [receptors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44958&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [hypothalamus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46359&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be involved in the motivational or reward aspects of eating.[ [40](#cit/section_4.40)] Analgesia Understanding the mechanism of cannabinoid-induced [analgesia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=449929&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has been increased through the study of cannabinoid receptors, endocannabinoids, and synthetic agonists and antagonists. Cannabinoids produce analgesia through supraspinal, spinal, and peripheral modes of action, acting on both ascending and descending pain pathways.[ [41](#cit/section_4.41)] The CB1 receptor is found in both the [central nervous system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46481&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CNS) and in peripheral [nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) terminals. Similar to [opioid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45054&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) receptors, increased levels of the CB1 receptor are found in regions of the brain that regulate nociceptive processing.[ [42](#cit/section_4.42)] CB2 receptors, located predominantly in peripheral [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), exist at very low levels in the CNS. With the development of receptor-specific antagonists, additional information about the roles of the receptors and endogenous cannabinoids in the modulation of pain has been obtained.[ [43](#cit/section_4.43), [44](#cit/section_4.44)] Cannabinoids may also contribute to pain an anti-inflammatory mechanism; a CB2 effect with cannabinoids acting on [mast cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44845&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) receptors to attenuate the release of inflammatory agents, such as [histamine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=657848&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [serotonin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335511&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and on keratinocytes to enhance the release of analgesic [opioids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45054&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has been described.[ [45](#cit/section_4.45)- [47](#cit/section_4.47)] One study reported that the efficacy of synthetic CB1- and CB2-receptor agonists were comparable with the efficacy of morphine in a murine model of tumor pain.[ [48](#cit/section_4.48)] Cannabinoids have been shown to prevent chemotherapy-induced [neuropathy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46041&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) models exposed to [paclitaxel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45258&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [vincristine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or cisplatin.[ [49](#cit/section_4.49)- [51](#cit/section_4.51)] Anxiety and Sleep The endocannabinoid system is believed to be centrally involved in the regulation of mood and the extinction of aversive memories. Animal studies have shown CBD to have anxiolytic properties. It was shown in rats that these anxiolytic properties are mediated through unknown mechanisms.[ [52](#cit/section_4.52)] Anxiolytic effects of CBD have been shown in several animal models.[ [53](#cit/section_4.53), [54](#cit/section_4.54)] The endocannabinoid system has also been shown to play a key role in the modulation of the sleep-waking cycle in rats.[ Adams IB, Martin BR: Cannabis: pharmacology and toxicology in animals and Addiction 91 (11): 1585-614, 1996.

Of the 2,737 possible participants, 936 (34%) completed the anonymous questionnaire. Twenty-four percent of patients considered themselves active Cannabis users. Similar numbers of patients inhaled (70%) or used edibles (70%), with dual use (40%) being common. Non-mutually exclusive reasons for Cannabis use [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (75%), neuropsychiatric symptoms (63%), recreational use/enjoyment (35%), and treatment of cancer (26%).

A Cochrane meta-analysis of 23 RCTs reviewed studies conducted between 1975 and 1991 that investigated dronabinol or nabilone, either as [monotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=754011&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or as an adjunct to the [conventional](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44198&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) dopamine [antagonists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350250&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that were the [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) antiemetics at that time.[ [44](#cit/section_5.44)] The chemotherapy [regimens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45864&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) involved drugs with low, moderate, or high [emetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467221&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) potential. The meta-analysis graded the quality of evidence as low for most outcomes. The review concluded that individuals were more likely to report complete absence of N/V when they received cannabinoids compared with placebo, although they were more likely to withdraw from the study because of an adverse event. Individuals reported a higher preference for cannabinoids than placebo or prochlorperazine. There was no difference in the antiemetic effect of cannabinoids when compared with prochlorperazine. The authors concluded that Cannabis-based medications may be useful for treating [refractory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350245&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) chemotherapy-induced N/V; however, they cautioned that their assessment may change with the availability of newer antiemetic regimens. At least 50% of patients who receive moderately emetogenic chemotherapy may experience delayed chemotherapy-induced N/V. Although selective neurokinin 1 antagonists that inhibit substance P have been approved for delayed N/V, a study was conducted before their availability to assess dronabinol, [ondansetron](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=616146&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or their combination antagonist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467824&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), is one of the mainstay agents in the current antiemetic armamentarium. In this trial, the primary objective was to assess the response 2 to 5 days after moderately to severely emetogenic chemotherapy. Sixty-one patients were analyzed for efficacy. The total response\u2014a composite endpoint\u2014including nausea intensity, vomiting/retching, and use of rescue medications, was similar with dronabinol (54%), ondansetron (58%), and combination therapy (47%) when compared with placebo (20%). Nausea absence was greater in the active treatment groups (dronabinol 71%, ondansetron 64%, combination therapy 53%) when compared with placebo (15%; P < .05 vs. placebo for all). Occurrence rates for nausea intensity and vomiting/retching episodes were the lowest in patients treated with dronabinol, suggesting that dronabinol compares favorably with ondansetron in this situation where a substance P inhibitor would currently be the drug of choice. For more information, see the [Cannabis](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea/nausea-hp-pdq#_457) section in Nausea and Vomiting Related to Cancer Treatment. Cannabis Three trials have evaluated the efficacy of inhaled Cannabis in chemotherapy-induced N/V.[ [46](#cit/section_5.46)- [49](#cit/section_5.49)] In two of the studies, inhaled Cannabis was made available only after dronabinol failure. In the first trial, no antiemetic effect was achieved with marijuana in patients receiving [cyclophosphamide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45253&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [doxorubicin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=560140&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),[ [46](#cit/section_5.46)] but in the second trial, a [statistically significant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44167&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) superior antiemetic effect of inhaled Cannabis versus placebo was found among patients receiving high-dose [methotrexate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45393&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [47](#cit/section_5.47)] The third trial was a randomized, double-blind, [placebo-controlled](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44840&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), crossover trial involving 20 adults in which both inhaled marijuana and oral THC were evaluated. One-quarter of the patients reported a favorable antiemetic response to the cannabinoid [therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This latter study was reported in abstract form in 1984. A full report, detailing the methods and outcomes apparently has not been published, which limits a thorough interpretation of the significance of these findings.[ [48](#cit/section_5.48)] Newer antiemetics (e.g., 5-HT3 receptor antagonists) have not been directly compared with Cannabis or cannabinoids in cancer patients. However, the Cannabis-extract oromucosal spray, nabiximols, formulated with 1:1 a small [pilot](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45838&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) randomized, placebo-controlled, trial in 2017 state that evidence remains insufficient to recommend medical marijuana for either the [prevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or treatment of N/V in patients with cancer who receive chemotherapy or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [41](#cit/section_5.41)] Appetite Stimulation [Anorexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44103&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), early satiety, weight loss, and [cachexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44108&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are problems experienced by cancer patients. Such patients are faced not only with the disfigurement associated with wasting but also with an inability to engage in the social interaction of meals. Cannabinoids Four controlled trials have assessed the effect of oral THC on measures of appetite, food appreciation, [calorie](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44651&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) intake, and weight loss in patients with advanced malignancies. Three relatively small, placebo-controlled trials (N = 52; N = 46; N = 65) each found that oral THC produced improvements in one or more of these outcomes.[ [51](#cit/section_5.51)- [53](#cit/section_5.53)] The one study that used an active control evaluated the efficacy of dronabinol alone or with [megestrol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46617&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [acetate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=655020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) compared with that of megestrol acetate alone for managing cancer-associated anorexia.[ [54](#cit/section_5.54)] In this randomized, double-blind study of 469 adults with [advanced cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and weight loss, patients received 2.5 mg of oral THC twice daily, 800 mg of oral megestrol daily, or both. Appetite increased by 75% in the megestrol group and weight increased by 11%, compared with a 49% increase in appetite and a 3% increase in weight in the oral THC group after 8 to 11 weeks of treatment. The between-group differences were statistically [significant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390271&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in favor of megestrol acetate. Furthermore, the combined therapy did not offer additional benefits beyond those provided by megestrol acetate alone. The authors concluded that dronabinol did little to promote appetite or weight gain in advanced cancer patients compared with megestrol acetate. Cannabis In trials conducted in the 1980s that involved [healthy control](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561403&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) subjects, inhaling Cannabis led to an increase in [caloric intake](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44109&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), mainly in the form of between-meal snacks, with increased intakes of fatty and sweet foods.[ [55](#cit/section_5.55), [56](#cit/section_5.56)] Despite patients' great interest in oral preparations of Cannabis to improve appetite, there is only one trial of Cannabis extract used for appetite stimulation. In an RCT, researchers compared the safety and effectiveness of orally administered Cannabis extract (2.5 mg THC and 1 mg CBD), THC (2.5 mg), or placebo for the treatment of cancer-related anorexia-cachexia in 243 patients with advanced cancer who received treatment twice daily for 6 weeks. Results demonstrated that although these agents were well tolerated by these patients, no differences were observed in patient appetite or quality of life among the three groups at this dose level and duration of [intervention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454757&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [57](#cit/section_5.57)] No published studies have explored the effect of inhaled Cannabis on appetite in cancer patients. Analgesia Cannabinoids Pain management improves a patient's quality of life throughout all stages of cancer. Through the study of cannabinoid [receptors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44958&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), endocannabinoids, and synthetic agonists and antagonists, have been analyzed.[ [58](#cit/section_5.58)][ [Level of evidence:1iC](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335121&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] is found (CNS) and in peripheral [nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) terminals.[ [59](#cit/section_5.59)] CB2 receptors are located mainly in peripheral [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and are expressed in only low amounts in the CNS. Whereas only CB1 agonists exert [analgesic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45590&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) activity in the CNS, both CB1 agonists have analgesic activity in peripheral tissue.[ [60](#cit/section_5.60), [61](#cit/section_5.61)] Cancer pain results from [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), invasion of bone or other pain-sensitive structures, or nerve injury. When cancer pain is severe and persistent, it is often resistant to treatment with [opioids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45054&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Two studies examined the effects of oral delta-9-THC on cancer pain. The first, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving ten patients, measured both pain intensity and pain relief.[ [62](#cit/section_5.62)] It was reported that 15 mg and 20 mg doses of the cannabinoid delta-9-THC were associated with substantial analgesic effects, with antiemetic effects and appetite stimulation. In a [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), single-dose study involving 36 patients, it was reported that 10 mg doses of delta-9-THC produced analgesic effects during a 7-hour [observation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45981&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) period that were comparable to 60 mg doses of codeine, and 20 mg doses of delta-9-THC induced effects equivalent to 120 mg doses of codeine.[ [63](#cit/section_5.63)] Higher doses of THC were found to be more sedating than codeine. Another study examined the effects of a plant extract with controlled cannabinoid content in an oromucosal spray. In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the THC:CBD nabiximols extract and THC extract alone were compared in the analgesic management of patients with advanced cancer and with moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain. Patients were assigned to one of three treatment groups: THC:CBD extract, THC extract, or placebo. The researchers concluded that the THC:CBD extract was efficacious for pain relief in advanced cancer patients whose pain was not fully relieved by strong opioids.[ [64](#cit/section_5.64)] In a randomized, placebo-controlled, graded-dose trial, opioid-treated cancer patients with poorly controlled [chronic pain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44654&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) demonstrated significantly better control of pain and sleep disruption with THC:CBD oromucosal spray at lower doses (1-4 and 6-10 sprays/d), compared with placebo. Adverse events were dose related, with only the high-dose group (11-16 sprays/d) comparing unfavorably with the placebo arm. These studies provide promising evidence of an adjuvant analgesic effect of THC:CBD in this opioid-refractory patient population and may provide an opportunity to address this significant clinical challenge.[ [65](#cit/section_5.65)] An open-label extension study of 43 patients who had participated in the randomized trial found that some patients continued to obtain relief of their cancer-related pain with long-term use of the THC:CBD oromucosal spray without increasing their dose of the spray or the dose of their other analgesics.[ [66](#cit/section_5.66)] An [observational study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=286105&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) assessed the effectiveness of nabilone in advanced cancer patients who were experiencing pain and other [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (anorexia, depression, and anxiety). The researchers reported that patients who used nabilone experienced improved management of pain, nausea, anxiety, and [distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) when compared with untreated patients. Nabilone was also associated with a decreased analgesic effect when cannabinoids are combined with opioids. The results from one pharmacokinetic interaction study have been reported. In this study, 21 patients with chronic pain were administered vaporized Cannabis along with sustained-release [morphine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45400&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [oxycodone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454764&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) received vaporized Cannabis and sustained-release morphine had a statistically significant decrease in their [mean](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285973&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pain score over the 5-day period; those who received vaporized Cannabis and oxycodone did not. These findings should be verified by further studies before recommendations favoring such an approach are warranted in general clinical practice. Neuropathic pain is a symptom cancer patients may experience, especially if treated with [platinum-based](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45841&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) chemotherapy or [taxanes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46138&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Two RCTs of inhaled Cannabis in patients with [peripheral neuropathy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44705&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or neuropathic pain of various etiologies found that pain was reduced in patients who received inhaled Cannabis, compared with those who received placebo.[ [69](#cit/section_5.69), [70](#cit/section_5.70)] A retrospective analysis examined the effect of Cannabis on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in Israeli malignancies.[ [71](#cit/section_5.71)][ [Level of evidence: 2Diii](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335137&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of their exposure to Cannabis: Cannabis-first group (received Cannabis before starting oxaliplatin), oxaliplatin-first group (received oxaliplatin before starting Cannabis), and controls (no Cannabis use). A significant difference in grade 2 to 3 CIPN was seen between the Cannabis-exposed patients (15.3%) and controls (27.9%) (P < .001). The neuropathy-sparing effect was more pronounced among those treated with Cannabis first (75%) compared with those who received oxaliplatin first (46.2%) (P < .001). Some limitations of this study were its retrospective design and documentation of Cannabis use as qualitative, not quantitative. A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, pilot study of nabiximols in 16 patients with chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain showed no significant difference between the treatment and placebo groups. A responder analysis, however, demonstrated that five patients reported a reduction in their pain of at least 2 points on an 11-point scale, suggesting that a larger follow-up study may be warranted.[ [72](#cit/section_5.72)] One real-world randomized controlled trial explored Cannabis use in patients with advanced cancer who received care in a community oncology practice setting (148 screened; 30 randomized; 18 analyzed).[ [73](#cit/section_5.73)] Once certified by their [oncologists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46260&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), participants were randomized to receive early Cannabis (EC) or delayed start of medical Cannabis (DC) for 3 months as part of a state-sponsored Cannabis program. The EC group had stable opioid usage compared with the DC group who had an increase in opioid usage during the 3-month study period. Overall, there were no significant changes in quality of life or symptom scores between the groups, with no overall Cannabis-related adverse events. Limitations included a variety of cancer types and no consistent use of Cannabis products (108 different Cannabis products were dispensed during the study period). Anxiety and Sleep Cannabinoids In a small pilot study of analgesia involving ten patients with cancer pain, secondary measures showed that 15 mg and 20 mg doses of the cannabinoid delta-9-THC were associated with A dronabinol in cancer patients with [altered](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44643&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) chemosensory perception also noted increased quality of sleep and in THC-treated patients.[ [52](#cit/section_5.52)][ [Level of evidence: 1iC](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335121&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Cannabis Patients often experience mood elevation after exposure to Cannabis, depending on their previous experience. In a five-patient [case series](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44006&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of inhaled Cannabis that examined analgesic effects in chronic pain, it was reported that patients who self-administered Cannabis had improved mood, improved sense of well-being, and less anxiety.[ [74](#cit/section_5.74)] Another common effect of Cannabis is sleepiness. A small placebo-controlled study of dronabinol in cancer patients with altered chemosensory perception also noted increased quality of sleep and relaxation in THC-treated patients.[ [52](#cit/section_5.52)] Seventy-four patients with newly [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) head and neck cancer self-described as current Cannabis users were matched to 74 nonusers in a Canadian study investigating quality of life using the EuroQol-5D and Edmonton Symptom Assessment System instruments.[ [75](#cit/section_5.75)] Cannabis users had significantly lower scores in the 0.74; 95% CI, CI, 0.037-1.541) domains. Cannabis users were also less tired, had more appetite, and better general well-being. A single center, [phase II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45831&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), double-blind study of two ratios (1:1 [THC:CBD] and 4:1 [THC:CBD]) of an oral medical Cannabis oil enrolled patients with recurrent or [inoperable](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285970&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [high-grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386205&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [glioma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45700&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Investigators assessed the side effects and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) at baseline and 12 weeks as a [primary outcome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44163&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[ [76](#cit/section_5.76)] There was no difference in the primary endpoint; however, some significant differences were noted in the subscores of the FACT-Br (i.e., physical, functional, and sleep favored the 1:1 ratio) and these endpoints would be appropriate for future research. Symptom Management With Cannabidiol A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (n = 144) assessed the impact of oral cannabidiol oil (50-200 mg three times a day) on the total symptom distress score (TSDS), a measure of overall cancer symptom burden.[ [77](#cit/section_5.77)] All patients received baseline care from [palliative care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269448&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [specialists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478785&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). No significant difference was found in the [median](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44941&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) TSDS between the two arms at the two assessment points (day 14 and day 28). This study had several limitations, including heterogeneity of the patient population, low symptom burden of patients at baseline, and a high level of patient withdrawals from both study arms.

Although cannabinoids are considered by some to be addictive [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), their addictive potential is considerably lower than that of other [prescribed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44711&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) agents or substances of abuse.[ [2](#cit/section_6.2), [4](#cit/section_6.4)] The brain develops a tolerance to flashes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256567&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and, rarely, [nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and cramping have been observed. However, these symptoms appear to be mild compared with withdrawal symptoms associated with opiates or [benzodiazepines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=694849&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the symptoms usually dissipate after a few days. Unlike other commonly used drugs, cannabinoids are stored in adipose tissue and excreted at a low rate (half-life 1-3 days), so even abrupt cessation of cannabinoid intake is not associated with rapid declines in [plasma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45839&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) concentrations that would precipitate severe or abrupt withdrawal symptoms or drug cravings. Cannabidiol is an many are metabolized by these [enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), highly concentrated CBD oils used concurrently could potentially increase the [toxicity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445093&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or decrease the effectiveness of these therapies.[ [5](#cit/section_6.5)- [7](#cit/section_6.7)] Since Cannabis smoke contains many of the same components as [tobacco](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439432&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) smoke, there are valid concerns about the adverse [pulmonary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45852&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effects of [inhaled](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44600&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) Cannabis. A longitudinal study in a noncancer population evaluated repeated measurements of pulmonary function over 20 years in 5,115 men and women whose smoking histories were known.[ [8](#cit/section_6.8)] While tobacco exposure was associated with decreased pulmonary function, the investigators concluded that occasional and low-cumulative Cannabis use was not associated with adverse effects on pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]). Interactions With Conventional Cancer Therapies The potential for cytochrome P450 interactions with highly concentrated oil preparations of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and/or cannabidiol is a concern.[ [9](#cit/section_6.9)] Few pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted with Cannabis or cannabinoids and conventional cancer therapies. A small study investigated the effect of Cannabis tea in 24 patients who received irinotecan or docetaxel.[ [10](#cit/section_6.10)] Administration of the Cannabis tea did not significantly influence exposure to and clearance of either intravenous agent. An Israeli retrospective observational study assessed the impact of Cannabis use during nivolumab immunotherapy.[ [11](#cit/section_6.11)] One hundred forty patients with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma received the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (89 patients received nivolumab alone and 51 patients received nivolumab plus Cannabis). In a multivariate model, Cannabis was the only significant factor that reduced the response rate to immunotherapy (37.5% in patients who received nivolumab alone compared with 15.9% in patients who received nivolumab plus Cannabis [odds ratio, 3.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-8.1; P = .016]). There was no difference in progression-free survival or overall survival. A subsequent prospective observational study from the same investigators followed 102 patients with metastatic cancers initiating immunotherapy.[ [12](#cit/section_6.12)][ [Level of evidence: 2Dii](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335136&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] while 34 patients used Cannabis during immunotherapy. Over half of the patients in each group had stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Cannabis users were less likely to receive immunotherapy as a first-line intervention (24%) compared with nonusers (46%) (P = .03). Cannabis users showed a significantly lower percentage of clinical benefit (39% of Cannabis users with complete or partial responses or stable disease compared with 59% of nonusers [P = .035]). In this [analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390238&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the median time to tumor progression was 3.4 months in Cannabis users compared with 13.1 months in nonusers and the overall survival was 6.4 months in Cannabis users compared with 28.5 months in nonusers. The investigators also noted that Cannabis users reported a lower rate of overall treatment-related adverse experiences compared with nonusers, with fewer immune-related adverse events (P = .057). The investigators postulated that this finding may be related to the possible immunosuppressive effects of Cannabis and concluded that Cannabis consumption should be carefully considered in patients with advanced malignancies who are treated with immunotherapy. Limitations noted by the authors that may be confounders in this analysis include the observational nature of the study, the relatively small sample size, and the high heterogeneity of the participants.

In one group, four small studies assessed [antiemetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46084&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)activity, but each explored a different patient population and chemotherapy [regimen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45864&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). One study demonstrated no effect, the second study showed a positive effect versus placebo, and the report of the third study did not provide enough information to characterize the overall outcome as positive or neutral. Consequently, there are insufficient data to provide an overall level of evidence [assessment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430407&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)for the use of Cannabis for chemotherapy-induced N/V.
