Modern-day naturopathic medicine also emphatically embraces multicultural holistic practices that are integral to so many countries and cultures across the globe. Minimally invasive therapies such as IV, injections and minor surgery are included in the university curriculum. Additionally, ND programs work hand-in-hand with leading research institutions to grow the body of evidence supporting natural therapies. [ [AANMC website](https://aanmc.org/naturopathic-medicine/)] Naturopathic doctors (ND) are primary care doctors. Like all other medical professionals, NDs are required to be licensed with the state in which they practice such as the California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA). Licensed NDs are regulated by DCA's Naturopathic Medicine Committee, and the licensing credentials are posted on the website. Dr. Nancy chose to become a chiropractor in 1983 rather than a naturopathic doctor when she discovered California had no naturopathic medicine board. As a chiropractor she practiced chiropractic, nutritional interventions, and Applied Kinesiology until graduating from naturopathic school in 2021. California naturopaths have enjoyed licensing in the state since 2003, and there are over 1400 naturopaths in California as of 2023. Having significant training in chiropractic nutrition, neurology and Applied Kinesiology, it was apparent that at some point, people need more than chiropractic care and the scope of naturopathic medicine facilitated the expansion of treatment modalities.
