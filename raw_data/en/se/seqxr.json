Episode 71 of the show is out. In this episode, I spoke with Dr. Eric Zielinski. I was familiar with Eric and his work on essential oils, and he seemed like he would be a really good guest as essential oils is a topic I have wanted to cover for a while now. I really enjoyed this conversation. Eric spoke about essential oils, the different ways we can use them, how to improve our health, and also connection to spirit and what it means to live a fulfilled life. Eric has a beautiful way of expressing himself and communicating, and this was a great conversation that I hope you all will get a lot out of.
