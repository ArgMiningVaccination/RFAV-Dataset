We are pleased you have joined our Iowa network, which consists of some of the finest health care providers in the state. Amerigroup has been selected by the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to provide health care services for Amerigroup members enrolled in the IA Health Link or Hawki programs. IA Health Link covers all Medicaid mandatory eligibility groups, as well as various optional categorically needy and medically needy groups, including children, pregnant women, the aged and individuals with disabilities. The Healthy and Well Kids in Iowa (Hawki ) program covers children 0 -19 years of age who meet the income guidelines. Amerigroup represents a growing network of health care provi ders who make it easier for our members to receive quality care. There is strength in numbers: our health services programs, combined with those already available in our target service areas, are designed to supplement providers' treatment plans. Our progr ams serve to help improve our members' overall health by informing, educating and encouraging self -care in the prevention, early detection and treatment of existing conditions and chronic disease. We believe hospitals, physicians and other providers play a pivotal role in managed care. We can only succeed by working collaboratively with you and other caregivers. Earning your loyalty and respect is essential to maintaining a stable, high -quality provider network. Together, we can arrange for and provide an integrated system of coordinated, efficient and quality care for our members and your patients. All network providers are contracted with Amerigroup through a Participating Provider Agreement. Introduction About This Manual This provider manual is design ed for contracted Amerigroup providers, hospitals and ancillary providers. Our goal is to create a useful reference guide for you and your office staff. We want to help you navigate our managed health care plan to deliver quality health care to our membe rs. Our goal is to aid you in finding the most reliable, responsible, timely and cost -effective way to deliver quality health care. Select any topic in the Table of Contents to view that chapter. Click on any web address to be redirected to that site. Each chapter may also contain cross -links to other chapters, to the Amerigroup website or to external websites containing additional informati on. We recognize that managing our members' health can be a complex undertaking, requiring familiarity with the rules and regulations of a complex health care system. This system encompasses a wide array of services and responsibilities; for example, init ial health assessments (IHAs), integrated case management, proper storage of medical records, and billing for emergencies. With this complexity in mind, we divided this manual into sections that reflect your questions, concerns and responsibilities before and after an Amerigroup member walks through your doors. The sections are organized as follows: Legal Requirements Contact Information Before Rendering Services After Rendering Services Operational Standards, Requirements and Guidelines Additional Resource s 11 Legal Requirements The information contained in this manual is proprietary, will be updated regularly and is subject to change. This section provides specific information on the legal obligations of being part of the Amerigroup network. Contacts This section is your reference for important phone and fax numbers, websites , and mailing addresses. Before Rendering Services This section provides the information and tools you will need before providing services, including verifying member eli gibility and a list of covered and noncovered services . The section also includes a chapter on the precertification process and coordination of complex care through our Integrated Case Management department. We take pride in our proactive approach to heal th. The chapter on Health Services programs details how we can partner with you to make the services you provide more effective. For example, the initial health assessment (IHA) is our first step in providing preventive care. The health services programs u nder Condition Care (CNDC ) allow us to collaborate with you to combat the most common and serious conditions and illnesses facing our members, including asthma, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. After Rendering Services At Amerigroup, our goal is to ma ke the billing process as streamlined as possible. This section provides guidelines, detailed coding charts, information on filing claims for professional and institutional services rendered. The Member Transfer and Dis enrollment chapter outlines how a member changes primary care physician (PCP) assignment or transfers to another health plan. When questions or concerns come up about claims or adverse determination, our chapter on Grievances and Appeals will take you step -by-step through the process. Operational Standards, Requirements and Guidelines This section summarizes the requirements for provider office operations and Access Standards, thereby ensuring consistency when members need to consult with providers for IHAs, referrals, coordination of care and follow up care. Additional chapters detail provider credentialing, provider roles and responsibilities and enrollment and marketing guidelines. Chapters on clinical practice and preventive health guidelines and integrated case management outline the steps providers should take to coordinate care an d help members take a proactive stance in the fight against disease. And finally, we included a chapter documenting our commitment to participate in quality assessments that help Amerigroup measure, compare and improve our standards of care. Additional Re sources To help providers serve a diverse and ever -evolving patient population, we designed a special program, Cultural Diversity and Linguistic Services, to improve provider and member communications by providing tools and resources to help reduce languag e and cultural barriers.

Amerigroup Smoking Cessation Program The Amerigroup Smoking Cessation Program is a great place to start. A member can enroll with Amerigroup's smoking cessation program which offers Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) and counseling. If a member is participating with Amerigroup's smoking cessation program administered by National Jewish Health (NJH), no Prior Authorization (PA) is required. To help a member enroll with the Amerigroup Smoking Cessation Program: The member c an self -refer by calling Member Services 800-600-4441. The provider can also refer the member by calling Provider Services at 800-454-3730 . What happens when a member is referred to the Amerigroup Smoking Cessation Program? a) Amerigroup confirms member enrollment and the member's information is passed along to Amerigroup's vendor, National Jewish Health (NJH). NJH contacts the member within one business day of receiving the referral. Three attempts are made to reach the member. If the member is re ached, counseling begins. After completion of the first call, the member is eligible for NRT product. b) If the member wants NRT, NJH conducts a medical screen for contraindications. If contraindication is indicated, NJH sends provider consent form to provid er. The provider completes the form and returns it to NJH as indicated on consent form (via fax to (888) 827 -7057 or mail Real Solutions Tobacco Cessation Program by Amerigroup c/o National Jewish Health 1400 Jackson St., S117A Denver, CO 80206). c) If the pr ovider approved use of NRT or the member does not have any contraindications, NJH ships a 28 day supply of NRT directly to member's home. Under this program the member is allowed up to a two months' supply of patches, lozenges, or gum. 2.

CHAPTER 5: LONG -TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS Long -term Services and Supports Overview Our fundamental approach to long -term services and supports (LTSS) is founded on p erson -centered principles and practices to facilitate member and family driven services and supports that are responsive and meaningful to evolving preferences, support needs and personal goals. We are dedicated to assisting all members in exploring servic e and support options to maximize community integration in alignment with their personal goals and the Olmstead Decision. Through this commitment, not only do we support members to succeed in communities of their choice, we also partner with providers, sta keholders and associations. Iowa has seven HCBS waiver programs.

However, payment will be made for the following exceptions: Catheter (indwelling Foley) Colostomy and ileostomy appliances Colostomy and ileostomy care dressings, liquid adhesive and adhesive tape Diabetic supplies (disposable or retractable needles and syringes, test -tape, clinitest tablets and clinistix) Disposable cathe terization trays or sets (sterile) Disposable bladder irrigation trays or sets (sterile) Disposable saline enemas ( for example, sodium phosphate type) Hearing aid batteries Orthotic and prosthetic services, including augmentative communication devices Orth opedic shoes Repair of member -owned equipment Oxygen services Therapeutic shoes for diabetics Wheelchairs, when the wheelchair is a customized wheelchair (Note: A customized wheelchair is one that is designed, assembled, modified or constructed for the specific member in whole or in part, based on the member's condition, measurements and needs. The member's condition must necessitate the regular use of a wheelchair on a long -term basis to enable independent mobility within the facility - prior authorization is required.) Hospice is a covered benefit in a nursing facility, as the nursing facility can be considered the member's residence. When the person does reside in a nursing facility, if all of the following conditions are met: The resident is terminally ill The resident has elected to receive hospice services under the Medicaid program from a Medicaid - enrolled hospice program. The nursing facility and the Medicaid -enrolled hospice program have entered into a written agreement under which the hospice program takes full re sponsibility for the professional management of the resident's hospice care, and the facility agrees to provide room and board to the resident. It's not a requirement that the care provided is under the immediate direction of either the facility or the resident's personal physician. Intermediate Care Facilities for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities Intermediate care facilities for persons with intellectual disabilities (ICF/ID) provide 24 -hour active treatment and services for persons with intellectu al disabilities and other related conditions. The facility will provide or assist a member with access to the following: Dietetic services Nursing services 49 Laboratory services Pharmacy services Behavior management services Specialized rehabilitation servi ces (including but not limited to physical therapy, speech language pathology and occupational therapy) Laboratory services Radiology and other diagnostic services Durable medical equipment (DME) as ordered by a physician o Note: DME provided in an ICF/ID is the responsibility of the facility and not payable separately.

Long -term Services and Supports Precertification Requirements Precertification, sometimes referred to as prior authorization (PA), is required for skil led nursing facility (SNF) and LTSS services for which Medicaid is the primary payer, medical and nonmedical absences, and reserve days (leaves of absence). Providers must submit precertification requests with all supporting documentation immediately upo n identifying a SNF admission or at least 72 hours prior to the scheduled admission. Failure to comply with notification rules will result in an administrative denial. Administrative Denial An administrative denial is a denial of services based on reason s other than medical necessity. Administrative denials are made when a contractual requirement is not met, such as late notification of admission, lack of precertification or failure by the provider to submit clinical information when request ed. Disputes for administrative denials must address the reason for the denial ( in other words, why precertification was not obtained or why clinical information was not submitted). If Amerigroup overturns its administrative decision, the case will be reviewed for medical necessity. If approved, either the claim will be reprocessed or the requestor will be notified of the action that needs to be taken. So we can ensure appropriate discharge planning, you must provide notice to Amerigroup via our precertificati on process when the following events occur: 50 Admission to an acute care or behavioral health care facility Admission to hospice For members that enter the facility as \"Medicaid Pending\", please request precertification as soon as the state approves the Medicaid eligibility and the member's eligibility is reflected on the Amerigroup website. The Amerigroup website and your Provider Manual list those services that require precertification and notification. Our provider website also houses evidence -based cr iteria we use to complete precertification and concurrent reviews. The precertification request can be submitted by: Faxing the request to 844-556-6121 Calling Care Management at 800-454-3730 Providers can obtain the status of a precertification request by visiting our provider website at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia . Routine precertification requests will be approved or denied within 14 days of the request. Urge nt precertification requests as determined by the treating provider will be approved or denied within 72 hours of the request. If a provider asks for prior approval of a service and a decision is made that the service is not medically needed, the provide r will be able to discuss this decision with Amerigroup. If the decision remains the same, the member, member's approved representative or the provider (on the member's behalf and with their written consent) can appeal the decision. See the section on Appeals . Dates of Service -April 1, 2017 , and forward After the first year, if services were approved before the member's coverage started with Amerigroup, those services will remain approved for the first 30 days the member is enrolled in Amerigroup, whether an in-network or out -of-network provider asked for the approval. After the first 30 days the member is enrolled in Amerigroup: If the member wishes to keep receiving servi ces from an out -of-network provider, or if the services require prior approval, the provider must ask Amerigroup to approve them before the member can receive these services. Long -term Services and Supports Person -Centered Case Management Model Our approach utilizes regional case management teams with multifunctional expertise to assist community -based case managers, members, families, representatives and members' interdisciplinary teams in the development of person -centered service plans . This model serve s as an ongoing resource to meet the varying needs of members to support health, well -being, independence and community living in the most integrated setting such as employment and participation in community activities. Our case management model invo lves a continuous process of communicating, coordinating, delivering, monitoring and assessing services and supports and progress toward achieving member goals to optimize person -centered service delivery. The core components of the case management model will include: Matching our members to the right community -based case manager by carefully considering member diagnoses, complexity of medical and/or behavioral health conditions and intensity of service and support needs, and identifying a community -based case manager on our team with appropriate experience, knowledge and skills. 51 Person -centered planning through partnership and collaboration with members, their natural supports and member -identified interdisciplinary teams who will consider members holisti cally using discovery and assessment results to make sure that medical, behavioral, social and educational needs are addressed to maximize health, well -being and independence in the development of a comprehensive, person -centered service plan. Coordination and collaboration across member systems of care to align resources based on need, integrate services, reduce duplication of efforts, improve continuity of care and services and increase cost efficiencies. The continuous process of delivering, monitoring a nd assessing interventions designed to meet the members' goals defined in person -centered service plans, as well as other care/treatment plans as part of their system of care to maximize individual health, well -being and quality of life. Technology and inn ovations to improve member and natural support experiences expand the tools to enable collaboration among multiple stakeholders, enhance our members' ability to self -direct services and supports, provide real -time member information and improve provider an d system performance. Ongoing stakeholder engagement at the member and system levels to build consensus, innovative solutions related to issues and concerns, and facilitate continuous program improvements to better serve members. Supporting Member Education and Informed Choices A core responsibility within our model is embracing person -centered service planning. We communicate an array of options available to our members, supporting and promoting their informed decision -making and their well -being. Our approach promotes member engagement in all aspects of care and services, including interdisciplinary team development, use of supports, and choice of specific providers. From our experience, we know fully informed members make effective decisions that promote health and safety and are suited to their preferences. This is a cornerstone to improving member experience, adherence to the service plans and overall outcomes. Long -Term Services and Supports Initial Discovery, Assessments and Informed Consent Once a member has enrolled in our LTSS program, our Community -Based Case Management team contacts the member and begins the educational process regarding our role, program services, benefits, resources and options available to promote integrated coordinati on. During this conversation, the member receives an overview of the core service planning and case management processes including all applicable assessments. This comprehensive orientation allows us to align with the member on his or her preferences and c onfirm the member's interest in LTSS. During face -to-face assessments, we engage members, their interdisciplinary team, member -selected participants, and natural supports, including family, in a highly individualized conversation to identify needs and pr eferences for building out their service plan. While outlining the benefits included in the LTSS program, we remind members of their right to choose their interdisciplinary team members, case managers and services including the option to self -direct their services through the CCO. If members choose the CCO, we provide training and administrative support to bolster member confidence in self -directing while preventing gaps in services. Amerigroup helps ensure all processes, such as selecting providers and developing a service plan, reflect and honor the member's strengths, goals and preferences. Long -term Services and Supports Person -centered Service Planning Our community -based case managers work collaboratively with members to develop a service plan that emphasizes and supports member choice and individual goals. During service plan development, we continuously engage members and their family or representatives about needs and preferences. Our 52 community -based case managers work with members, their family o r representatives and their providers to identify all available services and supports, including but not limited to the following: Covered benefits Community and state agency resources Value -added services Health insurance coverage options (such as Medicare and natural supports) Our case managers reside in the same communities as our members and therefore have detailed knowledge about the community, local provider network, other community resources available, and Medicare, Medicaid, and LTSS benefit s. We train our case managers in cultural competency to help assure that members have every opportunity to comfortably express preferences and communicate with their case manager. Long -term Services and Supports Incorporating Member Choice in Funding Dec isions As members request adjustments to their service plans based on changing circumstances or new information, our community -based case managers honor their preferences, unless a requested service is unavailable. If a service could potentially pose a hea lth or safety issue or is not a covered benefit, the community -based case manager will work to educate the member and revise the service plan to address all concerns and preferences. Our community -based case managers ensure all approved services are cons istent with the member's level of care and waiver designation as applicable. Throughout this process, we will put our members' needs and preferences first and will not hesitate to deploy creative strategies to help support our members. Long -term Services and Supports Identification Amerigroup has developed operational protocols, policies and procedures to promote early identification of member service and support gaps that may signal emerging needs that are better addressed through LTSS programs to enhance member health, well -being and independence. All community -based case managers are t rained to recognize indicators that suggest a member may benefit from and meet LTSS program enrollment criteria. Amerigroup will train all community -based case managers on LTSS eligibility criteria established by Iowa Medicaid Enterprise (IME) so timely ac tion is taken in coordination with HHS . Our community -based case managers engage and inform members regarding all available LTSS options. After conducting initial assessments for interested members using a state -approved tool, Amerigroup will refer all p otentially eligible members to the state or its designee for level of care determination. Through this process, we are better able to align services and supports with member strengths, needs and preferences to accommodate the periods of transition that all people and families experience. Long -term Services and Supports Processing Referrals to LTSS Services Our \"no wrong door\" approach provides a single point of entry for LTSS program referrals from end to end. All member -facing staff accepts self -referra ls from members or referrals from their families, support networks, service providers or health professionals. Training includes respect for the member's own advocacy and self -direction, active listening skills, how to gather situational facts, accurate do cumentation of essential information for follow -up, and proper routing of requests to the LTSS case specialist or the assigned case manager or care coordinator. In each instance, staff will work in consultation with the case management team manager to link the member with a community -based case manager. The member's case 53 manager or care coordinator will work in tandem with the newly assigned community -based case manager to facilitate continuity and integration of all service and support needs in the process described below. In the event that a member has not been linked to a specific case manager or care coordinator, the newly assigned case manager will consult and engage team members with relevant expertise throughout the process detailed below: Regardless of the referral source, the assigne d case manager will contact the member and, as appropriate, their family or representative to learn more about the member's needs and concerns. The case manager will discuss the request and the required steps prior to LTSS program referral to the state or its designee. If the member has an established relationship with another case manager or care coordinator, he or she will facilitate the introductory call. The case manager will describe LTSS options and discuss interest in receiving LTSS. During the initi al call, the case manager will also perform a brief telephonic screening to determine the level of urgency to prioritize both access to services and the face -to-face assessment. If it is determined that the member has an urgent need compromising health and safety as a result of a recent change in daily living circumstances or health -related conditions, the case manager will authorize medically necessary interim services and schedule and complete a face -to-face screening assessment no later than seven days f rom the date of referral. If the results of the telephonic screening indicate the need for LTSS is not urgent, the case manager will work with the member and as appropriate the family or representative to schedule and complete the face -to-face assessment no later than 30 days from the date of referral. Referrals received after -hours will be routed through our 24/7 member call center. The call center representative will have access to our core operating system and will enter a detailed message that tasks th e member's community -based case manager for follow up with the member the next business day. When indicated, the call center representative will also be able to connect the member to an on -call community -based case manager after hours. If members need imme diate assistance, their call will be referred to Amerigroup on Call (our 24/7 on -call nurse service) or 911 (if necessary). For members in crisis, a referral will be made immediately to emergency services. In the event of a medical emergency, our members a re encouraged to call 911; our call center representatives will assist as requested to facilitate the call. Ongoing Identification of Members Who May Be Eligible for LTSS In addition to processing all inbound referrals, our person -centered approach uses a n array of ongoing discovery and assessment strategies to facilitate proactive identification of members who currently need additional resources available through LTSS programs . Additionally, we are able to identify risks factors that signal signs of insta bility in life circumstances such as physical and/or behavioral health conditions that may result in a change that leads to LTSS eligibility. Our comprehensive approach emphasizes an integrated model that utilizes our collective expertise of our health pla n employees and the interdisciplinary team to develop a holistic view of each member's evolving life experiences and service and support needs across physical, behavioral health and social service delivery systems. Through internal and external collaborat ion and coordination we are able to maximize available state, regional and community resources to eliminate service and support gaps promoting member health, wellbeing and independence. For example, our physical health, behavioral health and LTSS leadershi p and teams are co -located to facilitate an internal referral process to address unmet needs. As behavioral health case managers become aware of changing needs with a member, they can consult and refer the member to their LTSS colleagues to provide all nee ded supports. Additionally, the teams conduct a variety of internal collaborative case rounds to build immediate and long -range solutions for our members with the most complex needs, including integrated rounds for members with co -occurring conditions, com plex case rounds 54 for LTSS members with medically fragile conditions and nursing facility reintegration rounds for members we are assisting in repatriating to the community. Our case managers navigate delivery systems and coordinate with our state and regio nal partners, contracted providers and community resources to link members to needed services and supports that are brainstormed through our collaborative processes. Long -term Services and Supports Transition and Discharge Planning When LTSS is necessar y, Amerigroup works with the provider and member (or their designated representative) to plan the transition or discharge to an appropriate setting for extended services. These services can be delivered in a nonhospital facility such as: Nursing facilities and skilled nursing facilities (NF/SNF). Respite care - in home or out of home. Home and Community Based Services (HCBS). Home health care program ( in other words, home I.V. antibiotics). When the member and family, together with the provider, identify medically necessary and appropriate services, Amerigroup will assist in providing a timely and effective plan that meets our member's needs and goals. Discharge Planning Amerigroup assists with discharge planning, either to the community or through a transfer to another facility, if the member or responsible party so requests. If the member or responsible party requests a discharge to the community, the care or service coo rdinator will: Collaborate with the skilled nursing facility (SNF) social worker to convene a planning conference with the SNF staff to identify all potential needs in the community. Facilitate a home visit to the residence where the member intends to mo ve to assess environment, durable medical equipment (DME) and other needs upon discharge. Convene a discharge planning meeting with the member and family, using the data complied through discussion with the SNF staff as well as a home visit, to identify me mber preferences and goals. Involve and collaborate with community originations such as Mental Health and Disability Service Regions, Centers for Independent Living (CILs) or Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) in this process to assist members as they transiti on to the community. Finalize and initiate execution of the transition plan. Although our person -centered approach is driven by the member, the transition implementation is a joint effort between the SNF social worker and the Amerigroup community -based case manager. Long -term Services and Supports Responsibilities of the LTSS Provider All home - and community -based services will be provided in integrated settings. All facility -based providers and home health agencies must notify an Amerigroup case manage r within 24 hours when a member dies, leaves the facility or moves to a new residence or moves outside the service area or state. Participat ion in the member's interdisciplinary care team (ICT), dependent on the member's need and preference. Follow all federal rules and regulations as applicable. Provide regular updates related to the care of service delivered Participate in discharge planning 55 Long -term Services and Supports Self-Direction (Consumer Choices Option and Consumer -Directed Att endant Care) Consumer Choices Option (CCO) and Consumer -Directed Attendant Care (CDAC) are Home - and Community -Based (HCBS) options that allow individuals enrolled in most HCBS waivers more flexibility, choice and control over how their services and suppor ts are provided. The programs give the member control over their Medicaid waiver dollars so they can develop a plan to meet their needs by directly hiring their own employees and/or purchasing other goods and services. An independent support broker ( ISB) will help the CCO member develop a budget based on the monthly funds approved by their case manager. CDAC members receive support from individual or agency -based CDAC providers. Member participation in consumer self -direction of HCBS is voluntary. Members may elect to participate in or withdraw from consumer direction of HCBS at any time without affecting their enrollment. To participate in the CCO program, members must live in th e state of Iowa, be eligible for the HCBS waiver and complete the Consumer -Directed Self -Assessment form with their support broker and Amerigroup community -based case manager. Member responsibilities in CCO include: Choosing which services they want to be self-directed. Choosing whether to use an independent CCO provider or one affiliated with an agency. Developing a plan of care with the interdisciplinary team. Using the budget authorized in the service plan, establish service hours and employee payment r ate. Amerigroup will partner with Veridian Fiscal Solutions as the financial management service provider for the CCO program. Veridian will work with members to assist with providing information on their budget and coordination of payment to workers on t he member's behalf. To participate in the CDAC program, members must live in the state of Iowa, be eligible for the HCBS waiver and complete the CDAC agreement with their Amerigroup community -based case manager. Member responsibilities in CDAC include: Choosing whether to use an independent CDAC provider or one affiliated with an agency. Developing a plan of care with the interdisciplinary team. Completing the CDAC agreement, establishing service hours and payment rates, including signing it along with the provider and giving a copy to the community -based case manager. CDAC can be for skilled and unskilled services. Unskilled services include help with normal daily life activities such as the following: Getting dressed and undressed Cleaning up after me als Getting into and out of bed Scheduling appointments Communicating with others Going to the doctor Fixing meals Handling money Taking a bath Shopping Like the CCO program, the member may be in charge of hiring their own employees. The employee: Must be at least 18 years old. Can be a family member, friend or neighbor. 56 Cannot be the member's wife or husband. Cannot be the member's parent, stepparent or guardian if the member is under 18 years old.

To https://dhs.iowa. gov/ime/members/medicaid -a-to-z/cdac . For more information on Veridian Fiscal Solutions, visit their website at https://www.veridianfiscalsolutions.org/cco . Long -term Services and Supports Electronic Visit Verification Electronic visit verification (EVV) is a telephone and computer -based system that electronically verifies when service visits occur and documents the precise time service begins and ends. The purpose of EVV is to verify individuals are receiving the servic es authorized for their support and for which the state or managed care plan is being billed. MCOs will partner together to identify a single EVV option to be implemented in Iowa. Once identification of the EVV has been completed, MCOs will work together in conjunction with the state on a rollout and training schedule for providers. Long -term Se rvices and Supports Client Participation Amerigroup recognizes the unique challenges faced by HCBS and facility providers. Amerigroup works with providers to address when a member/family that is noncompliant in paying the client participation, including facilitating a transfer if the issue cannot be resolved. You may refer to the Client Participation/Member Liability section for more information on client participati on. The paragraphs below outline our plan for working with the provider and the member/family to resolve such issues. 1. The HCBS provider, facility administrator or office manager contacts the Amerigroup community -based case manager with details regarding the lack of payment of the client participation including: The date the last payment was made. Discussions held with the member/family to date. Correspondence between the member/family to date. History of late and/or missed payments, if applicable. Any knowledge of family dynamics, concerns regarding the responsible party, or other considerations. 2. An Amerigroup community -based case manager and the provider or nursing home social worker, if applicable, discuss the issue with the member, determine the ba rrier to payment and elicit cooperation: The Amerigroup community -based case manager guides the discussion, including review of the obligation, potential impact to ongoing eligibility, and potential threat to continued services or residence at the current facility.

Amerigroup works collaboratively with health care providers ( in other words, Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs), Iowa Department of Public Health (ID PH) Substance Use Disorder providers, waiver service providers and a variety of community agencies and resources) to meet the needs of members with mental health (MH) and substance use disorders (SUDs), including those participating in waiver programs. Behavioral Health Services Goals The goals of the Amerigroup Behavioral Health program are to: Ensure adequacy of service availability and accessibility to eligible members. Assist members and providers to utilize the most appropriate, least restrictive me dical and behavioral health care in the right place at the right time. Promote integration of the management and delivery of physical and behavioral health services to members. Achieve the Amerigroup quality initiatives, including those related to HEDIS NCQA and Iowa Department of Health and Human Services (Iowa HHS) performance requirements. Work with members, providers and community supports to provide tools and an environment that supports members towards their recovery and resiliency goals. Behavioral Health Services Values The following values are incorporated into our policies and practices: Hope and respect for members and families, based on the knowledge that personally -valued recovery is possible A belief in member dignity and self -determination The encouragement to strengthen empowering relationships The elimination of stigma and discrimination Behavioral Health Services Principles Amerigroup adheres to the following principles related to the delivery of behavioral health services: Members are allowed to choose their behavioral health professional(s) to the fullest extent possible and appropriate. We support the involvement of the member, and those significant in the member's life as appropriate, in decisions about services provided to meet the member's health needs. We establish and promote strategies to engage members who may have histories of inconsistent involvement in treatment. For adult member s who have a serious mental illness and child members with a severe emotional disturbance (SED), services focus on helping the member maintain their home environment, education and employment, and on promoting their recovery and resiliency. Mental health s ervices for children are most appropriately directed toward helping a child and the child's family to develop resiliency and maintain a stable and safe family environment for the child. 63 We are committed to exploring the use of emerging technology ( for exam ple, telehealth) as a way to expand access to services and extend the reach of mental health and substance use disorder service professionals, particularly into rural areas of the state. We facilitate the coordination of services to eliminate both gaps in service and duplication of services. We promote quality improvement initiatives as well as monitoring and tracking outcomes such as member satisfaction, health status and clinical improvement and service utilization. Behavioral Health Services Objectives The objectives of the Amerigroup Behavioral Health program are to: Work with care providers to ensure the provision of medically necessary and appropriate care and services to our members at the least restrictive level of care, including inpatie nt care, alternative care settings, and outpatient care, both in -and out -of-network. Provide high quality case management and care coordination services designed to identify member needs and address them in a person -centered, holistic manner. Promote conti nuity and coordination of care among physical and behavioral healthcare practitioners. Maintain compliance with local, state, and federal requirements, as well as accreditation standards. Utilize evidence -based guidelines and clinical criteria and promote the use of same in the provider community. Enhance member satisfaction by working with members -in-need of services to implement an individually -tailored and holistic support and care plan that allows the member to succeed at achieving his/her recovery and resiliency goals. Enhance provider satisfaction and provider success by working to develop collaborative and supportive provider relationships built on mutually agreed upon goals, outcomes and incentives. Promote all health care partners to work together t o achieve quality and recovery goals through education, technological supports and the promotion of recovery ideals. Initiate quality improvement activities: plan, do, study, act (PDSA). Establish systems to monitor and track outcomes annually. Amerigroup -contracted providers deliver behavioral health and IDPH substance use disorder (SUD) services in accordance with best practice guidelines, rules and regulations, and policies and procedures set forth by Iowa HHS and IME. This includes, but may n ot be limited to, mental health services such as psychiatric inpatient hospital services, 24 -hour psychiatric medical institutions for children (PMICs), outpatient mental health services, case management, psychiatric rehabilitation services and behavioral health crisis services. Also included are SUD treatments such as inpatient, residential and outpatient services. Behavioral Health Services Recovery and Resiliency \"[Recovery is] a personal process of overcoming the negative impact of a psychiatric disabi lity despite its continued presence.\" \u2014 Townsend, W., S. Boyd, G. Griffin, and P. L. Hicks. 2000. Emerging best practices in mental health recovery. Columbus: Ohio Department of Mental Health. \"Recovery involves living as well as possible.\" \u2014Slade, M. (2 009) Personal Recovery and Mental Illness; A Guide for Mental Health Professionals. New York: Cambridge University Press. \"A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self -directed life, and strive to reach thei r full potential.\" \u2014 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2011) 64 Amerigroup believes physical and behavioral health services should be rendered in a manner that supports the recovery of persons experiencing mental illness and enhances the development of resiliency of those who are impacted by mental illness, serious emo tional disturbance and/or substance use disorder issues. Recovery is a consumer -driven process in which consumers find their paths to work, learn and participate fully in their communities. Recovery is the ability to live a fulfilling and productive life d espite the continued presence of a disability. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has released a consensus statement on mental health recovery. The components listed in this consensus statement are reflective of our de sire that all behavioral health services be delivered in a manner that promotes individual recovery and builds resiliency. The ten fundamental components of recovery as elucidated by SAMHSA include the following: 1. Self-direction: Consumers lead, control and exercise choice over and determine their own path of recovery by optimizing autonomy, independence and control of resources to achieve a self -determined life. By definition, the recovery process must be self -directed by the individual, who defines his or her own life goals and designs a unique path towards those goals. 2. Individualized and person -centered: There are multiple pathways to recovery based on an individual's unique strengths and resiliency, as well as his or her needs, preferences, experiences (i ncluding past trauma) and cultural background in all of its diverse representations. Individuals also identify recovery as being an ongoing journey and an end result, as well as an overall paradigm for achieving wellness and optimal mental health. 3. Empowerm ent: Consumers have the authority to choose from a range of options and to participate in all decisions \u2014 including the allocation of resources \u2014 that will affect their lives and are educated and supported in so doing. They have the ability to join with ot her consumers to collectively and effectively speak for themselves about their needs, wants, desires and aspirations. Through empowerment, an individual gains control of his or her own destiny and influences the organizational and societal structures in hi s or her life. 4. Holistic: Recovery encompasses an individual's whole life, including mind, body, spirit and community. Recovery embraces all aspects of life, including housing, employment, education, mental health and health care treatment and services, com plementary and naturalistic services ( for example, recreational services, libraries, museums, etc.), addictions treatment, spirituality, creativity, social networks, community participation and family supports as determined by the person. Families, provide rs, organizations, systems, communities and society play crucial roles in creating and maintaining meaningful opportunities for consumer access to these supports. 5. Nonlinear: Recovery is not a step -by-step process but one based on continual growth, occasion al setbacks and learning from experience. Recovery begins with an initial stage of awareness in which a person recognizes that positive change is possible. This awareness enables the consumer to move on to fully engage in the work of recovery. 6. Strengths -based: Recovery focuses on valuing and building on the multiple capacities, resiliencies, talents, coping abilities and inherent worth of individuals. By building on these strengths, consumers leave stymied life roles behind and engage in new life roles ( for example, partner, caregiver, friend, student, and employee). The process of recovery moves forward through interaction with others in supportive, trust -based relationships. 7. Peer support: Mutual support \u2014 including the sharing of experiential knowledge an d skills and social learning \u2014 plays an invaluable role in recovery. Consumers encourage and engage other consumers in recovery and provide each other with a sense of belonging, supportive relationships, valued roles and community. 8. Respect: Community, syst ems and societal acceptance and appreciation of consumers \u2014 including protecting their rights and eliminating discrimination and stigma \u2014 are crucial in achieving recovery. 65 Self-acceptance and regaining belief in one's self are particularly vital. Respect ensures the inclusion and full participation of consumers in all aspects of their lives. 9. Responsibility: Consumers have a personal responsibility for their own self -care and journeys of recovery. Taking steps towards their goals may require great courage. Consumers must strive to understand and give meaning to their experiences and identify coping strategies and healing processes to promote their own wellness. 10. Hope: Recovery provides the essential and motivating message of a better future \u2014 that people can and do overcome the barriers and obstacles that confront them. Hope is internalized but can be fostered by peers, families, friends, providers and others. Hope is the catalyst of the recovery process. Resiliency is a dynamic developmental process especial ly for children and youth (and their families) that encompasses positive adaptation and is manifested by traits of self -efficacy, high self -esteem, maintenance of hope and optimism within the context of significant adversity. Services that are provided to children and youth with serious emotional disturbances and their families are best delivered based on the System of Care Values and Principles that are endorsed by the SAMHSA and the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS). Services should be: Child -cent ered and family focused with the needs of the child and family dictating the types and mix of services provided. Community -based with the focus of services as well as management and decision -making responsibility resting at the community level. Culturally competent with agencies, programs and services that are responsive to the cultural, racial and ethnic differences of the populations they serve. Led by the guiding principles of a system of care, which include: o Children should have access to a comprehensi ve array of services that address the child's physical, emotional, social, educational and cultural needs. o Children should receive individualized services in accordance with their unique needs and potential, which is guided by an individualized service plan. o Children should receive services within the least restrictive, most normative environment that is clinically appropriate. o Children should receive services that are integrated, with linkages between child -serving agencies and programs and mechanisms for planning, developing and coordinating services. o Children should be provided with case management or similar mechanisms to ens ure that multiple services are delivered in a coordinated, therapeutic manner and adapted in accordance with the changing needs of the child and family. o Children should receive services without regard to race, religion, national origin, sex, physical disab ility or other characteristics.

Amerigroup will follow and enforce the PDL under the Medicaid Fee -for-Service (FFS) pharmacy benefit for psychotropic medications, which may include prior authorization criteria, quantity limits and days -supply limitations. The PDL is located at http://www.iowamedicaidpdl.com . Providers must inform all members being considered for prescription of psychotropic medications of the benefits, risks and side effects of the medication, alternate medications and other forms of treatment. The medical record is expected to reflect such co nversations as having occurred. 70 Members on psychotropic medications may be at increased risk for various disorders. As such, it is expected that providers are knowledgeable about side -effects and risks of medications and regularly inquire about and seek f or any side -effects from medications. This especially includes: Follow -up to inquire about suicidality or self -harm in children placed on anti -depressant medications as per FDA and APA guideline s. Regular and frequent weight checks and measurement of abdom inal girth especially for those on antipsychotics or mood stabilizers . Glucose tolerance test or hemoglobin A -1C tests especially for those members on antipsychotics or mood stabilizers . Triglyceride and cholesterol checks especially for those members on antipsychotics and mood stabilizers . ECG checks for members placed on medications with risk for significant QT -prolongation. Ongoing checks for movement disorders related to antipsychotic use and psychotic disorders. Guidelines for such testing and follow -up are provided by the American Psychiatric Association, amongst others. Summary guidelines are referenced in our Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs), which can be found at https://providers.amerigroup.com /ia. While the prescriber is not expected to personally conduct all of these tests, the prescriber is expected to ensure that these tests occur where indicated and to initiate appropriate interventions to address any adv erse results. These tests and the interventions are expected to be documented in, at minimum, the medical record for the member. Behavioral Health Services Utilization Management Process Utilization Management Decision Making Individuals involved in utilization management (UM) decisions are governed by the following statements: UM decision -making is based only on appropriateness of care and service and existence of coverage. Amerigroup does not specifically reward practitioners or other individuals fo r issuing denial of coverage care. Decisions about hiring, promoting or terminating practitioners or other staff are not based on the likelihood or perceived likelihood that they support, or tend to support denial of benefits. Financial incentives for UM d ecision -makers do not encourage decisions that result in underutilization, or create barriers to care and service. Our Behavioral Health Customer Service Staff Provider calls to our Provider Services line during regular business hours are taken by our experienced team of Utilization Management representatives (UMRs). UMRs assist providers with routine inquiries about member eligibility, benefits and claims or wit h referrals to network providers for your patients. If you are calling about precertification for a service that requires precertification and clinical review, these requests are referred to a member of our clinical staff to initiate a review of the reques t. Provider calls after business hours are taken by our Amerigroup on Call sta ff, who will issue you a reference number for precertification requests for urgent/emergent care. Requests for routine/outpatient care are taken during normal business hours. A ll requests for precertification will be reviewed by appropriate Behavioral Health staff within decision and notification timeliness standards (se e the \"Timeliness of Decisions on Requests for Precertification\" grid below). 71 Behavioral Health Services Behavioral Health Authorization Time Standards Amerigroup will make authorization determinations within time frames that facilitate timely access to care per the standards outlined in Chapter 16. For this to occur, it is critical Amerigroup receives all neces sary clinical information in a timely manner.

Please be prepared to provide clinical information in support of the request at the time of the call. Notification or Request Preauthorization The quickest, most efficient way to request precertification is using our preferred method through Availity Essentials via the Interactive Care Reviewer, at www.availity.com . You ma y also request authorization for inpatient mental health services by calling 800-454-3730 24/7, 365 days a year . We do not accept outpatient preauthorization requests via phone. Please refer to the ICR information above for outpatient preauthorization. Please be prepared to provide clinical information in support of the request at the time of the call. You may also request preauthorization via fax. Amerigroup -approved fax forms can be obtained on our provider website at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia . 72 Note: All requests for precertification for psychological and neuropsychological testing beyond the three -hour initial limit should be submitted using our preferred el ectronic method via www.availity.com Behavioral Health Services Clinical Criteria Amerigroup Clinical Criteria In addition to utilizing the \"Iowa Definition of Medical Necessity\" (see below), Amerigroup utilizes clinical criteria to evaluate the medical ne cessity of requests for care and services as follows: o Mental health : Amerigroup Medical Policies and Clinical Utilization Management Guidelines o Substance use disorder : American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Principles of Addiction Medicine Addition al level of care criteria will be used for services not included in Amerigroup or ASAM criteria sets. For more information about additional criteria in use by Amerigroup, please visit https://providers.amer igroup.com/ia . All criteria used by Amerigroup are approved by the Amerigroup Medical Advisory Committee and the Amerigroup Medical Policy and Technology Assessment Committee. For information about how to access the Amer igroup medical necessity criteria, please call the Amerigroup Provider Services line at 800-454-3730 . \"Medical necessity\" is defined by Iowa as those covered services that are determined through Utilization Management to be: Appropriate and necessary for the symptoms, diagnosis or treatment of the condition of the member. Provided for the diagnosis or direct care and treatment of the condition of member enabling the member to make reasonable progress in treatment. Within stand ards of professional practice and given at the appropriate time and in the appropriate setting. Not primarily for the convenience of the member, the member's physician or other provider. The most appropriate level of covered services, which can safely be provided. Behavioral Health Services Behavioral Health Medical Necessity Determination and Peer Review When a provider requests initial or continued precertification for a covered behavioral health service, Amerigroup utilization managers obtain necessary clinical information and review it to determine if the request appears to meet applicable medical necessity criteria. If the information submitted does not appear to meet such criteria, the utilization manager submits the information for revie w by an Amerigroup behavioral health medical director, or other appropriate practitioner, as part of the peer review process. The Amerigroup reviewer, or the requesting provider, may initiate a peer -to-peer conversation to discuss the relevant clinical in formation with the clinician working with the member. If an adverse decision is made by the Amerigroup reviewer without a peer -to-peer conversation taking place (as may occur when the provider is unavailable for review), the provider may request such a con versation within two business days of the issuance of the adverse decision. In this case, we will make a behavioral health medical director or other appropriate practitioner available to discuss the case with the requesting provider. This conversation may result in the decision being upheld or changed. 73 Members, requesting providers and applicable facilities are notified of any adverse decision by Amerigroup within notification time frames that are based on the type of care requested, and in conformance wit h regulatory and accreditation requirements. Behavioral Health Services Nonmedical Necessity Adverse Decisions Nonmedical Necessity Adverse Decisions (Administrative Adverse Decision) A request for precertification may result in an adverse decision for r easons other than a lack of medical necessity. Reasons for such an adverse decision may include: The notification of admission was late; providers must notify Amerigroup of admission (including preliminary clinical information) within 24 hours or the next business day of any inpatient admission of an Amerigroup member. The provider failed to request precertification of a service that requires it. The member was ineligible on the date of service. The requested service/benefit was a noncovered service/benefi t. The limit on the benefit has been reached. Behavioral Health Services Appeals, Grievance and Payment Disputes If precertification was not received or you disagree with the decision, refer to the Appeals, Grievance and Payment Disputes chapter. Behavioral Health Services Avoiding an Advers e Decision Most administrative adverse decisions result from nonadherence to or a misunderstanding of utilization management policies. Familiarizing yourself and your staff with notification and precertification policies and acting to meet those policies c an eliminate the majority of these decisions. Other administrative adverse decisions result from misinformation about the member's status or the member's benefits. Such information is readily available from Amerigroup by calling Provider Services at 800-454-3730 . Adverse decisions of a medical nature are rare. Such adverse decisions usually involve a failure of the clinical information to meet evidenced -based, national guidelines. Amerigroup is committed to working with all providers to ensure that such gu idelines are understood and to identify gaps for providers around meeting such guidelines. Peer -to-peer conversations (between an Amerigroup medical director and the provider clinicians) are one way that Amerigroup is able to ensure the completeness and ac curacy of the clinical information and provide a one -on-one communication about the guidelines as necessary. Medical record reviews are another way to ensure that clinical information is complete and accurate. Providers who are able to appropriately respon d in a timely fashion to peer -to-peer and medical record requests are less likely to encounter dissatisfaction with the utilization management process. Amerigroup is committed to ensuring a process that is quick and easy; working with participating provide rs to ensure a mutually satisfying process whenever possible. Reducing Risk to Members With B ehavioral Health or SUD Health Care Needs Through the Amerigroup Case Management/Care Coordination Process When a member is identified as having mental health and/or SUD needs requiring some type of intervention to reduce risk, Amerigroup utilizes the following strategies : o Inpatient management : moderate to high -risk hospitalized members When at-risk members are identified as part of the census management process, the UM staff works with provider discharge planners, our transitional care coaches, the member's Health 74 Home team and/or Amerigroup case managers to develop a discharge plan that maximizes the likelihood of the member making a successful transition back into the community. Key elements of the discharge plan include, but are not limited to: Understanding the charact eristics of each particular member (job, family, education, social activities, family background, prior service utilization, etc.) In the case of rapid readmissions - an admission that occurs within 30 days of discharge from the same level of care: o What h as worked in the past in helping this member to stay out of the hospital ( for example, medications, treatment interventions, services, and supports)? o What elements of the previous discharge plan did not work and need to be changed? How do medical issues or complications impact the member? What is the involvement of the family in the treatment process and how do the family and other social supports factor into the discharge plan? Are follow -up appointments scheduled within seven days of discharge? The behavioral health medical director conducts daily UM rounds and participates in complex case rounds to assist in facilitating the member's successful transition back into the community o Transitional care: moderate to high -risk hospitalized members A tra nsitional care coach or Health Home care coordinator collaborates with the UM staff to work with members, their family caregivers, their Health Home team and, when appropriate, the hospital's discharge planning staff to develop a discharge plan. The plan m ay include: Pretransition contacts Assisting the member with planning for follow -up care and ensuring that appointments are scheduled, transportation arranged, etc. Post -discharge contacts Medication reconciliation \"Red -flag\" education for the member and f amily/caregiver, as appropriate, about potential problems or relapse triggers Disease -specific interventions Transitional care is a short -term intervention strategy with the goals of reducing the member's risk of readmission and increasing the likelihood t hat he or she will make a successful transition back into the community. o Complex case management Once a member is identified as having complex case management needs through identification methods outlined above, the case manager attempts to engage the mem ber to conduct an assessment to determine the member's care management needs. The case manager works with the member, as well as the member's family/caregiver, as appropriate, to identify goals that are expressed in member -friendly language. The care pla n includes interventions that are agreed upon to achieve the member's goals. The case manager also obtains input from the member's PCP and other specialty providers in developing the care plan. For members with mental health and/or SUD needs, the case man ager ensures that all needed behavioral health and medical care needs are integrated in a holistic manner, by facilitating communication among treating providers and scheduling regular case conferences as required. The case manager may also utilize complex case rounds to obtain input on especially difficult integration issues. The case manager then monitors the member's progress, at regular intervals depending on the member's acuity, in meeting care plan goals. The case manager coordinates care and services with all treating providers, and assists the member with community resource referrals. Contacts 75 with the member may be done telephonically, or through face -to-face contact, depending on the member's level of acuity. Case Management continues until the ca re plan goals have been substantially met or there is agreement with the member/family/caregiver, as appropriate, that further care management is not indicated. o Amerigroup Condition Care (CNDC ) The needs of members with lower acuity, mental health or subs tance use disorder needs may be met by CNDC through some combination of: Lower acuity telephonic care management Condition Care programs (schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder or substance use disorder) Referrals to preventive services Providing them with health promotion material s Behavioral Health Services Behavioral Health Drug Utilization Review Program Our Psychotropic Drug Utilization Review Program processes medical and pharmacy claims data to identify and outreach to prescribers who are not following recommended evidencebased psychotropic treatment guidelines. Our goal is not to infringe on the presc riber's decisionmaking practice, but to provide education and training on best practices for prescribing psychotropic medications to support prescriber selfregulation. We design educational information to help the prescriber make care decisions based o n the latest medical evidence. We monitor claims data to determine whether the provider makes changes after intervention. DUR programs have been shown to be effective at improving healthcare quality while reducing medical and/or pharmacy costs. Behavioral Health Services Post -Discharge Outreach, Diversion Plans and Crisis Assessments Post -Discharge Outreach Amerigroup inpatient providers are required to conduct outreach to all members being discharged from inpatient care to encourage the member's attendanc e at follow -up appointments to be scheduled with a behavioral health specialty provider within seven calendar days of discharge. Amerigroup will require providers to maintain records of the results of such outreach efforts and will require reporting of t his information to Amerigroup on a regular basis. Amerigroup will also conduct on -site audits of member records on at least a quarterly basis. Providers are also encouraged to use these outreach opportunities to ensure discharged members/caregivers have b een able to fill necessary prescriptions and have access to transportation for follow -up appointments. If members/caregivers need assistance with filling prescriptions, with transportation to their appointments, or with appointment scheduling, they should be encouraged to contact Amerigroup Member Services at 800-600-4441 (TTY 711) for assistance. Diversion Plans When clinically indicated, Amerigroup encourages providers conducting crisis assessments for members at risk for admission to higher levels of ca re (for example, acute inpatient, PMIC) to carefully consider the opportunity for developing diversion plans, with appropriate member and family/caregiver involvement, to assist the member in safely achieving stabilization at a lower level of care. 76 The p rovider should contact the member/family/caregiver, as appropriate, as soon as possible following the diversion to offer needed outpatient services. Crisis Assessments Providers delivering crisis assessments/screenings to members must initiate a follow -up contact within one business day to any member seen for or provided with any emergency service and not detained for inpatient care and treatment, to determine the need f or any further services or referral to any services. Behavioral Health Services Clinical Practice Guidelines All providers have ready access to evidence -based Clinical Practice Guidelines for a variety of behavioral health disorders commonly seen in primary care, including ADHD, bipolar disorder for adults and adolescents, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and SUDs as well as evidence -based information on the use of psychotropic med ications. Please see the provider website at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia . Coordination of Behavioral Health and Physical Health Treatment Amerigroup emphasizes t he coordination and integration of physical and behavioral health services, wherever possible. Key elements of the Amerigroup model of coordinated care include: o Ongoing communication and coordination between PCPs and specialty providers, including behavior al health (mental health and substance use) providers o The expectation that providers screen for co -occurring disorders, including: Behavioral health screening by PCPs Medical screening by behavioral health providers Screening of mental health patients for co-occurring SUDs Screening of consumers in substance use disorder treatment for co -occurring mental health and/or medical disorders o Screening tools for PCPs and behavioral health providers can be located at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia o Referrals to PCPs or specialty providers, including behavioral health providers, for assessment and/or treatment for consumers with co -occurring disorders o Involving members, as well as caregivers and family members, as appropriate, in the development of patient -centered treatment plans. Case management and condition care programs to support the coordination and integration of care between providers As an Amerigroup network provider, you're required to notify a member's PCP when a member first enters behavioral health care and anytime there is a significant change in care, treatment or need for medical services, provided that you have secured the nece ssary release of information. The minimum elements to be included in such correspondence are: o Patient demographics o Date of initial or most recent behavioral health evaluation o Recommendation to see a PCP, if medical condition identified or need for evaluation by a medical practitioner has been determined for the member ( for example, EPSDT screen, complaint of physical ailments) o Diagnosis and/or presenting behavioral health problem(s) o Prescribed medication(s) o Vital signs o Allergy/drug sensitivity o Pregn ancy status o Behavioral health clinician's name and contact information 77 Behavioral Health Services Provider Training Amerigroup must monitor and ensure all participating providers that deliver behavioral health services provide relevant staff with training in accordance with Iowa HHS requirements. As a contracted provider of Amerigroup, your organization is required to provide training to your staff as appropriate. Your organization is also responsible for complying with any updates in training requirements. Additionally, Amerigroup will implement measures to monitor compliance with training requirements. Additional Training Amerigroup will present training programs for PCPs and behavioral health providers on topics related to the coordination of behavioral health and physical health care. Some of these training events will include the opportunity for pr oviders to obtain CME/CEU credit for participation. Please consult the Amerigroup provider website at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia for a schedule of these training events. Behavioral Health Consultations for Primary Care Providers Amerigroup will provide all contracted PCPs with the ability to consult with a behavioral health specialist. For more information about this and other behavioral health consultation reso urces, please call the Amerigroup Provider Services line at 800-454-3730 . Behavioral Health Services Critical Incident Reporting and Management We have a critical incident reporting and management system for incidents that occur in a home - and community -based long -term care services and supports delivery setting. As a participating Amerigroup provider, you will be required to participate in critical incident reporting. Immediate action will be taken to assure the member is protected from further harm. Crit ical incidents will be tracked and presented to our Quality Improvement committee for review. A critical incident, also known as a major incident, means an occurrence that: 1. Results in a physical injury to or by the member that requires a physician's treatment or admission to a hospital. 2. Results in the death of any person. 3. Requires emergency mental health treatment for the member. 4. Requires the intervention of law enforcement. 5. Requires a report of child abuse pursuant to Iowa Code section 23 2.69 or a report of dependent adult abuse pursuant to Iowa Code section 235B.3. 6. Constitutes a prescription medication error or a pattern of medication errors that leads to the outcome in 1, 2 or 3. 7. Involves a member's location being unknown by provider staff who are assigned protective oversight. Providers must report critical incidents to Amerigroup in accordance with applicable requirements and as outlined in Article 3.7 of the Amerigroup Provider Agreement. The maximum time frame for reporti ng an incident to Amerigroup is 24 hours. The initial report of an incident within 24 hours may be submitted verbally, in which case the person, agency or entity making the initial report will submit a follow -up written report within 48 hours. A report mus t also be filed with HHS through their Incident Management Provider Access system. Instructions can be found at: http://dhs.iowa.gov/sites/default/fi les/PCIR_CriticalIncidentReportUserGuideForm470_4698.pdf .

Suspected brutality, abuse or neglect of members who are children must also be immediately reported. The HHS form cannot be used to report suspected child abuse and depe ndent adult abuse. Report of suspected child abuse and dependent abuse must be made by calling the HHS Abuse Hotline at 800-362-2178. Providers must immediately ( in other words, within 24 hours) take steps to prevent further harm to any and all members and respond to any emergency needs of members. Providers with a critical incident must conduct an internal critical incident investigation and submit a report on the investigation by the end of the next business day. Amerigroup will review the pr ovider's report and follow -up with the provider as necessary to ensure that an appropriate investigation was conducted and corrective actions were implemented within applicable time frames. Providers must cooperate with any investigation conducted by Amer igroup or outside agencies ( for example, the HHS, Adult Protective Services, Child Protective Services and law enforcement). Behavioral Health Services Psychiatric Medical Institutions for Children (PMIC) PMICs provide 24 -hour care for individuals under the age of 21 years old. To qualify, an independent team evaluates and determines that ambulatory care resources available in the community do not meet the individual's treatment needs. Proper treatment of the individual's psychiatric con dition requires: Inpatient services under the direction of a physician. Services reasonably expected to improve his or her condition or prevent further regression, so the services will no longer be needed. PMICs will provide or assist a member with access to: Active treatment; active treatment is the implementation of a professionally developed and supervised individual plan of care. The plan of care is designed to achieve the member's discharge from inpatient status at the earliest possible time and must be developed and implemented by an interdisciplinary team no later than 14 days after admission. An individual plan of care; an individual plan of care is a written plan developed for each member to improve his or her condition to the extent inpatient care is no longer necessary. The team will review the plan every 30 days to determine whether services being provided are or were required on an inpatient basis, and recommend changes in the plan based on the member's overall adjustment as an inpatient. The pl an of care shall: o Be based on a diagnostic evaluation that includes examination of the medical, psychological, social, behavioral and developmental aspects of the member's situation and reflects the need for inpatient psychiatric care. o Be developed by an i nterdisciplinary team (as specified below) in consultation, if possible, with the member and member's parents, legal guardians or others who the member will be released to for care after discharge. o State the treatment objectives. o Prescribe an integrated pr ogram of therapies, activities and experiences designed to meet the objectives. 79 o Include, at an appropriate time, post -discharge plans and coordination of inpatient services, with partial discharge plans and related community services, to ensure continuity of care with the member's family, school and community upon discharge. An interdisciplinary team; the individual plan of care shall be developed by an interdisciplinary team of physicians and other personnel who are employed by the facility or who provide services to patients in the facility. Membership includes those physicians and other professionals who are involved in the direct provision of treatment services, involved in the organization of the plan of care or involved in consulting with or supervisin g those professionals involved in the direct provision of care. The team shall: o Be based on education and experience, preferably including competence in child psychiatry. o Be capable of assessing the member's immediate and long -range therapeutic needs, deve lopmental priorities and personal strengths and liabilities; this includes assessing the potential resources of the member's family, setting treatment objectives and prescribing therapeutic modalities to achieve the plan's objectives. o Include, as a minimum , either: A board -eligible or board -certified psychiatrist, a clinical psychologist who has a doctoral degree and a physician licensed to practice in medicine or osteopathy, or A physician licensed to practice medicine or osteopathy with specialized training and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental diseases and a psychologist who has a master's degree in clinical psychology and has been licensed by the state. o Also include one of the following: A social worker with a master's degree in social work with specialized training or one year's experience in treating persons with mental illness.

This may mean taking extra steps to verify t hat any patient treated by network providers is, in fact, a currently enrolled Amerigroup member. Amerigroup members enrolled in IA Health Link or Hawki are required to carry and present their IA Health Link or Hawki identification (ID) card when seeking services. The IA Health Link and Hawki ID cards are issued by Amerigroup. To prevent fraud and abuse, providers should confirm the identity of the person presenting the ID card. Providers also must verify a member's eligibility before services are deliver ed. Because eligibility can change, verify eligibility at each visit. Remember, claims submitted for services rendered to noneligible members are not eligible for payment. Member Eligibility How to Verify Member Eligibility Providers can verify member eli gibility as follows: Real -time member enrollment and eligibility verification for IA Health Link is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by calling the hotline or using the website to determine the member's specific benefit plan and coverage: o Automated voice response: 800-338-7752 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) o Website: https://dhs.iowa.gov/ime/providers Contact Provider Services to verify enrollment and benefits for our members: o Phone: 800-454-3730 , Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. -6 p.m. Central time o The secure Amerigroup provider website: https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia .

The back important phone numbers and the general correspondence and appeal mailing address. 82 The following are two examples: IA He alth Link Hawki 83 CHAPTER 8: MEDICAL MANAGEMENT Medical Management Overview The Amerigroup Medical Management program is a cooperative effort with providers to promote, provide and document the appropriate use of health care resources. Our goal is to provide the right care, to the right member, at the right time, in the appropriate setting. The decision -making criteria used by the Medical Management department are evidence -based and consensus -driven. We update criteria periodically as standards of practice and technology change. We involve practicing physicians in these updates and then notify providers of changes through fax communications (such as provider bulletins) and other mailings . Based o n sound clinical evidence, the Medical Management department provides the following service reviews: Precertification Concurrent/continued stay reviews Post -service reviews Decisions affecting coverage or payment for services are made in a fair, consistent and timely manner. The decision -making process incorporates nationally -recognized standards of care and practice from sources including the following: Iowa Medicaid coverag e criteria MCG Care Guidelines Anthem approved criteria Professional societies such as: o American College of Cardiology o American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists o American Academy of Pediatrics o American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons o Cumulative pro fessional expertise and experience After a case has been reviewed, decisions and notification time frames will be given for service: Approval Modification Denial Please note: UM decision -making is based only on appropriateness of care and service and existence of coverage. Amerigroup does not specifically reward practitioners or other individuals for issuing denial of coverage care. Decisions about hiring, promoting or terminating practitioners or other staff are not based on the likelihood or perceived likelihood that they support, or tend to support, denial of benefits. There are no financial incentives for UM decision -makers that encourage decisions resulting in under -utilizatio n, or that create barriers to care and service. Treating physicians may wish to speak with the Amerigroup reviewing physician. This peer -to-peer discussion may be initiated by calling the peer -to-peer number at 844-227-8345. Medical necessity is defined by Iowa as those covered services that are determined through Utilization Management to be: Appropriate and necessary for the symptoms, diagnosis or treatment of the condition of the member. Provided for the diagnosis or direct care and treatment of the condition of member enabling the member to make reasonable progress in treatment. 84 Within standards of professional practice and given at the appropriate time and in the appropriate setting.

Medical Management Precertification If a provider asks for prior approval of a service and a decision is made that the service is not medically needed, the provider will be able to discuss this decision with Amerigroup. If the decision remains the same, the member, member's approved represen tative or the provider (on the member's behalf and with their written consent) can appeal the decision. See the section on Appeals .

Failure to comply with notification rules will result in an administrative denial. Administrative Denial An administrative denial is a denial of services based on reasons other than medical necessity. Administrative denials are made when a contractual requirement is not met, such as late notification of admission, lack of precertification or failure by the provider to submit clinic al information when requested. Appeals for administrative denials must address the reason for the denial ( in ot her words, why precertification was not obtained or why clinical information was not submitted). If Amerigroup overturns its administrative decision, the case will be reviewed for medical necessity. If approved, either the claim will be reprocessed or the requestor will be notified of the action that needs to be taken.

Generally speaking, the provider is responsible for contacting us to request preservice review for both professional and institutional services. However, hospital or ancillary providers should also contact Amerigroup to verify preservice review status for all nonurgent care before rendering services. Medical Management Requests with Insufficient Clinical Information When the Medical Management department receives req uests with insufficient clinical information, we will contact the provider with a request for the information reasonably necessary to determine medical necessity. We will make at least one attempt to contact the requesting provider to obtain this additiona l information. If we do not receive a response, the request will be reviewed with the information originally submitted and denied. A denial letter will be sent to both the member and the provider. Medical Management Urgent Requests Based on the member's condition, you may request an urgent determination. The Medical Management department will complete an urgent preservice determination once clinical information is received from the provider. If additional information is needed to aut horize the admission, the Medical Management team will submit a request within 24 hours. The provider will then have 48 hours to provide the additional clinical information. Medical Management Routine Requests For nonurgent requests, the Medical Management department will make a determination as quickly as possible, but always within 14 calendar days of a routine request. Medical Management Emergency Medical Services Amerigroup does not require precertification for treatment of emergency medical conditions. In the event of an emergency, members may access emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If the emergency room visit results in the member's admission to the hospital, providers must contact Amerigr oup within 24 hours or the next business day. 89 Medical Management Emergency Stabilization and Post -Stabilization The emergency department's treating provider determines the services needed to stabilize the member's emergency medical condition. After the me mber is stabilized, the emergency department's provider must contact Amerigroup for authorization of further services. If we do not respond within one hour, we consider the necessary services authorized. The emergency department should send a copy of the emergency room record to the PCP's office within 24 hours. The PCP should: Review and file the chart in the member's permanent medical record Contact the member Schedule a follow -up office visit or a specialist referral, if appropriate Medical Management Concurrent Review: Hospital Admissions Hospitals must notify us of an admission within 24 hours of admission or by the next business day. Notify us by providing preliminary clinical information about the following admissions: Behavioral health Medical care o Inpatient admissions o Observation admissions (notification only required) - This can be removed. Observation no longer requires an authorization. Substance abuse After notification of an inpatient admission is received, we will send a request for clinical information supporting the admission's medical necessity. Evidence -based criteria are used to determine medical necessity and the appropriate level of care. Medical Management Concurrent Review: Clinical Information for Continued -Stay Review When a member's hospital stay is expected to exceed the number of days authorized during preservice review, or when the inpatient stay did not have preservice review, the hospital must contact us for continued stay review. We require clinical revie ws on all members admitted as inpatients to: Acute care hospitals Intermediate facilities Skilled nursing facilities Custodial nursing facilities Inpatient rehabilitation, psychiatric and substance abuse treatment facilities We perform these reviews to as sess medical necessity and determine whether the facility and level of care are appropriate. Amerigroup identifies members admitted as inpatients by: Facilities reporting admissions Providers reporting admissions Members or their representatives reporting admissions Claims submitted for services rendered without authorization Preservice authorization requests for inpatient care The Medical Management department will complete a continued -stay inpatient review within 24 hours of receipt of clinical information or sooner, consistent with the member's medical condition. Medical 90 Management nurses will request clinical information from the hospital on the same day as notification regarding the member's admission and/or continued stay. Providers should notify the health plan of an inpatient admission within 24 hours of the admission. If the information meets medical necessity review cri teria, we will approve the request within 24 hours of receipt of the information. We will send requests that do not meet medical policy guidelines to the physician adviser or medical director for further review. In addition to notifying providers of the de cision within 24 hours, we will send written notification of denial or modification of the request to the member and the requesting provider. Readmission Amerigroup follows the state of Iowa's 30 -day readmission policy. We may review hospital admissions on a specific member if it appears that two or more admissions are related based on same DRG. The claim review, which includes a review of medical records i f requested from the provider, may result in necessary adjustments. If so, we'll make all necessary adjustments to the claim (including recovery of payments) not supported by the medical record. Providers who do not submit the requested medical records or who do not remit the overpayment amount identified by us may be subject to a recoupment. Important to Note: The review for admission is based on the DRG and not on diagnosis codes. Per diem information should be used in identifying readmissions instead of relying on diagnosis codes. Claims should be combined by the provider prior to submission. Providers are responsible for, and required to self -adjust, claims within the 30 -day window. Medical Management Concurrent Review: Second Opinions The following are important guidelines regarding obtaining a second opinion: The second opinion must be given by an appropriately -qualified health care professional. The second opinion must come from a provider of the same specialty as the first provider. The secondary specialist may be selected by the member. The secondary specialist must be within our network. When there is no network provider who meets the qualification, we may authorize a second opinion by a qualified provider outside of the network, upon request by the member or provider. A second opinion regarding medical necessity is a covered service, offered at no cost to our members .

These service organizations include the fo llowing: Diabetes Prevention program Iowa Department of Health and Human Services Local health departments Prenatal care coordination agencies School -based service providers Our approach is collaborative, results -oriented, community -based and member -centered. We encourage providers to work with these community organizations to coordinate care, ensure continuity and provide culturally appropriate services to our members enrolled in IA Health Link. Our agreements offer clear guidelines for sharing clinical data that can help our members lead healthier lives. The intent of our collaboration with our community partners is to supplement providers' treatment plans. When combined with our own Health Services programs, they can improve our members' overall health by informing, educating and encouraging self -care. Th e targeted programs are divided into four categories: Preventive care programs, including Taking Care of Baby and Me\u00ae for mothers -to-be, Well Woman for keeping women healthy at any stage of life, and HealthCheck, a health screening and immunization program for members under the age of 21. Health management programs that promote knowledge and encourage self -care for specific medical conditions and chronic disease, including diabetes, asthma and heart disease. Health education, including our Amerigroup on Cal l phone line, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for all health -related questions. Telehealth, a unique health care delivery method utilizing computers and videoconferencing equipment to connect providers to specialists in different locations. Health Services Programs Preventive Care: Initial Health Assessments The initial health assessment (IHA) offers a baseline for providers to assess and manage a member's physical condition. Providers then offer the educational support necessary to allow members t o become more actively engaged in their own treatment and preventive health care. We encourage our members to schedule a visit with their new PCP as soon as possible after enrollment. The IHA should include the following categories of patient information: Demographics Patient history Physical examination Developmental assessment o Self-perceived health status o Behavioral change strategies o Special needs ( for example, hearing/vision impairment and language preferences) 95 Health Services Programs Preventive Care: Well Woman The Well Woman program was designed to remind and encourage women to have regular cervical and breast cancer screenings. PCP responsibilities for the care of female members include: Educating members on Preventive Health Care Guidelines for women Informing and referring members for cervical and breast cancer screenings Scheduling screening exams for members If the PCP is not a women's health specialis t, Amerigroup will offer female members direct access to women's health specialists within the network for covered, routine and preventive health care services. Members have the right to receive family planning services, in addition to routine care, from any Medicaid provider. Members also have the right to receive tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV/ AIDS care from any public health agency. Health Services Programs Preventive Care: Taking Care of Baby and Me \u00ae Taking Care of Baby and Me is a proactive case management program for all expectant mothers and their newborns. It identifies pregnant women as early in their pregnancies as possible through review of state enrollment files, claims data, hospital census reports, Availity and notification of pregnancy forms as well as provider and member self -referrals . Once pregnant members are identified, we act quickly to assess obstetrical risk and ensure appropriate levels of care and case management services to mitigate risk. Experience d case managers work with members and providers to establish a care plan for our highest risk pregnant members. Case managers collaborate with community agencies to ensure mothers have access to necessary services. When it comes to our pregnant members, we're committed to keeping both mom and baby healthy. That's why we encourage all of our moms -to-be to take part in our Taking Care of Baby and Me program offering: Individualized, one -on-one case management support f or women at the highest risk. Care coordination for moms who may need a little extra support. Educational materials and information on community resources. Incentives to keep up with prenatal and postpartum checkups and well -child visits after the baby is born. As part of the Taking Care of Baby and Me program, members are offered the My Advocate \u00ae program. This program provides pregnant women proactive, culturally appropriate outreach and education through Interactive Voice Response (IVR) . Eligible members receive regular phone calls with tailored content from a voice personality (Mary Beth), or they may choose to access the program via a smartphone application or website. This program does not replace the high - touch case management approach for high -risk pregnant women. However, it does serve as a supplementary tool to extend our health education reach. The goal of the expanded outreach is to identify pregnant women who have become high -risk, to facilitate connections between them and our case managers and improve member and baby outcomes. For more information on My Advocate, visit www.myadvocatehelps.com . NICU Case Management For parents with infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), we offer the NICU Care Management program. This program provides education and support designed to help parents cope wi th the day -to-day stress of having a baby in the NICU, encourages parent/caregiver involvement, and helps 96 them to prepare themselves and their homes for discharge. Highly skilled and specialized NICU case managers provide education and resources that outli ne successful strategies parents may use to collaborate with their baby's NICU care team while inpatient and manage their baby's health after discharge. Once discharged, the NICU case manager continues to provide education and support to foster improved outcomes, prevent unnecessary hospital readmissions and ensure efficient community resource consumption. The stress of having an infant in the NICU may result in post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms for parents and loved ones. To reduce the impa ct of PTSD among our members, we assist by: Guiding parent(s) into hospital -based support programs, if available. Screening parent(s) for PTSD approximately one month after their baby's date of birth. Referring parent(s) to behavioral health program resour ces, if indicated. Reconnecting with a one -month follow -up call to assess if the parent(s) received benefit from initial contact and PTSD awareness. Our case managers are here to help you. If you have a member in your care that would benefit from OB or NICU case management, please call us at 800-454-3730 . Members can also call Amerigroup on Call at 866-864-2544 (English) (TTY: 711) or 866-864-2545 (Spanish), available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Health Services Programs Preventive Care: Long -acting Reversible Contraception IA Health Link members have access to immediate postpartum placement of long -acting reversible contraception (intrauterine devices [IUDs] and etonogestrel implants) during their inpatient delivery admission. Physicians may implant the device of the patient's choice. Facilities and providers will receive the same reimbursement as if the device were implanted on an outpatient basis. To help ensure the devices are immediately available to patients, postpartum facilities ar e encouraged to stock obstetrical units with the LARC devises. The device HCPCS codes and insertion CPT codes for the inpatient procedure are noted below: code Description J7300 Intrauterine copper contraceptive J7301 Levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine contraceptive system, 13.5 mg J7307 Etonogestrel (contraceptive) implant system, including implant and supplies J7297 Levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine contraceptive system, 52 mg, three -year duration J7298 Levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine contraceptive system, 52 mg, five -year duration J7296 Levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine contraceptive system, 19.5 mg, five -year duration (Kyleena) CPT code Description 11981 Insertion, non-biodegradable drug delivery implant 58300 Insertion of IUD Unintended pregnancies continue to be a major health problem in the United States. These unintended pregnancies are associated with higher rates of maternal and neonatal complications of pregnancy. Long -acting methods are more effective at preventing unintended pregnancies, have significantly greater continuation rates than oral contraceptives, the vaginal contraceptive ring or the contraceptive patch, and have very low ra tes of serious side effects. 97 We respectfully ask providers to discuss reproductive life planning, and if appropriate, the option of immediate postpartum placement of the IUD or implant with their patients. It is suggested these discussions take place earl y on, during the third trimester of pregnancy. Please provide additional counseling and support to your teenage and young patients (ages 13 -19), as this group is at the greatest risk for early discontinuation of contraception. It appears there is lower dis continuation at two years of IUDs as compared to the etonogestrel implant. When clinically appropriate, IUDs should be considered over the implant. If you have questions regarding providing this new service to your patients, please contact Provider Servic es at 800-454-3730 Monday through Friday, from 7 a.m. -6:30 p.m. Central time .

Health Services Programs Health Education: Smoking Cessation A member can enroll with the Amerigroup Smo king Cessation Program which offers Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) and counseling. If a member is participating with the Amerigroup Smoking Cessation Program administered by National Jewish Health (NJH), no prior authorization is required . To help a member enroll with Amerigroup Smoking Cessation Program: 100 The member can self -refer by calling Member Services 800-600-4441. The provider can also refer the member by calling Provider Services at 800-454-3730 . What happens when a member is referred to the Amerigroup Smoking Cessation Program? a. Amerigroup confirms member enrollment and the member's information is passed along to Amerigroup's vendor, National Jewish Health (NJH). NJH contacts the member within one business day of receiving the referral. Three attempts are made to reach the member. If the member is reached, counseling begins. After completion of the first call, the member is eligible for NRT product. b. If the member wants NRT, NJH conducts a medical screen for contraindications. I f contraindication is indicated, NJH sends provider consent form to provider. The provider completes the form and returns it to NJH as indicated on consent form via fax to 1 -888- 827-7057 or mail Real Solutions Tobacco Cessation Program by Amerigroup c/o N ational Jewish Health 1400 Jackson St., S117A Denver, CO 80206). c. If the provider approved use of NRT or the member does not have any contraindications, NJH ships a 28 day supply of NRT directly to member's home. Under this program the member is allowed up to a two months' supply of patches, lozenges or gum. Health Ser vices Programs Provider Assessment of Smoking Use The following are guidelines providers should use to help members quit smoking: Assess members' smoking status and offer advice about quitting. Use the state's online Notification of Pregnancy form as a way to notify us, through the state, of pregnant women who smoke. Women are more likely to quit smoking during pregnancy. Offer members resources to stop smoking, including Clearing the Air program information from the National Cancer Institute. Refer members to the Amerigroup Smoking Cessation Program by having the member call Member Services 800-600-4441. The provider can also refer the member by calling Provider Services at 800-454-3730 . 101 CHAPTER 10: CLAIMS SUBMISSION AND GUIDELINES Claims Submission and Guidelines Overview Having a fast and accurate system for processing claims allows providers to manage their practices and our members' care more efficiently.

If the claim contains all required information, Amerigroup accepts the claim into the claims system for processing and sends you either a remittance advice (RA) or a claims disposition notice (CDN) when the claim is finalized. Claims Submission and Guidelines National Provider Identifier The NPI is a 10 -digit, all numeric identifier. NPIs are issued only to providers of health services and supplies. As a provision of HIPAA, the NPI has been established to improve efficiency and reduce fraud and abuse. All Amerigroup participating providers must have an NPI number with the exception of atypical providers. NPIs are divided into t wo types: Type One : Individual providers, including, but not limited to physicians, dentists , chiropractors and pharmacists Type Two : Hospitals and medical groups, including but not limited to hospitals, group practices, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) Using your NPI for claims and billing has several advantages due to simplification, for example: Billing process: Maintaining and using legacy identifiers for each of the health care plans is no longer necessary. Provider changes: Modifying provider information is easier, such as changing a business address or phone number. Provider identification: Using a single identification number for electronic transactions with any health care plan with which they are affilia ted. 104 NPI: HIPAA requires the adoption of a standard unique provider identifier for health care providers. All Amerigroup participating providers must have an NPI number, with the exception of atypical providers. The NPI is a 10 -digit intelligence -free nu meric identifier. Intelligence -free means the numbers do not carry information about health care providers, such as the state in which they practice or their specialty. Providers may apply for an NPI online at the National Plan and Provider Enumeration Sy stem (NPPES) website: https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/#/ . Or, request a paper application by calling NPPES at 800-465-3203. The following websites offer additional NPI informatio n: CMS : https://www.cms.gov Committee: www.nucc.org Atypical Providers Atypical providers include individuals or businesses that are not health care providers and do not meet the definition of a health care provider according to the NPI rules. These types of providers do not require an NPI number. Examples of atypical providers include but are not limited to the following: Home delivered meals Consumer Directed Attendant Care, Individual and Agency Homemaker services Companion services Home modification/repai r services Transportation services Claims Submission and Guidelines Enrollment in Iowa Medicaid To be reimbursed for services by Amerigroup, providers must successfully complete Iowa Medicaid's provider enrollment process. Providers enroll by completing a n online enrollment application at www.dhs.iowa.gov/iqrs/forms . Claims Submission and Guidelines ICD-10 Clinical Modification (CM) As of October 1, 2015, ICD -10 became the code set for medical diagnoses and inpatient hospital procedures in compliance with HIPAA requirements and in accordance with the rule issued by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). What is ICD -10? International Classifica tion of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD -10) is a diagnostic and procedure coding system endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1990. It replaces the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD -9), which was developed in the 1970s. Internationally, the codes are used to study health conditions and assess health management and clinical processes; and in the United States, the codes are the foundation for documenting the diagnosis and associated services provided across healthcare settings. Although we often use the term ICD -10 alone, there are actually two parts to ICD -10: ICD-10-CM (Clinical Modification) used for diagnosis coding 105 ICD-10-PCS (Procedure Coding System) used for inpatient hospital procedure coding; a variation from the WHO baseline and unique to the United States ICD-10-CM replaced the code sets, ICD -9-CM, Volumes 1 and 2 for diagnosis coding, and ICD -10-PCS will replaced ICD -9-CM, Volume 3 for inpatient hospital procedure coding. Claims Submission and Guidelines Claim Filing Limits Filing limits are determined as follows: If Amerigroup is the primary payer, the time period is 180 days. If Amerigroup is the secondary payer, the time period is 365 days for an in -network provider and 365 days for an out -of-network provider . The time period is determined from the last date of service on the claim through the Amerigroup receipt date. If Amer igroup is the secondary payer, the 180 -day period will not begin until the provider receives notification of the primary payer's responsibility. This is outlined in the Provider Agreement. Claims must be submitted within the contracted filing limit to be c onsidered for payment. Claims submitted after that time period will be denied for timely filing. Please note: Amerigroup is not responsible for a claim never received. If a claim is submitted inaccurately, prolonged periods before resubmission may cause you to miss the filing deadline. Claims must pass basic edits to be considered received. To avoid missing deadlines, submit clean claims as soon as possible after delivery of service. The following table outlines which form to use for different services a nd the time limit to file. 106 Claims Submission and Guidelines Claim Forms and Filing Limits Refer to the provider contract to confirm the time limits to file.

Retro Eligible Members In instances where a member is made retro -eligible to Amerigroup , the provider must submit the claims within 90 days of the date that they are made retro -eligible. However, the provider is responsible for obtain and authorization for any services on a go forward basis. Submit the claim within 90 days of the date the member is made retro eligible. The claims may deny for timely filing initially but contact your provider relations representative for assistance if needed in these circumstances or contact Provider Services. Claims Submission and Guidelines Claims from Noncontracted Providers The filing limit for out-of-network provider submissions of claims to the contractor is 12 months from the date of service. This conforms with the filing limit under the Medicaid state plan (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.45 [d][4]). Amerigroup accepts the following claims from noncontracted providers under certain conditions and within certain time frames: Emergency services: 365 days from date of service or discharge date Medicaid enrolled: 365 days with precertification if services are not available in Iowa Newly Medicaid enrolled: Within 365 days of the date the new provider identifier is issued, and within 365 days of the date of service Claims Submission and Guidelines Balance Billing Providers contracted with Amerigroup may not balance bill members for covered services above the amount Amerigroup pays to the provider. Providers may balance bill a member when precertification of a covered service is denied. The provid er must establish and demonstrate compliance with the following: Establish that precertification was requested and denied before rendering service. Request a review of the authorization decision made by Amerigroup. 108 Notify the member that the service requir es precertification and that Amerigroup has denied authorization. If out -of-network, the provider also must explain to the member that covered services may be available without cost when provided by an in -network provider. In such cases, precertification o f service is required. Inform the member of his or her right to file a grievance if the member disagrees with the decision to deny authorization. Inform the member of his or her responsibility for payment of nonauthorized services. If the provider uses a waiver to establish member responsibility for payment, the waiver must meet the following requirements: o The waiver is signed only after the member receives appropriate notification and before services are rendered o The waiver does not contain any language o r condition to the effect that if authorization is denied, the member is responsible for payment o A waiver must be obtained for each encounter or member visit that falls under the scenario of the noncovered services. Providers may not use nonspecific patien t waivers o The waiver must specify the date services were provided and which services fall under the waiver's application The waiver must show the cost of the services and have a payment plan established The provider has the right to file a payment dispute for an Amerigroup payment resulting from a denial of authorization. Claims Submission and Guidelines Client Participatio n/Member Liability Some members have a member liability, also referred to as client participation, they are required to contribute to their cost of care. HHS has the responsibility for determining the member liability amount. This includes a portion of mem bers eligible for Medicaid on the following bases: (i) members in an institutional setting; and (ii) 1915(c) HCBS waiver enrollees. Through the HHS eligibility and enrollment files, the state will notify Amerigroup of any applicable member liability amount s. This information will be made available to providers. Providers will be required to collect this amount from the member and bill gross/full charges. Amerigroup will adjudicate the claim and deduct the patient liability amount. In the event the sum of an y applicable third -party payment and a member's financial participation equals or exceeds the reimbursement amount established for services, Amerigroup will make no payment to the provider. You may refer to the section on Client Participation for more details on the process. Claims Submission and Guidelines Coordination of Benefits If a member carries insurance through multiple insurers, Amerigroup will coordinate the benefits to ensure maximum coverage without duplication of payments. Providers must submit coordination of benefits (COB) claims to the primary carrier before submitting to Amerigroup. After submitting the claim to the primary carrier, submit a claim for the total billed charges to Amerigroup along with a copy of the primary carrier's remittance advice. Indicate the Other Coverage information on the appropriate claim form. If you need to coordinate benefits, include at least one of the following items from the other health care program: Third -party RA Third -party letter explaining either the denial of coverage or reimbursement COB claims received without at least one of these items will be mailed back to you with a request to submit to the other health care program first. Make sure the information you submit explains all coding listed on the other carrier's remittance advice or letter. We cannot process the claim without this information. 109 There will be limited number of claims which do not automatical ly crossover to Amerigroup from the primary carrier. It will be the provider's responsibility to submit the crossover claim to Amerigroup Iowa for reimbursement in these instances. Cost Avoidance Exceptions Providers are not always required to coordinate first with the liable third party. In the following situations, we will first pay the provider and then coordinate with the liable third party: or (ii) when the claim is for preventive pediatric services (including EPSDT) that are covered by the Medicaid p rogram. Following reimbursement to the provider in these cost avoidance exception cases, we will actively seek reimbursement from responsible third parties and adjust claims accordingly. Coordination of Benefits Agreement CMS developed the Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA), which standardizes the way eligibility and Medicare claims payment information within a claims crossover context is exchanged. In accordance with our participation in this agreement, we submit ou r Medicaid enrollment data to CMS to obtain Medicare claim payment information. The exchange is used to create a claim to process coordination of benefits. Claims Submission and Guidelines Subrogation Personal injury and workers' compensation claims: If a provider treats a recipient for injuries or illness sustained in an event for which liability may be contested or during the course of employment, the provider may elect to bill Medicaid for services p rovided without regard to the possible liability of another party or the employer. Alternatively, the provider may elect to seek payment by joining in the recipient's personal injury claim or workers' compensation claim, but in no event may the provider se ek payment from both Medicaid and a personal injury or workers' compensation claim. After the provider accepts the Medicaid payment for services provided to the recipient, the provider shall not seek or accept payment from the recipient's personal injury o r workers' compensation claim. Providers must choose which method of payment they will pursue at the time of treatment and submit claims either to Amerigroup or to the member's personal injury/workers' compensation carrier. The law does not allow provider s to submit claims to both carriers. If a provider submits to both carriers, receives payment from both carriers, and subsequently sends a refund to Amerigroup, submission of the refund still could be considered a fraudulent action. Seeking or accepting pa yment from both carriers is prohibited by law. Amerigroup agrees to first pay the provider and then coordinate with the liable third party. We will not require providers to bill the third party prior to Amerigroup in the following situations: (i) the clai m is for coverage derived from a parent whose obligation to pay support is being enforced by the State Title IV -D Agency and the provider of service has not received payment from the third party within 30 calendar days after the date of service; or (ii) th e claim is for preventive pediatric services (including EPSDT) that are covered by the Medicaid program. Following reimbursement to the provider in these cost avoidance exception cases, we will actively seek reimbursement from responsible third parties and adjust claims accordingly. Claims Submission and Guidelines Claims Filed With the Wrong Plan If you file a claim with the wrong insurance carrier, Amerigroup will process your claim within 180 days from the date of service. If the claim or claim dispute includes an explanation for the delay or other evidence that establishes the reason, Amerigroup will determine good cause based primarily on that statement or 110 evidence and/or if the evidence leads to doubt about the validity of the statement. Amerigroup wi ll contact the provider for clarification or additional information necessary to make a good cause determination. Claims Submission and Guidelines Payment of Claims After filing an electronic claim, you should receive a response from Amerigroup within 30 business days after we receive the claim. If the claim contains all required information, Amerigroup accepts the claim into the claims system for processing and sends you either a remittance advice (RA) or a claims disposition notice (CDN) when the claim i s finalized. A \"clean claim\" is one in which all information required for processing is present. If a claim is denied because more information was required to process the claim, the claim denial notice shall specifically describe all information and supp orting documentation needed to evaluate the claim for processing. Claims Submission and Guidelines Monitoring Submitted Claims After submitting claims, you can monitor and make changes to the claim by: Checking claim status on the secure provider website at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia . Select Login or Register to access the secure site. Calling Provider Services. Confirming receipt of Plan Batch S tatus Reports from your vendor/clearinghouse to ensure claims have been accepted by Amerigroup. Correcting and resubmitting Plan Batch Status Reports and error reports electronically. Correcting errors and immediately resubmitting to prevent denials due to late filing. Claims Submission and Guidelines Electronic Fund Transfer Amerigroup allows electronic funds transfers (EFTs) for claims payment transactions, meaning that claims payments are deposited directly into a previously selected bank account. Enroll in this service by calling Provider Services at 800-454-3730 . Claims Submission a nd Guidelines Electronic Remittance Advice Amerigroup providers can choose to receive electronic remittance advices (ERAs). ERAs are received through an electronic mailbox that has been set up between Amerigroup, the provider and/or the provider's clearing house. For more information call Provider Services at 800-454-3730 . Claims Submission and Guidelines Claims Overpayment Recovery Procedure Refund notifications may be identified by two entities \u2014 either Amerigroup/our contracted vendors or the providers. If Amerigroup/our contracted vendors identify the refund notification, we'll research and notify the provider of an overpayment and request a refund check. The provider may also identify an overpayment and proactively submit a refund check to reconcile the overpayment amount. Once an overpayment has been identified by Amerigroup, Amerigroup will notify the provider of the overpayment. The overpayment notification will include instructions on how to refund the overpayment. If a provider identifies an overpayment and submits a r efund, a completed Refund Notification Form specifying the reason for the return must be included. This form can be found on the provider website at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia . The submission of the Refund Notification Form will allow Cost 111 Containment to process and reconcile the overpayment in a timely manner. The provider can also complete a Recoupment Notification Form, which gives Amerigroup the authorization t o adjust claims and create claim offsets. This form can also be found on the provider website at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia . For questions regarding the refund no tification procedure or recoupment process, please call Provider Services at 800-454-3730 . In instances where we're required to adjust previously paid claims to adhere to a new published rate, we will initiate a reconciliation of the affected claims. Amer igroup will determine the cumulative adjusted reimbursement amount based on the new rates. In the event the outcome of this reconciliation results in a net amount owed to Amerigroup, Amerigroup will work with the provider and provide the appropriate notice prior to commencement of any recovery activities including through an offset against future claims payments. Such recoveries are not considered part of the overpayment recovery process described above or in the provider agreement. Changes addressing the topic of overpayments have taken place with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), commonly known as the Healthcare Reform Act. The provision directly links the retention of overpayments to false claim liability. The langua ge of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1320a -7k makes explicit that overpayments must now be reported and returned to states or respective MCOs within 60 days of identification of the overpayment or by the date any corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. After 60 days, the overpayment is considered a false claim, which triggers penalties under the False Claims Act including treble damages. In order to avoid such liability, health care providers and other entities receiving reimbursement under Medicaid should implement policies and procedures on reporting and returning overpayments that are consistent with the requirements in the PPACA. Provision 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1320a -7k, entitled \"Reporting and Returning Overpayments - Deadline for Reporting and Returning Overpayments,\" clarifies the uncertainty left by the 2009 Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. This provision of the Healthcare Reform Ac t applies to providers of services, suppliers and Medicaid MCOs. Claims Submission and Guidelines Third -Party Recovery Providers may not interfere with or place any liens upon the rights of the state of Iowa or Amerigroup (acting as Iowa's agent) to reco very from third -party billing. Claims Submission and Guidelines Claim Resubmissions If you have not heard from Amerigroup regarding a submitted claim after 30 business days from the submission of the claim, contact us to determine the status.

Contact Provider Services at 800-454-3730 . Claims Submission and Guidelines Claims Returned for Additional Information Amerigroup will send you a request for additional or corrected information when the claim cannot be processed due to incomplete, missing or incorrect information. Amerigroup also may request additional 112 information retroactively for a claim already paid. If you receiv e a request from Amerigroup for additional information, you must provide that information within 90 days of the date of the request or your claim may be denied. To submit additional or corrected information, you must send: All supporting documentation you believe to be important or that is specifically requested by Amerigroup. A copy of the original, corrected CMS -1500 or CMS -1450 claim form. Please note: Many of the claims returned for further information are returned for common billing errors. Claims Submission and Guidelines Reference: Covered Services For a listing of covered services, please see the Covered and Noncovered Services chapter . Claims Submission and Guidelines Reference: Clinical Submissions Categories The following is a list of claims categories for which we routinely may require submission of clinical information before or after payment of a claim. If the claim: Involves precertification, predetermi nation or some other form of utilization review, including but not limited to claims that are: o Pending for lack of precertification. o Involving medical necessity or experimental/investigative determinations. o Involving drugs administered in a physician's off ice requiring precertification. Requires certain modifiers. Includes unlisted codes. Is under review to determine if the service is covered. Benefit determination cannot be made without reviewing medical records. This category includes, but is not limited to, specific benefit exclusions. Involves termination of pregnancy: All termination of pregnancy claims require review of medical records to determine if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest. Or, in cases where the woman suffers from a p hysical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a physical condition that endangers the woman's life and is caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. This condition would, as certified by a provider, place the woman in danger of dea th unless a termination of pregnancy is performed. Involves possible inappropriate or fraudulent billing. Is the subject of an internal or external audit, including high -dollar claims. Involves individuals under integrated case management or condition care . Is the subject of a dispute, including claims being mediated, arbitrated or litigated.

Claims Submission and Guidelines Reference: Common Reasons for Rejected and Returned Claims Many of the claims returned for further information are returned for common b illing errors. Problem Explanation Resolution Member's Identification (ID) Number is Incomplete Use the member's ID number on the IA Health Link card. Duplicate Claim Submission Overlapping service dates for the same service create a question about duplication. Claim was submitted to Amerigroup twice without additional information for consideration. List each date of service, line by line, on the claim form. Avoid spanning dates, except for inpatient billing. Read RAs and CDNs for important claim det ermination information before resubmitting a claim. Additional information may be necessary. Missing Codes for Required Service Categories Current Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) manuals must be used because changes are made to the codes quarterly or annually. Manuals may be purchased at any technical bookstore, or through the American Medical Association (AMA) or the Practice Management Information Corporation. Verify all services are coded with the correct codes (see lists provided). Check the codebooks or ask someone in your office who is familiar with coding. Unlisted Code for Service Some procedures or services do not have an associated code; use an unlisted procedure code. Amerigroup ne eds a description of the procedure and medical records to calculate reimbursement. DME, prosthetic devices, hearing aids or blood products require a manufacturer's invoice. For drugs/injections, the National Drug Code (NDC) number is required. By Report C ode for Service Some procedures or services require additional information. Amerigroup needs a description of the procedure and medical records to calculate reimbursement. DME, prosthetic devices, hearing aids or blood products require a manufacturer's invoice. For drugs/injections, the NDC number is required. Unreasonable Numbers Submitted Unreasonable numbers, such as \"9999\", may appear in the Service Units fields. Check your claim for accuracy before submission. Submitting Batches of Claims Stapling cl aims together may make the subsequent claims appear to be attachments, rather than individual claims. Clearly identify each individual claim and do not staple to another claim. 114 Claims Submission and Guidelines Reimbursement Policies Reimbursement policies serve as a guide to assist you in accurate claim submissions and to outline the basis for reimbursement if the service is covered by a member's Amerigroup benefit plan. These policies can be accessed on the provider site . Services mu st meet authorization and medical necessity guidelines appropriate to the procedure and diagnosis as well as the member's state of residence. Covered services do not guarantee reimbursement unless specific criteria are met. You must follow proper billing and submission guidelines including using industry standard, compliant codes on all claims submissions. Services should be billed with Current Procedure Terminology ( CPT) codes, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System ( HCPCS ) codes and/or revenue codes which indicate the services and/or procedures performed . The billed code(s) are required to be fully supported in the medical record and/or office notes. Unless otherwise noted within the policy, our policies apply to both participating and nonparticipatin g providers and facilities. If appropriate coding /billing guidelines or current reimbursement policies are not followed, Amerigroup may: Reject or deny the claim Recover and/or recoup the claim payment Adjust the reimbursement to reflect the appropriate s ervice and/or procedures performed. Amerigroup reimbursement policies are developed based on nationally accepted industry standards and coding principles. These policies may be superseded by mandates in provider , state, federal, or CMS contracts and/or requirements. System logic or set up may prevent the loading of policies into the claims platforms in the same manner as described; however, Amerigroup strives to minimize these variations. Reimbursement Hierarchy Claims submitted for payments must meet all aspects of criteria for reimbursements. The reimbursement hierarchy is the order of payment conditions that must be met for a claim to be reimbursed. Conditions of payment could include benefits coverage, medical necessity /clinical criteria , authorization requirements and/ or stipulations within a reimbursement policy. Neither payment rates nor methodology are considered to be conditions of payments. Review Schedules and Updates to Reimbursement Policies Reimbursement policies under go review s for updates to state contracts , state, federal or CMS requirements. Additionally, updates may be made at any time if we are notified of a mandated change or due to an Amerigroup business decision. We reserve the right to review and revise our policies whe n necessary. When there's an update, we'll publish the most current policies to our provider website. Medical Coding The Medical Coding department ensures correct coding guidelines have been applied consistently throughout Amerigroup. Those guidelines inc lude but are not limited to: Use of the correct modifier . Effective date of transaction code sets is included (CPT, HCPCS, ICD diagnosis/procedures, revenue codes, etc.) . Code editing rules are appropriately applied and within regulatory requirements . Analysis of codes, code definition and appropriate use . 115 Reimbursement by Code Definition Amerigroup allows reimbursement for covered services based on their procedure code definitions or descriptors unless otherwise noted by state, federal or CMS contract s and/or requirements. There are eight CPT sections: 1. Evaluations and management 2. Anesthesi a 3. Surgery 4. Radiology (nuclear medicine and diagnostic imaging) 5. Pathology and laboratory 6. Medicine 7. Category II codes: supplemental tracking codes that can be used for performance measurement 8. Category III codes: temporary codes for emerging technology, services, or procedures Provider Reimbursement and Fee Schedules Amerigroup reimburses providers bas ed on state Medicaid reimbursement methodologies and monitors the state website for any changes in fee schedules. Upon notification either by the state or through monitoring of the state website, Amerigroup would initiate the steps needed to update our sys tems to implement fee schedule and reimbursement changes. Where the state does not have a rate established, Amerigroup will use CMS methodologies as applicable to establish a rate. Fee schedule providers include the following: Ambulance Ambulatory surgical Assertive Community Treatment Audiologist Behavioral Health Birthing center Certified nurse midwife Certified registered nurse anesthesiologist Chiropractor Clinic Clinical Social Worker Community Based ICF/MR Community mental health center Crisis Response Services Family planning clinic Habilitation service Hearing Aid Dealer Independent Lab Independent Speech Pathologist Indian Health Services Lead Inspection Agencies Maternal Health Center Medical Supplies Nurse Practitioner Optician Optometrist Orthopedic Shoe Dealer Pharmacy Physical Therapist Physician Podiatrist Psychologist Psychiatric Medical Institute for Children Psychologist Public Health Agencies Rehabilitation Agency Screening Center Subacute Mental Health Services 116 Claims Submission and Guidelines Acute Care Hospitals/Critical Access Hospitals Inpatient Services Inpatient payment is based on the prospective payment system (PPS), which uses provider specific diagnostic rel ated group (DRG) base rates. The base rate is multiplied by the Iowa -specific DRG weight to determine the final payment. DRG payment: DRG provider specific base rate x DRG weight . Graduate medical education (GME) will be a flat rate add -on based on a provider specific payment rate. Cost Outliers An inpatient claim qualifies for a cost outlier payment when costs of service (not including any add -on amounts for direct or indirect medical education or for disproportionate -share costs) exceed the cost threshold. This cost threshold is the greater of e ither: Two times the statewide average DRG payment for that case. The hospital's individual DRG payment for that case plus $ 75,000. Additional payment for cost outliers is 80 percent of the excess between the hospital's cost for the discharge and the co st threshold established for the case. Long -Stay Outlier Reimbursement for long -stay outliers is calculated at 60 percent of the average daily rate for the given DRG for each approved day of stay beyond the upper day threshold. Payment for long -stay outl iers is made at 100 percent of the calculated amount when the claim is originally filed for DRG payment. Short -Stay Outlier Short -stay outliers are incurred when a member's length of stay is greater than two standard deviations below the average statewide length of stay for a given DRG, rounded to the next highest whole number of days. Payment for short -stay outliers is 200 percent of the average daily rate for each day the member qualifies, up to the full DRG payment. Outpatient Services Outpatient reimb ursement is based on the ambulatory payment classification (APC) payment. The APC payment is calculated by multiplying the applicable APC relative weight by the provider specific APC rate. The APC payment is multiplied by a discount factor percent and by t he units of service when applicable. Effective January 1, 2023 , Critical Access Outpatient hospitals must bill claims with Type of Bill 85x Hospital Outlier Payment Requests Cost outlier requests must be submitted to Amerigroup for review within 90 days from the date of the explanation of payment (EOP) of the initial DRG payment for both participating and nonparticipating hospitals. The request must include supporting information, including medical records, as indicated below: 117 Iowa Hospital Request Checklist Items to provide 1 Outlier dispute cover letter naming the hospital contact person (make sure to indicate on the cover letter that this is regarding an Iowa Outlier Request) 2 Copy of the original claim 3 Copy of the paid remittance(s) advice (RA) 4 Detailed itemized charges with revenue codes 5 Charges documented on itemized bill that correlate with UB -04 claim 6 Itemized bill numbered by provider and quantities billed 7 Check that total charges and DOS match on itemized bill, RA and UB -04 8 Charges documented in the itemized bill but not billed on the UB -04 are identified and marked through on the itemized bil l. 9 Utilization review notes documenting severity of illness and intensity of service criteria met; notes signed and dated 10 Physician discharge summary 11 Physician orders 12 Operating room procedure notes (if applicable) 13 Physical/occupational/speech/radiology orders/respiratory therapy notes (if applicable) 14 Chart organized and labeled for review. (Please do not include tabs or insert tabs; however, it is acceptable t o insert a page indicating documents that will proceed.) 15 Other documents ( for example, laboratory reports, anesthesiology records, etc.) 16 Request submitted within deadline of paid remittance advice 17 Indicate total number of pages submitted for review Note : The outlier request submissions must include all of the documentation detailed above for proper consideration. Upon receipt, the outlier request of the hospital is reviewed to see if it initially meets the requirements for outlier review. The request must be submitted within the timelines stated above. It must meet the threshold requirements for the DRG under which the claim is computed, and it is processed to pay the initial DRG payment. If the request meets the qualifications, then all the information provided by the hospital is forwarded to a vendor con tracted by Amerigroup for a forensic review. Upon the review, a response with the applicable supporting documents is sent to the provider that submitted the outlier request. The forensic review lists the categories of the exceptions with exhibits providin g line item details in the particular areas or revenue codes as applicable. If the provider disagrees with the review that was performed based on the documents that were received with the initial request, the following will apply: Outliers that do not meet the threshold of the reviewed documentation and have no additional payment can be disputed within 30 days of the date of the letter sent to the provider. The dispute must include any additional supporting documentation and the reason for the second -level dispute. Outliers that have reduced charges and an outlier payment being paid to the hospital can be disputed within 30 days of the date of the EOP. The dispute must include any additional supporting documentation and the reason for the second -level di spute. Requests should be sent to the contact information in the letter. If you have questions, please contact our Provider Services te am at 800-454-3730 . You may also use the contact information listed on the letter with the outlier review results and findings. 118 Claims Submission and Guidelines Ambulatory Service Center Reimbursement is based on the ambulatory service center (ASC) fee schedule. Each procedure code is assigned to one of the nine ASC levels. Each of the nine levels is assigne d to a separate reimbursement fee. If multiple procedures are medically necessary, payment will be made to the ASC procedure that is the most costly according to the fee schedule. The primary ASC procedure will be reimbursed at 100 percent and the secondar y ASC procedure will be paid at 50 percent of the fee for that procedure. Claims submissions are required on the CMS -1500 for ASC claims. Claims Submission and Guidelines Behavioral Health Facility Services are reimbursed based on the Behavioral Health Fee Schedule or per diems as defined by state reimbursement. Claims Submission and Guidelines Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) and Rural Health Clinics (RHC) Reimbursement is based on Prospective Payment System (PPS) rates. Claims Submission and Guidelines Intermediate Care Facility Reimbursement is based on a per diem rate that is derived from a cost based provider specific case mix adjusted rate. Claims Submission and Guidelines Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals Who Are Intellectually Disabled Reimbursement is based on 100 percent of the Amerigroup rate(s) for nursing facility, intermediate care facility and state resources centers. Claims Submission and Guidelines Skilled Nursing Facility Reimbursem ent is based on a per diem rate that is derived from a cost based provider specific case mix adjusted rate. Provider assessment pass -through payment and add -on amount will be included in the reimbursement. Claims Submission and Guidelines Hospice Reimburs ement is based on the state Medicaid rates. Hospice Room and Board Effective November 1, 2020, hospice providers must submit the NPI of the residing nursing facility in box 77. This is specific to Revenue Code 0658 when billed with HCPCS codes T2046, Q5 001, Q5002, Q5003 or Q5004. Providers must obtain the NPI for the facility where the patient is receiving care and report the facility's NPI in box 77 of the UB -04 claim form. Report only the 11 -digit NPI in this field. Do not input facility name, address, or any other notes in this field. o Failure to submit the NPI in this field will result in denials \u2014 119 Required HCPCS code(s): Hospice room and board claims, when billed with revenue code 0658, must have a HCPCS code of T2046, Q5001, Q5002, Q5003 or Q5004 sub mitted with the claim. Failure to follow this guidance will results in claims denials. Occurrence codes: Claims will deny if the following elements are missing or not filled out appropriately: o The begin date of the applicable hospice election period is missing. o The date of service billed is not within the election period. o The Occurrence Code 27 is not present on the claim. Interim Billing Interim facility/hospital claims is allowed in some long -term scenarios, that will span over 30 days. When interim billing on facility claims, the type of bill frequency (third digit) must match the patient status code. If the type of bill frequency does not match an appropriate patient status code, the cl aim is subject to denial and/or an overpayment recovery. If there is indication of an interim or continuing claim, where the third digit frequency is indicated as two or three, it would be inappropriate to bill a patient status code that indicates a discha rge, such as patient codes 1 to 5. A claim where the member is indicated as having been discharged from a facility, such frequency code one or four, it would be inappropriate to bill patient status code 30, indicating the member is still a patient. All claim form coding is required to match the patient's medical records and chart notes. Outlier Reimbursement Audit And Review Process Requirements and Policies This section includes guidelines on reimbursement to Providers and Facilities for services on claims paid by DRG with an outlier paid at percent of billed charge or where the entire claim is paid at percent of billed charge.

These r equirements include using industry standardized codes for most health services. This chapter is broken down into health service categories to help you find the specific billing requirements and codes you will need for each. You also will find information on billing members for services that are not medically necessary or not covered, billing for services for which the member is willing to pay, as well as information about completing the CMS -1500 claim form. To help you navigate the various billing require ments and codes, we have organized the service categories as follows: Adult preventive care Behavioral health Emergency services Family planning services Hospital readmission policy Hysterectomies Immunizations covered by the Vaccines For Children (VFC) program Initial health assessments (IHAs) Maternity services Newborns Preventive medicine services: new patient Preventive medicine services: established patient Sensitive services Sterilization Term ination of pregnancy For the most efficient claims processing, accurately completed claims are essential. Follow these general guidelines for claims filing: Indicate the provider's NPI number in Box 24J of the CMS -1500 form when appropriate. Missing or invalid numbers may result in nonpayment. Submit only state certified NPIs. Use the member's identification number from the IA Health Link ID card. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) should put the individual rendering provider NPI (if applicable) in 24j, and the billing/group NPI number in Box 33. Billing Professional and Ancillary Claims Coding To process claims in an orderly and consistent manner, we use standardized codes. The HCPCS, sometimes referred to as National Codes, provides coding for a wide variety of services. The principal coding levels are referred to as Level I and Level II: Level I: CPT codes maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA) and represented by five numeric digits. Level II: Codes that identify produc ts, supplies and services not included in the CPT codes, such as ambulance supplies and durable medical equipment (DME). Level II codes 129 sometimes are called the alphanumeric codes because they consist of a single alphabetical letter followed by four numeri c digits. In some cases, two -digit/character modifier code(s) should accompany the Level I or Level II coding. Reference guides useful for coding claims are: The CPT manual published by the AMA. The HCPCS manual published by the CMS. Billing Professional and Ancillary Claims Initial Health Assessments The Amerigroup primary medical groups (PMGs) function as a member's \" Health Home \". For that reason, we encourage our members to request an initial health assessment (IHA) as soon as possible after enrollment. The IHA should consist of a complete history, a physical exam and preventive services. When billing for IHAs, use the following ICD codes: Codes: Z00.121 - Z00.129 children (newborn to 18 years old) Codes: Z00.00 -Z00.01 for adults (19 years and older) Billing Professional and Ancillary Claims Adult Preventive Care The following is a list of codes specific to adult preventive care.

Sterilization does not include medical procedures that may have the effect of producing sterility but were performed for an entirely different purpose, such as r emoval of a cancerous uterus or prostate gland. To qualify for reimbursement, the following conditions must be met: 30 full days must elapse between the date of the consult and the date of surgery, but not more than 180 days Prior to sterilization, the pro vider must complete the Consent for Sterilization form (form 470-0835 or 470 -0835S [Spanish]), available on the HHS website at www.dhs.iowa.gov/iqrs/forms . Please note: Payment cannot be made to providers of associated services, including hospitals, anesthesiologists, pathologists and radiologists, unless the consent form is completed in an accurate and timely manner. The HHS will ask for recoupment of fees from Ame rigroup, which will subsequently be recouped from the provider. The following are required before performing sterilization: Patient has voluntarily given his or her consent to be sterilized. Patient was at least 21 years of age on the date of consent. Patient is not mentally incompetent. Patient is not institutionalized. At least 30 days, but no more than 180 days, have elapsed between the date of consent and the sterilization. Consent form used was the same form provided by HHS; no other form may be subst ituted. Dates on the consent form cannot be altered. The following are the exceptions to the 30 -day waiting period: Emergency abdominal surgery when the patient signs an informed consent at least 72 hours prior to surgery Premature labor when the patient has given informed consent at least 30 days prior to the expected date of confinement. The provider must indicate the expected date of confinement on the consent form 136 The provider must follow these sterilization procedures for Amerigroup to pay the claim : At the time of the sterilization consult, the nurse verifies the patient is a member of Amerigroup. The nurse then attaches the appropriate consent form to the front of the patient's chart. The patient completes, signs and dates the section titled Consen t for Sterilization. If an interpreter is necessary, the interpreter signs the consent form. The provider completes, signs and dates the section titled Statement of Person Obtaining Consent. Include the name and address of the facility where the procedure will be performed. The scheduling nurse schedules surgery. If anything is not in order, the procedure is postponed until t he issue is resolved. At the post -operative visit, the provider follows the instructions for use of alternative final paragraphs, signs and dates the Physician Statement, on the Sterilization Consent form. The provider forwards a copy of the signed Sterili zation Consent form to the facility where the procedure was performed. The provider files the original, signed Sterilization Consent form in the member's chart. The provider sends a signed copy of the Sterilization Consent form to Amerigroup, either submitted with the claim or sent separately to the Claims department. Billing Professional and Ancillary Claims Hysterectomy Payment will be made only for a medically necessary hysterectomy that is performed for a purpose other than sterilization and only when one or more of the following conditions are met: A member or her representative has signed an acknowledgment that she has been informed orally and in writing from the provider authorized to perform the hysterectomy that the hysterectomy will make the member permanently incapable of reproducing. This statement may be added to either the surgery consent form, written on the claim form, or on a separate sheet of paper. The member or her representative receiving the explanation must sign the statement. The following language is satisfactory for such a statement: Before the surgery, I received a complete explanation of the effects of this surgery, including the fact that it will result in sterilization. (Date) (Signature of member or person acting on her behalf) The vehicle for transmitting the acknowledgment that the member received the explanation before the surgery should not be the Consent for Sterilization Form (470 -0835 or 470 -0835S [Spanish]). This statement must be submitted to Amerigroup with th e related Medicaid claim. The member was already sterile before the hysterectomy: The provider must certify in writing that the member was already sterile at the time of the hysterectomy and must state the cause of the sterility. The following language is satisfactory for such a statement: Before the surgery, this patient was sterile, and the cause of that sterility was ____________________________________________. (Physician's signature) (Date) 137 This statement may be added to either the Surgery Consent Form, the claim form or a separate sheet of paper. A physician must sign any document stating the cause of sterility. This includes a history and physical, operative report, or claim form. This stat ement must be submitted to Amerigroup with the related Medicaid claim. The hysterectomy was performed as the result of a life -threatening emergency in which the physician determined that prior acknowledgment was not possible: The physician must include a description of the nature of the emergency. If the physician certifies that the hysterectomy was performed for a life -threatening emergency and includes a description of the nature of the emergency, the claim will be reviewed on an individual basis. Payme nt will be permitted only in extreme emergencies. Where the member is about to undergo abdominal exploratory surgery or a biopsy, and removal of the uterus could be a potential consequence of the surgery, the member should be informed of this possibility and given an opportunity to acknowledge in writing the receipt of this information. This includes C -sections when there is a reasonable expectation a hysterectomy will be performed, such as in the event of an acreta. Billing Professional and Ancillary Claims Termination of Pregnancy Abortions may only be authorized in the following situations: The pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest. A woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury or physical illness, including a li fe- endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed. The provider must complete a Certification Regarding Abortion For m (470 -0836) attesting to one of the circumstances listed above. In the case of rape or incest, the provider must include evidence that the crime was reported to law enforcement authorities. The Certification Regarding Abortion Form must be submitted to th e Amerigroup Claims department along with progress notes and any law enforcement documentation. Amerigroup will forward this information to the HHS for a final decision regarding coverage. After the HHS has made its decision, Amerigroup will notify the provider's office of the decision.

Throughout this chapter, specific billing requirements are broken down into the fo llowing service areas: Emergency room visits Urgent care visits Maternity Termination of pregnancy Inpatient acute care Inpatient sub -acute care Outpatient laboratory, radiology and diagnostic services Outpatient surgical services Outpatient infusion thera py visits and pharmaceuticals We also have included helpful billing guidelines for the ancillary services used most often by providers, including diagnostic imaging. These ancillary services include the following: Ambulance services Ambulatory surgical ce nters Physical, speech and occupational therapy Durable medical equipment Dialysis Home infusion therapy Laboratory and diagnostic imaging Skilled nursing facilities Home health care Hospice Nursing facilities Intermediate care facility for individuals who are intellectually disabled (ICF/IDs) Nursing facilities for individuals who are mentally ill (NF/MI) Please note: A member's benefits may not cover some of these services; confirm coverage before providing service. And finally, this chap ter will take a look at specific coding guidelines for the CMS -1450 (UB -04) claim form for hospital and health care facilities. Billing Institutional Claims Basic Billing Guidelines In general, the basic billing guidelines for institutional claims submitt ed to Amerigroup include: Use Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes or revenue codes. Valid HCPCS, CPT or revenue codes are required for all line items billed, whether sent on paper or electronically. Provide medical records. Medical records for certain procedures may be requested for determination of medical necessity. Use modifiers in accordance with your specific billing instructions. 140 Use codes for unlisted procedures. Because some provider services or procedures are not found in CPT, specific code numbers for reporting unlisted procedures have been designated. When using an unlisted procedure code, include a description of the service to help us calculate the appropriate reimbursement. We may reques t the member's medical records. Complete the appropriate billing for supplies and materials. Do not use CPT code 99070, which is for supplies and materials provided over and above those usually included with an office visit or other services. Amerigroup does not accept CPT code 99070. Health care providers must use HCPCS Level II codes, which provide a detailed description of the service. Please note: System edits are i n place for electronic claims . Claims submitted improperly cannot be processed easily and most likely will be returned.

Billing Institutional Claims Durable Medical Equipment Billing for custom -made durable medical equipment (DME), prescribed to preserve bodily functions or prevent disability, requires preservice re view. Without such review, claims for DME will be denied. Prior to dispensing, please contact the Amerigroup Medical Management department at 800-454-3730 . Please note: The presence of an HCPCS code does not necessarily mean that the benefit is covered or that payment will be made. Some DME codes may be By Report (customized) and therefore require additional information for preservice review and processing. A DME purchase may require PA. This does not apply to DMS. DME billing requires a differentiation between rentals and purchased equipment, as well as specific codes and modifiers. Special guidelines for DME billing: Use HCPCS codes for DME or supplies. Use an unlisted or miscellaneous code, such as E1399, when a H CPCS code does not exist for a particular item of equipment. 146 Use valid codes for DME and supplies. If valid HCPCS codes exist, unlisted codes will not be accepted. Attach the manufacturer's invoice to the claim if using a miscellaneous or unlisted code. The invoice must be from the manufacturer, not the office making the purchase. Please note: Catalogue pages are not acceptable as a manufacturer's invoice. Billing Institutional Claims Durable Medical Equipment: Rentals Most DME is dispensed on a r ental basis and requires medical documentation from the prescribing provider. Rented items remain the property of the DME provider until the purchase price is reached. Charges for rentals exceeding the reasonable charge for a purchase are not accepted. Ren tal extensions may be obtained only on approved items. Please note: DME providers should use normal equipment collection guidelines. Amerigroup is not responsible for equipment not returned by members.

After enrollment, we strongly encourage our members to select a PCP and remain with that provider because we believe in the positive impact of having a medical \"home.\" This home establishes a centralized hub from which all health care can be coordinated, no matter how many other caregivers become involved. Occasionally, membe rs may encounter barriers to effective relationships with their PCP. These obstacles may arise from geographical access, cultural and language differences, or simply personal preferences. Our members may change their PCP at any time, for any reason. Membe rs also have the right to change health care plans, following specific rules and timelines. If a member requests disenrollment, Amerigroup will provide information and assistance in the disenrollment process. We are committed to supporting providers' practices as well. Providers have the right to request that a member be reassigned to another PCP, under certain conditions and following specific guidelines. Amerigroup notifies PCPs of changes in member assignme nts through PCP Assignment Reports. These reports are available on Availity Essentials , our secure provider portal, at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia . Select Login or Register to access the secure site. Providers may also call Provider Services at 800-454-3730 . Cause for Disenrollment If a managed long -term services and supports member would have to change their residential, institutional or employment support provider based on the provider's change in status from an in -network to an out-of-network provider, the member has a cause for disenrollment. Member Transfers and Disenrollment PCP-Initiated Member Transfers A PCP may request member reassignment to a different PCP by completing and submi tting the Provider Request for Member Deletion from PCP Assignment form located at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia > Medical > Forms . Amerigroup will conduct a thorou gh review of the request for reassignment to determine whether the cause and documentation are sufficient to approve the request. This review includes monitoring to ensure consistency with our guidelines and policies. The provider is expected to coordinat e service for up to 30 days after the date Amerigroup receives the change request form. Upon completing the PCP assignment change, we will forward the form and any other information related to the case to the Member Services representative. This representa tive informs the member of the change within five working days. The change will be effective the day Amerigroup enters the change into the system. Member Transfers and Disenrollment PCP-Initiated Member Disenrollment The disenrollment process for abusive behavior and failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan is as follows: Complete the Provider Request for Member Deletion from PCP Assignment form located at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia > Medical > Forms . 150 Mail or fax ( preferred ) the form to: Amerigroup Iowa, Beach, -2429 Fax: 800-964-3627 Continue to manage the member's care as required until we can reassign the member to another PCP, or not more than 30 days from the day we receive the Provider Request for Member Deletion from PCP Assignment form, whichever comes first. Following our receipt of the Provider Request for Member Deletion from PCP Assignment form, we: Scan and log the form into the system for tracking purposes. Reassign the member to a new PCP for continuity of care. The effective date is no later than 30 days from the date on the Provider Request for Member Deletion from PCP Assignment form. Log th e new PCP assignment into the tracking system. Send an identification (ID) card and fulfillment material to the member indicating the newly assigned PCP's name, address and phone number. Document any abusive behavior and notify the Amerigroup Fraud and Abu se department if the abusive behavior continues. Send a warning letter to the member stating that if the behavior continues, Amerigroup will file a disenrollment request with the HHS . If the HHS grants approval, Amerigroup proceeds with the disenrollment p rocess. Prior to disenrollment, we will make every attempt to resolve issues and keep the member in our health care plan. If these attempts fail, we will reassign the member to another PCP or forward the disenrollment request form to the appropriate state agency requesting member reassignment to another health care plan. Member Transfers and Disenrollment State Agency -Initiated Member Disenrollment Contracted state agencies inform Amerigroup of membership changes by sending daily and monthly enrollment re ports. These reports contain all active membership data and incremental changes to eligibility records and Amerigroup disenrolls members not listed on the report. State -initiated disenrollment may occur due to changes in circumstances including: Ineligi bility for Medicaid, Hawki or the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan. If the member becomes ineligible and is later reinstated to these programs, MCO enrollment will also be reinstated. The member transfers to an eligibility group excluded from managed care organization enrollment. A shift to an eligibility category not covered by the contract. A change of place of residence to another state. The Iowa HHS determines participation in the Health Insurance Premium Payment program (HIPP) is more cost -effective th an enrollment in the contract. Death. Member Transfers and Disenrollment Member -Initiated PCP Reassignment Members have the right to change their PCP at any time. When a member enrolls in Amerigroup, he or she may select a PCP or allow their PCP to be assigned. After that, if the member wants to make a change, he or she is instructed to call our Member Services to request an alternate PCP. 151 Amerigroup accommodates member requests for PCP reassignment whenever possible. Our staff will work with the membe r to make the new selection, focusing on special needs. Our policy is to maintain continued access to care and continuity of care during the transfer process. When a member calls to request a PCP change: The Member Services representative checks the avail ability of the member's choice. If the member can be assigned to the selected PCP, the Member Services representative will do so. If the PCP is not available, the representative will assist the member in finding an available PCP. If the member advises the representative that he or she is hospitalized, the PCP change will take effect upon discharge. Amerigroup notifies PCPs of member transfers through the PCP Assignment Report. These reports are available on Availity Essentials through the Provider Online Re porting application located on Payer Spaces , our secure provider portal, at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia . Select Login or Register to access the secure site. The effective date of a PCP change will be the same as the date of the member request. Member Transfers and Disenrollment Member -Initiated Disenrollment Process When members enroll in our program, we pr ovide instructions on disenrollment procedures. Disenrollments become effective the last day of the calendar month following administrative cut -off or are subject to the HHS cut-off dates. If a member asks a provider how to disenroll from Amerigroup, the p rovider should direct the member to call Member Services at 800-600-4441 (TTY: 711). Please note: Providers may not take retaliatory action against any member for requesting transfer or disenrollment. When Member Services receives a call from a member who wants to disenroll, we attempt to find out the reason for the request and determine if we can resolve the situation. If we cannot resolve the situation, we inform the member that the disenrollment process will take 15 -45 days and refer the member to the HHS . If the state chooses to limit disenrollment, Amerigroup must allow a member to request disenrollment as follows: For cause, at any time Without cause, at the following times: o During the 90 days following the date of t he member's initial enrollment into Amerigroup or during the 90 days following the date the state sends the member notice of that enrollment, whichever is later o At least once every 12 months thereafter o Upon automatic reenrollment under 42 CFR 438.56 if the temporary loss of Medicaid eligibility has caused the member to miss the annual disenrollment opportunity o When the state imposes the intermediate sanction specified in \u00a7 438.702(a)(4) Members may re quest disenrollment from Amerigroup as follows: During the first 90 days following the date of the member's initial enrollment with Amerigroup : The member may request disenrollment for any reason, in writing or by calling Amerigroup. After the 90 days foll owing the date of the member's enrollment with Amerigroup: When the member is requesting disenrollment due to good cause, the member will first make a verbal or written filing of the issue through the Amerigroup grievance process. If there's no resolution, Amerigroup will direct the member to the enrollment broker. The enrolled member may request 152 disenrollment in writing or by calling the enrollment broker's toll -free member telephone line to request a good -cause change for enrollment. Good -cause changes in clude the following: o Amerigroup does not, because of moral or religious objections, cover the service the member seeks. o The member needs related services to be performed at the same time, and not all related services are available within the network. In ad dition, the member's PCP or another provider determines that receiving the services separately would subject the member to unnecessary risk. o Other reasons, including but not limited to poor quality of care, lack of access to services covered under the cont ract, lack of access to providers experienced in dealing with the member's health care needs, or eligibility and choice to participate in a program not available in managed care ( for example, PACE). Use of Amerigroup Grievance Procedures The state require s that the member seeks amends through our grievance process before making a determination on the member's request. The grievance process must be completed in time to allow the disenrollment, if approved, to be no later than the first day of the second mo nth following the month in which the member requests disenrollment. Amerigroup follows the timelines of an expedited grievance. The state makes the final decision for disenrollment. Member Transfers and Disenrollment Member Transfers to Other Plans Members may choose a different health care plan on an annual basis during the open enrollment period. As required by federal regulations, the open enrollment period lasts for 90 days for IA Health Link members. Upon initial enrollment, a member has 90 days to switch plans and once a year there after, they will have an opportunity to switch plans. However, members retain the right to change their health care plan when they have \"just cause\", which can be any of the following: The member has a lack of acces s to necessary services covered under the health care plan's contract. The member has a lack of access to providers experienced in dealing with the member's health care needs. The health care plan does not, for moral or religious objections, cover the services the member seeks. The member has concerns over quality of care. The member requires related services to be performed at the same time, and not all related services are available within the health care plan's network. The member's PCP leaves the he alth care plan and participates with another health care plan under contract with the state of Iowa , and the member requests the transfer to remain with the PCP. The member, Amerigroup or the HHS may initiate member disenrollment. If the request comes fro m a member and includes a member grievance, the grievance will be processed separately through the grievance process. Disenrollment may result in the following: Enrollment with another health care plan Termination of eligibility 153 Return to traditional Medic aid for continuity of care if the member's benefits fall into a voluntary aid code Member Transfers and Disenrollment Amerigroup -Initiated Member Disenrollment Amerigroup can't disenroll members or encourage members to disenroll for any reason, including issues around the member's health care needs or change in health care status or because of the member's utilization of medical services, diminished capacity, or uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from the member's special needs (except when the member's continued enrollment seriously impairs our ability to furnish services to either this particular member or other members). In instances where the exce ption applies, Amerigroup will provide evidence to Iowa HHS that continued enrollment of the member seriously impairs our ability to furnish services to either this particular member or other members. We have methods by which Iowa HHS is assured that disen rollment is not requested for another reason other than those permitted under the state contract. All our requests for the state to disenroll a member will be in writing and specify the basis for the request. If applicable, our request must document that reasonable steps were taken to educate the member regarding proper behavior, and the member refused to comply. Iowa HHS will review and approve all Amerigroup -initiated requests for disenrollment; the state retains sole authority for determining if conditi ons for disenrollment have been met and disenrollment will be approved. In accordance with 42 CFR 438.56, disenrollment requested by Amerigroup must comply with the following: All disenrollment requests must specify the reason(s) Amerigroup is requesting t he member's disenrollment. Amerigroup may not request disenrollment because of an adverse change in the member's health status or because of the member's utilization of medical services, diminished mental capacity, or uncooperative or disruptive behavior r esulting from his or her special needs (except when his or her continued enrollment seriously impairs our ability to furnish services to either this particular member or other members). All disenrollment requests must specify the methods by which we assur e Iowa HHS we didn't request disenrollment for reasons other than those permitted under the contract. Amerigroup may also request disenrollment for a member who has moved permanently out of the state. When a member moves out of our service area, he or she is responsible for notifying the HHS of the new permanent address. The HHS will disenroll the member from Amerigroup. Disenrollment Effective Date The effective date of a state -approved disenrollment must be no later than the first day of the second calendar month after the month in which: The member requests disenrollment pursuant to subrule 73.4(1). The state notifies the Amerigroup requests disenrollment pursuant to subrule 73.4(3). The member will remain enrolled and Amerigroup will be responsible for services covered under the contract until the effective date of disenrollment, unless the member is in an inpatient setting at the time of disenrollment. If the member is in an inpatient setting at the time of disenrollment, Amerigroup is responsible for the inpatient services for 60 days or until the member is discharged. 154 Time Frame for Disenrollment Determinations Regardless of the procedures followed, the effective date of an approved disenrollment must be no later than the first day of the second month following the month in which the member requests disenrollment or Amerigroup submits the request to the state. If Amerigroup or the state (whichever is responsible) fails to make the determination within the time frames specified in 42 CFR 438.56, the disenrollment is considered approved for the effective date that would have been established h ad the state or Amerigroup complied with the specified time frames. 155 CHAPTER 14: RECONSIDERATIONS, DISPUTES, GRIEVANCES AND APPEALS Reconsiderations, Disputes, Grievances and Appeals Overview We encourage providers and members to seek resolution of issues t hrough our grievances and appeals process. Verbal complaints and written g rievances are tracked and trended, resolved within established time frames and referred to peer review when needed. The Amerigroup grievances and appeals process meets all state of Iowa requirements and federal laws. The member, or member's authorized representative with written consent, has a right to be informed about 1) how to obtain a hearing and the representation rules involved; 2) filing grievances and appeals and the requireme nts and time frames for filing; 3) assistance available with filing grievances and appeals; 4) the toll -free number to file oral grievances and appeals; 5) the right to request continuation of benefits during an appeal or state fair hearing filing although the member may be liable for the costs of any continued benefits if the action is upheld; and 6) any state -determined appeal rights to challenge the failure of the organization to cover a service. The building blocks of this resolution process are the gri evance and the appeal. A grievance is an expression of dissatisfaction about any matter other than an adverse benefit determination as defined below. Examples include but are not limited to: The member is unhappy with the quality of the care. The doctor the member wants to see does not have a contract with us to provide services to the member. The member is not able to receive culturally competent care. The member got a bill from a provider for a service that should be covered by Amerigroup. Rights and/or dignity were not respected. The member is recommending changes in policies and services. Any other access to care issues exist. The term is also used to refer to the overall system of grievances and appeals handled by Amerigroup as well as access to the state fair hearing process. The NCQA classifies grievance requests as stages in the appeal process. The member may file a grievance at any time. An urgent grievance concerns urgent or emergency care services. An appeal is a request for a review of an adverse benefit determination. It is a clear expression by the member, or the member's authorized representative with written consent, following an Amerigroup decision that the member wants the decision reconsidered or reviewed. Examples of an adverse benefit determination or Amerigroup decisions a member may choose to appeal include but are not limited to: Denial or limited authorization of a requested service, including the type and level of service. Reduction, suspension or termination of a previously authorized service. Denial, in whole or in part, of payment for a service. Failure to provide services in a timely manner as defined by the agency. Failure of Amerigroup to act in the required time frames set forth in the contract. For a resid ent of a rural area with only one MCO, the denial of the member's request to obtain services outside the network . The provider or an authorized representative, with the written consent of the member, is able to request an appeal, file a grievance or reque st a state fair hearing on behalf of a member. Members have a right to ask for support in filing a grievance. This includes but is not limited to auxiliary aids and services upon request, such as providing interpreter services and toll -free numbers that ha ve adequate TTY/TDD and interpreter 156 capability. Providers may appeal on a member's behalf related to adverse determinations and nonmedical necessity claims determinations. This can only be done with the member's written consent. If a member has a grievanc e, we would like to hear about the issue either by phone or in writing. Members have the right to file a grievance regarding any aspect of our services. The member or member's authorized representative (including a provider, with the member's written conse nt) can file a grievance or appeal. Member grievances and appeals include but are not limited to: Access to health care services. Care and treatment by a provider. Issues having with how we conduct business. Amerigroup does not discriminate against provid ers for filing a grievance or an appeal on the member's behalf. In addition, providers are prohibited from penalizing a member in any way for expressing a complaint or filing a grievance. Please note: Amerigroup offers an expedited appeal for decisions involving urgently needed care. Standard and expedited appeals are never reviewed by a person who is subordinate to the initial decision -maker. Grievances Members: Filing a Grievance To help ensure Amerigroup members' rights are protected, all members are entitled to a grievances and appeals process. Our goal is to resolve verbal and written grievances in a timely and equitable manner and in accordance with state and federal regulations.

What happened. When the incident happened. Where the incident happened. Why the member was not happy with the health care services.

Amerigroup does not util ize or administer criteria having the effect of discriminatory practices on the basis of gender or gender identity.

Members who contact us with an allegation of discrimination are informed immediately of their right to file a grievance. This also occurs when an Amerigroup representative working with a member identifies a potential act of discrimination. The member is advised to submit a verbal or written account of the incident and is assisted in doing so, if the member requests assistance. We docu ment, track and trend all alleged acts of discrimination. 158 Members are also advised to file a civil rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR): Through the OCR complaint portal at https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/portal/lobby.jsf By mail to: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence Ave. SW, Room 509F, HHH Building, Washington, DC 20201 By phone at: 800-368-1019 available at www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/file/index.html .

Amerigroup may not deny or limit health services that are ordinarily or exclusively available to individuals of one gender, to a transgender individual based on the fact that a different gender was assigned at birth, or because the gender identity or gende r recorded is different from the one in which health services are ordinarily or exclusively available. Payment Disputes Providers: Claim Payment Dispute Process If you disagree with the outcome of a claim, you may begin the Amerigroup provider payment di spute process. The simplest way to define a claim payment dispute is when the claim is finalized , but you disagree with the outcome. There are three common, claim -related issues that are not considered claim payment disputes. To avoid confusion with claim payment disputes, these are briefly defined below. They are: Claim inquiry: A question about a claim but not a request to change a claim payment Claim correspondence: When Amerigroup requests further information to finalize a claim o Typically, these r equests include medical records, itemized bills or information about other insurance a member may have. Medical necessity appeals: A pre -service appeal for a denied service. For these, a claim has not yet been submitted. For more information on each of th ese, please refer to the appropriate section in this provider manual. 159 The Amerigroup payment dispute process consists of two internal steps. You will not be penalized for filing a claim payment dispute, and no action is required by the member. 1. Claim paymen t reconsideration: This is first step in the Amerigroup provider payment dispute process. The reconsideration represents your initial request for an investigation into the outcome of the claim. Most issues are resolved at the claim payment reconsideration step. 2. Claim payment appeal: This is the second step in the Amerigroup provider payment dispute process. If you disagree with the outcome of the reconsideration, you may request an additional review as a claim payment appeal. A claim payment dispute may be submitted for multiple reason(s), including: Contractual payment issues. Disagreements over reduced or zero -paid claims. Post -service authorization issues. Other health insurance denial issues. Claim code -editing issues. Duplicate claim issues. Retro -eligibility issues. Claim data issues. Timely filing issues.* * Amerigroup will consider reimbursement of a claim that has been denied due to failure to meet timely filing if you can: 1) provide documentation the claim was submitted within the timel y filing requirements or 2) demonstrate good cause exists. Claim Payment Reconsideration The first step in the Amerigroup claim payment dispute process is called the reconsideration. It is your initial request to investigate the outcome of a finalized cla im. Please note, we cannot process a reconsideration without a finalized claim on file. We accept reconsideration requests in writing, verbally and through our provider web portal within 1 80 calendar days from the date on the Explanation of Payment (EOP) (see below for further details on how to submit). Re considerations filed more than 1 80 days from the EOP will be considered untimely and denied unless good cause can be established. When submitting reconsiderations, please include as much information as you can to help us understand why you think the claim was not paid as you would expect. If a reconsideration requires clinical expertise, it will be reviewed by appropriate clinical Amerigroup professionals. Amerigroup will make every effort to resolve t he claims payment reconsideration within 30 business days of receipt of all necessary information. If additional information is required to make a determination, the determination date will be 30 business days from the date we receive all information. We will send you our decision in a determination letter, which will include: 1. A statement of the provider's reconsideration request. 2. A statement of what action Amerigroup intends to take or has taken. 3. The reason for the action. 4. Support for the action, includin g applicable statutes, regulations, policies, claims, codes , or provider manual references. 160 5. An explanation of the provider's right to request a claim payment appeal within 30 business days of the date of the reconsideration determination letter. 6. An address to submit the claim payment appeal. If the decision results in a claim adjustment, the payment and EOP will be sent separately. Claim Payment Appeal If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of a reconsideration determination, you may submit a claim payment appeal. We accept claim payment appeals through our provide r website or in writing within 30 business days of the date on the reconside ration dete rmination . Claim paym ent appeals received more than 30 business days after the EOP or the claims reconsideration determination letter will be considered untimely and upheld unless good cause can be established. When submitting a claim payment appeal, please include as much information as you can to help us understand why you think the reconsideration determination was in error. Please note, we cannot process a claim payment appeal without a reconsideration on fil e. If a claim payment appeal requires clinical expertise, it will be reviewed by appropriate clinical Amerigroup professionals. Amerigroup will make every effort to resolve t he claim payment appeal within 30 business days of receipt of all necessary inf ormation. If additional information is required to make a determination, the determination date will be 30 business days from the date we receive all information. The claim payment appeal determination letter will include: 1. A statement of the provider's cla im payment appeal request. 2. A statement of what action Amerigroup intends to take or has taken. 3. The reason for the action. 4. Support for the action including applicable statutes, regulations, policies, claims, codes , or provider manual references. If the dec ision results in a claim adjustment, the payment and EOP will be sent separately.

Claim Correspondence Providers: Claim Correspondence Claim correspondence is different from a payment dispute. Claim correspondence is when Amerigroup requires more information to finalize a claim. Typically, Amerigroup makes the request for this information through the EOP. The claim or part of the claim ma y, in fact, be denied, but it is only because more information is required to process the claim. Once the information is received, Amerigroup will use it to finalize the claim. The following table provides examples of the most common correspondence issues along with guidance on the most efficient way s to resolve them. 162 Type of Issue What Do I Need to Do?

It can mean any of the following: The denial or limited authorization of a requested service, including determinations based on the type or le vel of service, requirements for medical necessity, appropriateness, setting, or effectiveness of a covered benefit The reduction, suspension or termination of a previously authorized service The denial, in whole or in part, of payment for a service The fa ilure to provide services in a timely manner as defined by the state The failure of Amerigroup to act within the time frames in \u00a7 438.408(b) (1) (2) regarding the standard resolution of grievances For a resident of a rural area with only one MCO: the d enial of a member's request to exercise his or her right, under \u00a7 438.52(b) (2) (ii), to obtain services outside the network Amerigroup informs members of their grievance, appeal and state fair hearing rights in the member enrollment materials. If a membe r would like to file an appeal, the member, or member's authorized representative with the member's consent, must notify us within 60 calendar days of the date on the Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination letter. The request for an appeal may be verbal o r written. Provider s may submit appeals on a member's behalf with written consent . When a provider, or provider on member behalf, expresses dissatisfaction about an adverse determination involving a clinical issue, the case is handled automatically as an a ppeal rather than a complaint. All appeals are acknowledged in writing within three business days of receipt. Appeals are divided into two categories: Standard appeal: The appropriate process when a member, or his or her representative with written consen t, requests that Amerigroup reconsider the denial of a service or payment for services, in whole or in part. Iowa's standard appeal process requires resolution within 30 calendar days of receipt of the appeal request or within an additional 14 (44 total) calendar days if the member requests an extension, or if Amerigroup and the HHS determine it's in the best interest of the member to extend the decision time frame. Expedited appeals: An appeal when the amount of time necessary to complete a standard appeal process could jeopardize the member's life, health or the ability to maintain or regain maximum function. Iowa's expedited appeal process requires resolution within 72 hours of receipt of the expedited appeal request . Members have the right to appeal an Amerigroup denial of services or payment for services, in whole or in part. A denial of this type is called an adverse benefit determination. A member, or his or her representative with written consent, may submit a verbal or w ritten appeal regarding an adverse benefit determination within 60 calendar days from receipt of the denial letter. Amerigroup provides the member and their representative the opportunity, before and during the appeals process, to examine the member's ca se file, including medical records and any other documents or records considered during the appeals process. Providers and members are notified in writing of their right for an appeal, if any. Findings or decisions of peer review or quality of care issues are not disclosed. Upon determination of the appeal, Amerigroup ensures there is no delay in notification or mailing to the member (and if applicable, the member's representative) about the appeal decision. The appeal decision notice shall describe the act ions taken, the reasons for the action, the member's right to request a state fair hearing and the process for filing a state fair hearing request. 165 A first-level review is the appeal process that must be exhausted through Amerigroup before a state fair hearing is granted. Once the first -level review process is complete, a notice of decision will be issued by us and will identify further appeal rights, if applicable. Providers cannot file an appeal on their own behalf . Appeals Members: Time Frames Members and authorized representatives have 60 calendar days to file an appeal from the date of the Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination letter. All appeals are acknowledged in writing within three business days of receipt. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, Amerigroup will send an acknowledgment of receipt of the appeal to the member, member's representative or both. We'll keep a copy of the acknowledgment of receipt of appeal on file. Appeal decisions must be in writing and resolved within the fol lowing time frames: Pre-service and post -service appeals: within 30 calendar days of receipt of the appeal request Expedited appeals: within 72 hours of receipt of the appeal request Amerigroup complies with NCQA, state and federal standards. Appeals Members: Response to Standard Appeals After Amerigroup receives a verbal or written appeal request, the Grievances and Appeals department takes the issue into consideration and investigates the case. The member, his or her representative and the provider a re given the opportunity to submit written comments and documentation relevant to the appeal. Amerigroup may request medical records or a provider explanation of the issues raised in the appeal by phone or by fax or mail, with a signed and dated letter. Providers are expected to comply with the request for additional information within 10 days. When the appeal is the result of a medical necessity determination, a physician reviewer of the same or similar specialty who was not involved in the initial decis ion and has experience treating the condition being appealed reviews the case. The physician reviewer contacts the provider, if needed, to discuss possible alternatives. Appeals Members: Resolution of Standard Appeals Standard appeals are resolved within 30 calendar days of receipt of the initial written or verbal request. Members are notified in writing of the appeal resolution, including their right to further appeal, if any. Appeals Members: Extensions The resolution time frame for an appeal not related to an ongoing hospitalization or emergency may be extended up to 14 calendar days if: The member or his or her representative requests an extension. Amerigroup shows that there is a need for additional information and that the delay is in the membe r's interest. 166 If we extend the time frame and it was not at the request of the member, we must notify the member/representative in writing of the extension and reason for the delay and must complete all of the following: Make reasonable efforts to give t he member prompt oral notice of the delay . Within two calendar days, give the member written notice of the reason for the decision to extend the time frame and inform the member of the right to file a grievance if he or she disagrees with that decision. Resolve the appeal as expeditiously as the e nrollee's health condition requires and no later than the date the extension expires. Appeals Members: Expedited If the amount of time necessary to participate in a standard appeal process could jeopardize the member's life, health or ability to attain, m aintain or regain maximum function, the member may request an expedited appeal. Amerigroup will inform the member of the limited time frame available for providing information, as well as that the duration for submitting an expedited appeal is limited. When an expedited appeal is requested, Amerigroup will inform the member and member's authorized representative of the limited time available to present evidence and allegations of fact or law. Amerigroup ensures that punitive action is not taken against a p rovider who either requests an expedited resolution or supports a member's appeal. Appeals Members: Timeline for Expedited Appeals Members have the right to request an expedited appeal within 60 calendar days of receipt of the denial letter. Expedited appe als are acknowledged by phone and in writing. If Amerigroup denies a request for an expedited appeal, we must: Transfer the appeal to the time frame for standard resolution, which is 30 calendar days. Make a reasonable effort to give the member prompt verbal notice of the denial and follow up within two days with written notice. Appeals Members: Response to Expedited Appeals Amerigroup may request medical records or a provider explanation of the issues raised in an expedited appeal by phone or b y fax or mail, with a signed and dated letter. Providers are expected to comply with the request for additional information within 24 hours. Appeals Members: Resolution of Expedited Appeals Amerigroup resolves expedited appeals as quickly as possible and within 72 hours of the request. The member is notified by phone, whenever possible, as well as in writing within two days of the expedited appeal decision. Appeals Members: State Fair Hearing Members, or the member's representative with writt en consent, may request a state fair hearing after they have exhausted our internal appeal process. The request must be filed within 120 calendar days of the resolution letter. 167 Members, or the member's representative with written consent, may appeal in pe rson, by phone or in writing. To appeal in writing, they may complete an appeal electronically at http://dhs.iowa.gov/node/966 or write a letter telling HHS why they disagree wi th our appeal resolution. If the member does not want to complete the form online, he or she may mail, fax or take the appeal letter to: Appeals Section Department of Health and Human Services 1305 E. Walnut St., 5th Floor Des Moines, IA 50319 Fax: 515-564-4044 Members (or the member's representative) may also appeal by phone by calling the HHS Appeals Section at 515-281-3094 . The process is as follows: The state sends a notice of the hearing request to Amerigroup. Upon receipt of the request, we forward all documents related to the request to the state. The state of Iowa schedules a hearing, which is held by teleconference, unless the member requested an in -person hearing. The state notifies all parties of the date, time and place of t he hearing. Representatives from our administrative, medical and legal departments may attend the hearing to present testimony and arguments. Our representatives may cross -examine witness and offer rebutting evidence. An Administrative Law Judge renders a decision in the hearing. If any party disagrees with the judge's decision, they can request a Director's review and a decision will be rendered after the review is complete. If our position is overturned, we must adhere to the final decision and ensure th e decision is carried out. Please note: If the member needs special arrangements to attend the hearing due to a disability or needs language translation services, please call 515-281-8774 . Appeals Confidentiality All appeals are handled in a confidential manner. We do not discriminate against a member, their representative or provider appealing on a member's behalf with written consent for requesting a state fair hearing. We notify members of our appeals process in the Member Handbook; members may request a translated version in languages other than English. Appeals Continuation of Benefits during Appeal Members must file a request within 10 days of receiving a Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination letter from Amerigroup regarding a decision to reduce, limit, terminate or suspend benefits. We will tell the member that they may be liable for the costs of that care if the HHS upholds our decision. If the member requests that we continue coverage, the following conditions apply: If the HHS reverses our deci sion, we are responsible for covering services provided during the state fair hearing process. If the HHS upholds our decision, we may pursue reimbursement for all services provided to the member, to the extent that services were rendered solely because of this requirement. 168 Members can continue receiving covered services while their appeal or the state fair hearing process is pending if all of the following apply: An appeal is filed timely ( in other words, on or before the effective date of the adverse benefit determination or within 10 calendar days of the date Amerigroup sent the notice of adverse benefit determination). The date the notice is received is considered to be five days after the date on the notice unless the member shows he or she did not receive the notice within the five -day period. The appeal or state fair hearing request is filed either: o Within 10 calendar days from the date we mailed the Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination letter . o Befo re the effective date of this notice. The services were ordered by an authorized provider. The authorization period for the services has not ended. The member asks that the service continues. If a member's benefits are continued while an appeal or state f air hearing request is pending, the services must be continued until one of the following happens: The member decides not to continue the appeal or state fair hearing. The member does not request a state fair hearing within 10 days of the level 1 decision. The authorization for services expires or service authorization limits are met. A hearing decision is issued in the state fair hearing that is adverse to the member. 169 CHAPTER 15: CREDENTIALING AND RECREDENTIALING Credentialing is the process of validating the professional competency and conduct of providers and health delivery organizations. Providers and health delivery organizations must meet rigorous credentialing standards to b e part of the Amerigroup provider network. The credentialing process involves verifying licensure, board certification and education. The process also involves identifying malpractice or negligence claims through the applicable Iowa state agencies and the National Practitioner Database. We require recredentialing every three years to stay current with your professional information. Recredentialing is also essential to our members, who depend on the accuracy of the information in the Amerigroup Provider Dir ectory. The Amerigroup Provider Directory includes information for these provider types: Physicians (including specialists) Hospitals Pharmacies Behavioral health providers LTSS providers as appropriate Hard copies of the provider directories are updated at least monthly. Electronic provider directories are updated no later than 30 calendar days after Amerigroup receives updated provider information. Provider directories are posted on the Amerigroup website in a machine -readable file and format. We streamlined the credentialing process by teaming up with the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare (CAQH), which is nationally recognized for its thoroughness in collecting provider data. It is the medical director's or other designated physician's responsibility to participate in the credentialing program. Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare Amerigroup encourages Iowa providers to use CAQH's ProView for initial credentialing and periodic recredentialing. CAQH is a not -for-profit alliance of the nation's leading health care plans and networks whose mission is to improve health care quality and access for more than 165 million Americans covered by thes e plans. The CAQH data collection system of 800,000 providers allows administrative requirements to be streamlined. CAQH's ProView meets industry standard s for collecting the provider data used in credentialing. Providers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are able to enter information free of charge, reducing paperwork for more than 550 participating health care plans. ProView allows providers to fill out one application to 170 meet the credentialing data needs of multiple organizations. For both Amerigroup and providers, recredentialing through ProView is helpful because this process: Supports Amerigroup administrative streamlining and paper reduction efforts. Helps to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the provider database. Simplifies the crede ntialing application process, eliminating redundant application forms and streamlining paperwork for providers. Enables providers to utilize CAQH's database at no cost. Our credentialing process for office -based providers is consistent with National Commit tee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) guidelines and the state of Iowa requirements to practice medicine. Practitioners are notified within 60 calendar days of the credentialing committee's decision.

A committee member will disclose and abstain from voting on a practitioner if the committee member (i) believes there is a conflict of interest, such as direct economic competition with the practitioner; or (ii) feels his or her judgment might otherwise be compromised. A committee member will also disclose if he or she has been professionally involved with the practitioner. Determinations to deny an applicant's participation or terminate a practitioner from participation in one or more Networks or Plan programs, require a majority vote of the voting members of the CC in attendance, the majority of whom are network practitioners. During the credentialing process, all information that is obtained is confidential and not subject to r eview by third parties except to the extent permitted by law. Access to information will be restricted to those individuals who are deemed necessary to attain the objectives of the Credentialing Program. Specifically, information supplied by the practition er or HDO in the application, as well as other non -publicly available information will be treated as confidential. Confidential written records regarding deficiencies found, the actions taken, and the recommended follow -up will be kept in a secure fashion. Security mechanisms include secured office facilities and locked filing cabinets, a protected computer infrastructure with password controls and systematic monitoring, and staff ethics and compliance training programs. The procedures and minutes of the CC will be open to review by state and federal regulatory agencies and accrediting bodies to the extent permitted by law. Practitioners and HDOs are notified of their right to review information submitted to support their credentialing applications. In the event that credentialing information cannot be verified, or if there is a discrepancy in the credentialing information obtained, Amerigroup's credentialing staff (\"Credentialing Department\") will contact the practitioner or HDO within 30 calendar days of t he identification of the issue. This communication will notify the practitioner or HDO of their right to correct erroneous information or provide additional details regarding the issue and will include the process for submission of this additional informat ion. Depending on the nature of the issue, this communication may occur verbally or in writing. If the communication is verbal, written confirmation will be sent at a later date. All communication on the issue, including copies of the correspondence or a d etailed record of phone calls, will be documented in the practitioner's or HDO's credentials file. The practitioner or HDO will be given no less than 14 calendar days in 177 which to provide additional information. Upon request, the practitioner or HDO will be provided with the status of their credentialing or re -credentialing application. Amerigroup may request and will accept additional information from the applicant to correct or explain incomplete, inaccurate, or conflicting credentialing information. The CC will review the information and rationale presented by the applicant to determine if a material omission has occurred or if other credentialing criteria are met. Nondiscrimination Policy Amerigroup will not discriminate against any applicant for participation in its Plan programs or provider Networks on the basis of race, gender, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, age, veteran, or marital status or any u nlawful basis not specifically mentioned herein. Additionally, Amerigroup will not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of the risk of population they serve or against those who specialize in the treatment of costly conditions. Other than gender and language capabilities which are provided to the Members to meet their needs and preferences, this information is not required in the credentialing and re -credentialing process. Determinations as to which practitioners and providers require additional individual review by the CC are made according to predetermined criteria related to professional conduct and competence. The CC decisions are based on issues of professional conduct and competence as reported and verified through the credentialing process. Amerigroup will audit credentialing files annually to identify discriminatory practices, if any, in the selection of practitioners. In the event discriminatory practices are identified through an audit or through other means, Amerigroup will take appropri ate action to track and eliminate those practices. Initial Credentialing Each practitioner or HDO must complete a standard application form deemed acceptable by Amerigroup when applying for initial participation in one or more of Amerigroup's networks or plan programs. For practitioners, the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare (CAQH) ProView system is utilized. To learn more about CAQH, visit their web site at www.CAQH.org . Amerigroup will verify those elements related to an applicants' legal authority to practice, relevant training, experience and competency from the primary source, where applicable, during the credentialing process. All verifications must be current a nd verified within the 180 -calendar day period prior to the CC making its credentialing recommendation or as otherwise required by applicable accreditation standards. During the credentialing process, Amerigroup will review, among other things, verificati on of the credentialing data as described in the following tables unless otherwise required by regulatory or accrediting bodies. These tables represent minimum requirements. A. Practitioners Verification Element License to practice in the state(s) in whi ch the practitioner will be treating Members. Hospital admitting privileges at a TJC, NIAHO, CIHQ or HFAP accredited hospital, or a Network hospital previously approved by the committee. DEA/CDS and state -controlled substance registrations The DEA/CDS registration must be valid in the state(s) in which practitioner will be treating Members. Practitioners who see Members in more than one state must have a DEA/CDS registration for each state. Malpractice insurance Malpractice claims history Board certification or highest level of medical training or education 178 Verification Element Work history State or Federal license sanctions or limitations Medicare, Medicaid or FEHBP sanctions National Practitioner Data Bank report State Medicaid Exclusion Listing, if applicable B. HDOs Verification Element Accreditation, if applicable License to practice, if applicable Malpractice insurance Medicare certification, if applicable Department of Health Survey Results or recognized accrediting organization certification License sanctions or limitations, if applicable Medicare, Medicaid or FEHBP sanctions Re-credentialing The re -credentialing process incorporates re -verification and the identification of changes in the practitioner's or HDO's licensure, sanctions, certification, health status and/or performance information (including, but not limited to, malpractice experie nce, hospital privilege or other actions) that may reflect on the practitioner's or HDO's professional conduct and competence. This information is reviewed in order to assess whether practitioners and HDOs continue to meet Amerigroup credentialing standard s (\"Credentialing Standards\"). All applicable practitioners and HDOs in the Network within the scope of the Credentialing Program are required to be re -credentialed every three years unless otherwise required by applicable state contract or state regulati ons. Health Delivery Organizations New HDO applicants will submit a standardized application to Amerigroup for review. If the candidate meets Amerigroup screening criteria, the credentialing process will commence. To assess whether Network HDOs, within th e scope of the Credentialing Program, meet appropriate standards of professional conduct and competence, they are subject to credentialing and re -credentialing programs. In addition to the licensure and other eligibility criteria for HDOs, as described in detail below, in the \"Amerigroup Credentialing Program Standards\" section, all Network HDOs are required to maintain accreditation by an appropriate, recognized accrediting body or, in the absence of such accreditation, Amerigroup may evaluate the most recent site survey by Medicare, the appropriate state oversight agency, or a site survey performed by a designated independent external entity within the past 36 months for that HDO. Ongoing Sanction Monitoring To support certain Credentialing Standards between the re -credentialing cycles, Amerigroup has established an ongoing monitoring program. The Credentialing Department performs ongoing monitoring to help ensure continued compliance with Credentialing Standards and to assess for occurrences that may reflect issues of substandard professional conduct and competence. To achieve this, the Credentialing Department will review periodic listings/reports within 30 calendar days of the time they are made available from the various sources including, but not limited to, the following: Office of the Inspector General (\"OIG\") Federal Medicare/Medicaid Reports 179 Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\") State licensing Boards/Agencies Member/Customer services departments Clinical Quality Management Department (including data regarding complaints of both a clinical and non-clinical nature, reports of adverse clinical events and outcomes, and satisfaction data, as available) Other internal Amerigroup departments Any other information received from sources deemed reliable by Amerigroup. When a practitioner or HDO within the scope of credentialing has been identified by these sources, criteria will be used to assess the appropriate response. Appeals Process Amerigroup has established policies for monitoring and re-credentialing practitioners and HDOs who seek continued participation in one or more of Amerigroup's Networks or Plan Programs. Information reviewed during this activity may indicate that the professional conduct and competence standards are no longer being met, and Amerigroup may wish to terminate practitioners or HDOs. Amerigroup also seeks to treat network practitioners and HDOs, as well as those applying for participation, fairly and thus provides practitioners and HDOs with a process to appeal deter minations terminating/denying participation in Amerigroup's Networks for professional conduct and competence reasons, or which would otherwise result in a report to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). Additionally, Amerigroup will permit practiti oners and HDOs who have been refused initial participation the opportunity to correct any errors or omissions which may have led to such denial (informal/reconsideration only). It is Amerigroup's intent to give practitioners and HDOs the opportunity to con test a termination of the practitioner's or HDO's participation in one or more of Amerigroup's Networks or Plan Programs and those denials of request for initial participation which are reported to the NPDB that were based on professional conduct and compe tence considerations. Immediate terminations may be imposed due to the practitioner's or HDO's license suspension, probation or revocation, if a practitioner or HDO has been sanctioned, debarred or excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid or FEHB programs , has a criminal conviction, or Amerigroup's determination that the practitioner's or HDO's continued participation poses an imminent risk of harm to Members. Participating practitioners and HDOs whose network participation has been terminated due to the prac titioner's suspension or loss of licensure or due to criminal conviction are not eligible for informal review/reconsideration or formal appeal. Participating practitioners and HDOs whose network participation has been terminated due to sanction, debarment or exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid or FEHB are not eligible for informal review/reconsideration or formal appeal. Reporting Requirements When Amerigroup takes a professional review action with respect to a practitioner's or HDO's participation in on e or more of its Networks or Plan programs, Amerigroup may have an obligation to report such to the NPDB, state licensing board and legally designated agencies. In the event that the procedures set forth for reporting reportable adverse actions conflict wi th the process set forth in the current NPDB Guidebook, the process set forth in the NPDB Guidebook will govern. Amerigroup Credentialing Program Standards Eligibility Criteria A. Health care practitioners: 180 Initial applicants must meet the following criteria in order to be considered for participation: 1. 2. Must not be currently federally sanctioned, debarred or excluded from participation in any of the following programs: Medicare, Medicaid or FEHBP; 3.

Possess a current, valid, and unrestricted Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and/or Controlled Dangerous Substances (CDS) registrati on for prescribing controlled substances, if applicable to his/her specialty in which he or she will treat Members. The DEA/CDS registration must be valid in the state(s) in which the practitioner will be treating Members. Practitioners who see Members in more than one state must have a DEA/CDS registration for each state; and 5. Meet the education, training and certification criteria as required by Amerigroup. Initial applications should meet the following criteria in order to be considered for participatio n, with exceptions reviewed and approved by the CC: 1. For MDs, DOs, DPMs, and DMDs/DDSs practicing oral and maxillofacial surgery, the applicant must have current, in force board certification (as defined by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), American Osteopathic Association (AOA), Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC), College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC), American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery (ABFAS), American Board of Podiatric Medicine (\"ABPM\"), or American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (ABOMS) in the clinical discipline for which they are applying. 2. If not certified, MDs and DOs will be granted five years or a period of time consistent with ABMS or AOA board eligibility time limits, whatever is gre ater, after completion of their residency or fellowship training program to meet the board certification requirement. 3. If not certified, DPMs will be granted five years after the completion of their residency to meet this requirement for the ABPM. Non -certified DPMs will be granted seven years after completion of their residency to meet this requirement for ABFAS. 4. Individuals no longer eligible for board certification are not eligible for continued exception to this requirement. a. As alternatives, M Ds and DOs meeting any one of the following criteria will be viewed as meeting the education, training and certification requirement: i. Previous board certification (as defined by one) of following: ABMS, AOA, RCPSC, CFPC, clinical specialty or subspecialty for which they are applying which has now expired and a minimum of 10 consecutive years of clinical practice; ii. Training which met the requirements in place at the time it was completed in a specialty field prior to the ava ilability of board certifications in that clinical specialty or subspecialty; or iii. Specialized practice expertise as evidenced by publication in nationally accepted peer review literature and/or recognized as a leader in the science of their specialty and a faculty appointment of assistant professor or higher at an academic medical center and teaching facility in Amerigroup's network and the applicant's professional activities are spent at that institution at least fifty percent (50%) of the time. b. Practition ers meeting one of these three alternative criteria (i., ii., iii.) will be viewed as meeting all Amerigroup education, training and certification criteria and will not be required to undergo additional review or individual presentation to the CC. These al ternatives are subject to Amerigroup review and approval. Reports submitted by delegates to Amerigroup must contain sufficient documentation to support the above alternatives, as determined by Amerigroup. 181 5.

Some clinical disciplines may function exclusively in the outpatient setting, and the CC may at its discretion deem hospital privileges not relevant to these specialties. Also, the organization of an increasing number of physician practice settings in selected fields is such that individual physicians may practice solely in either an outpatient or an inpatient setting. The CC will evaluate applications from practitioners in such practices without r egard to hospital privileges. The expectation of these physicians would be that there is an appropriate referral arrangement with a Network practitioner to provide inpatient care. 6. For Genetic Counselors, the applicant must be licensed by the state to prac tice independently. If the state where the applicant practices does not license Genetic Counselors, the applicant must be certified by the American Board of Genetic Counseling or the American Board of Genetics and Genomics.

If the alternate provider is a practice rather than an individual, the file may include the practice name. The Company is not required to arrange an alternative prescriber; and c. DEA/CDS registration is o r was not suspended, revoked, surrendered or encumbered for reasons other than those aforementioned. 11. No current hospital membership or privilege restrictions and no history of hospital membership or privileges restrictions; or for Practitioners in specialties defined as requiring hospital privileges who practice solely in the outpatient setting, there exi sts a defined referral arrangement with a participating Practitioner of similar specialty at a participating hospital who provides inpatient care to members requiring hospitalization. 12.

The license status must be that of PA as v erified via primary source from the appropriate state licensing agency. Additionally, this license must be active, unencumbered, unrestricted and not subject to probation, terms or conditions. Any applicants whose licensure status does not meet these crite ria, or who have in force adverse actions regarding Medicare or Medicaid will be notified of this and the applicant will be administratively denied. d. If the PA has prescriptive authority, which allows the prescription of scheduled drugs, their DEA and/or st ate certificate of prescriptive authority information will be requested and primary source verified via normal Amerigroup procedures. If there are in force adverse actions against the DEA, the applicant will be notified and the applicant will be administra tively denied. e. All PA applicants will be certified by the National Commission on Certification of Physician's Assistants. This certification must be active and primary source verified. If the state licensing board primary sources verifies this certificatio n as a requirement for licensure, additional verification by Amerigroup is not required. If the applicant is not certified or if their certification has expired, the application will be classified as a Level II according to Credentialing Policy #8, as 188 adop ted or amended by each Amerigroup Health Plan and submitted for individual review by the CC. f. If the PA has hospital privileges, they must have hospital privileges at a CIHQ, TJC, NIAHO, or HFAP accredited hospital, or a network hospital previously approved by the committee. Information regarding history of any actions taken against any hospital privileges held by the PA will be obtained. Any adverse action against any hospital privileges will trigger a level II review. g. The PA applicant will undergo the stan dard credentialing process outlined in Amerigroup's Credentialing Policies. PAs are subject to all the requirements described in these Credentialing Policies including (but not limited to): committee review of Level II files failing to meet predetermined c riteria, re -credentialing every three years, and continuous sanction and performance monitoring upon participation in the network. h. Upon completion of the credentialing process, the PA may be listed in Amerigroup provider directories. As with all providers, this listing will accurately reflect their specific licensure designation and these providers will be subject to the audit process. i. PA's will be clearly identified: iv. On the credentialing file; v. At presentation to the CC; and vi. Upon notification to network se rvices and to the provider database. Currently Participating Applicants (Re -credentialing) 1. Submission of complete re -credentialing application and required attachments that must not contain intentional misrepresentations; 2. Re-credentialing application signed date 180 calendar days of the date of submission to the CC for a vote; 3.

If a HDO has satellite facilities that follow the same policy and procedures, Amerigroup may limit site visits to the main facility. Non -accredited HDOs are subject to indivi dual review by the CC and will be considered for Member access need only when the CC review indicates compliance with Amerigroup standards and there are no deficiencies noted on the Medicare or state oversight review which would adversely affect quality or care or patient safety. HDOs are re -credentialed at least every three years to assess the HDO's continued compliance with Amerigroup standards. 1. General Criteria for HDOs : a. Valid, current and unrestricted license to operate in the state(s) in which it will provide services to Members. The license must be in good standing with no sanctions. b. Valid and current Medicare certification. c. Must not be currently federally sanctioned, debarred or exc luded from participation in any of the following programs; Medicare, Medicaid or the FEHBP.

Following guidelines set by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ), these standards help ensure that medical appointments, emergency services and continuity of care for new and transferring members are provided fairly, reasonably and within specific time frames. We reco gnize that cultural and linguistic barriers may affect our members' ability to understand or comply with certain instructions or procedures. To break through those barriers and ensure that our access standards can be met, we encourage providers to access t he Amerigroup Cultural Competency Training and Cultural and Linguistic Toolkit called Caring for Diverse Populations . Locate this information on our website at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia under Provider Resources & Documents > Training. Or for additional information on cultural diversity and interpreter services, please refer to Chapter 2 4: Cultural Diversity and Linguistic Services in this manual . Amerigroup moni tors provider compliance with access to care standards on a regular basis. Failure to comply may result in corrective action. Access Standards and Access to Care General Appointment Scheduling Urgent, nonemergency: The existence of conditions due to an illness or injury which are not life threatening but which require expeditious treatment because of the prospect of the condition worsening without clinical intervention.

These hours of operation must not discriminate against Amerigroup members enrolled in IA Health Link. The statement must include the following: Waiting times for appointments Waiting times for care at facilities Languages spoken Access Standards and Access to Care Americans with Disabilities Act Providers must comply with all applicable feder al and state laws in assuring accessibility to all services for members with disabilities, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, maintaining the capacity to deliver services in a manner that accommodates the needs of its members. Providers contracted with Amerigroup are required by law to provide disabled persons full and equal access to medical services. Although a review of the requirements of the law and implementing regulations can be daunting, provi ding full and equal access to persons with disabilities can be achieved by: Removing physical barriers. Providing means for effective communication with people who have vision, hearing or speech disabilities, including providing auxiliary aids as needed. Providing flexibility in scheduling to accommodate people with disabilities. Allowing extra time for members with disabilities to dress and undress, transfer to examination tables, and extra time with the provider in order to ensure the individual is fully participating and understands the information. Making reasonable modifications to policies, practices and procedures. For more information on making changes to a practice to ensure ADA compliance, providers can refer to these additional resources: https://www.ada.gov https://www.ada.gov/medcare_mobility_ta/medcare_ta.htm Access Standards and Access to Care Interpreter Services Amerigroup will ensure that members who need interpreter services have access to interpreters 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Services include, but are not limited to, face -to-face assistance during office visits at no cost to you or the member. Providers should strongly discourage the use of minors, friends and family members acting as interpreters. Request telephonic interpreters for members needing language assistance as outlined below: During business hours: Providers call Provider Services at 800-454-3730 Members call Member Services at 800-600-4441 After -hours, providers and members can call Amerigroup at: 866-864-2544 (English) Phone: 866-864-2545 (Spanish) TTY: 711 194 Hours: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year Request face -to-face interpreters for members needing language assistance, including Am erican Sign Language as outlined below.

Document th e missed appointment in the member's medical record. 2. Make at least three attempts to contact the member to determine the reason for the missed appointment. 3. Provide a reason in the member's medical record for any delays in performing an examination, including refusals by the member. Access Standards and Access to Care After -Hours Services Amerigroup policy, and the state of Iowa's requirement, is for our members to have access to quality health care services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week . This kind of access means PCPs must have a system in place to ensure members may call after -hours with medical questions or concerns. Amerigroup monitors PCP compliance with after -hours access standards on a regular basis. Failure to comply may result in corrective action. PCPs must adhere to the answering service and answering machine protocols defined in the following sections. Answering Service Answering service or after -hours personnel must: Forward member calls directly to the PCP or an on -call pro vider, or instruct the member that the provider will contact the member within 30 minutes. Ask the member if the call is an emergency. In the event of an emergency, immediately direct the member to dial 911 or proceed to the nearest hospital emergency room . Have the ability to contact a telephone interpreter for members with language barriers. Return all calls. Answering machine messages: May be used when provider office staff or an answering service is not immediately available. Must instruct members with emergency health care needs to dial 911 or proceed to the nearest hospital emergency room. Must provide instructions on how to contact the PCP or an on -call provider in a nonemergency situation. Must provide instructions in English, Spanish and any other language appropriate to the PCP's practice. 195 We offer the following suggested language for answering machines: Hello, you've reached [insert physician office name]. If this is an emergency, hang up and dial 911 or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. If this is not an emergency and you have a medical concern or question, please call [insert contact phone or pager number]. You will receive a return call from the on -call physician within [time frame]. Please note: Amerigroup prefers that PCPs use an in -network provider for on -call services. When this is not possible, PCPs must use their best efforts to ensure the covering on -call provider abides by the terms of the Provider Agreement. Access Standards and Access to Care Amerigroup on Cal l Members may call Amerigroup on Call, our 24/7 information phone line, any time of the day or night, to speak to a registered nurse. Nurses provide health information and options for any of the following: Authorization requests Emergency instructions Health concerns Local health care services Medical conditions Prescription drugs Transportation needs Access to interpreter services Phone: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year Access Standards and Access to Care Continuity of Care Amerigroup provides continuity of care for members with qualifying conditions when health care services are not available within the network or when the member or provider is in a state of transition. A qualifying condition is defined as a medical condition that may qualify a member for continued access to care and continuity of care. Qualifying conditions include, but are not limited to the following: Acute conditions (for example, cancer) Degenerative and disabling conditions or diseases caused by a congenital or acquired injury or illness requiring a specialized rehabilitation program or a high level of service, resources or coordination of care in the community Newborns, who are covered retroactively to the date of birth Organ transplant or tissue replacement Pregnancy, with 12 weeks or less remaining before the expected delivery date, through immediate postpartum care Scheduled inpatient/outpatient surgery that was approv ed and/or precertified through the applicable HHS process Serious chronic conditions (hemophilia, for example) Terminal illness 196 States of transition may be when the member is any of the following: Newly enrolled Moving out of the service area Disenrolling from Amerigroup to another health plan Exiting Amerigroup to receive excluded services Hospitalized on the effective date of transition Transitioning through behavioral health services Scheduled for appointments within the first month of plan membership w ith specialists. These appointments must have been scheduled prior to the effective date of membership. A state of transition also is applicable when the provider's contract terminates. Amerigroup providers help ensure continuity and coordination of care through collaboration. This includes the confidential exchange of information between PCPs and specialists as well as behavioral health providers. In addition, Amerigroup coordinates care when the provider's contract has been discontinued to facilitate a smooth transition to a new provider. Providers must maintain accurate and timely documentation in the member's medical record including but not limited to the following: Consultations Precertification Referrals to specialists Treatment plans All providers share responsibility in communicating clinical findings, treatment plans, prognosis and the member's psychosocial condition as part of the coordination of care process. Medical Management nurses review member and provider requests for continu ity of care. These nurses facilitate continuation with the current provider until a short -term regimen of care is completed or the member transitions to a new provider. Please note: Only Amerigroup can make adverse determination decisions regarding contin uity of care. Adverse determination decisions are sent in writing to the member and provider within two business days of the decision. Members, and providers with the member's written consent, may appeal the decision by following the procedures in the Grievances and Appeals chapter . Reasons for continuity of care denials include, but are not limited to the following: Course of treatment is complete Member is ineligible for coverage Condition is not a qualifying condition Request is for change of PCP only and not for continued access to care Requested services are not covered Services rendered are covered under a global fee Treating provider currently is contracted with our network Please note: Amerigroup does not impose any pre -existing condition limitations on its Medicaid members, nor require evidence of insurability to provide coverage to any of our members. 197 Access Standards and Access to Care Provider Contract Termination Amerigroup will arrange for continuity of care for members affected by a provider whose contract is terminated. A terminated provider actively treating members must continue to treat members until the date of termination. PCPs must give at leas t 90 days advance notice and specialists must give at least 120 days advance notice before terminating the Provider Agreement. The exception is when the PCP or primary care clinic (PCC) provides 30 percent or more of Amerigroup services, in which case the PCP or PCC must give at least 120 days advance notice. HCBS providers must provide at least 30 days advance notice to Amerigroup when they are no longer willing or able to provide services to a member, and to cooperate with the member's care coordinator to facilitate a seamless transition to alternate providers. After Amerigroup receives a provider's notice to terminate a contract, we notify all impacted members. We send a letter at least 15 days in advance to inform the affected members about the: Impendi ng termination of their provider. Member's right to request continued access to care. Member Services phone number to make PCP changes and/or forward referrals to Medical Management for continued access to care consideration. Members under the care of specialists may also submit requests for continued access to care, including continued care after the tr ansition period. HCBS providers must continue to provide services to the member in accordance with the member's plan of care and as directed by Amerigroup, until the member has been transitioned to a new provider; this transition may exceed 30 days from th e date of notice to us. Members should contact Member Services at 800-600-4441. Access Standards and Access to Care Newly Enrolled Our goal is to ensure that the health care of our newly enrolled members is not disrupted or interrupted. Amerigroup ensures continuity of care for our newly enrolled members when the member's health or behavioral health condition has been treated by specialists. We also ensure continuity of care when the member's health could be placed in jeopardy if medically necessary covere d services are disrupted or interrupted. Amerigroup will pay a newly enrolled member's existing out -of-network provider for medically necessary covered services until that regimen of care is completed. The member's records, clinical information and care are transferred to an Amerigroup provider. Payment to out -of-network providers is made within the same time period required for providers within the network. In addition, we comply with out -of-network provider reimbursement rules as adopted by the HHS. However, we are not obligated to reimburse the member's existing out -of-network providers for on -going care if the time elapsed has been greater than: 90 days after the member enrolls in Amerigroup . Nine months after the member enrolls in Amerigroup, if the member was diagnosed with a terminal illness at the time of enrollment in our plan and has been receiving ongoing treatment for the illness. All new enrollees receive evidence of coverage (EOC) membership information in their enrollment packets, whic h provides information regarding members' rights to request continuity of care. 198 Access Standards and Access to Care Second Opinions Amerigroup will help to ensure that members have access to a second opinion regarding any medically necessary covered servic e. When the request involves care from a specialist, a provider of the same specialty must give the second opinion. When no provider exists within the network who meets the qualification, Amerigroup may authorize a second opinion by a qualified out -of-netw ork provider. This service is provided at no cost to the member. Access Standards and Access to Care Emergency Transportation Amerigroup covers emergency transportation services without precertification. When a member's condition is life -threatening and r equires use of special equipment, life support systems and close monitoring by trained attendants while en route to the nearest appropriate facility, we will provide emergency transport by ambulance. Supporting medical documentation may be requested prior to reimbursement. Examples of conditions considered for emergency transport include but are not limited to the following: Acute and severe illnesses Acute or severe injuries from auto accidents Extensive burns Loss of consciousness Semi -consciousness, seizure, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) treatment during transport Untreated fractures Emergency transportation is also available for facility -to-facility transfers when the required emergency treatment is not available at the first facility. Access Standards and Access to Care Emergency Dental Services for Adults and Children When a member has a dental emergency resulting in swelling, fever, infection or injury to the jaw, natural teeth, mouth or face, Amerigroup covers the in itial dental work and oral surgery, including anesthesia and drugs, for services provided in the following settings: outpatient, doctor's office, emergency care and urgent care. The services are limited to the care needed to give proper treatment. Injury as a result of chewing or biting is not considered an accidental injury. Initial dental work refers to services provided within 48 hours of the injury, or as soon as possible. Covered services include all exams and treatment to complete the repair, such as: Anesthesia Lab tests Mandibular/maxillary reconstruction Oral exams Oral surgery Prosthetic services Restorations X-rays 199 Access Standards and Access to Care Border City Providers Some cities outside of the state of Iowa but within 50 miles of the Iowa border are designated as \"Border Cities.\" Eligible providers practicing outside of Iowa but within a border city -designated area may enroll with Amerigroup for the provision of servic es to IA Health Link members. Such enrollment will not require Iowa licensure but the provider must meet the licensing requirements of the state in which they are providing the services and obtain an Iowa Medicaid identification number. 200 CHAPTER 17: PROVIDER ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES Provider Roles and Responsibilities Overview At Amerigroup, our goal is to provide quality health care to the right member, at the right time and in the appropriate setting. To achieve this goal , PCPs, specialists and ancillary providers must fulfill their roles and responsibilities with the highest integrity. We rely on your extensive health care education, experience and dedication to our members, who look to you to get well and stay well. Ame rigroup analyzes performance annually against the standards for the geographic distribution of each type of practitioner providing primary care. Provider Roles and Responsibilities Primary Care Physicians PCPs are the principle point of contact for our me mbers. The PCP's role is to provide members with a health \"home,\" the member's first stop in the health care process and a centralized hub for a wide variety of ongoing health care needs. Amerigroup furnishes PCPs with a current list of assigned members. T he PCP's role is to: Coordinate members' health care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Develop members' care and treatment plans, including preventive care. Maintain members' current medical records, including documentation of all services provided by the PCP, specialists, or referral services. Adhere to wait times, as outlined within the Provider Agreement and Provider Manual. Refer members to specialists. Coordinate with outpatient clinical services. Provide complete information about proposed treatments and prognosis for recovery to our members or their representatives. Facilitate interpreter services by presenting information in a language that our members or their representatives can understand. Ensure that members' medical and personal information is k ept confidential as required by state and federal laws. The PCP's scope of responsibilities includes providing or arranging for: Routine and preventive health care services. Emergency care services. Hospital services. Ancillary services. Interpreter servi ces. Referrals to specialists. Coordination with outpatient clinical services, such as therapeutic, rehabilitative or palliative services. Please note: Services should always be provided without regard to race, religion, sex, color, national origin, age o r physical/behavioral health status. Amerigroup members may select any contracted provider as their PCP as long as that provider is taking new patients. We keep providers up -to-date with detailed member information. We also furnish each provider with a cu rrent list of assigned members and provide medical information about the members' potential health care needs. Providers may use this information to coordinate treatment and services more effectively. 201 PCPs should provide services only to those Amerigroup members who have chosen you as their PCP. Verify that a member is assigned to you using any of the following methods : Call Provider Services at 800-454-3730 o Use the automated voice response (AVR) system to verify PCP assignment o Speak to a Member Services representative Log into Availity Essentials , the secure provider portal, at https://providers.amerigroup.com /ia. Select Login or Register to access the secure site. You may experience delays in claims payments if you treat members who are not assigned to you on the date of service. If you must provide services to an Amerigroup member not assigned to you, obtain precertification first. Noncontracted providers must obtain precertification before treating Amerigroup members. Provider Roles and Responsibilities Referrals PCPs coordinate and make referrals to specialists, ancillary providers and community services. Providers should refer members to network facilities and providers. When this is not possible, providers should follow the appropriate process for requesting out -of-network referrals. Please note: Specialty referrals to n etwork providers do not require precertification. All PCPs must perform the following with regard to referrals: Help members schedule appointments with other health care providers, including specialists. Track and document appointments, clinical findings, treatment plans and care received by members referred to specialists or other health care providers. Refer members to health education programs and community resource agencies, when appropriate. Coordinate with the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) progra m to provide medical information necessary for WIC eligibility determinations, such as height, weight, hematocrit or hemoglobin. Coordinate with the local tuberculosis (TB) control program to ensure that all members with confirmed or suspected TB have a co ntact investigation and receive directly observed therapy (DOT). Report any member who is noncompliant, drug resistant or who is or may be posing a public health threat to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services (Iowa HHS) or the local TB control program. Perform screening and evaluation procedures for the detection and treatment of, or referral for, any known or suspected behavioral health problems and disorders. Provider Roles and Responsibilities Out-Of-Network Referrals We recognize that an out-of-network referral may be justified at times. The Amerigroup Medical Management department will work with the PCP to determine medical necessity and will authorize out-of-network referrals on a limited basis. For assistance, contact the Medical Manage ment department at: Phone: 800-454-3730 Fax: 800-964-3627 202 Provider Roles and Responsibilities Interpreter Services Providers must notify members of the availability of interpreter services. Providers also must train their answering services and on-call personnel on how to access those services. Amerigroup providers should strongly discourage the use of minors, friends and family members acting as interpreters. Providers also must accommodate non -English speaking members by having multilingual mes sages on answering machines. For those instances when you cannot communicate with a member due to language barriers, telephonic and face -to-face interpreter services are available at no cost to you or the member. Request telephonic interpreters for member s needing language assistance as outlined below: During business hours: Providers call Provider Services at 800-454-3730 Members call Member Services at 800-600-4441 (TTY: 711) After -hours, providers and members call Amerigroup on Call at: 866-864-2544 (English) 866-864-2545 (Spanish) TTY: 711 Request face -to-face interpreters for members needing language assistance, including American Sign Language, d uring business hours: Providers call Provider Ser vices at 800-454-3730 Members call Member Services at 800-600-4441 (TTY: 711) Please note: To schedule face -to-face interpreter services, please allow 72 hours.

Provider Roles and Responsibilities Transitioning Members between Medical Facilities and Home When medically indicated, the PCP initiates o r assists with the discharge or transfer of members: From an inpatient facility to the appropriate skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility, or to the member's home. From an out -of-network hospital to an in -network hospital, or to the member's home with home health care assistance (within benefit limits). The coordination of member transfers from noncontracted, out -of-network facilities to contracted, in-network facilities is a priority that may require the immediate attention of the PCP. Contact the Ame rigroup Medical Management department to assist at 800-454-3730 . Provider Roles and Responsibilities Noncovered Services All PCPs must inform members of the costs associated with noncovered services prior to rendering the noncovered services. For more information, call Provider Services at 800-454-3730 . 203 Provider Roles and Responsibilities Specialists Specialists, licensed with additional training and expertise in a specific field of medicine, supplement the care given by PCPs. Specialists are charged with the same responsibilities as PCPs, including the responsibility of ensuring that precertification has been obtained befo re rendering services. Access to specialty care begins when the PCP refers a member to a specialist for medically necessary conditions beyond the PCP's scope of practice.

The program is designed to develop, implement, coordinate and monitor health care plans to optimize our members' h ealth care benefits. A case manager, through discussions with providers and members, collects data and analyzes information about actual and potential care needs for the purpose of developing a health care plan. Members referred to integrated case management may be identified by disease or condition, or high utilization of services. Examples of members appropriate for referral to integrated case management include those with: Unmanaged chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart failure. Complex or multiple -care case s, including multiple trauma or cancer. Frequent hospitalizations or emergency room visits. Hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis or cerebral palsy. High -risk or teen pregnancies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Acquired immune deficiency synd rome (AIDS). Potential transplants. Preterm births. We make the following information available to contracted providers: Amerigroup criteria for determining which members might benefit from integrated case management Provider 's responsibility for identify ing members who meet that criteria Process for providers to follow when notifying Amerigroup about identified members Additionally, the Integrated Case Management department provides descriptions of the programs for the following conditions or needs: Asthma Cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) Children with special health care needs Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end -stage renal disease (ESRD) Chronic obstructive pulmonar y disease (COPD) Diabetes Oncology Pregnancy, high -risk obstetrics and teen pregnancy Special programs, including discharge transitions Please note: Our Integrated Case Management department is sensitive to the cultural and linguistic diversity of our members and its impact on their interaction within the health care system.

The Care Management Referral Form is on our provider website at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia . Integrated Case Management Delegated Entities In some cases, Amerigroup delegates management, condition care , utilization management and integrated case management activities to external entities. Amerigroup monitors these activities and performs oversight to ensure that those entities are in compliance with federal, state and accreditation standards. Integrated Case Management Role of the Integrated Case Manager The case manager's role is to assess the member's health care status, develop a health care plan, and: Facilitate communication and coordination within the health care team. Facilitate communication with the member and his or her family in th e decision -making process. Educate the member and provider(s) about care management, community resources, benefits, cost factors and all related topics so informed decisions may be made. Encourage appropriate use of medical facilities and services, with th e goal of improving quality of care and maintaining cost -effectiveness on a case -by-case basis. The Integrated Case Management department includes experienced and credentialed registered nurses, some of whom are certified case managers. The department als o includes social workers, who add valuable skills allowing us to address our members' medical, psychological, social and financial issues. Interpreter services are available to support the integrated case management process at no cost to the member. Integrated Case Management Integrated Case Management Procedure When a member has been identified as having a condition that may require integrated case management, the case manager contacts the referring provider and member for an initial assessment. With the involvement of the member, the member's representative and the provider, the case manager develops an individualized care plan. That plan may involve coordinating services with public and behavioral health departments, schools and other community health r esources. 213 The integrated case manager periodically reassesses the care plan to monitor the following: Progress toward goals Necessary revisions New issues to be addressed to ensure the member receives the support necessary to achieve care plan goals Afte r goals are met or Integrated Case Management can no longer impact the case, the integrated case manager closes the case. Integrated Case Management Transitioning Disenrollees The case manager 's responsibility is to assist when a member requests help to transition to another health plan. This must occur without disruption of any regimen of care that qualifies as a continuity of care condition. The case manager works with the member, the member 's providers and the integrated case manager at the ne w health plan to ensure an orderly transition. Integrated Case Management Continued Access to Care New Amerigroup members may receive services from out -of-network, Iowa Medicaid -certified providers if certain guidelines are met. First, the provider must contact us to discuss the scheduled health services in advance of the service date. Second, the case must meet a qualifying condition, as defined below, in which the member: Has been approved and scheduled to receive a cornea and/or kidney tr ansplant or tissue replacement.

Is transitioning through behavioral health services, especially if t he member received precertification from the previous health plan or through fee -for-service coverage. Integrated Case Management Continuity of Care Process Our integrated case management nurses review member and provider requests for continuity of care. These nurses facilitate continuation with the current provider until the regimen of care is complete or the member transitions to a new provider. 214 Only Amerigroup can make adverse determination decisions regarding continuity of care. Adverse determination decisions are sent in writing to the member and provider within two business days of the decision. Members, and providers with the member's written consent, may appeal the decision by following the procedures in the Grievances and Appeals chapter of this manual. Reasons for continuity of care denial include, but are not limited to: Course of treatment being complete Member being ineligible for coverage Condition is not a qualifying condition Request is for change of PCP and not for continued access to care Requested services are not covered benefits Services rendered are covered under a global fee Treating provider currently is contracted with Amerigroup Case Management Health Home Services Overview Iowa has two CMS -approved Health Home State Plan Amendments, Chronic Condition Health Home and Integrated Health Home, for Medicaid members with chron ic medical and behavioral health conditions. An Integrated Health Home is a team of Healthcare Professionals and the Chronic Condition Health Home is a Designated Provider that deliver personalized, coordinated care for individuals who meet program eligibility criteria. Services utilize a whole -person treatment approach coordinated between multiple delivery systems. Health Information Technology (HIT) assists in linking services, providing feedback and facilitating communication among providers.

Following federal and state guidelines, we have a Quality Assessment and P erformance Improvement (QAPI) program in place to advance our levels of readiness, service, and care. The QAPI program, aligned with the State of Iowa's quality standards, includes focused studies measuring quality of care in the following clinical and ser vice areas: Childhood immunization status Comprehensive diabetes care (HbA1C Testing and LDL -C Screening) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) care Healthy birth outcomes Lead testing of 1 - and 2 -year -olds Smoking ce ssation Use of appropriate medication for asthmatics All providers are expected to participate in these studies as part of our mutual goal of providing responsive, cost-effective health care that improves our members' lives. The studies include: Participation in multi -disciplinary teams for problem solving. Population studies. Random sample -based studies. Satisfaction surveys. We share information from these studies with providers and encourage constructive feedback. Based on the results of the p revious year's QAPI program, Amerigroup reviews and assesses the program's effectiveness and develops a new work plan for the next year's activities. We also participate in national evaluations designed to gauge our performance and that of providers. An important measure of performance comes from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), which annually reports HEDIS scores to health care plans throughout the country. This professional evaluation serves as a yearly report card and is a tool used by more than 90 percent of America's health care plans to rate performance across a wide spectrum of care and service areas, including: Member satisfaction with care access Member satisfaction with claims processing Customer service Amerigroup uses the HE DIS data to identify areas for improvement and shares the results with providers. We submit the results of the HEDIS assessment and our own quality studies annually to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ), which makes the results public. As a result, HEDIS summaries may be used by potential members to make comparisons before choosing a health care plan. We also are committed to tracking preventable adverse medical events, also known as \"never events,\" with the goal of eliminating these events . Please note: If we determine the quality of care or services provided by a health care professional is not satisfactory, Amerigroup may terminate the Provider Agreement and related addendums. We make this determination by reviewing member satisfaction s urveys, case management data, member complaints or grievances, other complaints or lawsuits alleging professional negligence, or quality of care indicators. 217 Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Progr am The QAPI program focuses on developing and implementing standards for clinical care and service, measuring conformity to those standards and taking action to improve performance. The scope of the QAPI program includes, but is not limited to, the monitor ing and evaluation of: Care and service provided in all health delivery settings. Internal organizational performance. Provider/member satisfaction. Provider promotion of preventive health programs and exams. Provider management of member health status. Provider site facilities and medical records. Amerigroup develops an annual plan of quality improvement activities based on the results of the previous year's QAPI program evaluation. Then we review, evaluate and revise the QAPI program's effectiv eness. The evaluation is a written description of the ability of Amerigroup to implement the QAPI program, meet program objectives, and develop and implement plans to improve the quality of care and service to our members. The QAPI program requires the med ical director's or designated physician's involvement in the QI program. Providers support the activities of the QAPI program by: Completing corrective action plans, when applicable. Participating in the facility and medical record audit process. Providin g access to medical records for quality improvement projects and studies. Responding in a timely manner to requests for written information and documentation if a quality of care or grievance issue has been filed. Using preventive health and Clinical Pract ice Guidelines in member care. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) HEDIS \u00ae is a national evaluation and core set of performance measurements gauging the effectiveness of Amerigroup and providers in delivering quality care. We are ready to help when providers and their office staff need training to participate in required HEDIS evaluations. Providers can request consultations and training in the following areas: Information about the year's selected HEDIS studies How data for those measures will be collected Codes associated with each measure Tips for smooth coordination of medical record data collection Our Quality Improvement staff will contact the provider's office when we need to review or copy any medical records required for quality improvement studies. Office staff must provide access to medical records for review and copying. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Quality Management Twice a year, and in acco rdance with NCQA standards, Amerigroup analyzes relevant utilization data against established thresholds for each plan to detect current utilization levels. If our findings fall outside specified target ranges and indicate potential underutilization or ove rutilization, further analysis will occur based on the recommendation of the Amerigroup Utilization Management committee. 218 The follow -up analysis may include gathering the following data from specific provider and practice sites: Case management services needed by members Claims payments for covered services Coordination with other providers and agencies Focus studies Investigation and resolution of member and provider complaints and appeals within established time frames Retrospective reviews of services provided without authorization Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Best -Practice Methods Best -practice m ethods are our most up -to-date compilation of effective strategies for quality health care delivery. We share best practice methods during site visits to provider offices. Member Services and Network Management departments offer policies, procedures and ed ucational toolkits to help guide improvements. Toolkits may include examples of best practices from other offices, including: Resources for improving compliance with preventive health services. Clinical practice guidelines. Care for members with special or chronic care needs. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Member Satisfaction Surveys Member satisfaction with our health care services is measured every year by the NCQA. The NCQA conducts a survey called the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare P roviders and Systems (CAHPS\u00ae) . The survey is designed to measure member satisfaction with our services, including: Access to care. Amerigroup customer service. Provider communications. Provider office staff performance. We distribute the results of the CAHPS survey to both members and providers. Providers should review the results, share the results with office staff and incorporate appropriate changes in their offices. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Provider Satisfaction Surveys Amerigroup may conduct provider surveys to monitor and measure provider satisfaction with our services and identify areas for improvement. Provider participation in these surveys is highly encouraged and your feedback is very important. We inform providers of the results and plans for improvement through provider bulletins, newsletters, meetings or training sessions. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Medical Record and Facility Site Reviews We conduct medical record and facility site reviews t o determine provider: Compliance with standards for providing health care. Compliance with standards for storing medical records. Compliance with processes that maintain safety standards and practices. Involvement in the continuity and coordination of memb er care. The HHS and Amerigroup have the right to enter the premises of providers to inspect, monitor, audit or otherwise evaluate the work performed. We perform all inspections and evaluations in such a manner as to 219 not unduly delay work in accordance wi th the Provider Agreement . Amerigroup will conduct an office visit for those sites where a complaint is received within 60 calendar days of determining that the threshold was met. If the threshold was not met, Amerigroup will implement corrective actions to improve offices that do not meet site criteria. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the corrective action will be performed at least every six months until deficient offices meet the site standards and threshold. Follow -up visits will be documented and presented to the QI committee. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Medical Record Documentation Standards Amerigroup requires providers to maintain medical records in a manner that is current, organized, and permits effective and confidential member care and quality review. Medical records must be stored and retrieved in a manner that protects patient information according to the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, which requires the following: Providers of health care are prohibited from disclosing any individually identifiable information regarding a pati ent's medical history, mental condition, physical condition or treatment without the patient's or legal representat ive's consent or specific legal authority.

Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Medical Record Review Process A member of our Quality Improvement department will call the provider's office to schedule a medical record review on a date and time occurring within 30 days. On the day of the review, the Quality Improvement associate will: 1. Request the number and type of medical records required. 2. Review the appropriate type and number of medical records per prov ider. 3. Complete the medical record review. 4. Meet with the provider or office manager to review and discuss the results of the medical record review. 5. Provide a copy of the medical record review results to the office manager or provider, or send a final copy w ithin 10 days of the review. 6. Schedule follow -up reviews for any corrective actions identified. Providers must attain a score of 80 percent or greater to pass the medical record review. Amerigroup conducts a medical record review annually, according to our medical records standards, at select primary care sites and high -volume provider offices. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Facility Site Review Process An initial site inspection is required for all provider offices particip ating in Amerigroup, regardless of other accreditation or certification. In addition: A site review is required as part of the initial credentialing process for new providers if that site has not been reviewed and accepted as part of our credentialing proc ess. 222 OB-GYN specialist sites participating in our plan and not serving as PCPs also must undergo an initial site inspection. A member of our Quality Improvement department will call the provider's office to schedule an appointment date and time before the facility site review due date. The department will fax or mail a confirmation letter with an explanation of the audit process and required documentation. During the facility site review, the Quality Improvement associate will: 1. Lead a prereview conference with the provider or office manager to review and discuss the process of facility review and answer any questions. 2. Conduct a review of the facility. 3. Develop a corrective action plan, if applicable. After the facility site review is completed, our associat e will meet with the provider or office manager to: 1.

Schedule follow -up reviews, if applicable. 4. Complete a corrective action plan. 5. Sign an attestation that corrective actions are complete. 6. Submit the completed corrective action plan, supporting documents and signed attestation to our quality improvement analyst. Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Preventable Adverse Events The breadth and complexity of today's health care system means there are inherent risks, many of which can be neither pre dicted nor prevented. However, preventable adverse events should be tracked and reduced, with the ultimate goal of eliminating these events. Providers and health care systems, as advocates for our members, are responsible for the continuous monitoring, im plementation and enforcement of applicable health care standards. Focusing on patient safety, we work collaboratively with providers and hospitals to identify preventable adverse events and implement appropriate strategies and technologies to avoid these e vents. Our goal is to enhance the quality of care received not only by our members, but all patients receiving care in these facilities. Prevention of adverse events may require the disclosure of protected health information (PHI). HIPAA specifies that PH I may be disclosed for the purpose of health care operations in relation to quality assessment and improvement activities. Moreover, the information you share with us is legally protected 223 through the peer review process and will be maintained in a strictly confidential manner. If you receive a request for medical records, please provide the records within 10 days from the date of request. We will continue to monitor activities related to the list of adverse events from federal, state and private payers, in cluding \"never events\": Never events: As defined by the National Quality Forum (NQF), never events are adverse events that are serious, but largely preventable, and of concern to both the public and health care providers. Preventable adverse events should not occur. When they do, we firmly support the concept that a health plan and its members should not pay for resultant services. Medicaid is prohibited from paying for certain health care acquired conditions (HCAC), and this ruling applies to all h ospitals. 224 CHAPTER 21: ENROLLMENT AND MARKETING RULES Enrollment and Marketing Rules Overview The delivery of quality health care poses numerous challenges, not the least of which is the commitment shared by Amerigroup and providers to act in the best interest of our members. We want our members to make the best health care decisions possible. And when members ask for our assistance, we want to provide that assistance so they make those decisions without undue influence. We recognize that providers occupy a unique, trusted and respected part of people's lives. Given the complexity of modern -day hea lthcare and the inherent difficulties communicating with some of the populations we serve, there are potentially serious pitfalls when providers try to assist in the decision -making process. Sometimes, even though the intent is to help make our members' li ves better, we may overstep. For that reason, we are committed to following strict enrollment and marketing guidelines created by Iowa HHS and to honoring the rules for all state health care programs. Enrollment and Marketing Rules Marketing Policies Ame rigroup providers are prohibited from making marketing presentations and advising or recommending to an eligible individual that he or she select membership in a particular plan. The HHS marketing practice policies prohibit network providers from making an y of the following false or misleading claims: The provider's office staffs are employees or representatives of the state, county or federal government. Amerigroup is recommended or endorsed by any state or county agency, or any other organization. The state or county recommends that a prospective member enroll with a specific health care plan. A prospective member or medical recipient loses Medicaid or other welfare benefits if the prospective member does not enroll with a specific health care plan. These policies also prohibit network providers from taking the following actions: Making marketing presentations, advising or recommending to an eligible individual that he or she select membership in a specific health care plan. Offering or giving away any form of compensation, reward or loan to a prospective member to induce or procure member enrollment in a specific health care plan. Engaging in direct marketing to members designed to increase enrollment in a particular health care plan. The prohibition sh ould not constrain providers from engaging in permissible marketing activities consistent with broad outreach objectives and application assistance. Using any list of members originally obtained for enrollment purposes from confidential state or county dat a sources, or from the data sources of other contractors. Employing marketing practices that discriminate against potential members other than persons specifically excluded from coverage under our contract. Providers may not discriminate based on marital s tatus, age, religion, gender, gender identity , national origin, language, sexual orientation, ancestry, or pre -existing psychiatric problems or medical conditions, such as pregnancy, disability or AIDS. Reproducing or signing an enrollment application for the member. Displaying materials only from the provider's contracted managed health care organizations and excluding others. 225 Providers are permitted to: Assist members in applying for benefits by calling for enrollment information: o Amerigroup Member Services : 800-600-4441 (TTY: 711) o Iowa Medicaid Member Services: 800-338-8366 or 515-256-4606 (when calling from within the Des Moines area) ; TTY: 800-735-2942 Distribute copies of Amerigroup applications to potential members. File a complaint with Amerigr oup if a provider or member objects to any form of marketing, either by other providers or by Amerigroup representatives. Refer to Chapter 14: Grievances and Appeals for more infor mation on the grievance process. Enrollment and Marketing Rules Enrollment Process The HHS determines the eligibility and enrollment for individuals seeking to enroll in IA Health Link or Hawki , after which the process is as follows: 1. HHS presents IA Health Link or Hawki to eligible individuals and families. 2. HHS informs Amerigroup of new member enrollment . 3. Providers are given notice of new members assigned to their care through monthly eligibility reports. Providers access these reports by logging into Availity Essentials , and accessing the Provider Online Repor ting application located on Payer Spaces , at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia . Select Login or Register to access the secure site. 4. Amerigroup sends each new member a New Member Kit within five business days of receiving the HHS monthly membership file. This kit includes the Member Handbook, an information card with important phone numbers, and instructions for changing a PCP. 5. Members select a PCP. After 14 days, if the member has not selected a PCP, Amerigroup assigns a PCP to the member. 226 CHAPTER 22: FRAUD, ABUSE AND WASTE Fraud, Abuse and Waste Overview We're committed to protecting the integrity of our health care program and the efficiency of our operations by preventing, detecting and investigating fraud, abuse and waste. Fraud, Abuse and Waste Understanding Fraud, Abuse and Waste Combating fraud, abuse and waste begins with knowledge and awareness. Fraud: Any type of intentional deception or misrepresentation made with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to the person committing it \u2014 or any other person; the attempt itself is fraud, regardless of whether or not it is successful Abuse: when health care providers or suppliers do not follow good medical practices resulting in unnecessary or excessive costs, incorrect payment, misuse of codes, or services that are not medically necessary. Waste: includes overusing services, or other practices that, directly or indirectly, result in unnecessary costs. Waste is generally not considered to be driven by intentional actions, but rather occurs when resources are misused. Fraud, Abuse and Waste Examples of Provi der Fraud, Abuse and Waste The following are examples of provider fraud, abuse and waste: Altering medical records Billing for services not provided Billing for medically unnecessary tests Billing professional services performed by untrained personnel Misr epresentation of diagnosis or services Overutilization Soliciting, offering or receiving kickbacks or bribes Unbundling Underutilization Upcoding Fraud, Abuse and Waste Examples of Member Fraud, Abuse and Waste The following are examples of member fraud, abuse and waste: Forging, altering or selling prescriptions Letting someone else use a member's IA Health Link identification (ID) card Not telling the truth about the amount of money or resources the member has for the purpose of obtaining benefits Relocating to an out -of-service area and not notifying us Using someone else's IA Health Link ID 227 Fraud, Abuse and Waste Reporting Provider or Recipient Fraud, Abuse or Waste If you suspect a provider ( for example, provider group, hospital, doctor, dentist, counselor, medical supply company, etc.) or any member (a person who receives benefits) has committed fraud, waste or abuse, you have the right to report it. No individual who reports violations or suspec ted fraud and abuse will be retaliated against for doing so. The name of the person and their information, if supplied, who reports the incident is kept in strict confidence by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU).

In addition to reporting, we take corrective action such as: Written warning and/or education : We send certified letters to the provider or me mber documenting the issues and need for improvement. Letters may include education or request for recoveries, or may advise of further action. Medical record review : We may review medical records to substantiate allegations or validate claims submissions. Special claims review : A certified professional coder evaluates claims prior to payment of designated claims. This edit prevents automatic claim payment in specific situations. Recoveries : We recover overpayments directly from the provider. Failure of the provider to return the overpayment may result in reduced payment of future claims and/or further legal action. If you are working with the SIU all checks and correspondence should be sent to: Special Investigations Unit 740 W Peachtree Street NW Atlanta, Georgia 30308 Attn: investigator name, #case number Paper medical records and claims are a different address, which is supplied in correspondence from the SIU.

If a member has committed fraud, exhibited abusive or threatening behavior, or has failed to correct issues, he or she may be involuntarily disenrolled from our health care plan with state approval. Refer to the Member Transfers and Disenrollment chapter f or more information . Fraud, Abuse and Waste False Claims Act We're committed to complying with all applicable federal and state laws, including the federal False Claims Act (FCA). The FCA is a federal law allowing the government to recover money stolen through fraud by government contractors. Under the FCA, anyone w ho knowingly submits, or causes another person or entity to submit, false claims for payment of government funds is liable for three times the damages, or loss, to the government, plus civil penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim. The FCA also con tains Qui Tam or \"whistleblower\" provisions. A \"whistleblower\" is an individual who reports in good faith an act of fraud or waste to the government, or files a lawsuit on behalf of the government. Whistleblowers are protected from retaliation from their e mployer under Qui Tam provisions in the FCA and may be entitled to a percentage of the funds recovered by the government Fraud, Abuse and Waste Employee Education about the False Claims Act As a requirement of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, contracted providers who receive Medicaid payments of at least $5 million dollars (cumulative from all sources), must comply with the following: Establish written policies for all employees, managers, officers, contractors, subcontractors and agents of the network p rovider. The policies must provide detailed information about the False Claims Act, administrative remedies for false claims and statements, any state laws about civil or criminal penalties for false claims, and whistleblower protections under such laws, a s described in Section 1902(a)(68)(A). Include as part of such written policies detailed provisions regarding policies and procedures for detecting and preventing fraud, waste and abuse. Include in any employee handbook a specific discussion of the laws described in Section 1902(a)(68)(A), the rights of employees to be protected as whistleblowers, and policies and procedures for detecting and preventing fraud, abuse and waste. 230 CHAPTER 23: MEMBER RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES Member Rights and Responsibilities Overview Members should be clearly informed about their rights and responsibilities so they can make the best health care decisions. Members also have the right to ask questions about the way we conduct business, as well as the respon sibility to learn about their health care plan coverage. The following member rights and responsibilities are defined by the state of Iowa and appear in the Member Handbook.

Differences in our members' ability to speak or read the same language as their health care providers may add an extra dimension of difficulty when provide rs try to encourage follow -through on treatment plans. It is important to continually increase your knowledge of and ability to support the values, beliefs, and needs of diverse patients. Our Cultural Diversity and Linguistic Services toolkit, called \"Cari ng for Diverse Populations,\" was developed to give you specific tools for breaking through cultural and language barriers in an effort to better communicate with your patients. Sometimes the solution is as simple as finding the right interpreter for an of fice visit. Other times, a greater level of cultural awareness opens the door to the kind of interaction that makes treatment plans most effective: Has the patient been raised in a culture that frowns upon direct eye contact or receiving medical treatment from a member of the opposite sex? Is the patient self -conscious about his or her ability to read instructions? The Cultural Diversity and Linguistic Services toolkit provides the information you'll need to answer those questions and continue building tru st. The toolkit will enhance your ability to communicate with ease, talking to a wide range of people about a variety of culturally -sensitive topics. The toolkit also offers cultural and linguistic training to your office staff, enabling all aspects of an office visit to go smoothly. We strongly encourage you to access the complete toolkit on our website at https://providers.amerigroup.com/ia under Provider Resources & Doc uments > Training Programs. The toolkit contents are organized into the following sections: Improving Communications with a Diverse Patient Base Encounter tips for providers and their clinical staff A memory aid to assist with patient interviews Help in i dentifying literacy problems Tools and Training for Your Office in Caring for a Diverse Patient Base Interview guide for hiring clinical staff who have an awareness of cultural competency issues Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements Resource s to Communicate Across Language Barriers Tips for locating and working with interpreters Common signs and sentences in many languages Language identification flashcards Language skill self -assessment tools Resources to Increase Awareness on How Cultural Background Impacts Health Care Delivery Tips for speaking with people across cultures about a variety of culturally -sensitive topics Information about health care beliefs of different cultural backgrounds Regulations and Standards for Cultural and Linguistic Services This section identifies important legislation impacting cultural and linguistic services, including a summary of the Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) standards, which serve as a guide on how to meet these requirements. 233 Resources for Cultural and Linguistic Services The toolkit contains materials developed by and used with the permission of the Industry Collaboration Effort (ICE) Cultural and Linguistic Workgroup, a volunteer, multidisc iplinary team of providers, health plans, associations, state and federal agencies and accrediting bodies working collaboratively to improve health care regulatory compliance through public education. More information on the ICE workgroup may be obtained o n their website at www.iceforhealth.org .
