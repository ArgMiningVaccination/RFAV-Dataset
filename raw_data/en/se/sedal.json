QJ \"' ..c: GENERAL INTRODUCTION Background and aim of the study The work described in this thesis deals with modelling and cost-effectiveness analyses of vaccination strategies against infectious diseases, in particular prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. There is no doubt that vaccination is the cornerstone in prevention of infectious diseases. Highly effective vaccines are available against many viral and bacterial pathogens, including pathogens that cause major illnesses such as poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, hepatitis 8, diphtheria, whooping cough and meningitis. Year after year, vaccination saves millions of lives and relieves the burden of illness caused by microbial pathogens. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the vaccination of infants, children and high-risk groups (e.g. elderly and immunocompromised people) against several infectious diseases.1 Worldwide, due to the introduction of childhood vaccination programmes, the incidence of several major infectious diseases has declined dramatically. As a consequence of vaccination, not only immunized individuals are protected from disease. There are additional benefits related to the fact that the vaccinee will no longer spread the pathogen to other susceptible individuals. Consequently, even persons who are not vaccinat\u00ad ed are effectively protected due to a reduced circulation of the pathogen in the population . This phenomenon is often referred to as \"herd immunity\" or \"herd protection\".2 Ultimately, vaccination may be so effective that the pathogen is eliminated entirely from the population. This is exemplified by the eradication of smallpox in the 1970s after an intense worldwide vaccination campaign initiated by the WHO. Interestingly, due to the complete elimination from the human population of the causative agent of smallpox, the Variola virus, vaccination against smallpox is no longer necessary and has since been deleted from national immunisa\u00ad tion programmes. Whereas vaccination has been and continues to be extremely effective in controlling major infections, prevention of several other infectious diseases remains a chal\u00ad lenge. These include HIV/ AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, which together are responsible for approximately 5 million deaths worldwide, annually.3 For various reasons development of vaccines against these major infections has proven to be very difficult, although there are some glimmers ofhope.4 Vaccination is not only highly effective in preventing disease, it also belongs to the most cost-effective interventions in public health. Indeed, several major existing vaccines are comparatively simple and inexpensive, but nevertheless prevent very extensive morbidity that would otherwise have represented a considerable economic burden for national health\u00ad care systems. However, this characteristic of early vaccination strategies, combining low cost with major benefits, is not always obvious for newly developed vaccines. First, while initial 10 General Introduction and Outline of the Thesis vaccines were directed against major killer infections, many new vaccines protect against a more limited burden of disease. Also, considerable costs are involved in the development of new vaccines due to the increasingly stringent safety and efficacy requirements that new vaccines rightfully have to meet. Taken together, these factors clearly affect the cost-effec\u00ad tiveness of new vaccination strategies. Nevertheless, during the last decade, several new vaccines have become available, including vaccines against, for example varicella-zoster vi\u00ad rus, rotavirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and HPV.5 HPV vaccination, primarily aimed at protection against cervical cancer among women, be\u00ad longs to the category of interventions for which it is not a priori obvious that they are cost\u00ad effective. Firstly, compared to other vaccine-preventable diseases, the burden of cervical cancer is relatively low, i.e. 9.1 cases per 100,000 women in developed countries.6 Secondly, the two currently available vaccines primarily protect against HPV16 and 18, which are re\u00ad sponsible for only part of all cases of cervical cancer. Therefore, the vaccines do not provide complete protection against cervical cancer, necessitating the maintenance of cytological screening programmes. Thirdly, the vaccines are relatively expensive for reasons indicated above. In particular, it took more than 20 years to develop the vaccines, the vaccines are complex, and finally contain state-of-the-art adjuvants. Finally, HPV vaccines protect against a disease that will become apparent only several decades after acquisition of the HPV infec\u00ad tion. This time delay not only affects the cost-effectiveness of the vaccination, it also influ\u00ad ences the public perception of its necessity. Human Papillomavirus Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a non-enveloped DNA virus belonging to the family Pap\u00ad illomaviridae.7 At least hundred different HPV types have been identified. In general, two major categories of HPV types are distinguished: the high-risk and the low-risk HPV types. High-risk HPVs include HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 58, and 59; these viruses are known to be involved in the development of cancer.7 Low-risk HPVs types include HPV2 and 7, which produce skin lesions such as warts, and HPV6 and 11, which cause anogenital warts (Condyloma accuminata).7 HPV infection of the genital tract is one of the most common sexu\u00ad ally transmitted infections. Most sexually active men and women (> 75%) will acquire one or more HPV infections during their lives.7 HPV prevalence peaks between 20 and 30 years of age, just after individuals become sexually active.010 The HPV genome is a double-stranded DNA molecule and comprises six early genes, en\u00ad coding non-structural proteins such as El, E2, E6, and E7, and two late genes encoding the structural proteins Ll and L2. Infection with HPV is limited to the basal cells of the strati\u00ad fied epithelium, in particular keratinocytes of the skin or mucous membranes, ranging from the hands and feet to the genital regions.7 During infection, the non-structural proteins El and E2 maintain the viral DNA as an episome and facilitate the replication of the virus dur- 11 ing cell division and differentiation. In later stages of the infection, the Ll and L2 genes are activated, resulting in viral capsid formation. Thousands of virus particles are released per cell to infect other cells and spread to other hosts. Note that HPV infection is non-lytic, and virions are not released until the infected cells reach the epithelial surface. Of the women infected with HPV, 90% clear the infection spontaneousl y.711 After clearance of the virus, these women obviously are no longer at risk of developing HPV-induced disease. In the process, approximately 60-70% of infected individuals develop natural antibodies against the infecting HPV type.12 It is, however, unclear whether these antibodies provide protection against subsequent new infections with the same HPV type.13 14 A minority of HPV-infected women is unable to clear the infection. In this group, the infection persists and the infected individuals are at risk of developing disease, including cervical cancer. During persistent infection, part of the HPV genome, including E6 and E7 may integrate into the host cell chromosomal DNA. The E6 and E7 gene products disturb regulation of the cell cycle and inhibit apoptosis. Thus, E6 and E7, in conjunction with other factors, promote malignant cell transformation and tumour growth by suppression of the tumour suppressor proteins p53 and pRB, respectively.7 The precise type of disease caused by persistent infec- 1 tion with HPV depends on the virus type and on the site of the infection. '\u00adQJ HPV-induced genital diseases ..c: u As mentioned above, infection of the genital tract with HPV might induce abnormal and in\u00ad creased cell growth. In women, cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal malignancies are related to infection with high-risk HPV types.7 Furthermore, high-risk HPV infection might induce penile and anal cancer in men.15 Infection with low-risk HPV of the genital tract can cause warts (Condyloma accuminata) in both men and women.7 Cervical cancer Cervical cancer is the most common type of cancer induced by HPV infection. It has been shown that HPV infection is the underlying cause of cervical cancer in over 99% of cases.16 Cervical cancer is, after breast cancer, the second most common type of cancer among women worldwide. Worldwide, 16 per 100,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer annually, of whom approximately 9 will die.6 The incidence of cervical cancer is highest in the developing world, mainly because of the lack of effective cytological screening programmes .. The two most important HPV types involved in the development of cervical cancer are HPV16 and 18. Between 70 and 80% of cervical cancer cases are caused by infection with one of these two HPV types.17 In addition to HPV infection, there are other risk factors for development of cervical cancer, including smoking, the use of contraceptives or immunode- 12 General Introduction and Outline of the Thesis ficiency.18 Although in most women the HPV infection will be cleared, in a small minority the infection will persist. Of these women, who do not successfully clear the infection, approxi\u00ad mately 15% will develop cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), the precancerous stage of cervical carcinoma.19 CIN is classified in three different stages: mild (CINl), moderate (CIN2) and severe (CIN3). Progression from one stage to the next strongly depends on the HPV type involved and takes 7 to 15 years to progress from HPV infected to CIN3.20 Generally, low\u00ad grade CIN lesions regress spontaneous ly. However, in 20-30% of CIN cases, the lesions will progress to cervical cancer.19 Cervical cancer can be classified in four different stages (I-IV). Low-grade (stage I) cervical cancer is mostly asymptomatic. In some cases, abnormal vagi\u00ad nal bleeding will occur. In the more advanced stages various symptoms are reported, such as weight loss, heavy bleeding from the vagina, fatigue, and pelvic pain. Cervical cancer can be diagnosed by biopsy of the cervix.21 After diagnosis, treatment de\u00ad pends on the stage of the cancer. Surgery will be applied in the early cancer stages, the more advanced stages are treated in addition by chemotherapy. After treatment women are still at risk of reoccurrence of the disease. Treatment of the precancerous stages of cervical cancer is generally more successful. 22 CINl will usually remain untreated, as these lesions regress often spontaneously. CIN2/3 lesions are treated with cryosurgery, laser therapy or loop elec\u00ad trosurgical excision procedures (removal ofabnormal cells). These treatments ofCIN2/3 are highly effective.23 Therefore, detection of the precancerous stages is important as treatment will prevent cervical cancer from developing. Condyloma accuminata Condyloma accuminata can be recognized as clusters of warts in the genital or anal area and usually present as grouped exophylic papillomatous lesions. Together with gonorrhoea and Chlamydia, genital warts belong to the most prevalent sexually transmitted infectious diseases.24 The vast majority of genital warts (80-90%) is caused by infection with HPV6 and/or 11.25 The prevalence of these low-risk HPV types peaks at 20 -30 years of age. In the Netherlands, the prevalence of low-risk HPVs in this age group amounts to 10-15%.26 Next to age, sexual behaviour is an obvious risk factor for acquiring anogenital warts. After infection with HPV6 or 11, only a small proportion of infected males and females will even\u00ad tually develop warts around the genitals and anal tract. The incidence of genital warts in the sexually-active population has been estimated to be approximately 1 % and is slightly higher among women compared to men.26 In general, anogenital warts are physically harmless with only moderate symptoms, includ\u00ad ing itching. Yet, genital warts may have a considerable impact on mental health. In particular, patients feel shame and are uncomfortable. Currently, no effective treatment exists for the treatment of the underlying HPV infection, but treatment of external warts is possible. How\u00ad ever, recurrence rates of warts after treatment are relatively high.27 13 Cervical cancer prevention Cervical cancer development can be prevented by cytological screening and/or HPV vacci\u00ad nation. Cytological screening was the first tool available to provide protection against cervi\u00ad cal cancer. Screening is intended to detect early premalignant stages of cervical cancer. In contrast, vaccination against HPV provides protection against HPV infection and thus pre\u00ad vents cervical cancer. Both cytological screening and HPV vaccination are considered to be highly effective in providing protection against cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening Since the 1980s, cervical cancer screening programmes have been implemented primarily in the developed world. Women are usually screened for CIN lesions by cytological smears at intervals of 3-5 years. If abnormal cells are found in these smears, the patient is referred to a medical specialist and a biopsy is taken. Since the introduction of cervical cancer screening, the incidence of cervical cancer has declined dramatically. Studies have estimated an overall reduction of 50-80%.28 29 This reduction highly depends on the screening compliance, the frequency of the screening and the starting age of screening within the programme.30 31 In the Netherlands, women 30 -60 years of age are screened with 5-year intervals. The 5-year compliance rate to this programme is high. Although still a small group of women do not 1 attend the programme at all during life. This is of concern as half of cervical cancer cases occurs in this group ofwomen.31 Consequently, there is still a comparatively large group of a:; women developing cervical cancer, despite screening being in place. 6 HPVvaccination Recently, prophylactic HPV vaccines have become available that provide protection against cervical cancer. These HPV vaccines consist ofrecombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) com\u00ad posed of the viral structural proteins Ll and L2, and generally also contain an adjuvant.32 33 The vaccines induce high virus-neutralizing antibody titers, which effectively protect against the HPV types included in the vaccines.33 34 The available vaccines are highly effective in women not yet infected with the HPV types included in the vaccines. The first HPV vaccine that was registered is a quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil /Silgard, Sanofi MSD), comprising the HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. This vaccine protects against the majority of cases of cervical cancer (HPV16 and 18) and against genital warts caused by HPV6 and 11. A bivalent vaccine (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline), comprising only HPV types 16 and 18, was registered subse \u00ad quently. Interestingly, both vaccines appear to provide a certain degree of cross-protection against non-vaccine high-risk HPV types.35 Health-economic economic desirability of an intervention.36 A health-economic model is a simplified framework designed to describe complex pro- 14 General Introduction and Outline of the Thesis cesses and systems. These frameworks simulate, most often, the progression from a healthy condition to disease in a hypothetical cohort that is followed during lifetime until death. Health-economic models are used to transform clinical-trial efficacy results to population effectiveness levels. In particular, these models are used to inform policy makers on poten\u00ad tial reduced morbidity and mortality and monetary savings as a result of the intervention. In health-economic models, mortality and morbidity are often expressed as the life-years (LYs) gained or the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.37 In particular, a year lived in perfect health is worth 1 QALY and a year lived in suboptimal health is worth less than 1 QALY. By quantifying the health benefits in terms of LYs gained, only the years gained by prevented mortality are considered. In contrast, by considering QALYs not only an increased life expectancy, but also an improved quality of life is taken into account. Cost-effectiveness is estimated by comparing the total costs and QALYs of a cohort with or without the intervention, resulting in the incremental costs per QALY gained. The incremen\u00ad tal costs of the intervention can be estimated through comparison of the overall medical (and non-medical) costs of the cohort with and without the intervention. The medical costs not only comprise the costs of general practitioner visits, diagnostic tests, drugs, hospitali\u00ad sation, etc., but potentially also non-medical costs such as costs due to absenteeism from work or travel costs.38 By dividing the incremental costs by the incremental QALYs (or Lys) gained, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is determined. In the Netherlands, an intervention is generally being considered as highly cost-effective when the ICER is below \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained. Still, also higher ICERs up to \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained are deemed acceptable. Modelling of interventions against infectious diseases Health-economic evaluation of interventions against infectious diseases, in particular vacci\u00ad nation, is not always straightforward. Vaccine efficacy is often measured in terms of antibody responses, while long-term hard clinical endpoints, such as the duration of vaccine-induced protection, are often lacking at the moment health-economic evaluations are required. Ad\u00ad ditionally, there may be issues concerning the exact modelling technique that is chosen. For interventions against infectious diseases two different model types are often used, in particular static models (most often Markov models) or dynamic models.39 A Markov model is a mathematical system that simulates transitions from one health state to another (for ex\u00ad ample, from \"healthy\" to \"disease\") during specified time periods (years, months, days, etc). Currently, the Markov model is mostly used for infectious disease modelling, although this model has some limitations.39 The major limitation is the static nature of the model, which implies that the transmission of the pathogen in the modelled population is not simulated. Consequently, specific features of interventions against infectious disease are not taken into 15 account. For example, potential herd-immunity benefits of mass vaccination programmes and possible incidence shifts to older-age classes are not considered in static (often Markov) models. Nevertheless, in certain situations, the use of these static models is acceptable. For example, when vaccination provides lifelong and highly effective protection and when a high vaccination coverage in the population is attained, the use of static models may be justified. Indeed, under these conditions, herd-immunity benefits will be limited, and, when there is life-long protection, no age-shifts might occur. Furthermore, the use of a static model is justified when only a small group of persons (high-risk groups) is vaccinated, as this will not crucially affect the circulation of the pathogen in the general population and thus no or limited herd-immunity benefits are to be expected. In settings where indirect effects of the vaccination are to be anticipated, dynamic models should preferably be used.4\u00b0 For example, under conditions of moderate vaccination cover\u00ad age or when vaccination provides limited protection and/or only during a relatively short period of time, dynamic models will provide more reliable and valid outcomes. Dynamic models simulate the transmission of a pathogen within the modelled population. Conse\u00ad quently, potential herd-immunity benefits and age-shift are explicitly taken into account. However, a major limitation of dynamic models is that additional data are required on, for 1 example, transmissibility of the pathogen and the networks of contacts of individuals within the cohort. Despite this limitation, the use of dynamic models for the modelling of interven- 2i tions against infectious diseases is becoming more common and is often recommended. 6 Discounting Health-economic evaluations play an important role in health-care decision making. There\u00ad fore many countries have established guidelines which are intended to serve as an aid for conducting health-economic studies in a transparent fashion. These guidelines include, for example, the type of evaluation required (i.e. cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, budget impact, etc), the perspective to be taken and preferable sources for costing to be used. These guide\u00ad lines help to consistently understand the economic value of new interventions and to secure the quality and comparability of health-economic evaluations. Furthermore, these guidelines often specify how future monetary and health effects need to be weighed relative to current costs ( discounting). In particular, individuals generally have a positive time preference for positive goods in the present and prefer to postpone negatives to the future. Therefore, in health-economic evaluations, long-term outcomes are generally discounted (i.e. devalued) at a constant rate to correct for difference in timing. Discounting of future costs is well embedded in economic theory and is generally well accepted. Notably, the discount rate for costs reflects most often the country-specific interest rate. Discount\u00ad ing of future health benefits is, however, debated. In particular, it is not a priori clear how to value future health effects, i.e. which discount rate to apply. Often, an equal discount rate for 16 General Introduction and Outline of the Thesis future costs and health benefits is applied. This method has, however, been criticized and application of differential discounting has been suggested. With differential discounting, the discount rate for future health effects is generally lower compared to the discount rate for costs. Specifically, the difference between the discount rate for costs and the discount rate for health effects might equal the expected growth rate for the value of health. Nonetheless, the question as to how to value future health benefits of a specific intervention remains a topic of major discussion. Vaccination programmes often have their benefits far in the future; i.e. the costs usually oc\u00ad cur long before the benefits become apparent. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness ratios of vaccination programmes are particularly sensitive to the discount rate applied. The cost\u00ad effectiveness of vaccination strategies is often so heavily influenced by discounting that the outcome may change from highly favourable to unfavourable exclusively due to changing the discount rate. Consequent ly, the cost-effectiveness is no longer driven by the gains, but by the discount rate applied. Specifically for vaccines, alternative discounting approaches have been proposed, such as time-shifted or step-wise discounting. With these approaches, the future health effects are devalued at a reduced rate compared to the constant discount\u00ad ing approach. Clearly, there is an urgent need for transparent and widely accepted discount rules for health-economic evaluations. Scope and Outline of this Thesis The general aim of the studies described in this thesis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination with the main focus on cervical cancer prevention. As outlined above, im\u00ad plementation of new preventive interventions is often driven by health-economic outcomes. In the Netherlands, cost-effectiveness is one of the seven criteria which are considered by the Dutch Health Council when a new vaccine is to be implemented within the Dutch na\u00ad tional immunisation programme.41 So when HPV vaccination was considered for inclusion in the national immunisation programme, health-economic evaluations were required. In this thesis, we further elaborate on these health-economic evaluations of HPV vaccination. We specifically considered the unanticip ated low acceptance of the vaccine, which underscores the importance of potential herd-immun ity effects among unvaccinated girls (and boys). To take these additional herd-immunity effects into account, a dynamic transmission model was developed. This model was used to assess not only the cost-effectiveness of the existing HPV vaccination programme, but also of alternative vaccination scenarios aimed at a further reduction of the burden of cervical cancer, including vaccination of girls/women up to 24 years of age and/or vaccination of boys. Finally, we analyzed potential additional benefits of cross-protection induced by the HPV vaccines and the benefits of protection against ano\u00ad genital warts. In the work described in Part I of this thesis, a Markov model was used to assess the clini- 17 1 cal and health-economic consequences of HPV vaccination. It was assumed, at the start of the study, that the HPV vaccine uptake would be high. Therefore, we argued that the effects of herd-immunity would be small and that, thus, the use of a static model would be justi\u00ad fied. Specifically, Chapter 2 presents a study, on the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination of 12-year-old girls. This age group was considered as the most effective age of vaccination against HPV infection, as the majority of 12-year-old girls are not yet sexually active. How\u00ad ever, although in the Netherlands and in many other countries, HPV vaccination has been introduced for young teenage girls, clinical trials have shown that HPV vaccination remains effective in women up to at least 26 years ofage. Therefore, in Chapter 3, we assessed until which age it is desirable, both from a clinical and health-economic perspective, to vaccinate women against HPV infection. Part I of this thesis ends with Chapter 4, in which we ad\u00ad dressed the question as to which HPV vaccine should preferably be used to vaccinate wom\u00ad en against HPV. In particular, the currently available bivalent vaccine Cervarix appears to provide a somewhat superior protection against cervical cancer due to slightly better cross-reactivity against non-vaccine HPV types, while the quadrivalent vaccine Gardasil provides additional protection against genital warts. We made an analytical comparison be\u00ad tween both vaccines, including the potential cross-protective benefits of the vaccines and the prevention of genital warts. In Part II of this thesis, a dynamic model was designed to assess the epidemiological and economical consequences ofHPV vaccination.42 In Chapter 5 of this thesis a dynamic model ] is presented which implicitly takes herd-immunity effects into account. The model, which simulates the transmission of the seven most prevalent HPV types, was used to estimate the reduction in cervical cancer incidence for different HPV vaccination scenarios. Cost-effec\u00ad tiveness analyses of teenage HPV vaccination and new additional catch-up programmes are presented in Chapter 6. In particular, we assessed the health gains and cost-effectiveness of the current HPV vaccination programme compared to the added value of two alternative vaccination programmes, i.e. vaccination of girls/women at an older age or vaccination of boys. In Part III of thesis, the emphasis is on how we should value the future health gains of vac\u00ad cination programmes. HPV vaccination presents one of the most extreme examples of the ex\u00ad tend to which discounting can influence cost-effectiveness results. Previously, several papers on the justification of differential discounting and on the impact of discounting on the future outcomes of preventive programmes have been published.3643-46 The Netherlands, together with Belgium, is unique in discounting future health gains at a rather low rate compared to rate used for discounting costs. The use of differential discounting is subject of intense de\u00ad bate.47 50 Specifically, it has been argued that differential discounting provides inconsistent results. In Chapter 7, we assessed the impact of different discounting approaches and rates on the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination. The final chapter of this part (Chapter 8) en- 18 Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavi rus16/18 for the prevention of cervical cancer: adaption of an existing cohort model to the situation in the Netherlands. courages the use of differential discounting approaches. Based on the available evidence, dif\u00ad ferential discounting is well supported by evidence and it is argued that it is time for change. The thesis ends with Chapter 9 presenting a general discussion of our main findings. Spe\u00ad cifically, the future of cervical cancer prevention and the appropriate use of health-economic modelling is discussed. Furthermore, we address the use of static vs. dynamic models for interventions against infectious diseases and a recommendation is made on future model\u00ad ling and prevention of HPV-induced cervical cancer. The chapter ends with a perspective on the position of health-economic modelling within the broader field of health-care decision making. Finally, before HPV vaccination was introduced the cost-effectiveness of the intervention has been analyzed by other investigators. In Annex II to this thesis, we provide an overview of Dutch cost-effectiveness analyses performed before HPV vaccination was introduced, setting the scene for this thesis. This overview illustrates that our findings are in line with the results and conclusions of the available cost-effective ness analyses. In particular, all studies show that teenage HPV vaccination results in a significant reduction in cervical cancer incidence and can be considered a cost-effective intervention. 19 20 -Part I - Static modelling of prophylactic vaccination against human papi lloma virus infection 21 22 Cost-ef fectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavir us16/18 for the prevention of cervical canc er: adapt ion of an existing cohort model to the situation in the Netherlands. Raina M Rogoza Tjalke A Westra Wilschut Maarten J Postma Vaccine 2009:27(35):4776-83 Abstract Cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide. Implementation of an HPV-vaccination strategy is generally expected to significantly reduce the burden of cervical-cancer disease. Here, we estimate the costs, savings and health gains of the addition of HPV vaccination to the already existing Dutch screening programme. In the base-case analysis, it was estimated that implementation of an HPV vaccine would result in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u20ac22,700 per life-year gained (LYG). In sensitivity analysis, the robustness of our finding of favourable cost-effectiveness was established. Also, the ICER appeared sensitive to the vaccine price, the discount rate and duration of vaccine-in duced protection. From our results, it validly follows that immunisation of 12-year-old Dutch girls against HPV infection is a cost-effective strategy for protecting against cervical cancer. Introduction Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, with approximately 500,000 new cases and 250,000 deaths annually.51 Over three quarters ofnew cases occur in developing countries.52 In most developed countries the incidence of cervical 2 cancer has been drastically reduced thanks to cervical cancer screening programmes. '\u00ad QJ \"' ..c: However despite screening the incidence of cervical cancer is still at levels that warrant implementations of further measures to reduce it in most countries. For example, in the Netherlands approximately 600-700 women are annually diagnosed with cervical cancer in a population of 8.3 million women.53 54 The causal relationship between cervical cancer and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is generally accepted.55 Studies in the last decades have shown that HPV-infection is a prerequis ite for cervical cancer, and that persistency of the infection is especially important.56 In particular, infection with one of the oncogenic types of HPV may develop into cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of grades 1 through 3 and ultimately into cancer. Major oncogenic serotypes are 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68,5758 although additional oncogenic types such as 73 and 82 have also been implied.59 61 Additional HPV types, other than those subtypes explicitly labelled as oncogenic, may be considered low-risk HPV serotypes regarding their progression to cancer. Of the oncogenic types, types 16 and 18 have shown to be responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer worldwide.62 63 Recently two types of been developed and registered.60 63\u00b767 Clinical studies have considered vaccine outcomes relating to CIN stages 2 and 3 (CIN 2+) and cancer in situ, as well as HPV infections. These studies have shown that the HPV 16/18 vaccines have good safety profiles and are effective in preventing (persistent) infection with HPV types 16 and 18, in preventing CIN2+ related to types 16 and 18 and partially effective in preventing 24 Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus16/18 for the prevention of cervical cancer: adaption of an existing cohort model to the situation in the Netherlands. CIN2+ related to other oncogenic HPV types. Vaccine efficacies for up to 6.4 years of protection ranged from 94 -100 for (persistent) infection with HPV types 16 and 18,636668\u00b771 90 -99% for CIN2+ with HPV types 16 and and 46 -68% for CIN2+ of all HPV types.73 74 Additionally, evidence on cross-protection regarding infections of serotypes 31 and 45 have been presented, with 5.5-year efficacies at 54% and 88% respectively. 66 69 74\u00b776 Finally, efficacy against persistent infection with all non-vaccine oncogenic types was found at 27 - 38% over a time period of 12 months.66 68 69 73 74 For reimbursement decisions on prophylactic HPV vaccination in the Netherlands, health-economic assessments are essential in the present situation; i.e. a favourable cost\u00ad effectiveness ratio currently has to be provided before a positive recommendation for any drug or vaccine is given.77 78 For example, health economics were crucial in deciding whether or not to implement meningococcal C and 7-valent pneumococcal infant vaccinations in the Dutch National Immunisation Programme (NIP).7000 Also, one of both HPV 16/18 vaccines was initially rejected for reimbursement in the Dutch Drug Reimbursement System (DRS) on the ground of insufficient evidence of a favourable health-economic profile.77 For HPV\u00ad vaccines both the DRS and the NIP present potential routes for reimbursement in the Netherlands, with health economics as one predominant criterium. 81 As mentioned, in the Netherlands 600 -700 cases of cervical cancer occur every year; despite the existence of an effective screening programme.53 The National Cervical Cancer Screening Programme (NCCSP) in the Netherlands includes approximately 68-77% of women between the ages of 30 and 60 years in their invitational screening were women get screened every 5 years.31 53 82 Within this programme approximately 490,000 cytology tests are analyzed annually, preventing an estimated number of 1500 cervical cancer cases per year.83 This paper aims to estimate the costs and effects of introducing HPV vaccination for girls to be covered by the Dutch NIP. Life-years gained (LYG) are considered as the primary effect measure of interest, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained are additionally provided. Costs and health outcomes are compared within the formal Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) by contrasting vaccination on top of the NCCSP with the NCCSP alone. Ballpark figures on acceptable ICERs for vaccines included in the Dutch NIP are available: low-risk elderly influenza and elderly pneumococcal vaccination both at approximately \u20ac10,000 per LYG and infant pneumococcal vaccination at \u20ac16,200 per LYG or \u20ac14,600 per QALY gained (all updated to 2007).79 so 84 It has been suggested that ICE Rs below \u20ac20,000 per LYG might reflect acceptable cost-effectiveness for vaccination programmes in the Netherlands. 85 Finally, a further alternative threshold for the ICER may be derived from a country's Gross National Product (GNP) per capita, which is just over \u20ac30,000 for the Netherlands, 86 implying favourable cost-effectiveness if the ICER is below \u20ac30,000 (once the GNP /capita) or \u20ac60,000 (twice) per LYG and/or QALY.87 25 2 \"' ..c: A number of differences between both vaccines now registered should be noted. In particular, both include protection against HPV serotypes 16 and 18, yet one of them is bivalent (Cervarix), and the other is quadrivalent (Gardasil, also including serotypes 6 and 11). The differences between the branded vaccines were not elaborated in this paper, since we chose to focus on cervical outcomes. Methods General Model Design Cost-effectiveness modeling cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination has previously been reviewed00-91 and both static92 95 and dynamic% 97 models have been developed. Dynamic models explicitly model the transmission of HPV in the population with the force of infection being dependent on the number of infected individuals at any moment in time. In a static model the force of infection remains constant over time. It has been noted that for the initial questions relating to policy decisions about HPV vaccination - in particular , whether teenage girls should be vaccinated -static and dynamic models may provide similar results and model choice should be driven by preferring the least complex model that still provides valid results88 98 99; i.e. a static model would suffice. For our analysis on vaccinating teenage Dutch girls, we selected a previously published static model and adapted it to the Dutch situation.89 100 Given the similarity of the static models developed so far, we would not expect major differences if another model were selected for adaptation. ---- --- ---.-----,,---r- -----------,. HPV lnfecred Mortality Cancer ------------- ' Screen ing Figure 1. Schematic representation of the model. The model specifies between 7 types of HPV infections: serotypes 16, 18, 31, 45, 52, and non-onco9enic serotypes 26 Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination papillomavirus 16/18 for the prevention of cervical cancer: adaption of an existing cohort model to the situation in the Netherlands. The model was designed as a generic model to be applied in various country-specific settings. The Markov model simulates the progression from HPV infection through CIN stages 1-3 to cervical cancer (Figure 1). Notably, women progress through the model according to transition probabilities that were estimated from the literature.89 100 The model version we applied distinguishes 7 categories of HPV types: 16, 18, 31, 45, 52, other oncogenic subtypes and low-risk HPV.100 In the model it was assumed that concomitant infections with different HPV types were not possible. Further, a subdivision into histology-identi fiable health states was made: normal histology, CINl, CIN2, CIN3, and four sub-stages for cervical cancer as defined by the Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), stage 1 through 4. The model was calibrated by varying parameter estimates over the ranges specified in a literature review, taking the NCCSP explicitly into account (see below). For calibration, age and type specific HPV prevalence, HPV-type distribution in normal and disease states, CIN stage-specific prevalence, cervical cancer incidence and cervical cancer mortality were used to parameterize the mode1.101-1o4 The model evaluated a cohort of uninfected 12-year old girls once in the absence of vaccination (screening only) and once in the presence of vaccination at the age of 12 being added to screening, with respect to epidemiol ogical and screening outcomes, such as HPV\u00ad infections, screening tests, cases of various CIN-stages, cases of cervical cancer, cancer deaths and life-years lost to cervical cancer. The cohort size was set at 100,000, reflecting the approximate number of 12-year old girls in the Netherlands today 54 and was simulated in the Markov model during the entire lifetimes of these cohort members. In addition to cervical cancer death, overall mortality was included in the model.105 In the next stage, epidemiological outcomes were linked to economic costing parameters, regarding cytology tests, colposcopies, biopsies, treatment of CIN-stages and treatment of cervical cancer. Quality oflife parameters were also assessed. Differences between the \"screening only\", and \"vaccination added\" cohort evaluations, regarding outcomes and costs, provided the basis for estimating the ICERs in terms of net costs per life-year gained. Below we provide more details on several model aspects. Inclusion of the Screening Programme Transitions within the progression-of-disease component of the model are impacted by the probability of being screened and treated. Asymptomatic cancer and pre-cancerous CIN lesions can be detected through screening. Cytology-based screening has been present in the Netherlands for a number of decades now, and the programme has been optimized based on various evaluations, inclusive of cost-effectiveness analyses, with an estimated cost per LYG at \u20ac15,500 for screening versus no screening.31106\u00b7109 Since 1996 all women between the age of 30 and 60 are invited through the organized screening programme to visit their General Practitioner to have a cytology test every 5 years. 27 The cytological outcome determines the follow-up, which can be (i) referral to a specialist for treatment of lesions, (ii) repeat cytology on the short term (6 months) for CIN abnormalities or (iii) repeat cytology in 5 years ifno abnormalities are detected. In addition, the specification of cytology tests to be further followed up has been narrowed further since 1996 to enhance the efficiency of the programme.109 Modelled screening parameters were based on literature values indicating that the compliance to the programme is about 80% during a five-year period 82 and approximately 10% of women do not attend screening at all.110 Furthermore, opportunistic screening that occurs, with preventive cytology tests being taken on the initiative of the woman or her physician. However, as these tests are not reimbursed if performed without clear medical need, these opportunistic cytology tests are limited in number and have recently further decreased.111 Therefore, opportunistic cytology tests were therefore ignored in our model. All relevant assumptions made in the model regarding the Dutch NCCSP were previously reported, including performance characteristics of cytology, biopsy and colposcopy.89 Assumptions on Costin9 & Quality of Life Due to vaccination, the number of CIN and cervical cancer cases in the Dutch population are projected to decrease. Estimated direct medical costs for the management of cervical disease 2 used in the model are listed in Table 1, in addition to the estimated quality-of-life impacts.83107 111 114 In line with the Dutch guidelines for pharmacoeconomic research, both direct and indirect 21 non-medical costs were included in the costing, in particular traveling costs and production Jg losses, respectively.115 Also in line with the Dutch guidelines, we used quality-adjusted life years as additional outcome measure (QALYs). For the vaccine \u20ac100 per single dose was analyzed in the base case (in sensitivity analysis a range of \u20ac80-120 was investigated). Additionally , an administ ration cost of \u20ac5 per dose was included in each of the model simulations.79 The total annual cost of the Dutch NCCSP amounted to \u20ac26 million in 2001, comprising \u20ac16 million for cytology-related costs, \u20ac9 million for regional organizat ion and \u20ac1 million for a variety of other aspects.82 The majority of these costs will remain unaltered with adding vaccination to the screening programme if the screening intensity and other programme characteristics remain unchanged (as is currently assumed). However, as the number of positive cytology tests will decrease due to vaccination, the number of referrals and repeat cytologies will also decrease. These changes were explicitly taken into account in our analysis. 100 As implementation of HPV vaccination in the Dutch NIP was envisaged for 2008/2009, all costs were assumed to reflect 2008 price levels.114 28 Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus16/18 for the prevention of cervical cancer: adaption of an existing cohort model to the situation in the Netherlands.

This implementation was chosen in the absence of evidence for the HPV 16/18 vaccine on actually lowering cervical cancer incidence. Obviously, studies have not yet had a long enough follow\u00ad up to establish efficacy of the vaccination on cervical cancer directly. Vaccine efficacy was set at 95% against HPV 16/186668 in the base-case (90-100% in sensitivity analysis). Additionally, cross protection was assumed to be 50% againstserotype 31 and 90% againstserotype 45.666 74 75 Vaccine efficacies were assumed to apply after the full scheme of 3 vaccinations. Duration of protection of the HPV16/18 vaccine is now evidenced for 6.4 years.71116 Based on the extended phases of clinical trials, lifelong persistence of antibodies or lifelong protection may not be unrealistic.73 Obviously, if less favourable protection scenarios become a reality, booster vaccinations would become an option for achievement of maximal vaccine benefits. For the base case analysis, we assumed lifelong protection after the initial set of vaccinations. In an alternative scenario, we assumed that lifelong protection would potentially be achieved with the inclusion of a booster after 20 years (approximately coinciding with the first visit within the context of the NCSSP).81 Full coverage for the initial set of vaccinations was assumed 29 2 \"' ..c: for both scenarios. In the sensitivity analysis we analyzed different coverage rates for the booster assuming no protection of the vaccine beyond 20 years after the initial vaccinations. Cost-effectiveness Calculations From the cohort of 12-year-old girls going through the Markov model, various items were tracked. Outcomes for which we provide results included HPV infections (both overall and serotype specific), CIN2+ cases, cervical cancer cases, cytologies, health-care resource use and life-years lived by the cohort. Next, these items were adequately costed. Numerical results on items and costs were compared for model simulations once including and once excluding vaccination. The ICER was defined as the net costs divided by the life-years gained. Net costs resulted from total investment costs in the vaccination minus savings on CIN2+ and cervical cancer treatments, cytology tests, biopsies and colposcopies. Life-years gained resulted from the difference between total life-years lived with vaccination minus those in the absence of vaccination. QALYs were also calculated in the model, and are included in the reported ratios of costs per QALY gained. Finally, specific further features of our model include the following. First, calculations were performed for the cohort of 12-year old girls that was assumed to receive the full scheme of 3 doses. Second, coverage of vaccination was assumed to be 100% for reporting of our results (given the structure of our model, ICERs will not change with varying the vaccine coverage, with lower coverages just providing similar relative reductions in both net costs and life-years gained). Third, if the vaccine is effective in preventing transitions to one type of HPV infection, it was assumed that competing risks of acquiring another oncogenic HPV\u00ad type would apply.100 Discounting of money and life years was done according to the Dutch guidelines for pharmacoeconomic analyses at 4% and 1.5%, respectiv ely.117 118 Discounting was implemented in the model per half year. We do note that internationally differential discounting is controversial50 and therefore sensitivity analysis was extensively directed at the discount rate, besides the aspects mentioned above ( duration of protection and vaccine price). Scenario analysis was directed at the potential future inclusion of a booster in the vaccination strategy and at possible price reductions. Probabilistic analysis was performed on the base case, assuming beta distributions on efficacies (95%-conf idence intervals from Harper et al. were used for this purpose66 68) and gamma distributions for costs (Table 1100), and beta distribution for disutilities expressed in QALYs. For one probabilistic sensitivity analysis 1000 model simulations were completed. 30 Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus 16/18 for the prevention of cervical cancer: adaption of an existing cohort model to the situation in the Netherlands. Resul ts Clinical Results To estimate the cost-effectiveness of HPV immunisation of 12-year old Dutch girls, the Markov model was calibrated on data specific for the situation in the Netherlands. Figure 2 shows the model calibration results for HPV prevalence, cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The figure illustrates the good model fit for the finally selected set of parameters. In the base case, vaccination was estimated to reduce the number of HPV16 and 18 cases by 95%, those with serotype 31 by 50% and those with 45 by approximat ely 90%, as was inserted into the model. Corresponding estimated overall reductions in CINZ+ and cervical cancer cases were 57% and 74%, on the baseline numbers of cases in the non-vaccina ted arm, which were 1527 Age group _ 15 u .!:!

After immunisation of the full cohort of12-year old girls, in the base-case analysis 2,907 life years would be saved/gained (1,234 if discounted). Discounted savings related to vaccination were estimated at \u20ac2,893,000 for the full cohort of 100,000 girls, with two-thirds of the savings being related to averted cases of cervical cancer (Figure 3). Vaccination costs minus discounted savings divided by the life-years gained rendered an ICER at Biopsy savings due to HPV vaccination (totalling \u20ac2,893,000). Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis To fully evaluate the level of uncertainty in the outcomes, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed. Figure 4 presents the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) corresponding with the PSA on the base case, based on 1000 Markov simulatio ns. The CEAC shows the probability of being cost-effective for specific thresholds or ceiling ratios for cost\u00ad effectiveness on the x-axis, as estimated from the proportion of simulations with an ICER below the specific ceiling chosen. For example, the estimated median ICER from the PSA amounts to approximately \u20ac23,000 per LYG. Furthermore, given the model uncertainty, 95% of simulations were found to be below \u20ac24,800 per LYG and 100% below \u20ac29,000. 0 :;::; I'!! ose) Figure 4.

Sensitivity & Scenario Analysis The robustness of the estimated base-case ICER was determined in a deterministic sensitivity analysis. In particular, our sensitivity analysis was directed to the impact of vaccine price, discount rate, duration of vaccine protection and the potential need for a booster immunisation. Not surprisingly, the cost-effectiveness ratio was sensitive to the vaccine price (Figure SJ. For example, in a scenario where the vaccine price would be reduced to \u20ac80, which could be the case within a large-scale NIP vaccination, cost-effectiveness would improve to \u20ac17,900 per LYG. If the current pharmacy price of \u20ac120 is applied, cost-effectiveness would be around \u20ac27,500 per LYG. The correspon ding range for net costs per QALY ranges from \u20ac14,600 to \u20ac22,400. Given the relative size of the discounted medical savings compared with the vaccination costs, cost-effectiveness is not sensitive to plausible changes in those savings. For example, a reduction in discounted savings by 10% results in an increase of only 1 % in the cost-effectiveness ratio, either per LYG or per QALY (not shown). 1.0-.----------------, 0.9 0.8 0.7 't, 0.6 8 0.5 0.4 :C 0.3 _g 0.2 Figure 5. Sensitivity analysis on the vaccine price, vaccine price in \u20ac's (excluding administration costs), cost\u00ad effectiveness in costs per life-year gained. Further analysis revealed that the cost-effectiveness ratio is highly sensitive to the discount rate (Table 2). The Netherlands is rather unique in requiring differential discounting of monetary and health units.50 Applying equal discounting at rates suggested by others, easily doubles the net costs per LYG and per QALY gained. However, if the discount rate as prescribed for health (1.5%) would be applied in equal discounting for money as well, cost\u00ad effectiveness improves to just over \u20ac20,000 per LYG (\u20ac16,400 per QALY). Table 4 illustrates that results are highly sensitive to the discount rate of life years as these are gained in the relatively distant future (average age mortality 67.3 years), whereas sensitivity to the discount rate for money is limited as the majority of monetary impact relates to vaccination costs on the short term. 33 Table 2.

Money Health gains ICER Base case 4% 1.5% \u20ac22,700 Dutch guideline up to 2005. If a single booster vaccination, given 20 years following the original vaccination, was included in the analysis, the ICER was estimated at \u20ac26,600 LYG (\u20ac21,700 per QALY), assuming full uptake of the booster. If uptake of the booster would be limited to only half of the population that received the initial set of vaccinations, and duration of protection was limited to only 2 20 years for those who did not receive the booster, the ICER would increase to \u20ac29,200 per LYG (\u20ac24,000 per QALY). ln the absence of a booster for all and duration of protection of 20 years, ICER was \u20ac31,700 per LYG (\u20ac26,400 per QALY). \"' ..c: Discussion Our analyses illustrate that there is good potential for HPV 16/18 vaccination of 12- year old girls to be cost-effective in the Netherlands. Generally, cost-effectiveness ratios were found below \u20ac30,000 per LYG and QALY both in our base-case and in the sensitivity analyses. Our analyses are in line with previous analyses that have been published for the Netherlands.53 81 119 In particular, specifically for the purpose of the reimbursement of the quadrivalent vaccine within the Dutch DRS, one previous analysis focused on the Dutch situation. 82 The base-case estimate from that analysis amounted to net costs of \u20ac21,900 per QALY gained for vaccinating Dutch girls aged 13-15 years old. If expressed per life-year gained, these net costs would expectedly be somewhat higher than our base-case estimate at \u20ac22,700 per LYG. Yet, the vaccine price applied in the analysis for the quadrivalent vaccine was \u20ac118, as opposed to \u20ac100 in our analysis. Additionally, we assumed \u20ac5 for administration costs of the vaccine within the NIP, whereas in the analysis for the DRS significantly higher costs apply for delivering and administering the vaccine through the network of pharmacists and GPs. 34 Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus16/18 for the prevention of cervical cancer: adaption of an existing cohort model to the situation in the Netherlands. For a vaccine price of \u20ac100, Boot et al. reported a very similar range as we found for the ICER per LYG at \u20ac24,000-28,000. 53 Here the upper bound was found by assuming a booster at the age of 30 years, and the lower assuming lifelong protection provided with the initial set of vaccination. Finally, the Health Council recently reported a range for the net costs per QALY of \u20ac20,000 -\u20ac30,000, based on studies from the Erasmus University in Rotterdam and the Free University in Amsterdam.81 Despite relevant differences in the organization of and compliance to the screening, analyses for neighbouring countries indicate similar results for HPV vaccination cost-effectiveness. For the Belgian situation it was calculated that cost-effectiveness of HPV-vaccination would be approximately \u20ac23,000 per LYG.98 Inclusion of a booster may be expected to worsen this cost-effectiveness to the same magnitude as indicated in our analysis, i.e. approaching \u20ac30,000 per life-year gained. For Germany, Schneider et al. analyzed the public-health impact of HPV vaccinatio n.119 These authors showed that major potentials for favourable cost\u00ad effectiveness exist for a cohort of 400,000 girls with only screening in place. Implementation of HPV vaccination was projected to reduce the number of cervical cancer deaths from 1,376 to 250.119 Our model evaluated the efficacy of the vaccine at reducing infections with HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 45 at stages prior to serious morbidity and mortality. Ultimately, HPV-vaccine clinical trials have been and will be designed to show efficacy/effectiveness on CIN2+ and cervical cancer cases. For validating our model, we compared the model-predicted vaccine effectiveness on CIN2+ cases of all types (not only those related to vaccine types) with findings of vaccine effectiveness on CIN2+ from clinical studies. It is re-assuring that the modelled effectiveness of vaccination on CIN2+ in the base-case at 57% in our approach is well in the range found for reductions of CIN2+ cases in the clinical trials with 6-year follow\u00ad up ( 46 -68% for CIN2+ ).74 7s As mentioned in the Introduction, differences exist between the two available vaccines that may ultimately result in differences in cost-effectiveness for the use of these vaccines, although this has yet to be determined. In particular, the additional inclusion in the quadrivalent vaccine of serotypes 6 and 11 is associated with additional benefits on the incidence of genital warts. As these benefits occur on the short term and are therefore less influenced by discounting, Brisson et al. 92 showed that inclusion of QALY-benefits of genital warts has the potential of improving cost-effectiveness by one-third. Given the higher discount rate of 3% for QALYs used by Brisson et al., we would not expect an impact that high for the Netherlands with a lower guideline-speci fied discount rate at 1.5% for QALYs in the Netherlands. Obviously, results per LYG would not be influenced by inclusion of genital warts, as genital warts do not cause mortality . Secondly, anti-HPV immunogenicity patterns in time after vaccination differ for both vaccines, in particular regarding serotype 18 where a superior profile is seen for the bivalent over the quadrivalent vaccine.120 35 2 '\u00ad QJ \"' ..c: 121 Clinical significance of these published differences in immunogenicity has yet to be demonstrated in further studies regarding potential clinically relevant differences in duration of protection.86 Conclusion Our analyses illustrate that prophylactic vaccination of 12-year-old girls to prevent cervical cancer is highly likely to be cost-effective. Generally, cost-effectiveness ratios below \u20ac30,000 per life-year gained or QALY were estimated, both in the base-case and sensitivity analyses. Obviously, long-lasting protection by the vaccination is crucial for achieving favourable cost-effectiveness. Limited duration of protection of the initial vaccination schedule could be supported by boosting, which was also been shown to be cost-effective. From a health\u00ad economic perspective, introduction of HPV vaccination of young teenage girls seems justified in the Netherlands. Despite this positive outlook, other aspects will need to be considered, including budgetary impact analyses and ethical considerations in relation to vaccination catch-up programmes and the future of cervical screening. 36 Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavi rus16/18 for the prevention of cervical cancer: adaption of an existing cohort model to the situation in the Netherlands. 37 38 Until which age should women be vaccinated against HPV infection? Recomm endation Maarten Postma Jan C Wilschut journal of Infectious Diseases 2011:204:377-84 3 Abstract Introduction: Cervical cancer is caused by infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Several countries have implemented vaccination programmes against HPV for teenage girls before sexual debut. However, recent clinical trials have demonstrated that vaccination of older women is highly effective as well. Accordingly, it has been suggested that these older women should also be offered vaccination. Here, the cost-effectiveness of HPV-vaccination for older women was assessed. Methods: A Markov model was used to estimate age-specific health benefits and cost savings of HPV-vaccination for women 12-50 years of age, in the Netherlands. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the outcomes. State-of-the-art health-economic methods were used and international health-economic guidelines were followed. Results: HPV-vaccination is highly cost-effective for girls aged 12-16 years. Remarkably, cost-effectiveness only slowly declines with increasing age of the vaccinees up to 25 years. Indeed, substantial health benefits can be obtained by vaccinating women in this age group at acceptable costs. Beyond this age, cost-effectiveness of HPV-vaccination rapidly declines. Conclusions: Not only HPV-vaccination of girls before sexual debut is a highly effective and cost-effective strategy for prevention of cervical cancer, also vaccination of women until the age of 25 years is generally cost-effective. 40 Until which age should women be vaccinated against HPV infection? Recommendation based on cost-effectiveness analyses Introduction In the European Union, two prophylactic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil, have been approved for vaccination of women up to 26 years.122 Cervarix is a bivalent vaccine containing antigen derived from HPV16 and -18. Gardasil is a quadrivalent vaccine which, in addition to HPV16 and -18 antigen, also contains antigen derived from HPV6 and -11. 122123 Both vaccines are highly efficacious in prevention of HPV16 and -18 infection among HPV-nai\"ve women. 124 Together, HPV16 and -18 cause approximately 70% of all cases of cervical cancer worldwide. HPV6 and -11 are responsible for 80-90% of cases of genital warts. In the European Union, the cervical cancer incidence and mortality is approximately 10.7 and 3.5 per 100,000 women, respectively.125 Since licensure of the HPV-vaccines, many European countries have introduced routine HPV-immunisation programmes for teenage girls before sexual debut. Generally the age of vaccination of these girls is around 12 years, varying among different countries from 11 to 14 years.126 Besides annual vaccination of these girls, several countries have also implemented ad hoc catch-up programmes covering older teenage girls up to -18 years. For example, in the Netherlands and the UK routine HPV\u00ad vaccination was introduced for 12-and 13-year old girls. Furthermore, catch-up programmes including teenage girls up to 16 or 18 years, respectively, were implemented in 2008. A few countries have offered HPV-vaccination to women at older age in catch-up programmes or on an individual basis. For example, the USA and France offer HPV-vaccination to women up to 26 years of age.126127 Unfortunately, despite the severity of the disease and the high vaccine efficacy, generally catch-up HPV vaccination did not reach a high coverage. 128\u00b713\u00b0 For example, in the Netherlands and the UK, vaccine uptake in the catch-up programmes was less than 50%.129131132 As a result, many of these teenage girls are still at risk of acquiring an HPV16 or -18 infection later on in life. Recently, several clinical trials have shown that not only HPV-vaccination of young teenage girls, but also vaccination of older girls and women induces high virus-neutralizing antibody titers.133\u00b7135 Consequently, in addition to vaccination of young teenage girls, implementation of vaccination programmes for older girls and women could potentially prevent a significant burden of disease. Especially women in the age range of 18-30 years could benefit, as the risk of infection is highest in this group.1\u00b0 Clearly, only HPV16-and HPV18-negative women would benefit from the vaccination, as both HPV-vaccines are prophylactic vaccines.136 An advantage of vaccinating women against HPV16 and -18 at older ages would be that it might weaken concerns about a possibly limited duration of protection, since the women would be vaccinated at or close to the moment they are at highest risk of becoming infected. 10 Indeed, there is uncertainty about the duration of protection of HPV-vaccination, due to the as yet relatively short periods of follow-up after vaccination. Protection is now formally 41 3 \"' ..c: proven to be 7.3 and 9 years for Cervarix and Gardasil, respectively.137\u00b71J9 Therefore, it may be validly questioned if the vaccination at 12 years would still provide protection one or more decades after the initial vaccination, when sexual activity may be highest. While, it has been shown that the HPV-vaccines are effective in the older age groups, it remains unclear how all above aspects impact on the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating women at older ages. In particular , as the HPV-vaccines, at approximately \u20ac100/dose (with 3 doses required), are relatively expensive vaccines compared to other vaccines currently in use, health-ec onomic considerations have played an important role in the decision-making process. For example, in the UK the Department of Health decided to include girls up to 18-years of age in a catch-up programme based on the cost-effectiveness results of Jit et a/.40 Previously, we have shown that HPV-vacc ination at 12-years of age is cost-effective in the Netherlands.140 However, as the vaccine coverage of the catch-up programmes is relatively low ( <50%) and new data have become available on the vaccines' efficacy in older women, the question arises if it is worthwhile to vaccinate women at an age beyond the age range of the current catch-up program. Using recent data on the efficacy of vaccination of women in general and at older ages in particular, we have now adjusted our economic model and present the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of HPV-vaccination of women 12-50 years of age in the Netherlands, in the context of the current cervical cancer screening programme. Methods Model We adjusted and modified our previous Markov model for HPV-infection to estimate the age-specific health benefits and cost-effectiveness of first-time HPV-vaccination in the Netherlands, with a focus on ages beyond the coverage of the current vaccination programme . The model structure is shown in Figure 1 and specific details of the model can be found in three recent papers. For example, assumptions on disease-related costs and QALY losses were adapted from these papers.100 140 141 Briefly, the model simulates the progression of HPV-infection through cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) stages 1-3 on to cervical cancer stages 1-4 for seven different HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 45, \"other high-risk types\", and \"low-risk types\"). The model contains probabilities between \"HPV-susceptible\" and \"HPV-infected\" reflect the forces of infection for the different types. In the model, HPV vaccination reduces the force of infection by a constant according to the observed clinical vaccine efficacy. Thus, women who are in the health state of \"HPV-susceptible\" directly benefit from the vaccination. Women in other health states, who have experienced a prior HPV-infection, will only benefit from the vaccination after natural clearance or treatment of the infection, given the assumed absence of therapeutic efficacy of the vaccination. In the model, it is assumed that women do not 42 Until which age should women be vaccinated against HPV infection? Recommendation based on cost-effectiveness analyses develop natural immunity against HPV-infection and may return to \"HPV-susceptible\" after leaving the compartment of \"HPV-infected\".

The model specifies between seven types af HPV infection (16, 18, 31, 33, 45, other oncogenic serotypes and other non-oncogenic serotypes). The model was calibrated to age-and type-specific HPV-prevalence, 103 cervical cancer incidence, and cervical cancer mortality, 142 taking into account the Dutch national cervical cancer screening programme, e.g. women 30-60 years are screened at a 5-year interval. The calibration process has been extensively described previously. 100 141 In short, based on a literature search, the transition probabilities between different health states were estimated. The transition probabilities were varied within their 95% confidence intervals to obtain the optimal goodness-of-fit for HPV prevalence, cervical cancer incidence and mortality, determined by calculating the average percentage of deviation. Note, that we calibrated our model to epidemiological data in the Netherlands from the period before HPV\u00ad vaccination was introduced. Obviously, our current model refers to the present situation in the Netherlands with vaccination now going on for a few years. Although in the meanwhile approximately 50% of Dutch teenage girls of 12-16 years of age are vaccinated against HPV16 and -18, we considered it plausible to assume that this has not yet substantially influenced the force of infection. Vaccine Characteristics In the initial clinical trials, it has been shown that both HPV-vaccines are highly effective (95%) against HPV16 and -18 infections, until the age of 26.17 138 143\u00b7145 Furthermore, cross- 43 protection against HPV31, -33 and -45 has also been demonstra ted.17143147 For older women (e.g. >26 years of age) less clinical data are available regarding the vaccines' efficacies. For both vaccines, it has been shown that the vaccine-induced virus-neutralizing antibody titers decrease with age of vaccination. 134 135 However, antibody levels after vaccination remain much higher than the levels after a natural infection. It has also been shown that the vaccines' efficacy against a 6-months persistent infection is somewhat lower in women 24-45 years of age at the time of vaccination (83.1 %, 95%C.I. 50.6-95.8%) compared to that in adolescents (95%), but nevertheless, protective efficacy remains very high.134148 In our base-case, a high vaccine efficacy at 95% was assumed for all age groups.17 138146 In the base-case, we assumed no cross-protection against other HPV-types, since the cross\u00ad protective efficacy differs between both vaccines and evidence for cross-protection requires further support despite preliminary results indicating potentials for it.17 146 Furthermore, it was initially assumed that the vaccine would provide lifelong protection and that the cost of vaccination would be \u20ac105/dose, as listed in the Dutch Drug Reimbursement System.149150 Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed on the base-case, assuming a beta distribution for efficacies (95% confidence intervals from Paavonen et a/.17 were used for 3 this purpose) and a gamma distribution for costs, and a beta distribution for disutilities expressed in QALYs.14\u00b0 For one PSA, 1000 simulations were completed. [ Outcome Measures & Cost-effectiveness Analyses cu ..c: u In the model, the clinical and health-economic impact of HPV-vaccination is analyzed for women at different ages (12-50 years) in one-year age cohorts. In the analysis, a one-year age cohort of women is followed twice over the full lifetime ( until death or 100 years): once as a first-time vaccinated cohort and once as an unvaccinated cohort. A 100% vaccine coverage for the complete vaccination schedule (3 doses) was assumed. However, given that our model is a \"static\" model, results on cost-effectiveness are insensitive to this particular assumption. The model tracks the total number of CIN and cervical cancer cases, deaths, costs, and health effects, the latter expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or life years (LYs). By summing all the costs, LYs and QALYs, and by subsequently calculating the differences between the two cohorts, one without and one with vaccination, the model provided estimates for net costs, LYs and QALYs gained. By dividing the net costs by the LYs and QALYs gained, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was determined. Health effects and costs were differentially discounted according to Dutch guidelines for health-economic research at 1.5% and 4%, respectively. ICERs were calculated for individual one-year age groups, enabling us to estimate the cost-effectiveness for HPV-vaccination at different ages. In the Netherlands, ICERs below \u20ac20,000/QALY are generally labeled as \"cost-effective\". In many cases, higher thresholds up to \u20ac50,000/QALY are considered acceptable as well, for 44 Until which age should women be vaccinated against HPV infection? Recommendation based on cost-effectiv eness analyses example, ICERs upto \u20ac30,000/QAL Y are still highly likely to be considered as favourable. 151 On the other hand, ICE Rs above \u20ac80,000 /QALY reflect unfavourable cost-effectiveness in the Netherlands. 152 Finally, ICERs in between \u20ac50,000/QALY and 80,000/Q ALY are likely to be considered unfavourable. 151 Sensitivity & Scenario Analysis Since there is uncertainty about the vaccines' efficacy and the duration of protection and since the vaccine price may vary, we performed several sensitivity and scenario analyses to evaluate the robustness of our results. First, assumptions regarding the vaccine efficacy were evaluated in two differentsubanalyses: (i) vaccine efficacy was decreased to 83.1 % for all age groups, as indicated above,134 and (ii) cross-protection against other HPV types was included (Table 1). Cross-protection against non-vaccine HPV-types was included as reported for the bivalent vaccine.17 Table 1. Parameters used in the model. Parameter Cohort size Screening coverage Vaccine coverage Vaccine efficacy HPV16/18 HPV31 HPV33 HPV45 Vaccination costs Duration of protection 100,000 80% 100% 95% 0 -75.7% \u20ac65-\u20ac125 20 years 1 dose after 20 years Reference 140 140 140 146,134 146 146 146 150 149 \"Booster dose wos combined into a scenario in which the vaccine induced immunity wanes after 20 years. \u20ac1.00 = $1.29 (November 2010) Next, the impact of waning immunity on the ICER was analyzed. As vaccine efficacy has only been proven for 9 /7.3 years after vaccination, in this scenario the duration of protection was reduced from lifelong to 20 years. 137 149 Such \"medium-term\" protection can be motivated, since after 9/7.3 years antibody titers remained high and no clinically relevant reduction in protection has been reported. 137 Furthermore, the impact of an additional one-dose booster, 20 years after the initial vaccination scheme, was analyzed, assuming the booster to provide lifelong protection thereafter. 45 Finally, the impact of the vaccine price on the ICER was analyzed. When vaccination strategies are implemented in the context of national immunisation programmes substantial price reductions are likely to be granted by the vaccine manufacturers. Since the actual price that is paid by the Dutch government for the HPV-vaccine is not publicly known, we varied the vaccine price in a range from \u20ac45 to \u20ac125 per dose. In this range we also included \u20ac125 per dose, to consider the contribution of (varying) vaccination costs.153 Results Health Benefits In the absence of vaccination, but taking the Dutch cervical cancer screening programme into account, the model predicted an annual number of 565 cervical cancer cases and 205 cervical cancer-related deaths in a cohort of 100,000 women in the Netherlands, who were followed during their lifetime (Figure 2). Addition of HPV-vaccination to the current Dutch cervical cancer screening programme resulted in a reduction in cervical cancer cases, mortality , LYs lost and QALYs Iost.140 Although the benefits 3 of HPV-vaccination were sensitive to the age of the vaccinee, important health benefits were consistently found for vaccination up to 25 years of age (Figure 2). Obviously, the health benefits of vaccination gradually decline with the age of the vaccinee. Nevertheless, a 50% reduction in _g cervical cancer incidence can be obtained by vaccination of women till the age of 25. Above 25 years of age, the clinical benefits of HPV-vaccination start to decline more rapidly. :S 1600 Q) 1600 0 0 1400 0 1200 [ 1000 \"' Q) 5 600 0 soo Q) \u00a7 400 C Q) :;:j 200 .c <( Age of vaccination Figure 2.

Recommendation based on cost-effectiveness analyses Cost-effectiveness As the health gains among women above 30 years of age are limited, we only determined the ICER of HPV-vaccination for women 12-35 years of age. Figure 3 shows the cost\u00ad effectiveness acceptability curves for HPV vaccination at different ages. The ICER of HPV\u00ad vaccination for 12-year-old girls was \u20ac19,900/Q 30-year-old women.

The JCER of the current catch-up program, i.e. the average ICER for girls aged 13-16 year, was estimated at \u20ac22,500/Q ALY. Extension of the age groups in potential catch-up programmes resulted in average ICERs of \u20ac23,500 and \u20ac26,900/Q ALY for inclusion of all girls/women 12-18 or 12-25 years of age, respectively. Sensitivity & Scenario Analyses In further sensitivity analyses, the impact of vaccine efficacy, duration of protection, and vaccine price were analyzed (Figures 4-6). Figure 4 shows that including the benefits of cross-protection against HPV31, -33 and -45 resulted in a further improvement of the cost\u00ad effectiveness of the vaccination, the ICER now remaining below \u20ac30,000/Q ALY even for women of 25 years of age. Lowering of the vaccines' efficacy to 83.1% for all age groups resulted in a slight increase of the ICE Rs (Figure 4). 47 3 ,_ C. \"' ..c: u 30000 iii 0 u cii 20000 c Ql E 10000 u .\u00a3 0 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Age of vaccination (years) Figure 4.

Discussion Recently, it has been argued that HPV-vaccination should be offered not only to teenage girls but also to older women.134135154 The arguments were primarily based on favourable efficacy data from clinical trials134 135 rather than on cost-effectiveness considerations. In this study, we show that not only substantial health benefits can be obtained by vaccinating women till the age of 25 years, but also that vaccination of these women is generally cost-effective with ICERs below \u20ac30,000 per QALY gained. On the other hand, for women of 30 years and older; HPV-vaccination becomes less attractive, with ICERs rising above \u20ac30,000 or even \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained. For women between 25 and 30 years, a potential for favourable cost-effec tiveness exists, depending mostly on the vaccine price. This is the first study which analyses in detail the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of HPV-vaccination for women in individual one-year age groups up to an age of SO years. Our analysis shows potentials for favourable cost-effectiveness up to ages far beyond the age categories currently implicated in catch-up programmes for HPV-vaccination in, for example, the UK and the Netherlands. Importantly, the outcomes predicted by our model 49 would appear to be quite robust, based on sensitivity analyses. We note that our sensitivity analyses did not include transition probabilities, since these were used to calibrate the model. Base-case values may, therefore, be considered as \"optimal\" values. In this analysis, we used a static model to predict the outcome of HPV-vaccination among different age groups. One might argue that for modeling of infectious diseases, a dynamic approach -in which herd-immunity benefits are taken into account -would be preferable. Clearly, due to widespread introduction of HPV-vaccination programmes among teenage girls, herd-immunity benefits will arise. However, as yet, these benefits are likely to be limited, certainly for women above 18-20 years of age, since at this point vaccination coverage in these older age groups will be very low and HPV-transmission is likely to occur in a strongly age-assorted fashion. Obviously, as the girls who have been vaccinated thusfar grow older, the contribution of herd immunity to protection against HPV in the older age groups will increase, and may then warrant the use of dynamic transmission modelling approaches. However, in the current situation, the use of a static model is not only justified but possibly even preferable, since static modelling improves the transparency and robustness of the results. To assess the long-term impact of HPV-vaccination and herd immunity among unvaccinated girls and older women, we are currently developing a 3 dynamic transmission model. \"' -= u As shown in sensitivity analysis, the estimated ICE Rs in this study are strongly dependent on assumptions regarding vaccine price and duration of protection. In the base-case, we assumed a price for the vaccine of \u20ac105/dose. Under these conditions, using a cut-off of \u20ac30,000/QAL Y, HPV-vaccination is cost-effective for individual one-year age cohorts up to an age of 23 years. However, it is known that significant discounts can be achieved on registered vaccine prices, in particular when the vaccination is implemented in a national immunisation programme. In our analysis, with discounts of \u20ac20 or \u20ac40 / dose, vaccination remains cost-effective for individual one-year age cohorts up to an age of 27 or 30 years, respective ly. As the time of follow-up for the two registered HPV-vaccines is still limited, there is uncertainty about the duration of vaccine-induced protection. However, based on the relatively slow waning of antibody titers after vaccination, David et al. -using extrapolation methods -estimated that at least the bivalent HPV-vaccine is likely to induce lifelong protection.149 Accordingly, in our base-case we assumed lifelong protection. If the duration of protection would be limited, HPV-vaccination would become less favourable for all age groups. Even though our study was conducted for the situation in the Netherlands, in general the results also apply for many other Western countries. For example, the results of our study are in line with the conclusions of earlier cost-effectiveness analyses of HPV-vaccination so Until which age should women be vaccinated against HPY infection? Recommendation based on cost-effectiveness analyses indicating that ad hoc catch-up programmes including women up to -24 years is generally cost-effective compared to screening only.40155 156 Our study adds to this conclusion that, for individual one-year age cohorts, HPV-vaccination remains cost-effective up to an age of -25 years, or -depending primarily on the vaccine price -even up to 27 or 30 years. Furthermore, our findings are in line with the conclusion of Kim et al. 157 that the cost-effectiveness of HPV\u00ad vaccination of women 30 years and older is unfavourable. Note that, our findings are slightly more favourable than those of Kim et a/.158 probably due to the lower discount rate applied in the Netherlands to future health outcomes and a lower screening frequency than assumed by Kim et al. Furthermore, Kim et al. assumed a higher screening compliance whereby the incremental benefit of HPV-vaccination will be reduced. However, despite these differences the general conclusions are line with each other. From our study, we conclude that vaccination of 12-year-old girls is a highly ( cost-)effective strategy to prevent HPV infection. Furthermore, we also conclude that large-scale catch-up programmes including women up to 25 years of age will generally be cost-effective at an average ICER of <\u20ac30,000/QALY gained. However, in view of the relatively low vaccination coverage that was achieved in earlier catch-up programmes for teenage girls, it is not very likely that many countries will implement new ad hoc large-scale catch-up vaccination programmes including age groups up to 25 years, despite their potential cost-effectiveness. Therefore, in this study we analyzed the cost-effectiveness of HPV-vaccination of individuals in one-year age groups rather than large catch-up groups. We demonstrate that even for individual-based vaccination, as has been introduced in the US, the ICER remains below \u20ac30,000/QALY gained for women up to 25 years and ranges between \u20ac30,000 and \u20ac50,000 for women up to 30 years of age. With a modest reduction in vaccine price of 33%, even vaccination of individual women up to 30 years of age would remain cost-effective at an ICER of \u20ac30,000/QALY gained. Individual-based vaccination could readily be implemen ted, for example within the context of national drugs reimbursement schemes. For women >30 years of age, addition ofHPV-vaccination to organized cervical cancer screening programmes is unlikely to be cost-effective, and therefore it is probably more beneficial to focus on other interventions to protect them against cervical cancer. 51 52 Inclusion of the bene fits of enhanced cross -protection against cervical cancer and prevention of genital warts in the cost -effectiveness anal ysis of human papilloma virus vaccination, A Westra 2011:204:377-84 4 ... OJ \"' ..c: Abstract Background: Infection with HPV 16 and 18, the major causative agents of cervical cancer, can be prevented through vaccination with a bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine. Both vaccines provide cross-protection against HPV-types not included in the vaccines. In particular , the bivalent vaccine provides additional protection against HPV 31, 33, and 45 and the quadrivalent vaccine against HPV31. The quadrivalent vaccine additionally protects against low-risk HPV type 6 and 11, responsible for most cases of genital warts. In this study, we made an analytical comparison of the two vaccines in terms of cost-effectiveness including the additional benefits of cross-protection and protection against genital warts in comparison with a screening-only strategy. Methods: We used a Markov model, simulating the progression from HPV infection to cervical cancer or genital warts. The model was used to estimate the difference in future costs and health effects of both HPV-vaccines separately. Results: In a cohort of 100,000 women, use of the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine (both at 50% vaccination coverage) reduces the cervical cancer incidence by 221 and 207 cases, corresponding to ICE Rs of \u20ac17,600/Q ALY and \u20ac18,900/QAL Y, respective ly. It was estimated that the quadrivalent vaccine additionally prevents 4390 cases of genital warts, reducing the ICER to \u20ac16,300/QA LY. Assuming a comparable willingness to pay for cancer and genital warts prevention, the difference in ICE Rs could justify a slightly higher price ( -7% per dose) in favour of the quadrivalent vaccine. Conclusions: Clearly, HPV vaccination has been implemented for the prevention of cervical cancer. From this perspective, use of the bivalent HPV vaccine appears to be most effective and cost-effective. Including the benefits of prevention against genital warts, the ICER of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was found to be slightly more favourable. However, current decision-making on the introduction of HPV is driven by the primary cervical cancer outcome. New vaccine tenders could consider the benefits of cross-protection and the benefits of genital warts, which requires more balanced decision-making. 54 Inclusion of the benefits of enhanced cross-protection against cervical cancer and prevention of genital warts in the cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination, in the Netherlands Back ground Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. It is caused by persistent infection with high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV).159 In Europe, two prophylactic HPV vaccines are available, a bivalent and a quadrivalent vaccine. The bivalent ASO4-adjuvanted vaccine (\"Cervarix\"; GlaxoSmithKline) provides protection against infection Dahme), also protects against HPV 6 and 11, in addition to HPV16 and 18. HPV16 and 18 are the two major oncogenic HPV types and are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide.16O HPV6 and 11 are low-risk HPV types; these viruses are responsible for most of the cases of genital warts.161 Obviously, the choice of which vaccine to use will depend on various factors, including the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of the vaccines. In the Netherlands, the decision of implementing HPV vaccination in the context of the National Immunisation Programme (NIP) has been based on the prevention of cervical cancer followed by a vaccine tender offered by the two pharmaceutical companies. Although, in the context of the Dutch drug reimbursement system, the cost of the vaccination -for both vaccines -is listed at \u20ac105 per dose, substantial price reductions are likely to be granted by the vaccine manufacturers. Therefore the predominant focus is on the actual price of the vaccines, and relevant clinical differences between both vaccines are not taken into account. These differences relate to the vaccines' cross-protective efficacies against other, non-vaccine, high-risk HPV types and the protection against genital warts.17 162 163 We argue that the decision of which vaccine to use within a country-specific immunisation programme should be made by taking these differences explicitly into account. In particular , the willingness-to-pay for cancer and genital warts might differ and can as such influence the acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio. In the Netherlands, approximately 600 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed annually. Furthermore, the incidence of genital warts is estimated at approximately 85.8 and 121.6 per 100,000 among men and women, respectively.164 Previousl y, several studies have estimated that the implementation of HPV vaccination for Dutch teenage girls, at 12 years of age, is a cost-effective intervention at around \u20ac20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.140 165\u00b7168 This was estimated irrespective of which specific vaccine was used.153 The present paper aims to determine the costs and health outcomes of HPV vaccination of 12-year-old girls for both vaccines individually, considering not only the benefits of preventing cervical cancer but also those of preventing genital warts, in the context of the current cervical cancer screening program. In particular, the clinical benefits and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for both vaccines were estimated. Also, the price difference between both vaccines was estimated to achieve equal ICERs. Note that several governments, including the Dutch and UK governments, initially did not consider the potential benefits of protection 55 4 \"' ..c: against genital warts in their decision which vaccine to choose and thus the HPV vaccine was introduced only on the basis of the prevention of cervical cancer. Methods Model A previously published Markov model for HPV infection and cervical cancer was modified to take the additional burden of genital warts into account.140 The initial model structure (Figure 1A) and input data (Additional file 1: Appendix Table) have been described in detail previously.140 In the current modified model, the potential cross-protection benefits of both vaccines can be considered, since multiple HPV-types (e.g. HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 45, other high\u00ad risk HPV types and other low-risk HPV types) are included in the design. In addition, the modified model simulates the progression of HPV infection to genital warts for two categories of HPV types: \"6/11\" and \"other low-risk types\" (Figure from \"susceptible\" to \"HPV-infected\" to \"genital warts\" were adapted from literature (Table 1 & Additional file 1: Appendix Table).169 The modified model was calibrated to age-and type\u00ad specific HPV-prevalence and genital warts incidence (Table 2).26103 164170 The model was used to estimate the clinical and economical benefits of vaccination with either the bivalent or the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the context of the NIP, in addition to the current Dutch cervical cancer screening program.Note that it was assumed that neither the sensitivity of the screening programme nor the attendance is changed by the implementation of HPV vaccination.

Burden of disease Table 2 gives an overview of the age-specific numbers of reported cases of genital warts in 4 women treated by GPs and STl-clinics, annually. In the Netherlands, the incidence of genital warts in the total female and male population is on average approximately 11,500 and 8,100 :;; annually, respectively.164 Of these cases approximately 9% are treated in clinics for sexually-c. Jg transmitted infections. No direct coherent Dutch data are available about the treatment costs of genital warts and the quality of life during an episode of genital warts. Therefore, costs were estimated from different sources, including national databases, literature and expert opinions.164 The medical costs include general practitioner (GP) visits, specialist visits, treatment costs and pharmacists' fees. The utility losses of genital warts were adapted from literature.171 Total GP treatment costs of genital warts were estimated from the Netherlands Information Network of General Practice (LINH). Data available through LINH are based on electronic medical records from about 85 general practices, spread throughout the country. Data include longitudinal information on patient characteristics such as age, sex, degree of urbanization, as well as medical information on consultations, prescriptions, referrals, and diagnoses. GPs participating in the LINH network are instructed to use ICPC-1 codes for every patient contact. Based on ICPC-codes X91 and Y76, probable cases of genital warts in 2007, 2008 and 2009 were identified. A total of935 (491 female and 444 male) patients with genital warts were identified over the period 2007-2009. Medication was prescribed in 80% and 91 % for the female and male patients, respectively. Per treated patient an average of 1. 7 prescriptions were counted (range 1 to 22). Podophylotoxin and imiquimod were the drugs 58 Inclusion of the benefits of enhanced cross-protection against cervical cancer and prevention of genital warts in the cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination, in the Netherlands mostly used, in 90% and 5% of the cases, respectively. Women diagnosed with genital warts visited their GP slightly more often than men, an average of 1.8 (range 1 to 20) and 1.5 (range 1 to 18) visits per person, respectively. Furthermore, on average, 0.2 (range Oto 4) telephone consultancies per person diagnosed with genital warts were made. Surgical removal (CTG Dutch hospital costing codes 13012, 13047, 13048) of the warts was performed with 37 patients, requiring an average of 1.2 surgical interventions per patient. Finally, 115 (12%) patients were sent to a medical specialist, most often a gynaecologist (i.e. 40% of female patients) or a dermatologist (i.e. 60% of female and 90% of male patients). Unit costs were adapted from Oostenbrink et al. and from the Dutch Health-Care Insurance Board. 172 Summing up all the costs, the average per-patient GP-treatment costs were estimated at \u20ac114 and \u20ac106 for females (Table 3) and males, respectively. The treatment costs of genital warts within an STI-clinic (\u20ac285 per case) were obtained from expert consultation. It has been shown that the quality of life during an episode of genital warts decreases to 0.944.173 174 This corresponds to a QALY loss of approximately 0.018 per case of genital warts.171 Estimates of the costs and QALYs, for the different (pre-)cancer stages, were adapted from our previous publication (Table 1).14\u00b0 For incidence data, treatment costs and quality-of -life estimates for cervical cancer and pre-cancer stages, we refer to our previous publication.140 Table 3.

In line with our previous 59 studies, we conservatively assumed a 95% efficacy against HPV16 and HPV18 infection for both vaccines.166\u00b0 Furthermore, both vaccines induce cross-protection against other oncogenic HPV-types .17 35 124 138 163 Since the bivalent vaccine induces a higher degree of cross-protection than the quadrivalent vaccine (Table 1), vaccine-spe cific cross-protection efficacies were explicitly taken into account. Finally, it was assumed, that both vaccines induce lifelong protection.149 Total vaccination costs were set at \u20ac315 per vaccinated woman (including 3 doses and administration costs). Note that relevant lower vaccine prices are paid within the Dutch NIP. and probably also in other national immunisation programmes, after tendering . Therefore, vaccination costs were reduced in sensitivity analysis. No utility losses due to vaccine-induced side effects were considered. Cost-effectiveness analyses Differences in costs and effects were estimated by following a cohort (100,000 women) during life twice, once as a partly (i.e. 50%) vaccinated (bivalent or quadrivalent) cohort and once as an unvaccinated cohort. For all situations it was assumed that 90% of all women attend the current Dutch cervical cancer screening programme at least once during life according to the \"pre\u00ad vaccine-era\" 5-yearly compliance rate of80%. No changes in the screening programme structure or compliance rates were assumed for the vaccinated cohort. The model tracks the total number 4 of cases (e.g. cervical cancer, cervical premaligancies, and genital warts), costs, life-years (LY) gained and changes in QALYs. By summing up all the costs, LY gained or QALYs, the net costs, LYs E and QALYs gained/lost were determined for both options. Subsequently, the difference between Jg the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohort was determine d. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated by dividing the incremental costs by the incremental LY or QALYs gained. In the Netherlands, interventions with an ICER below \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained are generally considered as being cost-effective. Future costs and health effects were discounted at 4% and 1.5%, respectivel y, reflecting the Dutch guidelines for cost-effectiveness research.175 Furthermore, to enhance the transferability of our base-case findings to other countries, we also performed sensitivity analyses at costs and health outcomes discount rates of both 3%. Finally. the vaccine prices of the vaccines were varied to achieve equal ICERs for both. Sensitivity analyses The robustness of the outcomes were analyzed in univariate sensitivity analyses. As there is uncertainty about the duration of vaccine-induce protection, vaccine price, cross-protection, and the treatment costs of genital warts, these parameters values were varied in univariate sensitivity analyses. To provide insight in the impact of possible additional herd-immunity benefits on our findings a certain degree of herd-immunity was incorporated in our model. In particular, based on a previous study of Bogaards et al., we estimated a relative risk reduction among unvaccinated women for developing cervical cancer of 33%, aligning a 50% vaccine uptake.165 This risk reduction was applied to both the unvaccinated male and female populations for both cervical cancer and genital warts. As the herd-immunity benefit 60 Inclusion of the benefits of enhanced cross-protection against cervical cancer and prevention of genital warts in the cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination, in the Netherlands is highly sensitive to the vaccination coverage, these benefits were estimated for different coverages; i.e. for 50%, 70% and 90% coverage, the relative risk reductions were estimated at 33%, 55% and 84%, respectively. Finally, to enhance the transferability of our finding to other countries the discount rate and screening compliance was varied in sensitivity analyses. As the Netherlands and Belgium are unique in discounting health effects with a lower rate compared to costs, the discount rates for both health effects and costs were also varied independently in the sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, in the Netherlands 90% of women are screened at least once during life. Compared to other countries this is a relative high coverage and therefore we decreased this coverage to 70%, 50% and 30% in sensitivity analysis. In addition to the impact of the above parameters on the estimated ICER, we also determined the price difference between the two vaccines under conditions of equal ICERs, not only for the base case, but also for the different options analyzed in the sensitivity analyses. Results Clinical results Introduction of HPV vaccination for 12-year-old girls in the model, at a 50% vaccination coverage reduces the annual HPV16/18-related cervical cancer incidence by 198 cases, independent of which vaccine is used. Due to the benefits of cross-protection, 35 the bivalent vaccine will prevent 23 cases of cervical cancer induced by one of the other high-risk HPV types while, due to a lower level of cross-protection163 thusfar documented, the quadrivalent vaccine will prevent 9 cases due to cross-protection. So, in total we estimated that the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccine prevent 221 and 207 cases of cervical cancer, respectively. Furthermore, both vaccines will prevent cervical premalignancies, the bivalent vaccine 106 CINl, 203 CIN2 and 264 CIN3, and the quadrivalent vaccine 91 CINl, 182 CIN2 and 237 CJN3. In addition, the quadrivalent vaccine will prevent annually 4,390 cases of genital warts. Cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination Notably, 1,524 (646 if discounted) or 1,430 (606 if discounted) life years will be gained when the bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine are being used, respectively. When all the above health benefits are taken together, in total 1,815 (790 if discounted) or 1,803 (824 if discounted) QALYs are estimated to be gained by using the bivalent or the quadrivalent vaccine, respectively. In particular; for the bivalent vaccine 709 discounted QALYs are gained by providing protection against HPV16/18-induced cervical (pre-)malignancies and 81 discounted QALYs are gained due to cross-protection. For the quadrivalent vaccine, 709, 33 and 82 discounted QALYs are gained due to protection against HPV16/18-induced (pre-) malignancies, cross-protection and prevention of genital warts, respectively. Furthermore, vaccination with the bivalent vaccine results in a discounted cost-saving of \u20ac1,641,000 by 61 4 ... (lJ HPV16/18-induced saving of \u20ac211,000 due to cross-protection. The quadrivalent vaccine results in discounted cost-savings of \u20ac1,641,000, \u20ac84,000 and \u20ac570,000 due to protection against HPV16/18- induced (pre-)malignancies, cross-protection, and prevention of genital warts, respectively. The total vaccination costs are estimated at \u20ac15M per year in the Netherlands. Considering only the benefits of prevention of HPV16/18-related disease, the lCER was estimated at \u20ac19,900 per QALY or \u20ac24,300 per LY gained (\u20ac41,900/QALY or \u20ac52,800/LY if discounted at 3%). When the benefits of cross-protection and protection against genital warts are taken into account, the ICER of the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines were estimated at \u20ac17,600 per QALY or \u20ac21,500 per LY gained (\u20ac36,900/QALY or \u20ac46,500/L Y if discounted at 3%) and \u20ac16,300 per QALY or \u20ac22,700 per LY gained (\u20ac31,800/Q ALY or \u20ac49,600/L Y if discounted at 3%), respectively. Sensitivity analyses In the univariate sensitivity analyses, the ICER for the bivalent HPV vaccine ranged from \u20ac2,200 to \u20ac97,100 per QALY gained. The ICER for the quadrivalent vaccine ranged from \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac73, 100 per QALY gained. Figure 2 shows the upper and lower limit of the ICER upon variation of individual parameter values. Figure 2 shows that the ICER was most sensitive to vaccine price, duration of protection, herd-immu nity and the discount rate for health benefits. Figure 3 provides a detailed overview of the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination for the four abovementioned scenarios. Also, we considered a best-case (i.e. vaccine price \u20ac45/dose, lifelong protection, herd immunity and discount rates costs and health effects at 0%) and a worst-case scenario (i.e. vaccine price \u20ac105, 20-years protection, no herd immunity, and high discount rates cost and health effects at 4%). HPV vaccination was estimated to be cost-saving (irrespective of the HPV vaccine) in the best-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario the ICER was \u20ac81,800/QALY (\u20ac107,700/LY) or Y), for the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccine, respectively. Finally, the cost effectiveness of HPV vaccination was found to be more favourable in a setting with a moderate or poor screening programme (Figure 4). Gonltal .. ......

QJ \"' ..c: Price differential between the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccine The per-dose price differential between both vaccines was estimated such that the cost-effectiveness of the bivalent vaccine would equal that of the quadrivalent vaccine (\u20ac16,300 per QALY gained). Note that, here, we considered an equal willingness-to-pay for prevention of cancer and genital warts. In the base-case, we estimated that, based on a list price of \u20ac105/dose, the bivalent vaccine has to be \u20ac6.90 per dose less expensive compared to the quadrivalent vaccine to achieve an equal ICER ( \u20ac14, if discounted at 3%). This price difference was most sensitive to assumptions about herd immunity , treatment costs of genital warts, exclusion of the benefits of either cross-protection or genital warts, vaccination costs and, again, the discount rate for health benefits (Figures 5 & 6). The price differential ranged from minus \u20ac2.80, if only life years gained were considered (i.e. the bivalent vaccine might be more expensive), to almost \u20ac11 if future health outcomes are discounted at 4%. Indeed, consideration of herd immunity resulted in a larger price difference between both vaccines to achieve equal ICERs. A 33% reduction in incidence of genital warts and cervical cancer among unvaccinated females and males resulted in a price differential of approximately \u20ac15 per dose. If vaccine coverage would further increase to 90%, the price differential increased to \u20ac16 per dose. Finally, if the bivalent vaccine provides an extended duration of protection compared to the quadrivalent vaccine, as has been hypothesized by Einstein et al., 133 the results were in favour of the bivalent vaccine. In particular, assuming lifelong protection for the bivalent vaccine and 20 or 40 years for the quadrivalent vaccine, we estimated a price differential of \u20ac24 and \u20ac1 per dose, respectiv ely. Finally, in the worst-case scenario, the price differential was estimated at \u20ac21.

Price differential for the quadrivalent vaccine to be as cost-effective as the bivalent vaccine. Blue squares indicate the price differential considering the life-years gained and red dots indicate the same if quality\u00ad adjusted life years gained are considered. In settings with a moderate or poor screening programme the estimated ICER was more driven by the health gains of providing protection against cervical cancer. Consequently, the price differential diminishes in settings with a higher burden of cervical cancer, often accompanying a relatively poor screening programme (Figure 4). There are three scenarios in which the bivalent vaccine may have a higher price compared to the quadrivalent vaccine to be equally cost-effective. These scenarios include the conditions in which (i) only LY gained are considered, (ii) the quadrivalent vaccine provides a shorter duration of protection, and (iii) prevention of genital warts are not taken into account. 65 4 \"' ..c: Discussion Currently, there are two registered prophylactic HPV vaccines, a bivalent vaccine and a quadrivalent vaccine. To decide which vaccine could best be used in countries' national immunisation programmes, an analytical comparison in terms of cost-effectiveness between both vaccines is required. Accordin gly, the primary aim of the current study was to make a specific comparison between the bivalent and the quadrivalent HPV vaccines, taking the specific characteristics of both vaccines explicitly into account. These include not only the benefits of protection against HPV16 and 18, but also those of cross-protection against other high-risk HPV types and, for the low-risk HPV types, protection against genital warts. Note that, although differences in immunogenicity between both vaccines have been reported,35 the clinical relevance of this has not been demonstrated yet. Even though we conducted the study for the situation in the Netherlands, the general conclusions of our analyses are likely to apply, with minor modifications, to other European countries and the USA, because of strong similarities in HPV prevalence and implementation of prophylactic vaccination programmes in these countries. From our base-case analyses, it follows that use of the bivalent HPV vaccine gives the highest reduction in cervical cancer incidence. Consequently, the highest number of life-years gained was obtained by implementing the bivalent vaccine, resulting in a more favourable ICER compared to that obtained with the quadriavalent vaccine ( \u20ac21,500 /LYG vs. \u20ac22, 700 / LYG). This implies that the bivalent vaccine might be \u20ac2.80 more expensive if only LYs are considered. Considering QALYs gained on the basis of protection against (pre-)cervical malignancies and genital warts, the quadrivalent vaccine provided the highest health gain. The ICER of the quadrivalent vaccine was estimated to be more favourable than that of the bivalent vaccine at \u20ac16,300/QALY gained vs. \u20ac17,600/QALY. This implies that the quadrivalent vaccine can be approximately \u20ac7 per dose (based at a list price of \u20ac105/dose) more expensive than the bivalent vaccine to be equally cost-effect ive. The ICERs of both vaccines were found to be particularly sensitive to the vaccine price (range: \u20ac5,600 -17,600/QALY), the duration of protection (range: \u20ac16,300 discount rate for health and, to herd\u00ad immunity benefits most scenarios, the ICER (\u20ac/ QALY) of the quadrivalent vaccine remained more favourable than that of the bivalent vaccine. This difference, as argued above, may justify a slightly higher vaccine price for the quadrivalent vaccine. Interestingly, without discounting, the bivalent vaccine results in a slightly higher QALY gain than the quadrivalent vaccine, despite the benefits in terms of prevention of genital warts of the latter. This illustrates that the health gains of prevention of cervical cancer prevention are highly sensitive to the discount rate applied. Furthermore, it is important to note that the acceptable price differential between both vaccines highly depends on the vaccine price applied for the reference vaccine. In particular, in the base- 66 Inclusion of the benefits of enhanced cross-protection against cervical cancer and prevention of genital warts in the cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination, in the Netherlands case (bivalent vaccination costs was \u20ac105/dose), the price differential was estimated at \u20ac7 per dose. Reducing the vaccination costs of the bivalent vaccine to, for example, \u20ac45 per dose, the price differential decreases to \u20ac4. Possible lower vaccine costs will further reduce the price differential between both vaccines. Inclusion of additional herd-immunity benefits resulted in an increased price difference between both vaccines primarily due to the benefits of providing indirect protection against genital warts in males. Interestingly, the absolute herd-immunity benefit in females will be highest if vaccine coverage is moderate, while in males the herd-immunity benefit will be highest when vaccine uptake is high. In our study, the indirect effects could not be directly considered as a static model was used. The use of static models for infectious disease modelling has been criticised by us and others.43 73 176 However, in balancing complexity and transparency, static models are still of major importance and can be used for initial assessments. Here, we included the potential herd-immunity benefits based on a previous Dutch modelling study.127 Further research should be directed to develop a dynamic transmission model including the most important high-and low-risk HPV types. Another limitation of the current study is that potential additional health benefits of providing protection against other than cervical cancers were not included. The inclusion of these cancers will further improve the ICER for both vaccines. Consequently, price differentials between both vaccines might diminish, 171 as the benefit of providing protection against genital warts will play a less prominent role. Finally, we did not perform any probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). The use of PSA is highly recommended as it provides some insight in the certainty of the outcomes. However, comparing the PSAs of different vaccines is rather critical as potentially a highly favourable option (lower limit 95% confidence interval) of one vaccine is compared with a rather unfavourable option (upper limit 95% confidence interval) of the other vaccine. For that reason we currently didn't embark on a formal PSA, but rather performed an extensive deterministic sensitivity analysis. Our results are generally in line with the findings of others. In particular, several studies estimated that the bivalent HPV vaccine resulted in the highest reduction in cervical cancer incidence due to the additional benefits of cross-protection. \" 35 163 However, as only the quadrivalent vaccine provides protection against genital warts, the decision which vaccine to use is not that straightforward. From a health-economic perspective, the most cost-effective vaccine should be preferred considering both the health gains of providing protection against cervical cancer and genital warts. Several studies made this type of comparison between both vaccines.171 177 Here, we estimated that a \u20ac6.70 (7%) price differential, in favour of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, resulted in equal ICERs. This justifiable price difference between both vaccines estimated in the present study is slightly different from that found in other studies.177 For example, Jit et al. estimated that the bivalent vaccine should be approximately 25% less expensive. 171 Indeed, even larger 67 discrepancies have been reported. 177 The difference between our study and those of others can be explained by various factors. Firstly, as mentioned above, we used a static model in which herd-immunity benefits are not directly taken into account. As indicate above, inclusion of herd-immunity benefits results in an increased price difference (e.g., the price difference reaches a maximum of approximately 16% when herd-immunity is taken into account). Secondly, we included vaccine-spec ific cross-protection against high-risk HPVs in our analyses. As there is evidence that the bivalent vaccine is more cross-protective than the quadrivalent vaccine,35 162 163 this results in a smaller price difference. Finally, according to health-economic guidelines in the Netherlands, future health benefits are discounted with a relatively low discount rate of 1.5%, and therefore, the health benefits of cervical cancer are devalued less than in most other countries. Nevertheless, in general we can conclude that in western countries a higher vaccine price for the quadrivalent vaccine is justified due to the additional benefits of providing protection against genital warts. In contrast, Demarteau et al. estimated that for Taiwan a higher vaccine price for the bivalent vaccine is justified.178 The difference between this study and the studies performed in western countries can be primarily explained by the higher incidence of cervical cancer in Taiwan. Due to the potentially higher effectiveness of the bivalent vaccine in providing protection 4 against cervical cancer a relevantly higher health gain might be obtained in settings with a high burden of cervical cancer. In most western countries the burden of cervical cancer \"' ..c:: has already been dramatically reduced since the introduction of cervical cancer screening . Consequently, in these settings the benefits of providing protection against genital warts are predominant and the ICER of the quadrivalent vaccine is even more sensitive to the inclusion of the benefits of providing protection against genital warts than found in our study. This illustrates that the decision which vaccine to use on health-economic grounds will highly depend on the disease burden of cervical cancer versus the burden of genital warts. Conclusion In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrate that HPV vaccination is a cost-effective intervention in the Netherlands. Clearly, HPV vaccination has been implemented for the prevention of cervical cancer. From this perspective, use of the bivalent HPV vaccine appears to be most effective and most cost-effect ive in prevention of cervical cancer. This is primarily due to the broader cross-protective capacity of the bivalent vaccine, compared to the quadrivalent vaccine, against high-risk HPV types not included in the vaccines. However, if the potential benefits of providing protection against genital warts are considered, another decision might be made. From a health-economic perspective, a coherent analytic comparison of the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines could be made and to consider costs and benefits of cross-protection against other high-risk HPV types not included in the 68 Inclusion of the benefits of enhanced cross-protection against cervical cancer and prevention of genital warts in the cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination, in the Netherlands vaccines as well as those of protection against genital warts. From a health care decision- making perspective, these analyses -next to other criteria -can then be compared to the initial intention of cancer prevention underlying introduction of the vaccination in local national vaccination programmes. This will then provide a more balanced view than cost- comparison alone.

Methods: A dynamic transmission model was designed for the seven most prevalent HPV types, to predict the epidemiologic impact of HPV vaccination. Age-specific HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence and mortality data for The Netherlands were used to calibrate the model assuming a steady state. The consequences of HPV vaccination were analyzed in different scenarios. In particular, the age of vaccinated girls and the inclusion of boys in HPV vaccination programmes were assessed. In separate sensitivity analyses, the vaccination coverage, duration of vaccine-induced protection, and vaccine choice were varied. Results: Assuming a coverage of 50%, implementation of HPV vaccination among girls of 12 years of age resulted in an overall reduction of 52% in cervical cancer incidence. The model\u00ad predicted outcomes were highly sensitive to the duration of vaccine-induced protection 5 and the vaccination coverage. If vaccination would only provide 20 years of protection, a 31 % reduction in cervical cancer incidence was obtained. HPV16 and 18 were estimated Q, \"' ..c: to be eradicated from the general population if vaccine coverage is >90% and vaccination provides lifelong protection. Vaccination at an older age continues to provide protection against cervical cancer, but vaccination before sexual debut was estimated to remain most efficient. Vaccination of boys was found to be not an effective additional intervention. Finally, small, but clinical relevant, differences between different registered vaccines were found. Conclusion: HPV vaccination was found to be highly effective in reducing the burden of cervical cancer. The model-predicted outcomes are sensitive to vaccine-induced duration of protection and vaccination coverage. Alternative strategies should be considered to further reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. 74 Analysis of the impact of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus infection using a dynamic- modelling approach Introduction Human Papillomavirus (HPV) represents one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted viral infections worldwide. More than 75% of all sexually active women are thought to contract any HPV at some point during lifetime.57 HPV infection is usually transient and most of these infections will be cleared within one year. However, with some women the infection persists and may progress to genital malignancies, such as cervical cancer.179 Although more than 100 different types of HPV have been identified, HPV16 and HPV18 are the two major oncogenic types involved in genital malignancies. Together, HPV16 and HPV18 are responsible for 70- 80% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. Other, common oncogenic HPV types include HPV31, 33, 45, 52 and 58.179 Since 2007, two prophylactic HPV vaccines are available which provide protection against HPV16 and 18 infection.17 180 Both vaccines are safe and highly effective in preventing persistent HPV16 and 18 infections and HPV-related premalignant disease, observed efficacies being >95%. Therefore, many Western countries have introduced HPV vaccination of teenage girls into their national immunisation programmes (NJPs), principally to prevent cervical cancer among the vaccinees later on in life. 181 Previously, the epidemiological and economic consequences of HPV vaccination have already been assessed by us and others.4092140182\u00b7184 Most of these studies were based on static models, assuming a high vaccination coverage. In static models, typically the transmission of the virus between individuals is not simulated and, consequently, the so-called herd-immunity benefits are not considered. 185 Additionally, static models lack the capacity to model age shifts in the epidemiology and potential virus-type replacement. Currently in most countries the vaccine uptake is relatively low (i.e. 50-60%)181 and, therefore, the use of static models is no longer justified. Decisions regarding new interventions for HPV, such as new catch-up campaigns or improved screening, should take the potential indirect effects explicitly into account. To provide better estimates of the epidemiological consequences of HPV vaccination -in particular, in a low-coverage environme nt-we have designed a dynamic transmission model. Several dynamic models have already been developed for analyses of the impact of population\u00ad wide introduction of HPV vaccination. These initial dynamic models included HPV16 and HPV18 only. More recently, models have been published which considered multiple HPV types. Consequently, these models can take benefits of potential cross-protection and the effects of the use of multivalent HPV vaccines explicitly into account. Our model structure is generally in line with the previously published dynamic HPV models. However, based on recent findings, we assumed a lower degree of immunity to a natural HPV infection, which highly impacts on the calibration and results of the dynamic model. Furthermore, following up on our previous work, we used the most recent data to parameterize the model.186 The aim of the current study is to provide insight in the epidemiological benefits of HPV vaccination. The presented model includes natural immunity and provides long-term 75 5 ... QJ \"' ..c: estimates on the epidemiological consequences of HPV vaccination strategies. Furthermore, alternative HPV-vaccination strategies are assessed. With our model, we explicitly consider the potential benefits of providing protection against high-risk but non-HPV16/18 infections due to cross-protection or due to the use of multivalent HPV vaccines. Methods Dynamic transmission model We developed an age-structured compartment model to provide up-to-date and adequate estimates of the epidemiological impact of HPV vaccination. The epidemiological model has the general SIRS (Susceptible -Infectious -Recovered with immunity -Susceptible) structure and consist of a set of differential equations, simulating the progression from \"susceptible\" through \"HPV-infected\" and \"cervical intraepithelial-neoplasia\" (CIN) on to \"cervical cancer\" (Figure 1). The arrows represent the continuous flow between the compartments. The model time step was 1 month. The model simulates the transmission of the seven most common oncogenic HPV types (i.e. 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58) between males and females.8 These HPV-types together are responsible for approximately 90% of cervical cancers, in Europe.63 187 In particular, the model predicts the prevalence of HPV infection and the incidence of cervical (pre)malignancies for the Dutch situation . The model can be used to assess the epidemiological and economic consequences ofinterventions aimed to reduce the burden of cervical cancer, such as prophylactic HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. Notably, the model focuses on vaccination, but additionally takes the Dutch national cervical cancer screening programme specifically into account. Model structure The model was age-specific and had 100 age groups (one year wide age-groups). The modeled population size was assumed to be constant over time. In particular , the number of individuals entering the model (i.e. births) was equaled to the number of individuals leaving the model (i.e. natural mortality). Mortality rates were age-specific and obtained from the Dutch centre of statistics (CBS http://ww w.cbs.nl). The size of a birth cohort was set at 200,000 individuals with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1, reflecting the Dutch population. The model is summarized in Figure 1. New births enter the model in the compartment \"susceptible\" comprising sexually-inactive individuals. Age-specif ic sexual debut rates were included in the model, simulating the transition from sexually inactive to sexually active. From the moment individuals become sexually active, they are at risk for acquisition of an HPV infection. The risk of infection is highly dependent on the number of sexual partners an individual has per unit of time. Therefore, in the model, the number of sexual contacts was age-specific. Furthermore, for sexually transmitted infections (ST!s), it is generally known that a small \"core\" group of individuals, which have a relatively high number of different 76 Analysis of the impact of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus infection using a dynamic-modelling approach sexual partners, forms the driving force and sometimes the sole reservoir for maintaining the ST! in the general population. 188 Therefore, the sexually-active population was stratified into two groups, i.e. a core group (>2 different partners/6 months) of 10% and a non-core group (s2 different partners/6 months) of90%.189 Susceptlble (Vir ins) Births Mortality other cause Susceptible HPV Infected Immune Mortality Figure 1. Schematic representation of the transmission model structure It is assumed that, after a woman has acquired an HPV infection, she is subsequently at risk to develop cervical (pre)malignancies. Although the majority (e.g. 70%) of women will clear the infection within one year, in a small proportion of individuals the infection will persist.194 The disease model simulates the progression from \"persistent infection\" through \"CIN 1-3\" on to \"cervical cancer stages 1-4\" and \"death\". After clearance of the infection or regression of the disease, 63% of the women develop partial immunity.191 Natural induced antibodies are assumed to be initially as effective as vaccine-induced antibodies (i.e. 95% efficacy). However, it was assumed that natural immunity will only provide 6.5 years protection. 13 Finally, in the model both men and women can acquire multiple HPV infections. Note that neither the risk of infection, nor the clearance rates are affected by multiple HPV infections.192 Each HPV infection can progress or regress individually based on HPV type\u00ad specific progression or regression rates. 193 However, to simplify the model, it was assumed that in cases of multiple HPV infections only one HPV type will progress to disease. Model parameterization Parameterization of the HPV transmission model was based on large surveys Groep, concern\u00ad ing the age of sexual debut, the heterosexual contact matrix and the rate of partner change. 194 195 In the model, the number of partners an individual has per unit of time as well as the mixing between age groups are age-specific. Mixing between core and non-core members was adopted from a previous ST! modelling study (i.e. screening for asymptomatic Chlamydia). 196 77 The force of infection was determined by model calibration. Specifically, the number of partners and the contact matrix were obtained from the two surveys mentioned above. However; the probability that a susceptible individual will indeed acquire HPV through contact with an infected partner (i.e. the transmission probability (P)) is unclear. Previously, p was set at 0.7 and 0.8 for men and women, respective ly.197 More recently, Bogaards et al. determined that the transmission probability for HPV might be type-spec ific and in the range of 0.43 to 0.94 (estimated average 0.79).199 Here, the transmission probability for the individual HPV types were allowed to range from 0 to 1 to obtain the best model fit for the different HPV types, using the built-in curve fitter toolbox in Berkeley Madonna. In particular, the curve-fitter toolbox uses the minimum deviation for model calibration. Additionally, we assumed that the transmission probability for men to women is equal to that for women to men. HPV prevalence numbers of the seven most common HPV types included in our model were used as reported by Coupe et al. for women of 25 to 65 years of age.8 Table 1 shows the observed HPV prevalence and the estimated per partnership transmission probabilities for the different HPV subtypes. As the number of sexual partners varies with age and gender, the force of infection is age-and gender-specific. 5 The HPV type-specific transition rates were adapted from the literature or from our previously designed static model.140 193 Bulkmans et al. and Guiliano et al. reported HPV \"' ..c type-specific clearance rates for women and men, respectively. 199 200 lnsigna et al. reported the HPV type-speci fic progression and regression rates from HPV infection through CINl to CIN2. The transition rates obtained from literature were varied within their 95% confidence intervals to obtain the optimal goodness-of-fit for HPV prevalence, cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The human papillomavirus distribution in cervical cancer was adapted from two large meta-analyses.63 187 Note that for inclusion in a dynamic model, transition probabilities were converted to rates using the formula: rate= -LN(l-probability) Table 1. Estimated probability t prevalence in women 25 -65 years of age of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavir us infection using a dynamic-modelling approach Cervical cancer screening programme Since 1985, a national cervical cancer screening programme is in place in The Netherlands aimed to reduce the burden of cervical cancer. Initially, women 35 to 53 years of age were invited for screening, once every 3 years. The screening programme has been revised in 1996. Specifically, since the revision, women aged 30 to 60 years are screened with a 5-year interval. The adherence to the programme is high; specifically, 70% of the invited women participate in the screening. Note that a small group of women (i.e. approximately 10% of the invited women) does not attend the screening programme at all during their lifetime. The cytological outcome determines the follow-up which can be (i) referral to a medical specialist, (ii) increased follow-up within 6 months or (iii) repeat cytology after 5 years. In the model, the current Dutch cervical cancer screening programme is explicitly included, according to the 1996 revision. Stage-specific detection rates for cytological screening, colposcopy and biopsy were taken from our previous publication.9 HPV vaccination Since 2007, two prophylactic HPV vaccines are available for women aged 10 to 26 years.2\u00b01 The first registered vaccine is a quadrivalent benign subtypes HPV6 and HPV11, the latter being involved in the development of genital warts. The other vaccine is a bivalent vaccine (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline) which comprises just HPV16 and HPV18. Currently, an octavalent vaccine against the oncogenic HPV types 16, 18, 31, 45, 52 and 58, and HPV types 6 and 11 is in a clinical trial (http://www.c)jnjctrja).gov NCT00851643). Furthermore, the development of a nonavalent HPV vaccine has been suggested, which includes HPV33 in addition to the HPV types included in the octavalent vaccine. Both registered HPV vaccines are highly effective in providing protection against HPV16 and HPV18 infection. A >95% vaccine efficacy against persistent HPV16/18 infection in women not previously infected with HPV16 or 18 has been reported for both vaccines.1 7 202 Furthermore, for both vaccines a certain degree of additional cross-protection against other HPV types has been reported (Table 2).17 141 For the octavalent or nonavalent vaccine, efficacy estimates against persistent infection or CIN are, as yet, lacking. However, high antibody titers against all HPV types included in the vaccine were found after vaccination with the octavalent vaccine. Note that, due to the relatively short follow-up period on the efficacy of the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, the duration of protection is only evidenced up to approximately 10 years.203 Within the follow-up period no break-through cases have been observed. Furthermore, as also after 10 years the antibody titers remain high, a lifelong vaccine\u00ad induced protection is generally assumed and often accepted for both marketed vaccines.149 79 s ... Q) \"' ..c: Table 2. Vaccine characteristics. Efficacy HPV16/18 Efficacy HPV31 Efficacy HPV33 Efficacy HPV45 Duration In the Netherlands, 12-year-old teenage girls are routinely vaccinated with the bivalent HPV vaccine from GSK since 2010. Furthermore, a catch-up programme was implemented in 2009 for girls 13 to 16 years of age. Currently, only about 50% of the 12-year-old girls attend the vaccination program.42204 As we aim to mimic the Dutch context, in the model a 50% vaccine uptake among girls was assumed. Under these conditions, we estimated the epidemiological consequences of vaccination, specifically the reduction in cervical cancer incidence, and the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case of cervical cancer. In sensitivity analyses, we tested the robustness of the model-pre dicted results. Furthermore, alternative vaccination scenarios and vaccine characteristics were assessed, such as vaccination at older age or vaccination with an octavalent or nonavalent HPV vaccine. Sensitivity analysis Vaccine characteristics The efficacies of the bivalent and the quadrivalent vaccines have been determined in large clinical trials, including thousands of women. Nevertheless, the duration of vaccine-induced protection remains uncertain. Therefore, in sensitivity analysis we reduced the duration of protection (due to waning immunity) from lifelong to 20 years. As the duration ofvaccine\u00ad induced protection is at least 10 years, we thought that it was plausible to assume that during a 10-year period after vaccination women do not become susceptible to infection with the particular HPV type involved. So, in the case of an average vaccine-induced protection of 20 years, we assumed that all women will start losing protection 10 years after vaccination at a constant rate (i.e. 0.10/year). Furthermore, the benefits of preventing other HPV infections, due to cross-protection or due to the use of multivalent HPV vaccine formulations, were estimated. Cross-protection was assumed as reported for the bivalent and the quadrivalent vaccine (Table 2). For the candidate octavalent and nonavalent vaccines, a high efficacy against all vaccine types included in the vaccine was assumed, i.e. 95% efficacy, while no additional cross-protec tion was assumed. Currently, the vaccine uptake in The Netherlands and many other countries is relatively low. The willingness to be vaccinated can be affected by various factors, such as education and knowledge about the disease and the vaccination. Efforts are taken to further improve 80 Analysis of the impact of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus infection using a dynamic-modelling approach vaccine uptake. Therefore, we varied the vaccine uptake for 12-year-old girls from SO - 100% to adequately analyze changes in uptake. To complete the picture and further improve the usefulness of our study for other settings, we also analyzed uptakes below 50%. Alternative HPV vaccination scenarios Within Europe, the age of annual HPV vaccination varies between 10 -17 years. Yet, the HPV vaccines have been registered for women up to 26 years of age and clinical trials among women >26 years of age are currently ongoing. Therefore, the age of vaccination was varied from 10 to 30 years. Vaccination of boys has already been the subject of much debate. Notably, the CDC recently recommended vaccination of boys in the USA as the HPV vaccine uptake among girls remains low.205 Therefore, we also estimated the benefits of vaccination of boys in addition to girls. Number needed to vaccinate (NNV) To provide insight in the effectiveness of the different vaccination scenarios we estimated the number needed to vaccinate (NNV). Here, we defined the NNV as the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case of cervical cancer. The NNV was estimated for all different scenarios assessed in the current study. Results Model predictions without vaccination Figure 2 shows the calibration results for HPV prevalence (panel 2a) and cervical cancer incidence (panel 2b). The model predicted 542 new cases of cervical cancer, annually. The figures illustrate a good model fit for these two parameters. Furthermore, the model\u00ad predicted cervical cancer mortality (i.e. 173 deaths annually) and CINl-3 prevalence are in line with reported cervical cancer-related deaths and CINl-3 prevalence in the Netherlands. 10.0 100 80 7.5 c., .!: IJ .. 60 5.0 c., .. :, 40 e 2.5 i a. 20 0.0 CJ 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Age (yeani) Age(yeani) Figure 2.

In the model, impleme ntation of HPV vaccination of girls at 12 years of age results in a rapid decrease in HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence. Reductions of 65% and 83% in, respectively, HPV16-and HPV18-induced cervical cancer incidence were observed in a one-year age cohort if a 50% vaccine coverage was applied, i.e. the initial HPV vaccination coverage in the Netherlands (Figure 3). This reduction corresponds to 316 (52% reduction) averted cervical cancer cases. Besides prevention of HPV16 and HPV18 infection, the bivalent vaccine provides a certain degree of cross-protection against other HPV types not included in the vaccines. Consideration of this cross-protection result in a reduction in HPV31, 33, and 45 prevalence, of 64%, 55% and 80%, respectively, corresponding to 49 (8%) additional cervical cancer cases averted. ------.

Age vaccinee: 12 years, vaccination coverage: 50%, duration protection: lifelong, vaccine efficacy 95% against HPVl 6 and 18. The model-predicted reductions in HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence are highly sensitive to the assumed vaccine-induced duration of protection and the vaccination coverage. Obviously, with increasing vaccination coverage, the incidence of cervical cancer further decreases. For example, 80% or 100% vaccine coverages result in overall reductions of approximately 71 % and 7 4%, respectively, in cervical cancer incidence. According to our model, HPV16 and HPV18 will be completely eradicated if the vaccination coverage increases beyond 92% and 65%, respectively, assuming that vaccination provides lifelong protection. If HPV vaccination would not provide lifelong protection, a lower number of cervical cancer cases will be averted. For example, if the vaccine-induced immunity will provide 20 years of protection, the reduction in cervical cancer incidence is approximately 31 % (Table 3). Eradication of HPV16 and HPV18 will not be achieved if HPV vaccination provides 20-years protection even at 100% coverage. 82 Analysis of the impact of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus infection using a dynamic-modelling approach Table 3.

In addition, many countries have implemented a once-only catch-up programme covering girls at older ages. Indeed, vaccination at the age before sexual debut ( <13 years of age) was found to be most efficient in providing protection against cervical cancer (Figure 5). Even if vaccine\u00ad induced protection would not provide lifelong protection, but only, for example, 20 years, it would still be most beneficial to vaccinate girls at 12 years of age (Figure 5). .. 100 GI u 90 C 80 u- \"ii 70 u-60 \u00b7-GI u 50 GI C c.> 0 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 Age vaccinee (years) Figure 5.

Due to the current comparatively low vaccine uptake among girls, vaccination of boys has been considered. 206 The effectiveness of vaccinating males to prevent cancer in women highly depends on the uptake in the female population. 207 Indeed, in our analysis, we confirmed this conclusion (Figure 6). If only 20% of the girls are vaccinated, we found that vaccination of males is of considerable interest (i.e. reduction increased from 30% to 37%). However, if the vaccination coverage among females is moderate (50%) or high (75%), the added value of vaccinating males decreases and might not be worth considering. .. 100 .. 100 a, u 90 u 90 C C 80 Cl 80 u- u- 3 70 n 70 -a, 60 -a, 60 C: u 50 C: u 50 a, C a, C u a, 40 u a, 40 C :s! c:s! 0 U 30 0 U 30 ;:, C 1S .5 u-20 20 :, 10 -g 10 a, a: 0 a: 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Vaccine coverage (%) Vaccine coverage (%) Figure 6.

The base-case NNV was estimated at 158. As the relative herd-immunity is highest if vaccine coverage is low, the NNV is more favourable if vaccine coverage is low (for example, at 20% coverage the NNV = 145) compared to high (for example, at 80% coverage, the NNV = 187). Furthermore, the efficiency of HPV vaccination was found to depend strongly on the duration of vaccine\u00ad induced protection and on the age of the vaccinees. Table 4. Number Needed to Vaccinate.

This corresponds to a 52% overall reduction in cervical cancer incidence among the vaccinees. In contrast, a static model would have predicted a reduction of approximately 35% HPV-induced cervical cancer under the same conditions (i.e. 50% coverage and 95% efficacy against HPV16/18).153208 Considering however a 100% vaccine uptake the dynamic and static model predicted a reduction in cervical cancer incidence of 74% and 70%, respectively. This illustrates that, for modelling of infectious diseases, it is preferable to use a dynamic transmission approach, which -among other aspects -takes into account herd-immunity benefits of vaccination. Other indirect effects of HPV vaccination, like type replacement and age-shift, were not found. The model-predicted outcomes are particularly sensitive to the duration of vaccine-induced protection and the vaccination coverage. In The Netherlands, the initial HPV vaccine uptake was approximately 50%. However, coverage is rising and currently approximately 60% of teenage girls are attending the HPV vaccination programme. Indeed, increasing vaccination coverage rates will result in increasing reductions in cervical cancer incidence and a relatively smaller effect of herd-immunity in the population. We estimated that HPV16 and HPV18 will be completely eradicated from the population at vaccination coverage rates of >90% and >65%, respectively. The difference between the thresholds for eradication between these two HPV types is mainly due to the slower clearance rate and higher force of infection of HPV16, as compared to those ofHPV18. A 31 % reduction in cervical cancer was observed if vaccination were to provide only 20 years of protection. Initially, lifelong protection after vaccination has been assumed, although clinical evidence for this was (and is) not yet available. Currently, the follow-up period after HPV vaccination in clinical trials is approximately 10 years. After this period the antibody titers are still high and no breakthrough cases have been observed. Therefore, it is generally accepted that HPV vaccination will provide lifelong protection. Monitoring remains, however, of importance as in the past a number of vaccinations did eventually not succeed in providing lifelong protection, for example, mumps vaccination. This is of concern as the occurrence of breakthrough infections might harm the public trust in national immunisation programmes. If HPV vaccination does not provide lifelong protection, a decreasing number of cases of cervical cancer will be prevented. In this scenario, an additional booster immunisation can be considered to provide protection for women at older age. However, obtaining high vaccination coverage in older women might be challenging and the desirability of a booster might correspondingly be debatable. 86 Analysis of the impact of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus infection using a dynamic-modelling approach In clinical trials, differences in vaccine efficacy (i.e. cross-prot ection) between the currently registered bivalent and quadrivalent vaccine were found. The long-term clinical relevance of this cross-protection is as yet unclear. Furthermore, HPV vaccines containing eight or nine different HPV types are currently in clinical trials. Here we show that there are small differences in number of cases averted between the HPV vaccines. In particular, at 50% coverage, we estimated that the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines reduce the cervical cancer incidence by 60% and 55%, respectively. The candidate octavalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines will reduce the burden of cervical cancer by 62% and 66%, respectively. Note, however; that the duration of protection and the efficacy against either HPV infection or CIN for both the octavalent and nonavalant vaccine is not known and that the vaccines are not registered yet. In many countries, a one-off catch-up programme was implemented for girls older than 12 years, who were not included in the NIP. As currently vaccination coverages are generally low, alternative vaccination strategies for unvaccinated individuals at older age could be considered. We show that vaccination of girls and women up to 26 years of age, at a 50% coverage, still provides a >25% reduction in cervical cancer incidence. Although, due to herd\u00ad immunity benefits of routine vaccination of 12-year-old girls, the efficiency of vaccination at older ages will diminish during the coming years, from a public-health perspective, potential high health gains may be expected from vaccinating women up to 26 years of age, although possibly against an unfavourable cost-effectiveness. Due to the currently low vaccine uptake in the USA, the Center for Disease Control recently suggested to implement vaccination of boys.205 We show, in agreement with observations of others,158 209 210 that the added value of vaccination of boys strongly depends on the vaccination coverage among girls. Indeed, vaccination of boys will only be of interest if the coverage among girls is very low (i.e. <20%), and thus argue against implementation of vaccination of boys under the current conditions of>50% vaccination coverage rates among girls. These findings are in line with recent findings of Bogaards et al. 209 These authors argued that, among many scenarios analyzed, a female-only strategy is preferable. Strength and limitations of the study In general our simulation shows a good model fit. A major limitation of current HPV models is that, despite the availability of the results from large clinical trials, the pathogenesis of cervical cancer is still not well understood. As a consequence, the progression and regression rates have to be estimated by model validation and calibration. Currently, from several large HPV-vaccine clinical trials, data are becoming available on disease progression and regression. For example, lnsigna et al. were among the first to assess the transition probabilities from HPV infection to C!Nl to CIN2 for different HPV types, based on these data.193 Here, we used these transition rates to design and calibrate our disease model. 87 Next to disease progression, the induction of natural immunity after HPV infection has been investigated based on clinical trial data. It was already known that 60-70% of women develop antibody titers after an HPV infection. However, the efficacy of natural immunity is debated. Safaeian et al. found that women with high natural antibody titers have a decreased risk of acquiring a subsequent HPV infection. 13 Specifically, these authors found a 50% reduced risk for these women during a 4-year follow-up period. In contrast, Trottier et al. reported that there is no natural immunity after clearance of an HPV infection. 14 The inclusion of natural immunity might considerably influence the model-predicted outcomes, as an increased force of infection has to be considered to fit the model. Infectious diseases with a relative low force of infection are often better controllable by vaccination and an increased herd\u00ad immunity benefit will be found. Within our model, 63% of women are protected by natural immunity against subsequent HPV infection. Furthermore, it was assumed that natural immunity is highly effective (>95%) for an average of 6.4 years. Further work should be directed to better understand the natural history of HPV infection and the pathogenesis of HPV-induced cancers. In this study, we only considered the benefits of protection against cervical cancer. However, it has been shown that HPV vaccination also provides protection against other HPV-induced 5 cancers. Consideration of these other HPV-induced cancers will result in additional health gains. Specifically, more insight should be gained on the HPV-specific incidence of (pre) ;; malignant stages and the progression rates from one health state to another. o Compari son with other studies Our findings are generally in line with findings of others for different countries. For The Netherlands, Bogaards et al. used a deterministic dynamic modeling approach and estimated a 4 7% reduction in cervical cancer incidence due to HPV vaccination.211 Furthermore, Choi et al. and Van de Velde et al., using deterministic and stochastic dynamic modeling, respectively, estimated -70% and -65% reductions in HPV prevalence for the UK and Canada, respective ly.212 213 Note that both Choi et al. and van de Velde et al. assumed a 70% vaccine uptake. Increasing the vaccine uptake to the 70%-level used by these authors, we found a 6 7% decrease in cervical cancer incidence (Bogaards et al. reported a 60% decrease). Therefore, overall the results of four different dynamic transmission models appear to provide comparable results. Nevertheless, there are some differences in model structure. First, Van de Velde et al. used a stochastic individual-based model, simulating all women individually, while the other models are determini stic compartmental models. Second, the duration of natural immunity against subsequent infections varies in the models (ranging from 6.4 years to 33 years). Third, inclusion of the potential cross-protection benefits differs between the studies. Although the different models include multiple HPV types, Choi and colleagues grouped the non-HPV 16/18 types as one HPV group in their transmission model. Considering the HPV types other than HPV16 and 18 as one group might result in 88 Analysis of the impact of prophylactic vaccination against human papilloma virus infection using a dynamic-modelling approach inadequate estimates of the benefits of HPV vaccination. Specifically, we found differences in effectiveness between the different HPV types. Conclusions and future perspectives In conclusion, we present a dynamic transmission model for HPV infection including the most prevalent high-risk HPV types. Our study underpins the importance of dynamic simulation approaches for infectious disease modeling. We found that a 50% vaccination coverage results in a 52% reduction in cervical cancer incidence. The reduction in cervical cancer incidence is strongly dependent on vaccination coverage and the duration of vaccine-induced protection. Despite this, clearly efforts should be made to improve vaccination coverage among 12-year\u00ad old girls. Furthermore, vaccination of older girls could be considered to reduce the burden of cervical cancer in partially vaccinated cohorts. Further work will be conducted to assess the health-economic consequences of HPV vaccination. Also, we are currently expanding the model to include other HPV-induced diseases. 89 90 Cost- effectiv eness of human papilloma virus vaccination programmes parallel to current vaccination of teenage girls. Tjalke A Westra Hans W Nijman Jan C Wilschut Taos Daemen Maarten J Postma Manuscript in preparation Abstract Introduction: Since 2009, 12-year-old Dutch teenage girls are vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV vaccination has been introduced in the Netherlands to provide protection against cervical cancer. However, the current uptake of HPV vaccination, being approximately 50-60%, is comparatively low. Conseque ntly, a large group of girls are still at risk of developing HPV-induced cervical cancer later on in life. Therefore, alternative HPV vaccination scenarios have been proposed, in addition to the existing programme, to provide additional protection against cervical cancer. Aim: Here, we updated the cost-effectiveness estimates of the existing HPV vaccination programme in the context of the relatively low uptake of the vaccine, and we assessed the cost-effec tiveness of three different vaccination scenarios: (i) increased coverage of the existing programme, (ii) vaccination of girls at an older age, and (iii) vaccination of teenage boys. Method: A dynamic model was used to determine the clinical and economical consequences of the existing programme with and without the above alternative scenarios. Costs and health effects of the alternative scenarios, expressed as life years (LYs) or quality-adjusted 6 life years (QALYs) gained, were compared with the outcomes of the existing programme. In sensitivity analyses, the robustness of the model-pr edicted outcomes was evaluated. ,_ QJ \"' ..c: Results: found the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the existing HPV vaccination programme to be \u20ac9,500 per QALY gained. The three alternative scenarios were also found to be cost-effective. In particular, in addition to the existing programme at an uptake of 50%, the cost-effectiv eness of an increased coverage up to 70%, or vaccination of girls up to 20 years of age with a coverage of 10% remained below \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained. The costs per gained QALY for vaccination of girls 24 years of age or for vaccination of boys were below \u20ac50,000. Conclusions: From a health-economic perspective, alternative HPV vaccination programmes, in addition to the existing programme for 12-year-old girls, should be considered. In particular, we found that an increased coverage at 12 years of age, vaccination of older girls and vaccination of boys were likely cost-effective. An increased coverage of the current vaccination programme was found to be most effective and cost-effective in further reducing the burden of cervical cancer. If the coverage of the existing programme for girls increases, vaccination of boys is unlikely to remain cost-effective. 92 Introduction Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination programmes parallel to current vaccination of teenage girls Two prophylactic vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are currently available: Cervarix\"' and Gardasil.214 Both vaccines are highly effective in providing protection against infection with HPV16 and 18, the two most common HPV types found in cervical cancer.17 Furthermore, there is evidence that both vaccines induce some degree of cross-protection against other high-risk HPV types not included in the vaccines.35 In view of the severity of the disease, most developed countries decided to introduce HPV vaccination for young teenage girls.181 Implementation of HPV vaccination is expected to substantially reduce the burden of cervical cancer. In the Netherlands, an HPV vaccination programme for 12-year-old girls was introduced in 2010.215 In addition, a catch-up programme, covering girls 13 to 16 years of age, was conducted in 2009. Despite the severity of the disease prevented by the HPV vaccination, vaccine uptake is relatively low with only SO to 60% of teenage girls currently being vaccinated.216 Many girls decide not to get vaccinated, primarily due to uncertainties about the vaccine's efficacy and safety.131 Therefore, despite the implementation of the HPV vaccination programme, many girls remain at risk of acquiring an HPV infection, and thus they also remain at increased risk of developing cervical cancer later on in life. To further reduce the burden of cervical cancer, alternative HPV vaccination programmes have been proposed in combination with the existing programmes. For example, vaccination of girls who initially declined HPV vaccination or vaccination of teenage boys, in addition to the vaccination of teenage girls, has been recommended.217 Although both additional vaccination strategies are directed at a further reduction of the burden of HPV-induced cancer, their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will differ. Bogaards et al. have argued that a strategy involving vaccination of females only will be most efficient in reducing HPV prevalence.207 Previously, using a static modelling approach, we already showed that HPV vaccination of women up to 23 years of age is cost-effective.218 However, a significant herd\u00ad immunity effect might be expected among boys and unvaccinated girls, since approximately 50% of girls aged 12 to 20 years are currently protected by vaccination against HPV16 and 18 and thus no longer spread these viruses. How these indirect benefits affect the cost\u00ad effectiveness of vaccination of teenage girls at an older age or vaccination of teenage boys is not well understood. Before alternative HPV vaccination programmes are going to be introduced, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such programmes should be assessed. Here, we aim to update the cost-effectiveness estimates of the existing HPV vaccination programme, in the context of the comparatively low vaccine uptake. Furthermore, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative HPV vaccination strategies, in addition to the current vaccination of 12-year-old girls. In particular, we considered, for the situation in the Netherlands: (i) an increased vaccine uptake by 12-year-old girls, (ii) vaccination of 93 6 \"' .c girls at an older age, and (iii) vaccination of 12-year-old boys in addition to the existing vaccination programme for girls. A previously published dynamic transmission model was used to determine the clinical and economic consequences of these different vaccination scenarios.219 Methods Model We used a dynamic model to predict the prevalence of seven high-risk HPV types (i.e. HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58), incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer and the cervical cancer-related mortality, before and after HPV vaccination.219 The deterministic compartment model simulates the transmission of the individual HPV types between males and females, taking into account the indirect effects of herd protection. The population was stratified by age, sex, sexual activity (i.e., core with>2 partners per 6 months and non-core with <2 partners per 6 months), and screening attendance. Men and women may have multiple HPV infections in the model; however, for the progression to cervical cancer only the most oncogenic HPV type was considered. The transmission part of the model consists of three compartments representing \"HPV\u00ad susceptible\" , \"HPV-infected\", or \"immune\" . Only women in the compartment \"HPV-infected\" are at risk of developing cervical cancer. In the model, women can progress from \"HPV\u00ad infected\" through \"CIN stages 1, 2, and 3\", on to \"cervical cancer stages 1 to 4\". Furthermore, women can regress to less severe disease states or to the \"immune\" state as a result of natural regression or treatment. Natural immunity can wane, causing people to become susceptible again to infection with the same HPV type. The average duration of natural immunity was assumed to be 6.4 years.13 Progression and regression rates were adapted from the literature and were determined by fitting the model to data on HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence and mortality. 193 The model explicitly considers the Dutch cytological cervical cancer screening programme. In this programme, women 30 to 60 years of age are invited for cytological screening at 5-year intervals. In the Netherlands, 90% of women attend the screening programme at least once during life. However, the overall 5-year compliance is approximately 80%. For further details of the model, see Westra et al 223 Vaccine characteristics In the Netherlands, teenage girls are vaccinated with the bivalent HPV vaccine Cervarix, since 2009. This vaccine has shown high efficacy against persistent HPV16 and 18 infection in females na\"ive to HPV.17 Furthermore, some degree of cross-protection against other non\u00ad vaccine HPV types has been found for Cervarix'., and Gardasil. Cervarix shows cross\u00ad protective efficacy against HPV31, 33, and 45 (Table 1) and Gardasil against HPV31 (i.e. 94 Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination programmes parallel to current vaccination of teenage girls 57%)35 As the cross-protection differs between both vaccines and the duration of cross\u00ad protection is unclear, in our base case we excluded these potential benefits. As the vaccines induce high antibody titers against HPV16 and 18, it is generally assumed that vaccination provides lifelong protection against these virus types.149 However, clinical evidence for this is still lacking. Therefore, we assessed the cost-effectiveness for two options: (i) vaccination provides lifelong protection and (ii) vaccination provides 20 years of protection. Finally, the vaccine price was set at \u20ac105 per dose according to the list price in the Netherlands. Table 1 provides an overview of the characteristics of the bivalent HPV vaccine Cervarix currently used in the Netherlands. Table 1: Vaccine characteristics of the bivalent HPV price per dose Efficacy 95% 79% 56% 76% Lifelong or 20 years \u20ac105 ---------- Vaccination strategies Reference 17 17, 147 17,147 17,147 149 List price In the Netherlands, HPV vaccination started in 2009 with a catch-up programme covering girls ranging from 13 to 16 years of age. Since 2010, 12-year-old girls are being vaccinated annually. Vaccine uptake in the context of the latter programme was initially approximately 50%, but the coverage is currently increasing.216 Nevertheless, a large group of women remains at risk of developing cervical cancer later on life as a result of an HPV infection against which the vaccines do protect, simply because they are not vaccinated. In the present study, the base case involved an update of the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination of girls at 12 years of age. We assumed a vaccination coverage of 50% for girls completing the full three-dose course, based on the current Dutch situation. In three different scenarios, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of additional HPV vaccination programmes. Specifically, the following scenarios were considered: (i) an increased coverage for girls 12 years of age, (ii) a catch-up programme for girls at 16, 20, or 24 years of age, and (iii) vaccination of boys at 12 years of age. A 10% vaccination coverage was applied for vaccination of girls at an older age and 10%, 30% or 50% vaccine uptake was considered for the vaccination of boys, in combination with a 50% coverage in the existing programme for girls. We assumed that these additional programmes would start 4 years after the introduction of HPV vaccination in the Netherlands (i.e. 2013). 95 6 '\u00ad QJ \"' ..c: Cost-effectiveness analyses The model tracks the total costs and quality-of-life losses of the different cohorts. Health\u00ad state-specific costs and quality-of -life losses (i.e. utilities) were adapted from our previous publicati on.140 These costs include treatment costs of CIN and cervical cancer, costs of the screening programme and costs of the vaccination. In addition, indirect costs were included according to Dutch health-economic guidelines. Future monetary and health effects were discounted at a rate of 4% and 1.5%, respectively. By comparing the costs and quality-of-life of the vaccinated cohorts with those of the unvaccinated cohorts, the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were determined. Dividing the incremental costs by the incremental QALYs gained, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was determined. In the Netherlands, an intervention is considered highly cost-effective if the ICER remains below \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained. However, interventions with an ICER ranging from \u20ac20,000 to \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained are generally also considered to be cost-effective.220 Sensitivity analyses The available HPV vaccines comprise 2 high-risk HPV types (i.e. HPV16 and HPV18). The quadrivalent vaccine GardasW\" in addition contains 2 low-risk HPV types, HPV6 and 11, providing protection against anogenital warts. Novel second-generation HPV vaccines, providing protection against 6 or 7 different high-risk HPV types and 2 low-risk HPV types, are currently in clinical evaluation. Here, we assessed the cost-effecti veness of the candidate nonavalent HPV vaccine considering only the benefits of providing protection against cervical cancer. The nonavalent vaccine induces high antibody titers against the individual HPV types. As no efficacy data against persistent infection or disease are available at the moment, we assumed a 95% efficacy against infection with HPV types included in the vaccine. Furthermore, recent data show that the bivalent vaccine Cervarix TM provides already sufficient protection in a two-dose schedule, as opposed to the current three-dose schedule, if girls are vaccinated at 10 to 14 years of age. Therefore, here we updated the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination considering a two-dose strategy and a 2+1-dose strategy with a booster dose 10 or 20 years after the vaccination. To enhance the transferability of our findings to other settings, different discount rates were applied to the future monetary effects (range: 0 to 5%) and health effects (range: 0 to 5%). Together with Belgium, the Netherlands is unique in discounting future health gains at a lower rate compared to costs, i.e. 3% (Belgium) or 4% (Netherlands) for monetary effects vs. 1.5% for health effects. Furthermore, as HPV vaccination is implemented within national immunisation programmes, a lower vaccine price can be considered than the current Dutch list price of the HPV vaccines. Therefore, the vaccine price was varied from \u20ac65 to \u20ac125 per dose. 96 Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination programmes parallel to current vaccination of teenage girls Results Benefits and cost-effectiveness of the current HPV vaccination programme Clinical benefits in the base-case scenario Implementation of HPV vaccination in the Dutch national immunisat ion programme was expected to substantially reduce the burden of cervical cancer. Without vaccination, our model predicted 602 cases of cervical cancer annually, reflecting the situation in The Netherlands. In the base-case scenario (vaccine coverage: 50%; duration of protection: lifelong; age vaccinee: 12 years), vaccination resulted in a 52% reduction in cervical cancer incidence. When the benefits of cross-protection induced by the bivalent vaccine Cervarix, as currently used in the Netherlands, were taken into account, the reduction was 60%. If vaccine-induced immunity wanes after 20 years, the reduction in cervical cancer incidence was estimated at 31 % in the base-case scenario. Furthermore, implementation of the catch-up programme, covering girls 13 to 16 years of age, was estimated to prevent 704 or 387 additional cases of HPV16-or HPV18-induced cervical cancer, if vaccination provides lifelong or 20 years protection, respective ly. Cost-effectiveness of the existing HPV vaccination programme For the calculation of the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination, the total cervical cancer\u00ad related costs and utilities in the unvaccinated cohort were compared to those in the vaccinated cohort. Total model-predicted cervical cancer screening and treatment costs without vaccination were \u20ac44 million (\u20ac11.6M if discounted). Furthermore, the model\u00ad predicted annual utility losses per age-cohort were approximately 4270 life-years (1650 if discounted) and 700 QALYs (355 if discounted) due to cervical cancer-related mortality and morbidity, respectively. Implementation of HPV vaccination in the Netherlands covering 50% of 12-year-old girls is estimated to cost approximately \u20ac16 million annually. Considering only the benefits of protection against HPV16 and 18, vaccination prevents 320 cases of cervical cancer per vaccinated cohort. The model predicted that vaccination of 12-year-old girls reduces the annual cervical cancer-related costs ( excluding vaccination costs) from \u20ac44 million ( \u20ac11.6M, if discounted) to \u20ac34 million (\u20ac8.9M, if discounted). Furthermore, the undiscounted utility losses decreased from 4970 QALYs or 4270 LYs (2005 QALYs or 1650 LYs, discounted) to 2560 QALYs or 1930 LYs (1371 QALYs or 650 LYs if discounted). Discounted vaccination costs minus the discounted monetary savings divided by the discounted QALYs gained resulted in an ICER for the base case (age vaccinee: of \u20ac9,500 per QALY gained. If vaccination does not provide lifelong protection, but only for 20 years, the estimated ICER was \u20ac14,100 per QALY gained. So, under all circumstances, vaccination of 12-year-old girls was found to be a cost\u00ad effective intervention for the prevention of cervical cancer. 97 6 \"' ..c: In addition to the vaccination of 12-year-old girls, a catch-up programme covering girls 13 to 16 years of age was implemented in the Netherlands in 2009. The costs of this catch\u00ad up programme were estimated at \u20ac63 million. It was estimated that the implementation of this programme prevents 1214 cases of cervical cancer and will result in \u20ac10.8 million discounted monetary savings. Furthermore, approximately 5202 discounted QALYs might be gained by the implementation of the catch-up programme , which is equivalent to an ICER of \u20ac12,100 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses As mentioned above, currently, in the Netherlands, the bivalent HPV vaccine Cervarix\"' is used. Considering the vaccine-ind uced cross-protection, our model predicts that 49 additional cases of cervical cancer will be prevented . Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of the overall HPV vaccination programme improved from \u20ac9,500 per QALY gained to \u20ac7,800 per QALY gained. Use of the quadrivalent vaccine Gardasil results in a 55% reduction in cervical cancer incidence. Assuming price parity between Cervarix and Gardasil (i.e. \u20ac105/dose), the cost-effectiveness of the quadrivalent vaccine was estimated at \u20ac9,000/ QALY gained (Table 2). Furthermor e, a two-dose schedule with the bivalent HPV vaccine has shown to be as immunogenic as the three-dose schedule of the bivalent vaccine. If the number of vaccinations was reduced to two (at t=0 and t=6 months), the cost-effectiveness of the bivalent vaccine was estimated at \u20ac4,500/QALY gained. If for the two-dose schedule a booster dose is required 10 or 20 years after the initial vaccination to achieve lifelong protection, the costs per QALY gained was estimated at \u20ac5,600 or \u20ac6,300, respectiv ely. Currently, a candidate nonavalent HPV vaccine is in clinical evaluation, potentially providing protection against seven high-risk HPV types. The model predicted a 72% reduction in cervical cancer incidence, if we considered a 95% vaccine efficacy against the different HPV types included in this vaccine. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of this vaccine was estimated at \u20ac7,100 per QALY gained, ifwe assumed the vaccine price to be the same as that ofCervarix or Gardasil, i.e. \u20ac105 per dose. Considering the differences in cost-effectiveness, we estimated the price differential at \u20ac5, \u20ac19, and \u20ac28, for the quadrivalent, bivalent and the candidate nonavalent HPV vaccine, respectively, to achieve equal cost-effectiveness compared to a vaccine providing only protection against HPV16 and 18 (i.e. \u20ac9,500/QALY gained). Compared to the bivalent vaccine Cervarix (\u20ac105/dose), which is currently used, the price differential was estimated at -\u20ac12 and \u20ac8 for the quadrivalent vaccine Gardasil and the candidate nonavalent vaccine, respectivel to achieve equal cost-effectiveness. gs Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination programmes parallel to current vaccination of teenage girls Table 2.

Previously, it has already been shown that the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination is highly sensitive to discounting. When we varied the discount rate from 0% to 5%, the ICER turned out to be \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac24,900 per QALY gained (Table 3). In the base case, the price of the HPV vaccine was \u20ac105 per dose according to the Dutch list price. However, within national immunisation programmes usually lower prices are paid for vaccines. The cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination ranged from \u20ac5,200 to \u20ac11, 700, if the vaccine price per dose was varied from \u20ac65 to \u20ac125. In the base case, we considered that vaccination provides lifelong protection. Currently, the duration of vaccine-induced immunity is proven for almost 10 years.32 If we assumed that vaccination would provide only 20 years of protection, we estimated that the cost\u00ad effectiveness of HPV vaccination was \u20ac14,100 per QALY efficacy HPV16/18: 95%). gained were estimated at \u20ac12,000, \u20ac13,300, and \u20ac11,100 for the bivalent, quadrivalent, and the candidate nonavalent HPV vaccine, respectively, if these vaccines would provide 20 years of protection. Finally, if HPV16/18-induced immunity provides lifelong protection and the cross-protection wanes after 20 years, the ICERs were estimated at \u20ac8,400 and \u20ac9,100 per QALY gained for the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccine, respectively. 99 Table 3. Sensitivity analysis of the effect of the discount rates for costs and health effects on the future outcomes of HPV vaccination. Discount rates Incr emental effects vaccinee coverage 50%; vaccine price \u20ac105; duration protection lifelong; vaccine efficacy HPV16/18 95% Alternative vaccination programmes to further reduce the burden of cervical cancer Increased vaccination coverage among 12-year-old girls The most straightforward strategy to reduce the burden of cervical cancer is to try to improve the vaccination coverage among 12-year-old girls. Table 4 provides an overview of the model\u00ad predicted vaccination costs, QALY gains and monetary savings for different vaccination 6 coverages. If vaccination provides lifelong protection, HPV16 and 18 was eradicated from the modelled cohorts if vaccination coverage was >90%. Therefore, no additional QALYs or \"' ..c monetary savings were obtained if vaccination coverage was raised from 90% to 100%. In direct comparison, when the coverage increases from 50% to 70% or from 70% to 90%, the ICER was estimated at \u20ac16,500/QALY gained and \u20ac38,100/Q ALY gained, respectively. As no additional health gains will be obtained if coverage increases from 90% to 100%, this strategy was dominated (i.e. more costly and equal QALY gain). If vaccination would provide only 20 year protection, the ICER in a direct comparison was still below \u20ac50,000/QAL Y in the above scenarios. 100 Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination programmes parallel to current vaccination of teenage girls Table 4.

Age vaccinee 12 years; vaccine efficacy HPV16/18 95% Vaccination of'older 'girls in addition to the existing vaccination programme To further reduce the burden of cervical cancer, vaccination of females at older age may be considered. Table 5 presents a summary of the benefits and cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination of older girls and young women up the age of 24. As currently the coverage of the existing programme among 12-year-old girls is increasing, the vaccination coverage of the existing programme was set at either 50% or 70%. Furthermore, we assumed a 10% vaccine uptake in the older age groups. Vaccination of women at older age resulted in favourable lCERs (Table 5). In the context of a vaccination coverage among 12-year-old girls of 70%, the costs were \u20ac27,100/QAL Y gained for girls 16 years of age and almost \u20ac40,000/ QALY gained for vaccination of women 24 years of age. Under conditions of moderate coverage (50%) among 12-year-old girls, vaccination of girls 16 to 24 years of age was more cost-effective. If vaccination were to provide only 20 years of protection, vaccination of 16-year-old girls, in addition to the existing programme, was cost-effective at \u20ac23, 700 /QALY gained. 101 Table 5.

In the context of the existing programme with a 50% coverage among 12-year-old girls, vaccination of boys was found to be cost-effective. \"' .c However, if vaccination coverage among girls increases, the vaccination of boys becomes less and less cost-effective. Specifically, if >70% of girls are vaccinated within the existing programme, the cost-effectiveness of vaccination of boys exceeds \u20ac100,000/Q ALY gained. Table 6.

Specifically, the cost-effectiveness of the existing programme was estimated at \u20ac9,500 per QALY gained. However, as the current vaccine uptake in the programme is only 50-60%, a large group of girls is still at risk of acquiring an HPV infection and, thus, of developing cervical cancer later on in life. Therefore, alternative vaccination scenarios have been proposed, such as vaccination of boys and vaccination of girls at an older age. Indeed, in our study, we found that, while an increased vaccination coverage among 12-year-old girls is the most effective and cost-effective strategy for further prevention of cervical cancer, vaccination of girls 16-20 years of age might be an attractive and cost-effective additional scenario. Also, as long as the vaccination coverage among 12-year-old girls in the existing programme remains 50%-60%, vaccination of boys was found to be, under most circumstances, a cost-effective intervention to further reduce cervical cancer among women. The vaccination of boys has recently been criticised by Bogaards et al 207 These authors showed that vaccination of girls only is the most efficient strategy for reducing HPV prevalence. Also in our study, we also found that an increased vaccination coverage among 12-year-old girls or the vaccination of older girls was more cost-effective than the vaccination of boys. Furthermore, when vaccination coverage among 12-year-old girls increases, the cost-effectiveness of vaccination of boys goes down. Notably, in the Netherlands, the current HPV vaccination coverage among 12-year-old girls approaches 60%. If vaccination coverage reaches levels >70%, vaccination of boys is no longer cost-effective with an ICER above \u20ac100,000 per QALY gained. Also others found that the vaccination of boys is unlikely to be cost-effective. 158 210 221222 However, in these studies a> 70% vaccination coverage among girls was considered. We show that in the context of a low vaccination coverage among girls, vaccination of boys is likely cost-effective. Besides vaccination of boys, we also assessed the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination of girls and women at an older age. Against a background of 50% coverage of the current vaccination programme among 12-year-old girls, we found that vaccination of women up to 24 years of age remains cost-effective (i.e. <\u20ac30,000/QAL Y). If the coverage of the existing programme increases to 70%, the costs per QALY gained remained favourable for vaccination of 16-or 20-year-old girls. Under these conditions, the ICER for 24-year-olds appeared to be almost \u20ac40,000 per QALY gained. So, a catch-up programme for unvaccinated girls who initially declined vaccination could be considered. However, it might be argued that these girls already refused the vaccination once and that, thus, the additional uptake in such a catch-up programme might be small. The main reasons for refusal of the vaccine relate 103 6 ,._ ., \"' ..c to uncertainty about the vaccine's safety and efficacy. With the availability of new safety and efficacy data, there is a possibility that the girls who originally declined the vaccination might now be willing to participate. 223 So, until the existing HPV vaccination programme for 12-year-old girls reaches high coverage rates, catch-up programmes for older girls or, as indicated above, vaccination of 12-year-old boys could be considered to further reduce the burden of cervical cancer. Next to the prevention of cervical cancer, vaccination against HPV provides also protection against other HPV-induced cancers of the genital tract. In particular, vulvar, vaginal, anal and penile cancer in females and males might be prevented by vaccination.224 Furthermore, head-and neck cancers have been related to HPV infection. Inclusion of these cancers in health-economic evaluations will further improve the cost-effectiveness of the existing routine and catch-up programmes. De Kok et al. have made a first estimate of the benefits of protection against these other HPV-induced cancers specific for the situation in the Netherlands. 225 However, as a static model was used, the indirect benefits in males could not be considered. Other studies for other countries found that the inclusion of non-cervical HPV-induced cancers indeed does improve the cost-effect iveness of HPV vaccination using dynamic models.171 m Further work will be required to assess the clinical and economical benefits of protection against other non-cervical HPV-induced cancers, specifically for the situation in The Netherlands. Our modelling analysis indicates that the cost-effectiveness of the bivalent, quadrivalent and the candidate nonavalent vaccine in preventing cervical cancer is almost similar. In particular, assuming price parity between the different vaccines (i.e. \u20ac105 per dose), we estimated that the costs per QALY gained were \u20ac7,100, \u20ac7,800 and \u20ac9,000 for the nonavalent, and quadrivalent HPV vaccine. This implies that the nonavalent vaccine may be more expensive compared to the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, i.e. \u20ac8 or \u20ac22 per dose, respectivel y, to achieve equal cost-effectiveness. Recent clinical data showed that the bivalent vaccine already provides full protection given in a two-dose schedule to 10 to 14-year-old girls. If we considered a two-dose schedule for the bivalent vaccine, the ICER was estimated at \u20ac4,500/Q ALY gained. However, the quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccines are expected to substantially reduce the burden of anogenital warts. These additional benefits were not taken into account in this study, as HPV vaccination has been introduced to provide protection against cervical cancer. Previously, we already showed that the inclusion of protection against genital warts improves the cost-effectiveness of the quadrivalent vaccine.227 Also in other studies, it was found that the inclusion of protection against anogenital warts favours the cost-effectiveness of the quadrivalent vaccine.171 Therefore, a dynamic model simulating HPV6 and 11 transmission should be designed to consider these additional benefits of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, and also that of the candidate nonavalent HPV vaccine, since this vaccine also includes HPV6 and 11. 104 Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination programmes parallel to current vaccination of teenage girls The model-predicted outcomes of our study were found to be highly sensitive to the vaccination costs, to the discounting rates applied, and to the duration of vaccine-induced immunity. Application of a 4% discount rate for both future costs and health effects, according to the old Dutch health-economic guidelines, the ICER of vaccination of 12-year\u00ad old girls against HPV infection was estimated at \u20ac15,000 per QALY gained. Furthermore, it is generally known that governments obtain price reductions on vaccines when the vaccination strategy is implemented in national immunisation programmes. However, the vaccine prices paid within this context are not publically available. Therefore, in sensitivity analyses, we decreased the vaccine price down to \u20ac65 per dose. The ICER ofHPV vaccination was estimated at \u20ac5200 per QALY gained, if the vaccine price was \u20ac65 per dose. Finally, the exact duration of vaccine-induced immunity still remains uncertain. Although the antibody titers remain high for at least 10 years after the vaccination, clinical evidence for lifelong protection is not available yet. If HPV vaccination were to provides, for example, only 20 years of protection, the costs per QALY gained increase from \u20ac9,500 to \u20ac14,100, and thus still remain the threshold of \u20ac20,000. Therefore, although the ICER is highly sensitive to discounting, vaccine price and duration of protection, the vaccination of 12-year-old girls against HPV infection is likely cost-effective. In conclusion, this study re-evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the existing HPV vaccination programme. Despite the low coverage, we found the existing HPV vaccination programme to be highly cost-effective, i.e. <\u20ac10,000/QAL Y gained. Furthermore, this is one of the first studies to provide evidence for the cost-effectiveness of (i) alternative vaccination programmes, taking into account the indirect effects of the existing programme, and (ii) the use of the candidate nonavalent HPV vaccine. Under the current circumstances of relatively low vaccination coverage, we found vaccination of older girls or 12-year-old boys, in addition to the existing HPV vaccination programme for 12-year-old-girls, to be likely cost-effective. Vaccination of older girls was found to be more favourable compared to the vaccination of boys. Furthermore, we made an analytical comparison between Cervarix, Gardasi)TM and the candidate nonavalent HPV vaccine, in terms of cervical cancer prevention and cost-effectiveness. Assuming price parity between Cervarix and GardasiJTM we found Cervarix to be most cost-effective in providing protection against cervical cancer. Furthermore, Cervarix may be \u20ac12/dose more expensive to achieve equal cost-effectiveness compared with Gardasil. Ifwe considered the potential benefits of the candidate nonavalent H PV vaccine, this vaccine was found to be most cost-effective. A \u20ac8 price differential with Cervarix was found to achieve equal cost-effectiveness. To allow well-informed decisions during next tenders, analytical comparisons should be made between the different candidate vaccines. These comparisons should take vaccine\u00ad specific characteristics explicitly into account. 105 106 -Part III - Discounting of future outcomes of preventive interventions 107 108 On discounting of health gains from human papilloma virus vaccina tion : effects of different approaches. Tjalke A Westra Mehraj B Parouty Werner B Value in Health 2012:15(3):562-7 Abstract Objectives: Discounting has long been a matter of controversy in the field of health-economic evaluations. How to weigh future health effects has resulted in ongoing discussions. For health-care interventions with current costs but future benefits these discussions are imminently relevant. Different approaches to discount health effects have been proposed. In this study, we estimated the impact of different approaches for discounting health benefits of HPV-vaccination. Method: A HPV model was used to estimate the impact of different discounting approaches on the present value of health effects. For the constant discount approaches, we varied the discount rate for health effects ranging from 0% to 4%. Next, the impact of relevant alternative discounting approaches was estimated, including hyperbolic, proportional, stepwise and time-shifted discounting. Results: The present value of health effects gained through HPV-vaccination varied strongly when varying discount rates and approaches. Application of the current Dutch guidelines results in a present value of health effects that is eight or two times higher than that produced 7 when using the proportional discounting approach or when using the internationally more common 4% discount rate for health effects, respectively. Obviously, such differences translate into large variations in corresponding ICERs. Conclusion: The exact discount rate and approach chosen in an economic evaluation importantly impacts the projected value of health benefits of HPV-vaccination. Investigating alternative discounting approaches in health-ec onomic analysis is important, especially for vaccination programmes yielding health effects far into the future. Our study underlines the relevance of ongoing discussions on how and at what rates to discount. 110 On discounting of health gains from human papilloma virus vaccination: effects of different approaches Introduction In economic evaluations of health interventions, typically a comparison between competing programmes is made.220\u00b723O By comparing two or more programmes, differences in costs and health outcomes can be estimated. The latter are often expressed in quality-adjusted\u00ad life years (QALYs) gained. This comparison can be summarized in the incremental cost\u00ad effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as incremental costs per QALY gained. This ICER is calculated by dividing the estimated difference in costs by the estimated difference in health outcomes. By relating the ICER to a relevant threshold, health care decision makers can subseque ntly judge the desirability of funding a certain health intervention. In order to secure the quality and comparabilit y of health-economic evaluations, many countries have established national guidelines for such analyses. These guidelines, for example, specify the appropria te study perspective and indicate how specific costs and health effects should be measured and valued. Furthermore, these guidelines often specify how future costs and health benefits need to be weighed relative to current costs and benefits (i.e. how to discount and at which discount rate). While all country-specific guidelines known to us advice the use of the same stationary (or constant) discount model, the recommended discount rates for costs and health outcomes differ from one country to the next. Table 1 gives an overview of the discount rates applied for costs and health outcomes for a number of western countries. 231 Broad consensus exists on discounting of monetised costs and benefits. By contrast, which methods to use to discount non-monetised health outcomes relative to money, has been a topic of considerable controversy for decades. Table 1. Country-specific discount rates for costs and health outcomes. --------------Discount rate Country Costs Health Austria 5% 5% Belgium The Netherlands 4% 1.5% United States 3% 3% Vaccination programmes against infectious diseases, but also other preventive programmes, often involve dominant intervention costs occurring years before the health effects emerge. Although, to a certain degree, this is intervention-and disease-sp ecific, generally 111 the discounting method and rate do determine the weight that future health outcomes of vaccination programmes receive in an evaluation.140232 With costs being borne in the present and health effects often far in the future, discounting has a large impact on the final cost\u00ad effectiveness ratio of such programmes, increasing the ratio compared to the undiscounted ratio. One of the most extreme examples relates to vaccination against Human Papillomavirus (HPV), for which the major health gains ofinterest start to occur approximately 30 years after the initial vaccination through the prevention of cervical cancer and associated morbidity and mortality . For instance, Brisson et al. determined the age-specific undiscounted and discounted net present value of HPV vaccination .92 Specifical ly, these authors showed that especially in the older age groups health gains of preventing cervical cancer are strongly affected by discounting. Consequentl y, the cost-effectiveness of HPV-vaccination, which has recently gained considerable attention in many countries particularly with regard the issue of whether or not to fund (large-scale) vaccination programmes, is highly sensitive to discounting.140 The ICERs of preventive interventions such as vaccination are so heavily influenced by discounting, 44 that the uncertainty related to methodological disagreement between economists on this issue can lead to opposite conclusions and decisions. Therefore, some 7 researchers have argued that specific discounting rules should be applied for preventive interventions, or for exploring the decision uncertainty related to discounting.233 Recently, \"\" ..c: Beu tels et al. suggested that alternative discounting approaches using rates decreasing over time, such as hyperbolic or step-wise discounting, should be applied in sensitivity analyses,43 which was previously suggested by Bleichrodt and Brouwer. 234 This should then provide insight into whether and to which extent the choice of the discounting procedure (over which economists disagree) would influence the policy decision based on the economic evaluation. Naturally, it is more likely for preventive interventions (with long-term health impacts) than for curative interventions ( with short-term health impacts) that the choice for one specific discounting method could be decisive in judging the interventions to be cost\u00ad ineffective or cost-effective. In this paper, we aim to provide an overview of alternative discounting approaches proposed in literature. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of adopting these different discounting approaches in the context of the economic evaluation of a particular preventive programme (i.e. prophylactic HPV-vaccination) in The Netherlands. 140 Given that the health outcomes of HPV-vaccination for the prevention of cervical cancer occur several decades after the initial vaccination (See Box 1), this preventive intervention provides an excellent example -possibly one of the most extreme ones -to demonstrate the influence of different discounting approaches. 112 On discounting of health gains from human papillomavirus vaccination: effects of different approaches Box 1. Pathogenesis cervical cancer Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. Infection with the Human PapillomaVirus (HPV) is a prerequisite for cervical cancer, and the persistence of the infection is especially important. In particular , infection with one of the oncogenic types of HPY may develop into cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of grades I -Ill and ultimately into invasive cancer. Major oncogenic serotypes are 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, and 52. Of these serotypes, HPY 16 and 18 have shown to be responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. In the Netherlands, HPV infection peaks are found in women aged 20 -25 years. Although most women are able to clear the infection within one year; some of them will develop persistent infection. Women can develop CIN 1-111 and cervical cancer after some years of persistent infection. In the Netherlands the average age of cervical cancer is estimated between 40 -45 years. Currently, highly effective prophylactic HPY vaccines are available. HPY vaccines are most effective if administered to women who are HPY negative. Therefore, women should be vaccinated before they become sexually active. Most developed countries decided to implement HPY vaccination of girls aged 12-years in National immunization programmes. Health benefits following HPY-vaccination comprise of prevention of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or development of cervical cancer. These health benefits are expected to occur approxim ately 20 and 30 years after the initial immunization, respectively. Methods In order to investigate the influence of different discount rates and approaches, we used a previously published in-house Markov model for HPV-infection. 140 This model simulates the transmission of HPV infection through cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) stages to cervical cancer. By simulating a cohort twice, once as an unvaccinated and once as a vaccinated cohort, the age-specific health gains of HPV vaccination can be estimated by considering the differences between both simulations. We investigated five different discounting approaches, and focussed on changing discount rates and approaches for health effects. We did not vary the discount rate for costs in the current study (which will be set at a constant level of 4% according to Dutch guidelines), and thus emphasize the differences in the net present value of health effects depending on different discounting approaches and rates. Below we summarize the different approaches used for discounting of health effects which are considered in this study. Constant discounting approach The constant ( or stationary) discounting approach ( equation 1) is well-founded in economic theory, and reflects the most generally used and accepted discounting approach for future costs and health outcomes in health-economic evaluations. 235 In the constant discounting approach, future costs and health outcomes are devalued at a constant rate. So both future costs and health outcomes are exponentially devalued to the moment the intervention 113 (e.g. the vaccination) took place. The magnitude of the discount rate for costs is commonly informed by the rate of return on risk-free government bonds, in line with the societal perspective that is often used. Furthermore, the discount rate for costs is usually determined by this interest rate after correcting for the deflator (i.e. the real interest rate is used instead of the nominal rate). A discount rate for costs of 3-5% is most often used internationally (Table 1). In the Netherlands, this discount rate is 4%. Most countries prescribe the same discount rate for health effects (i.e. uniform discounting; e.g. 4% for costs and 4% for health effects). The reason for this is especially that it has been argued that inconsistencies might occur if discounting is done non-uniformly or differentially .236 Yet, others have rejected the idea that differential discounting would be impossible based on grounds of consistency. 44 233 Indeed, it has been argued that health outcomes could well be discounted with a lower discount rate than costs, without risking inconsistency.47 48 237-241 The justification of a lower (but still constant in time) discount rate for health outcomes lies in the growth of the value of health effects over time, which is not otherwise accounted for in economic evaluations. The difference between the discount rate for costs and effects would be the expected growth rate in the value of health. In the Netherlands, this growth rate has been estimated to be 2.6%.46 With a discount rate of 4% for costs, this would imply an appropriate discount rate for effects of ( 4.0 -2.6 =) 1.4%. In The Netherlands, a discount rate of 1.5% for health effects is indeed 7 currently used in differential discounting. In the present study, to illustrate the impact of the discount rate for health outcomes, we applied different discount rates for health, specifically '\u00ad QJ \"' ..c 0%, 1.5%, 3% and 4%, while the discount rate for costs was set at 4%. Empirical discounting approaches In contrast to the constant discounting approach, empirical studies have shown that the individuals' time preference may decline over time, both from an individual and a societal perspective.242\"245 This was recently confirmed for health effects in a meta-regression analysis by Asenso-Bo adi et a/.245 In particular, the time preference for a short-term delay (i.e. a 5-year delay) was approximately 25% which decreased to approximately 3.5% for a long\u00ad term delay (i.e. a 100 year delay). Alternative discounting approaches have been proposed to better reflect such observed time preferences. Two prominent examples are hyperbolic (equation 2) and proportional (equation 3) discounting.246 249 Applying these discounting approaches obviously still implies that future health effects are weighed less than current ones, however at a decreasing incremental rate. This could more appropriately capture the exact nature of time preference as conceived by the public in the real world. Hyperbolic discounting (equation 2) has been proposed by Loewenstein and Prelec.248 In equation 2, h reflects the individual's preference for the future or timing in general. An individual does not have any time preference (i.e. a discount rate of 0) if h=0; by increasing h the preference for the present increases. Parameter g determines how much the function differs from the constant discounting model,249 with g=l actually representing the constant discount model. Proportional discounting (equation 3) has been proposed by Harvey.247 In 114 On discounting of health gains from human papillomavirus vaccination: effects of different approaches equation 3, b reflects the magnitude of the time preference and y determines the shape of the curve. Initially, Harvey suggested that y should be 1 but others have introduced different values for y. For example, Cairns and van der Pol estimated that the proportional discounting model would fit empirical data best ify would be set at 1.5.244 Here, the proportional and hyperbolic discounting approaches were fitted to time preference rates as reported by Asenso-Boadi et al.245 by varying the values of the variables to minimize the sum of squares and maximize the explanatory power (reflected in r2 ).245 In particular, for the hyperbolic discounting approach the values of h and g were estimated at 0.32 and 0.29, respectively. For the proportional discounting approach the values for b and y were estimated at 3.4 and 1.1, respectively. Equation 1: Equation 2: Equation 3: I a(t)= -- (I+r J I Equations 1-3. of the different discounting methods. 1 constant, 2 hyperbolic, and 3 proportional. In which a(t) is the weight attached to time t. h, g, b and y are parameters reflecting the time preference for the future and r is the discount rate. Stepwise approaches In the step-wise discounting approach, a constant discount rate is used during a specified period, but this is lowered in subsequent consecutive time periods. (It thus resembles a discontinuous hyperbolic discounting function.) Step-wise discounting was previously recommended by the UK treasury (in 1996), and has also been mentioned as one of the options for discounting in economic evaluations in at least two recent papers.43 47 25\u00b0 For the United Kingdom, the time intervals after which the discount rate decreases with 0.5% were based on empirical data,251 and a normative framework was the starting point of the analysis. We applied the rates recommended by the UK treasury (i.e. 3.5% for years 0-30, 3% for years years 126-200, 1.5% for years 201-300, and 1 % thereafter). Note, in the static HPV model that we used, the time horizon of our analyses was set at 100 years so the minimum discount rate applied was 2.5%. Time-shifted approach Specifically for vaccines, in an attempt to appropriately value outcomes of evaluations of preventive interventions, it has been proposed that the health outcomes might be discounted from the moment of risk reduction (i.e. averted infections) instead of from the 115 7 L. \"' moment that health is actually gained.45 252 Bos and colleagues argued that in the case of a vaccination programme health gains of preventing infections are undervalued due to discounting, in particular for some infectious diseases with a long time delay between the initial infection and disease development. To account for this, they recommended the time\u00ad shifted discounting approach, by which health outcomes are discounted from the moment the infection is prevented rather than from the moment each individual life year or QALY is gained. Although this method has been used by others as a pragmatic discounting approach, an exact underpinned normative rationale for it has not been given. Furthermore, this method can easily be criticized because the individuals' time preference in the period after an infection is prevented, is ignored. Still, we used this method with two different discount rates ( 4% and 1.5%) in the period in which discounting is required according to the method. Specifica lly, QALY losses due to cervical cancer were only discounted in the period between vaccination and the moment of HPV-infection in the time-shifted approach (i.e. all QALY losses were implicitly assumed to have been prevented at the same time as the causal factor, an HPV infection, was prevented). Table 2. Overview of different discounting approaches. Approach Name 1 Constant 2 Stepwise 3 Hyperbolic 4 Proportional Time-shifted Resu lts Description Discount rate is constant over time (Equation 1), can be uniform or differential Discount rate declines stepwise after specific time intervals (Table 2) Discount rate declines gradually over time (Equation 2) Discount rate declines gradually over time (Equation 3) Time period between vaccination and the prevention of infection is discoun- ted rather than full period up to actual quality-adjusted life-year g_a_in_s __ _ All five discounting approaches were applied to the health outcomes of a Dutch HPV\u00ad model. This model predicts the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer incidence with and without HPV-vaccination, reflecting the current Dutch situation. Implementation of HPV-vaccination for the full cohort of 12-year-old Dutch girls (i.e. cohort size was set at 100,000) resulted in an undiscounted lifetime gain of2,907 life years or 3,462 QALYs. The total undiscounted costs of implementing HPV-vaccination to the Dutch National Immunisation programme (\"Rijksvaccinatieprogramma\" RVP) were \u20ac31.5 million (\u20ac30.9 million discounted) and resulted in \u20ac11.5 million undiscounted cost offsets (\u20ac2.8 million discounted). Application of the different discounting approaches for health gains resulted in different numbers of discounted QALYs gained by HPV-vaccination. Figure 1 illustrates the time- 116 On discounting of health gains from human papillomavirus vaccination: effects of different approaches specific discount rates of the different discount approaches applied. Clearly, applying the proportional or hyperbolic discounting approach the short-term gains are highly devalued however the long-term benefits are discounted with a relatively lower discount rate compared to a constant discount rate at 4%. Figure 2 illustrates the age-specific net present value of the health gains of HPV-vaccination applying the different discounting approaches. The time-shifted discounting approach resulted in the highest present value of QALYs while the proportional or hyperbolic discounting approach resulted in the lowest estimates (Table 3). Obviously, these results are driven by the relatively high initial discount rates in these latter two methods (i.e. much higher than 4%). If one would use lower rates in a hyperbolic discount function (e.g. Meerding et al.253 recently reported empirically observed hyperbolic discounting with relatively low discount rates), this would yield much higher net present health benefits. For instance, applying these two approaches, but now starting at a 4% discount rate, we find a net present value of 1613 and 1607 QALYs for the proportional and hyperbolic discounting approach, respectively. Notably, in the time-shifted discounting approach,45 health outcomes of HPV-vaccination were only discounted at a constant rate for the period between vaccination and infection, and in the period after infection a zero discount rate was applied. 30--- --------------, -25r, ,S 20\u00b7 f! --- .--. ......i 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Time (years) Figure 1.

Age-specific health gains of human papillomavirus vaccination in the Dutch simulation model using different discount approache s. For the time-shifted discounting approach, a 4% discount rate for the period between intervention and prevented infection was used. 118 On discounting of health gains from human papillomavirus vaccination: effects of different approaches When the step-wise discounting approach was applied the total number of discounted QALYs were comparable to those obtained at constant rate of3%. Note that, the total number of discounted QALYs is sensitive to the time interval and decline in discount rate. When the conventional constant discounting approach was applied, the present value of QALYs gained was highly sensitive to the chosen discount rate. Lower discount rates for health outcomes resulted in substantial increases in total number of discounted QALYs gained with HPV-vaccination (Table 3). Table 3. Discounted health outcomes of HPV-vaccination using the different discounting approaches. Discounting approach QALYs gained Undiscounted 3462 Constant 1.5% proposed To give an indication of the impact of these different approaches on the final ICER, we also combined these results with the discounted costs (4%). It should be noted that we do this mainly for illustrative purposes and that it might not always be logical to combine our results on health gains with a cost-estimate based on constant discounting using a 4% discount rate. In particular, if one prefers an empirically based approach such as hyperbolic discounting for health effects, it is likely that one also wishes to discount costs on a similar basis, i.e. using a hyperbolic discount function. Table 3 shows the results for the ICERs. According to Dutch guidelines (constant discount rates of 4% for money and 1.5% for health; i.e. differential discounting), we found an ICER for HPV-vaccination of \u20ac18,400 per QALY gained. Furthermore, varying the discount rate for health effects from 0% to 4% resulted in estimated ICERs of \u20ac7,600 to \u20ac59,100 per QALY, still using constant discounting. When we applied the proportional discounting approach to health effects, we found an ICER that was nine times higher than the benchmark of \u20ac18,400 per QALY gained. Ergo, extremely large and relevant differences in the ICER were found between the various approaches investigated, moving from extremely cost-effective up to extremely cost-ineffective (when compared to commonly cited thresholds). 119 7 L. QJ \"' ..c: Discussion Discounting of health outcomes is controversial and has been the subject of extensive debate since it was introduced and recommended for economic evaluations. These discussions often evolve around uniform or differential discounting of health outcomes and money, the exact rate of discounting and whether or not to use decreasing discount rates. Different discounting approaches have been suggested. For example, it has been proposed to take the individual's time preference more explicitly into account or to apply lower discount rates in later periods. The aim of using such alternative methods in applied economic evaluations would be to explore the decision uncertainty associated with the different prevailing opinions on this matter.43 It has been suggested to include alternative discount approaches in national guidelines.43 234 In particular , it was proposed to apply alternative discount approaches in sensitivity analyses. In the current study, we evaluated the influence of using different discounting approaches for health outcomes. We illustrated what the impact is of alternative discounting approaches on future health outcomes and the cost\u00ad effectiveness of HPV-vaccination. Since the health outcomes related to HPV-vaccination are expected to occur several decades after the initial vaccination, the number of QALYs gained by HPV vaccination is highly sensitive to the discounting method that is applied.140 Here, we compared the standard constant discounting to alternative approaches. Indeed, our results show that alternative discounting approaches devalue the long-term health outcomes of HPV-vaccination very differently compared to the constant discounting approach. For these alternative discounting approaches, the valuation of future health outcomes was both dependent on the parameter values used in the discounting approaches and the nature of the approaches themselves. Obviously, the variation identified in the net present value of QALYs gained had a large impact on the actual ICE Rs (Table 2). Our current model represents a static model that does not explicitly simulate the spread of HPV in the population. Models that do simulate this spread explicitly are labelled dynamic transmission models.74 233 As argued, for interventions that impact on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases it is preferable to use a dynamic transmission model for simulation of infectious diseases.43 73 In the current paper, we illustrate the effect of different discounting approaches in the static approach. Nevertheless, how to apply constant discounting or alternative approaches in a dynamic transmission model framework is of high interest. Since herd immunity induced by HPV vaccination is highly assortative with age (young people tend to have sex with partners of similar age), one can speculate that the qualitative impacts of the various discounting techniques is roughly similar between dynamic and static models when the same vaccination and screening strategies are compared (i.e. vaccinating a single cohort every year). Once vaccination starts, in addition to a static model, a dynamic model projects the prevention of infections in unvaccinated people. The consequences (warts, precancero us lesions, cancer cases and deaths prevented) 120 On discounting of health gains from human papillomavirus vaccination: effects of different approaches of these additional preventions, however, are likely to follow a pattern over time that is similar for vaccinated (directly protected) girls and for unvaccinated (indirectly protected) girls and boys, mainly because they are all of similar age. This contrasts with some childhood vaccinations for which the herd effects reach across generations. Nevertheless, the herd immunity benefit in the population induced by HPV vaccination depends on the proportion of vaccinated individuals in the population. As a consequence the health gain and the cost\u00ad effectiveness of HPV vaccination might vary between vaccinated cohorts until a new steady state has been reached. In addition, it has been shown that for multicohort models the cost-effectiveness ratio will change for vaccinated cohorts from year to year if differential discounting is applied.184 254 255 In particular, HPV vaccination becomes more favourable if additional cohorts are vaccinated. In general, it seems important for decision-making and guideline- prescribing bodies in different jurisdictions to have transparent, defendable and plausible discount rules. Constant uniform discounting is well founded in economic theory, and is the generally accepted and recommended discounting approach. It purposely does not reflect commonly observed declining time preference of individuals, as this enhances stability by avoiding time inconsistency and paradoxes in policy making. It has been argued, however, that it can be adjusted to account for the growing value of health over time.47 256 Therefore, constant differential discounting has been proposed, which allows for a lower discount rate for health effects relative to costs to adjust for the growing value of health over time.47 233 Differential discounting, which has been adopted in some current (e.g., Netherlands and Belgium) and previous (e.g., UK) HTA guidelines, often significantly lowers the JCERs of interventions. In particular, the ICER of interventions with health gains in the (far) future is more favourable when differential discounting is applied. Again, given the impact that discounting has on final outcomes, the exact underpinning of the discount rules adopted in studies and prescribed in guidelines needs to be fully transparent. Although the topic which discounting approaches to consider as most appropriate, is beyond the scope of this paper, it must be noted that some approaches appear to have a better normative and /or empirical underpinning than others. Nevertheless, as discounting strongly affects -and as such in a way masks -the present value of costs and outcomes of especially interventions with long-term outcomes, alternative discount approaches should be applied in sensitivity analysis. For example, differential discounting or step-wise discounting should be investigated. Recently, the United Kingdom already recommended lowering the discount rate of outcomes from 3.5% to 1.5% when health outcomes extend beyond 30 years, in sensitivity analysis.257 Proportional and hyperbolic discounting approaches are important as they reflect individual and societal time preferences for health outcomes.244 Caution, however, is required in their use as these models introduce risk time of time-inconsistent behaviour. Furthermore, empirical studies show high variance in time preference, and the high observed discount rates may 121 7 ,_ <1J \"' ..c: result in policies that unfairly harm future generations. Still, it is useful to use them more frequently in economic evaluatio ns, for instance in sensitivity analyses.234 256 This is also interesting, since the approach of differential discounting, as prescribed in The Netherlands, and the proportional and hyperbolic discounting functions more or less represent extremes in terms of outcomes. Thus, using them, also in sensitivity analysis would make sense and be informative for decision makers. Our results highlight the importance of discounting and ongoing discussions in the literature on this topic. Furthermore, our study underlines the importance of discount rates as well as discount approaches. It illustrates that the recommendation to carefully identify appropriate discount methods and rates, and to investigate the sensitivity of results to application of alternative discounting approaches, holds even stronger if vaccination programmes are considered with health effects far into the future. HPV-vaccination can be considered as one of the most extreme examples of such a programme. We hope that this paper will contribute to the debate in this area and to a fair discounting practice, such that all interventions for cure and prevention can be compared at the same level playing field. 122 On discounting of health gains from human papillomavirus vaccination: effects of different approaches 123 124 Accu mula ting evidence for the case of Maarten J Clinical Pharmacology 2013:6(1):1-3 Discounting of monetary and health outcomes is nowadays common in health economics and specified in all country-spec ific guidelines on \"good health-economic practice\".254258 It is the specific approach taken and the exact rates utilized that differ among countries. In particular , regarding the differing approaches, much debate has been spurred concerning whether to adopt equal or differential discounting. Equal discounting is mostly used in practice and guidelines sometimes refer to pragmatic motivations, including consistency arguments or the ease to use one and the same rate for money and health. Differential discounting involves the application of a generally lower discount rate for health outcomes -for example, life years -motivated by ethical arguments on valuing life years for future generations without discounting future utility or the potential increase in the monetary value of health over time related to differing growth rates in the economy and life expectancy.46 240 259 More specifically, equal discounting is motivated by the main argument that the use of differential discounting would lead to infinite postponement of health-care programs.46 This argument has recently been illustrated by O'Mahony and colleagues by the inclusion of additional cohorts in a cost-effectiveness analysis for HPV vaccination.260 In particular , they showed that the cost-effectiveness of subsequent cohorts becomes more favourable if differential discounting is applied. How to exactly judge and whether this is actually a 8 problem is again topic for discussion. One could argue that this decline in cost-effectiveness can be justified exactly due to this increasing value of health.261 ... QJ \"' ..c: Currently only 2 countries prescribe the use of differential discounting in their guidelines: the Netherlands at 4% for money and 1.5% for health effects and Belgium at 3.5% and 1.5%, respective ly.254 The methodology underlying differential discounting has first been specified by Gravelle & Smith in the UK262 which, not surprisingly, involves the first country to embark on differential discounting. However, the UK reversed this decision to discount differential ly back to equal discounting approximately half a decade ago.4750 236 Note, recently the Appraisal Committee of NICE recommended to apply differential discounting (1.5% health effects and 3.5% costs) for long term benefits in sensitivity analysis.43 We previously strongly argued against this reversal, and the Netherlands changed to differential discounting based on this argumen tation. 47 Next to an overall lower discount rate for health, an initially similar but decreasing discount rate in time has been proposed as well. This illustrates the general uncomfortable feeling with equal discounting of money and life years. Notably, it is well-known from empirical research on time preference that this preference is relatively stronger for the near future than for the distant future.248 Two approaches have focussed on a methodology combining a discount rate for health that is essentially similar to that for money on the short term and a relatively low discount rate farther into the future.45263265 Building on these methods, other authors have extended the approach from specifying 2 discount rates for the near 126 Accumulating evidence for the case of differential discounting and distant futures to a trajectory of discount rates for multiple periods into the future. For example, more than 2 differentiating periods with decreasing discount rates for health have been proposed by the UK Treasury, 266 with the discount rate decreasing from an initial 3.5% to 3.0% after 30 years, on to 2.5% after 75 years, etcetera. Obviously, the approach of decreasing discounting for health often results in a net lower discount rate for health than for money. Discounting certainly has a rich history. Fundamental to the approach is Ramsey's formula already specified in 1928,m explaining the discount rate for money (rm) into its constituting elements: Equation r = p + E g m m m with p reflecting the rate of pure time preference, Em the elasticity of marginal utility of money and gm the growth in the amount of money (in particular, economic growth). A similar formula can be designed for the discount rate of health, for example concerning life years (r1, E1, g1). Both formulas, having only the pure time preference component in common, imply similar discount rates obviously is highly unlikely, again illustrating the need for differential discounting from a purely mathematical point of view since it is not always the case that Em=E1 or gm=g1 With the growth in life expectancy lagging far behind economic growth, a lower r1 than rm is plausible, rather than the other way around. Notably, the pure time preference component has been further subdivided into parts reflecting impatience (just wanting things asap) and uncertainty (potential occurrence of a catastrophic event avoiding us to reap any future benefits). For example, the recently recommended 3.5% discount rate in the UK254 may be considered to comprise 0.5% for impatience, 1 % for catastrophic risk and 2% for the component reflecting elasticity and economic growth. From a more philosophical point of view, the specific nature of health gains as life years may give rise to specific considerations. This specific nature refers to indivisibility of a life year within a sequence of life years gained and the dependence of life years within the sequence. In particular, one cannot live an individual life year without living the previous one; i.e. the subsequent life year is dependent on the previously lived ones and as such life lived is indivisible (one cannot life half of the previous life year, for example). Two inferences can be drawn from this. Firstly, it might be questioned whether the pure time preference component in the mathematical approach would indeed be exactly similar for both money and life years. In particular, since discounting future lives implicitly assumes their existence, rationality may dictate that pure time preference should be omitted or at least exclude the catastrophic risk component. Secondly, if life years are dependent and indivisible it would not be adequate to discount a sequence of life years gained in one individual year one by one, rather, one aught one to discount the whole composite of accumulated years once 127 8 ... ClJ \"' ..c: from the start of the sequence back to the moment of implementation of the intervention being investigated. An overall lower discount rate for life years would validly address the first aspect, whereas the second once again motivates the use of a decreasing or even zero discount rate within the sequence of dependent indivisible life years. We have outlined various motivations and illustrations for differential discounting of money and health. Given the predominant current stream in the guidelines of equal discounting, we would argue that it is time for change. From ethical, economic, mathematical and philosophical points of view, differential discounting is strongly supported and guidelines should start reflecting this better. We would argue that, rather than by sound evidence and reasoning, equal discounting is primarily supported by pragmatic and historic motivations. Fortunately, the expertise in the area of discounting in health economics is rapidly accumulat ing, involving thorough discussions, complex analyses and strengthening alignment with empirical situations. This expertise now more and more comprises the specificities in discounting, enhancing fair and valid discount rates and albeit fair and valid assessments of the costs and benefits with different timings for both public health and pharmaceutical strategies. Our arguments have been derived from analysis of the health outcome of life years. Notably, for quality oflife other arguments might exist, ultimately even warranting different discount rates for life years and quality of life. This might illustrate the need to go from a 2-dimensional analysis to a 3-dimensional one including money, life years and quality separately, designing a framework justifying the specificities of all these 3 elements and in the end estimate the respective discount rates separately and differentially. 128 Accumulating evidence for the case of differential discounting 129 130 General discussion and concluding remark s 9 ,._ Cl) \"' ..c:: GENERAL DISCUSSION Summary The work described in this thesis addresses the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In the first part of the study, using a static model, we demonstrate that prophylactic HPV vaccination is a cost-effective intervention for women until the age of 23 years. In particular , we estimated the costs per QALY gained for 12-year-old girls at \u20ac18,500, increasing to approximately \u20ac30,000 for women 23 years of age. Vaccination of women >23 years of age still results in health gains with however, increasingly unfavourable cost-effectiveness outcomes. Reduced vaccine prices improve cost-effectiveness of vaccination at relatively older age. Inclusion of the potential cross\u00ad reactivity of the HPV vaccines against non-vaccine high-risk HPV types results in more favourable outcomes. In this regard, it was found that the bivalent vaccine Cervarix is more effective and cost-effective (at \u20ac17,600/QALY gained) than the quadrivalent vaccine Gardasil (at \u20ac18,900/QALY gained). However, Gardasil was found to be more cost\u00ad effective at\u20ac16,300/Q ALY gained, if the additional benefits provided by this vaccine, in terms of protection against genital warts, were explicitly taken into account. In general, based on the results obtained with the static model, we found that HPV vaccination represents a cost\u00ad effective intervention for women in the Netherlands. Even more favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are anticipated if potential indirect benefits of the vaccination are taken into account. To quantify these, in the second part of the thesis, we used a dynamic model to determine the future monetary and health effects of HPV vaccination. Dynamic models implicitly consider benefits due to herd\u00ad immunity and changes in the force ofinfection in the population. Our dynamic model predicted that the cervical cancer incidence in the Netherlands will decrease with approximately 52% if 12-year-old girls are vaccinated at a 50% coverage. The latter approximately corresponds with the initial Dutch situation after start of the vaccination in 2009. The total cervical cancer incidence would be reduced by 7 4% if all girls would be vaccinated against HPV with either Cervarix or Gardasil. If vaccine-induced cross-protection is taken into account, Cervarix and Gardasil were estimated to reduce the cervical cancer incidence by 60% and 55%, respectivel y, at 50% vaccination uptake among 12-year-old girls. These estimates are based on the widely accepted assumption that the vaccination provides lifelong protection. If, vaccination would not provide lifelong protection, but only, for example, 20 years, the reduction in cervical cancer incidence is estimated at only 31 %. The cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination at 12 years was estimated at \u20ac9,500 or \u20ac14,100/QALY gained if vaccination provides lifelong or 20 years of protection, respectively. Vaccination of women at an older age was found less cost-effective due to the herd-immunity effects of vaccination at 12 years of age. So, dynamic models for HPV vaccination provide realistic insights that are lacking with static models. 132 General discussion and concluding remarks In the above analyses, it appeared that there is a profound effect of the discounting rates used on the cost-effectiveness outcomes of HPV vaccination. Discounting is applied in health-economic evaluations to correct for differences in timing. More specifically, due to a preference for goods in the present over those in the future, future costs and health effects are less strongly weighted compared to current costs and health effects in health-economic evaluations. In the context of the static model, the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination ranged from \u20ac7,600 to \u20ac59,100 per QALY gained, if the costs and health gains are both equally discounted at either 0% or 4%, respectively. Application of decreasing (hyperbolic or step-wise) discounting approaches resulted in ICERs of\u20ac164,500 and \u20ac36,800 per QALY gained, respectively. This illustrates that the estimated cost-effectiveness is highly dependent on the discount rates that are applied. In line with the Dutch guidelines, we recommend the use of differential discounting, being defined as different rates for costs and health effects (generally a lower rate for health effects), in health-ec onomic evaluation of vaccine strategies as this discounting approach takes into account the changing value of health. Furthermore, decreasing discount rates should be considered for preventive interventions with long-term effects. Cost-eff ectiveness of prophy lactic ofHPVvaccination has been analysed, both in the Netherlands and elsewhere. 140 165\u00b7168 268\u00b7272 For the situation in the Netherlands, four cost-effectiveness analyses of HPV vaccination for 12-year old girls, aimed at prevention of cervical cancer at older age, have been published. 140 165\u00b7167 Three of the four studies concluded that HPV vaccination can be considered as cost-effective, with ICERs ranging from \u20ac18,500 per QALY gained to \u20ac24,000 per life-years gained. The estimated cost-effectiveness in this thesis of \u20ac18,500 per QALY gained (Chapter 2) is at the low end of this range. One potential reason for this is that vaccine-induced cross-protection is included in the base-case. In contrast to the conclusions of three of the four published studies, De Kok et al. estimated that HPV vaccination is not cost-effective with an ICER above \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained.167 However, the authors applied an incorrect discount rate of 3% for both costs and health effects. As mentioned, the application of different discount rates strongly influences the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination. When De Kok et al. applied the discount rates as recommended by the Dutch health-economic guidelines (i.e. 4% and 1.5% for costs and health effects, respectively), the cost-effectiveness was found to be \u20ac19, 700 per QALY gained, consistent with the abovementioned range. In Chapter 3, it is suggested that vaccination of women up to 26 years of age may be a cost\u00ad effective strategy, based on favourable ICER estimates, although substantial vaccine price reductions are needed for favourable cost-effectiveness of vaccination of relatively older girls/women. 168 273 In Chapter 6, it was estimated that vaccination of girls at an older age 133 9 t.. <lJ \"' .c remains cost-effective, despite the herd-immunity effects of the existing HPV programme covering 12-year-old girls. Furthermore, vaccination of boys has been suggested in the literature. It is argued that the vaccination of boys will not be highly efficient in providing protection against cervical cancer among women. However, with the current low vaccination coverage (i.e. 50%) in the existing programme, vaccination of 12-year-old boys was found potentially cost-effective (at \u20ac31,600 per QALY gained). Vaccination of 12-year-old girls remains the most effective and cost-effective approach for vaccination against HPV infection. Also in countries other than the Netherlands, HPV vaccination is generally found to be highly cost-effective.40 92 155 171 268 272 While different model structures, epidemiological data and vaccine characteristics have been used, all studies that focused on young teenage girls conclude that routine vaccination against HPV is cost-effective compared to screening programmes alone. Specifically, in all studies, the cost-effectiveness ratio remained below \u20ac50,000 per QALY gained.272 Also the cost-effectiveness of vaccination of males has been assessed in other countries.210212274 The conclusions of these studies are generally in line with our findings. Vaccination of boys, in addition to girls, is not effective in providing protection against cervical cancer among women with a cost-effectiveness ratio above \u20ac100,000 per QALY gained, if the vaccination coverage among women is above 70%. However, if coverage among teenage girls is 50%, vaccination of males is likely cost-effective (Chapter 6). While some HPV-induced diseases in males might be prevented by vaccination of boys, the herd-immunity effects of the vaccination of girls only will also largely prevent these diseases. For example, Brisson et al. determined, under base-case assumptions (vaccine efficacy: 99%; duration of protection: 20 years; coverage: 70%), the added value of vaccination of boys in addition to the vaccination of girls. They found in girls an 85% reduction in HPV16 and -18 prevalence, compared to 65% for vaccination of females only.21\u00b0 For boys, these HPV16 and -18 reductions were estimated at 62% and 88%, if girls only or girls and boys are vaccinated, respectivel y. These authors concluded that, due to herd-immunity effects of vaccination of 12-year-old girls, the gains of vaccination of boys are limited. Therefore, HPV vaccination of teenage girls only is considered as the most effective and cost-effective intervention by the authors. Static versus dyna mic modelling of interventions against infectious diseases The application of dynamic models for simulation of interventions against infectious diseases is in general preferable over the use of static modelling approaches, as dynamic models not only consider the direct but also the indirect effects of the intervention. As indicated above, dynamic models capture these indirect effects, since in this type of models the transmission of the pathogen is simulated. Indirect effects of vaccination include the 134 General discussion and concluding remarks protection of unvaccinated individuals due to a reduced circulation of the pathogen in the population (i.e. herd-immu nity), type-replacements and age-shifts. Indeed, through inclusion of the potential herd-immunity effects of a vaccination strategy, more favourable model outcomes will generally be found. On the other hand, type-replacements and age-shifts may have negative effects on the model-predicted outcomes. Due to a reduced circulation of the pathogen in the population, the risk of infection of unvaccinated individuals decreases and thus the average age of infection increases (age-shift). Type-replacements may occur when vaccination induces, for example, protection against carriage and thus open an ecological niche that may be occupied by pathogens not included in the vaccine. However, although for vaccination against bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, type-replacements have been observed, for viral infectious diseases these have not been reported as yet.275 Therefore, for vaccination against human papillomavirus infection, only herd-immunity effects are to be anticipated. Dynamic modelling might provide better insight in the consequences of the current and additional HPV vaccination programmes. With a vaccination coverage of only 50-60% among teenage girls, significant beneficial effects in the unvaccinated population are anticipated to occur. Specifically, we found that, for the Netherlands, HPV16-and HPV18- related cervical cancer incidence decreases by 65% and 83%, respectively, if 50% of teenage girls are vaccinated. This underlines the importance of dynamic modelling for interventions against infectious diseases. Note that, with an increase in vaccination coverage (>90%), both static and dynamic models provide similar results, i.e. 70-74% reduction in overall cervical cancer incidence. This indicates that, under certain conditions, the use of static modelling approaches for interventions against infectious disease is justified. In the literature, several dynamic HPV models have been published.165 171 197 212 213 Despite disparities in structure and epidemiological data input between these models, the findings are generally in line with each other. In particular, at a 70% vaccination coverage, a 60- 70% reduction in cervical cancer incidence has been found.165 212 213 In agreement with this general conclusion, we found in this study (Chapter 6), that the cervical cancer incidence will decrease with approximately 67% if70% vaccine coverage is achieved. Generally, it is assumed that the HPV vaccines will provide lifelong protection. Also for other vaccines, such as the mumps and measles vaccines, it has been considered that vaccination will provide lifelong protection. However, after implementation of these vaccines, the vaccine-induced duration of protection appeared to not always provide lifelong protection (secundary vaccine failure). For example, recently breakthrough infections of mumps have been observed among adolescents and young adults.276 Waning of vaccine-induced immunity causes these breakthrough infections. If HPV vaccination were to provide only 20 years rather than lifelong protection and no booster vaccination will be considered for 135 older age groups, the estimated reduction in cervical cancer incidence was found to be 31 % and the cost per QALY gained increased from \u20ac9,500 to \u20ac14,100, according to the current Dutch situation (i.e. 50% vaccination coverage). So, if HPV vaccination does not provide lifelong protection, the health gain will become smaller. Monitoring of vaccinated cohorts is therefore important to assess the long-term efficacy of the HPV vaccines. Discounting of future monetary and health effects of preventive interv entions The current Dutch health-economic guidelines prescribe a 4% and 1.5% annual discount rate for future monetary and health effects. Based on these discount rates, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination at \u20ac18,400 per QALY gained (Chapter 7). However, if the internationally standardized discount rates are applied (3% for monetary and health effects), cost-effectiveness was estimated at \u20ac37,000 per QALY gained. This estimated ICER is slightly more favourable compared to the ICER found by de Kok et al., because we included vaccine-induced cross-protection in our study. The application of differential discounting has been strongly debated in literature.47 49 236 For 9 example, O'Mahony et al. showed that the cost of HPV vaccination per QALY gained decreases from \u20ac29,900 for the first vaccinated cohort to \u20ac22,100 for the 30th vaccinated cohort.260 \"' .c This decline was not observed when equal discount rates for monetary and health effects were applied. It might be argued that this implies that the results of differential discounting are difficult to interpret. However, if the outcomes are discounted back to the moment the intervention took place, a valid approach might be taken which might not result in inconsistent results between vaccinated cohorts. Furthermore, different ICERs for consecutive cohorts might be reasonable due to the increasing value of health and so the acceptable price paid for one QALY will increase in subsequent years. Current ongoing discussions illustrate that the application of differential discounting is well founded in health-economic methodology. Also Coupe eta/. discounted the future costs and health effects of alternative screening programmes for vaccinated cohorts to the moment girls (12 years of age) are vaccinated against HPV infection. 217 278 If all the effects were discounted to the moment the first cytological screening would take place (i.e. at 30 years of age), the costs per QALY gained increased from \u20ac9,994 to \u20ac15,587, representing to my opinion the valid trajectory. The application of differential discounting is based on sound scientific evidence. Therefore, in Chapter 8, we state that differential discounting should be applied more often in health\u00ad economic evaluations and should be adopted in health-economic guidelines. Furthermore, as the outcomes of preventive interventions are highly sensitive to discounting, guidelines should state that the outcomes should be presented both undiscounted and discounted to enhance transparency. 136 General discussion and concluding remarks Optimization of cervical cancer prevention Nowadays, women can be protected against cervical cancer by two independent preventive programmes, i.e. cytological screening and prophylactic HPV vaccination. Both interventions have been shown to be highly effective and cost-effective. In particular, cytological screening -with or without HPV-DNA detection -is a valuable tool to detect premalignant cervical lesions among women and to start treatment in an early phase of the disease. Prophylactic vaccination against HPV provides protection against HPV16-and 18-induced and thus prevents approximately 70-80% of cervical cancer cases. Health-economic evaluations are required to find the optimal cervical cancer prevention strategy including vaccination and screening. In two studies, Coupe et al. assessed the clinical benefits and cost-effect iveness of alternative screening programmes with and without HPV-DNA testing, specifically for vaccinated girls in the Netherlands. 277 278 In the first study, the authors found that, for a fully vaccinated cohort, the ICER of the cytological-screening programme remained below \u20ac20,000 per QALY, if women 30 to 60 years of age are screened with 5-year intervals (i.e. the ICER is \u20ac11,133 per QALY gained).278 Furthermore, the combination of a cytological smear test and HPV-DNA testing remains cost-effective, if women are screened with 7-year intervals (i.e. the ICER is \u20ac17,627per QALY gained). In the second study, Coupe et al. considered the potential benefits of vaccine-induced cross-protection against non-vaccine types. The authors also considered the impact of second-generation vaccines and found that, if vaccination provides protection against non-vaccine HPV types, screening remains cost-effective if women are screened four-times during life.277 In case the new nonavalent vaccine is going to be used, the cost-effectiveness of two-times cytological screening with HPV-DNA testing during life was estimated at \u20ac31,300 per QALY gained. In the analyses of Coupe et al. it was assumed that the coverage of HPV vaccination among 12-year-old girls is 100%. However, currently only 50-60% of girls are vaccinated.279 Reducing the screening frequency for unvaccinated girls might put them at an increased risk of developing cervical cancer. Thus, a specific screening approach to non-vaccinated girls could be warranted. However, offering two different screening programmes to vaccinated and unvaccinated women might be costly and confusing. Coupe et al. argue that with the current bivalent HPV vaccine being in use, there is only a small difference in optimal screening programme for vaccinated (4-times HPV-DNA) and unvaccinated (5-times HPV-DNA) women and, therefore, one screening programme should be maintained. 277 If the nonavalent HPVvaccine is going to be implemented, screening of vaccinated girls becomes unfavourable and a screening programme for unvaccinated women only might be considered. As indicated above, currently, a large group of women are still at risk of developing HPV16- and 18-induced cervical cancer due to the comparatively low vaccination coverage. To further reduce the burden of cervical cancer, alternative vaccination strategies have been 137 proposed, including vaccination of girls at an older age or vaccination of boys, in addition to the existing vaccination programme for 12-year-old girls.m In this thesis, we show that vaccination of women up to 24 years of age can be considered cost-effective. In particular, in Chapter 4, it is estimated that a 48% reduction in cervical cancer can be obtained by vaccination of 16-year-old girls. However, due to the herd-immunity effects of vaccination of 12-year-old girls, the clinical benefits and the cost-effectiveness will become less favourable for older age groups. In Chapter 6, we show that the cost per QALY gained ofHPVvaccination for 16-year-old girls increases from \u20ac9,600 to \u20ac13,700 due to the herd-immunity effects of the existing vaccination programme covering 12-year-old girls. Furthermore, we estimated that by vaccination of 16-year-old girls, at 10% coverage, in addition to 12-year-old girls at 50% coverage, the reduction in cervical cancer further decreases with approximately 9%. This reduction could also be obtained if approximately 35% of 12-year-old boys would be vaccinated. Note that, due to differences in population sizes, vaccination of 16-year-old girls is 3 to 4 times more effective than vaccination of boys. This finding is in line with results of Bogaards et al., who found that vaccination of females only is the most effective strategy to reduce the HPV prevalence in the total population.207 Therefore, vaccination of adolescent girls might be more effective in reducing HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence than inclusion of boys in the existing vaccination programmes. Therefore, vaccination of older 9 girls could be considered as an effective and cost-effective strategy (Chapter 3 & 6) to further reduce the burden of cervical cancer . \"' ..c Protection against other HPV-induced diseases Cervical cancer is not the only type of cancer caused by infection with oncogenic HPV. Currently, several cancers have been related to HPV infection. In particular, among women, HPV infection of the genital tract might cause vaginal, vulvar, or anal cancer, in addition to cervical cancer.224 In males, HPV infection may cause penile and anal cancer. Furthermore, HPV infection has been related to the development of head-and-neck cancers in both men and women. While in essentially all cases of cervical cancer, HPV infection is the cause of the disease, in non-cervical cancers, evidence for the involvement of HPV is less compelling. Nevertheless, HPV vaccination does appear to provide a significant degree of protection against these other types of cancer as well. In particular, Gardasil has been shown to be >95% effective against HPV16-and HPV18-induced premalignant stages of vulvar and vaginal cancers in women and it provides 77.5% protection against anal intraepithelial neoplasia in men.202200 The inclusion of these additional benefits in health-economic analyses might further improve the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination. Specificall y, De Kok et al. estimated that the costs per QALY gained would decrease with approximately 13%. Next to cancer, infection with HPV can cause anogenital warts. Indeed, in 80-90% of the cases, infection with HPV6 and/or HPVl 1 is the cause of anogenital warts. The quadrivalent 138 General discussion and concluding remarks HPV vaccine Gardasil provides a high degree of protection against HPV6 and 11 infection.33 Therefore, additional health gains might be expected by vaccination of women with this vaccine. Most health-economic evaluations did not consider these additional health gains, as HPV vaccination was introduced for the prevention of cervical cancer.140166167 272 However, to allow policymakers to make a well-informed decision which vaccine to use, in Chapter 5 we estimated the additional monetary and health effects of providing protection against HPV6 and -11 infections. The total costs of implementation of the quadrivalent vaccine decreased from \u20ac18,900 to \u20ac16,300 per QALY gained, if protection against genital warts was explicitly taken into account. Health-economic persp ectives on national immunisation progr ammes HPV vaccination provides protection against cervical cancer, which affects a relative small group of women, annually. Nevertheless, vaccination against human papilloma virus infection for the prevention of cervical cancer in women has been implemented in many countries in the context of national immunisation programmes, including that of the Netherlands. Implementation of these \"niche\" vaccines, i.e. vaccines against diseases with a relative low burden, puts a high pressure on national health-care budgets for preventive interventions due to the high costs of the vaccine and the limited monetary saving. Nevertheless, HPV vaccination against cervical cancer was found likely cost-effective, as discussed in detail above. Therefore, to make well-informed decisions with respect to the implementation of new vaccines within national immunisation programmes, health\u00ad economic evaluations are essential. In the context of the Netherlands national immunisation programme, approximately 95% of all Dutch children are annually vaccinated against twelve different infectious diseases. Since the implementation of the immunisation programme, the burden due to these diseases has decreased dramatically. For example, polio has been eradicated from the Netherlands, indeed from essentially all western countries, and many other childhood infections, including measles and diphtheria, only occur sporadically. It is, however, of utmost importance that the compliance to the immunisation programme remains high, otherwise these infectious diseases may re-emerge. Therefore, confidence in the programme is crucial. In this regard it is important to note that the implementation of HPV vaccination was debated not only in the scientific literature but also in the (social) media, which might undermine the trust in national immunisation programmes in general. Fortunately, thus far the overall vaccine uptake in the context of the Dutch national immunisation programme has remained unaffected by the discussion about the HPV vaccination. However, to maintain the confidence in the vaccination programme, implementation of new vaccines should be carefully considered and evaluated. 139 Concl uding remarks The results described in this thesis support and reinforce previous favourable cost\u00ad effectiveness estimates of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus infection of teenage girls. In particular , more detailed cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out and additional scenarios were investigated. It is shown that, from a health-economic perspective, vaccination of older girls could be considered. Furthermore, an analytical comparison between the two currently available HPV vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil, was made. Taken together, the superior cross-protection induced by the one vaccine and the protection against anogenital warts provided by the other vaccine resulted in a modest acceptable price difference between both vaccines to achieve equal cost-effectiveness in favour of Gardasil. Finally, a dynamic model was developed to assess the potential indirect effects of HPV vaccination. Vaccination of girls at 12-years ofage became more favourable if these indirect effects were taken into account. In contrast, due to the herd-immunity effects of the existing vaccination programme, the cost-effectiveness of vaccination of girls at an older age or the vaccination of boys was found to become less favourable. Nevertheless, both strategies were found to be cost-effective, if implemented in addition to the existing vaccination programme. Of both strategies, vaccination of older girls was found to be the best strategy to further reduce the burden of cervical cancer, in the Netherlands. In conclusion, HPV vaccination 9 is a highly effective and cost-effective intervention against cervical cancer, in particular in teenage girls and potentially for older girls/women and boys as well. \"' .c 140 General discussion and concluding remarks 141 142 -Annex I- Reference list 1.

CMAJ. 2007;177. 175 176 -Annex III - Summa ry Summary It is generally accepted that vaccination is the most effective tool to prevent infectious diseases. Highly effective vaccines are available against various -often childhood -infections, such as poliomyelitis, measles and diphtheria. In many countries, vaccination against these diseases is now implemented in the context of national immunisation programmes. Vaccination against infectious diseases not only protects vaccinees in a direct manner, in addition it reduces the transmission of the pathogen in the population and, thus, also indirectly protects unvaccinated individuals. If vaccination coverage reaches sufficiently high levels, infectious diseases may even be eradicated entirely, with smallpox as the most prominent example. Since the introduction of national immunisation programmes, the incidence of vaccine\u00ad preventable infectious diseases has declined dramatically. For example, before childhood vaccination programmes against measles and whooping cough were introduced, these infectious diseases were highly prevalent among infants and young children, causing extensive morbidity and mortality. Fortunately, effective vaccination schemes are now in place against these major childhood infections. In addition, new vaccines are being introduced against III infections with a more limited disease burden, including some very recent ones, such as vaccines against human papillomavirus are ongoing to develop vaccines against a number of infections for which vaccines are still lacking, such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. Implementation of new vaccines puts a high pressure on national health-care budgets, as these new vaccines are often relatively expensive. Also, in some cases, including vaccination against HPV, large groups of individuals are being vaccinated to prevent a relatively limited disease burden. Therefore, well-informed decisions have to be made regarding the desirability of new vaccination programmes. Preferably, vaccination should prevent relevant mortality and/or severe long-term morbidity. Furthermore, the costs of the vaccine should be in a reasonable balance with the potential future monetary savings, related to reductions in disease costs, and the gains in quality of life and survival. For the Netherlands, seven specific criteria for implementing a new vaccination programme have been developed by the Dutch Health Council. Health-economic modelling is used to assess the economic desirability of an intervention. A health-economic model is a simplified framework designed to describe complex processes and systems. These frameworks simulate the progression from a healthy condition to disease in a hypothetical cohort, reflecting the real-life situation as closely as possible. These models can be used to assess not only the costs of the new intervention, but also the potential future savings and health gains. Specifically, these models provide insight in 178 Summary the reduced mortality and morbidity as a result of the intervention. By comparing the total costs and health effects, the latter often expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained, in the presence or absence of the intervention, the incremental costs and QALYs can be determined. The costs include both the costs of the intervention and the disease\u00ad related costs, such as the costs of standard care. By dividing the incremental costs by the incremental health gains, the cost-effectiveness of an intervention can be determined. This cost-effectiveness is generally expressed as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), representing the costs per QALY gained. The ICER gives an impression of the desirability of an intervention. In the Netherlands, an intervention is generally considered cost-effective if the ICER of the intervention remains below \u20ac20,000. Since 2007, prophylactic vaccines have become available against HPV infection. Currently two HPVvaccines are registered: Gardasil, a quadrivalentvaccine, and Cervarix, a bivalent vaccine. Gardasil provides protection against 4 different HPV types, i.e. the oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18 and the low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 which are related to the development of anogenital warts. Cervarix comprises only the HPV types 16 and 18. Furthermore, both vaccines provide some degree of protection against oncogenic HPV types not included in the vaccines (i.e. cross-protection). Infections with oncogenic HPV types can cause cervical cancer among women. HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of the cervical cancer cases. The work described in this thesis deals with health-economic evaluation of prophylactic HPV vaccination programmes. Specifically, both static and dynamic models were used to estimate the long-term consequences of HPV vaccination programmes on a population level. Determination of the potential reduction in cervical cancer-related mortality and morbidity and the cost-effectiveness of vaccination is important for policymakers to reach a well-informed decision about implementation of HPV vaccination in the context of national immunisation programmes. Part I: Static modell ing of prophy lactic HPV vaccination In the first part of this thesis, a static model was used to assess the long-term clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of vaccination programmes against HPV infection. In the Netherlands, HPVvaccination was introduced for 12-year-old girls in 2010. The aim of the programme is to prevent that girls become infected with HPV16 or 18, and thus to protect them against later development of cervical cancer caused by these viruses. Furthermore, a catch-up programme for girls aged 13 to 16 years was undertaken. In Chapter 2 and 3, the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination for girls and women up to 26 years of age was assessed. It is shown that vaccination of 12-year-old girls is highly effective and cost-effective. Specifically, the costs per QALY gained of vaccination of 12-year-old girls was estimated at \u20ac18,500. Furthermore, 179 the cost-effective ness for vaccination of girls and women <23 years of age still remained well below \u20ac30,000 per QALY gained. The cost per QALY gained of HPV vaccination was found to be very sensitive to assumptions on the duration of vaccine-induced immunity. Currently, the duration of vaccine-induced immunity is evidenced for approximat ely 10 years. Yet, it seems reasonable to assume lifelong protectio n, as was done in the base-case analyses. If vaccination would provide only 20 years of protection though, the cost-effectiveness ratio of HPV vaccination for 12-year-old girls was estimated to be significan tly higher at \u20ac26,900 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination is also highly sensitive to the vaccine price and to the extent of cross-protection induced by the vaccines. Obviously, more favourable model outcomes are found, when lower vaccine prices are assumed or when vaccine-induced cross-protection is taken into account. When vaccination strategies are implemented in the context of national immunisa tion programmes, substantial price reductions are likely to be granted by the vaccine manufactures. The cost-effectiveness ratio of HPV vaccination decreased to almost \u20ac10,000 per QALY gained, if a 40% price discount was considered. Finally, both vaccines provide some degree of cross-protection against HPV types not included in the vaccines. Including the additional benefits of vaccine-induced cross-pro tection, in Chapter 4, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of the use of the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccines at \u20ac17,600 or \u20ac18,900 per QALY gained, respectively, considering III only the benefits of protection against cervical cancer. However, the quadrivalent vaccine Gardasil provides protection not only against cervical cancer but also against genital warts. This additional protection cannot simply be ignored. The cost-effectiveness of vaccination with GardasiJTM was estimated at \u20ac16,300 per QALY gained, if the additional benefits of protection against genital warts were taken into account. In general, based on the results obtained with the static model, we found that HPV vaccination represents a cost-effective intervention for women in The Netherlands, irrespect ive of which vaccine is used. Part II: Dynamic modelling of prophy lactic HPV vaccination Since of HPV vaccination, vaccination coverage -being 50-60% -has been lower than anticipated, not only in the Netherlands but also in many other countries. Conseque ntly, a large group of girls is still at risk of developing cervical cancer later on in life. In the abovementioned chapters, a static model was used to assess the long-term consequences and cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination. However, a major limitation of static models is that these models do not take into account the indirect effects of a vaccination programme, such as e.g. herd-immunit y. To optimally assess the cost-effectiveness of the current HPV vaccination, indirect herd-immunit y effects should be taken into account. Dynamic models explicitly simulate the transmission of the pathogen within the modelled population. Therefore, dynamic models provide a better estimate of the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination compared to static models, particularly in the context of the current moderate vaccination coverage. 180 Summary In Chapter 5, we designed a dynamic model to estimate the long-term benefits of the currently available HPV vaccines in terms of protection against cervical cancer. Within the model framework, the seven most prevalent HPV types were included. Taking the herd\u00ad immunity benefits explicitly into account, the HPV16-and HPV18-induced cervical cancer incidence was estimated to decrease with 65% and 83%, respectively, if 50% of 12-year\u00ad old girls are vaccinated against HPV. Under these conditions, the overall cervical cancer incidence decreases with 52%. Taking the vaccine-sp ecific cross-protection of CervarixTM and Gardasil into account, we estimated that the cervical cancer incidence decreases by 60% and 55%, respectively. The corresponding ICERs were estimated at \u20ac7,800 and \u20ac9,000 per QALY gained for Cervarix and Gardasil, respectively (Chapter 6). Considering an increased coverage among 12-year-old girls, we determined that the cost-effectiveness remains well below \u20ac20,000 per QALY gained, despite a decreased herd-immunity benefit. Finally, currently, broad-spectrum HPV vaccines are in clinical trials, providing protection against eight (octavalent) or nine (nonavalent) different HPV types. However, as HPV16 and HPV18 are the two dominant types involved in cervical cancer development, the addition of other HPV types to the vaccines results in an only modest extra health. To further reduce the burden of cervical cancer, either the vaccination of older girls and women or vaccination of boys could be considered. In Chapter 6, we found that with the current coverage of 50-60% among 12-year-old girls, both strategies are likely to be cost-effective. However, if vaccination coverage increases among 12-year-old girls, the cost-effectiveness of vaccination of boys decreases and quickly crosses the acceptable the cost-effectiveness threshold. Specifically, if 70% of girls are vaccinated against HPV, the ICER of vaccination of boys exceeds \u20ac100,000 per QALY gained. Vaccination of 16-year-old girls remains likely cost\u00ad effective, also when the coverage among 12-year-old girls increases to 70%. Yet, improvement of the vaccination coverage among 12-year-old girls is the most effective and cost-effective strategy to further reduce the burden of cervical cancer. Vaccination of girls at 16-20 years of age is the most attractive and cost-effective addition to vaccination of 12-year-old girls. Part III: Discounting of future outcomes of preventive interventions In the studies summarized above, it was found that the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination is highly sensitive to discounting. Discounting is applied in health-economic evaluations to correct for differences in timing. More specifically, it is generally known that individuals have a positive time preference for goods in the present over those in the future. This is due to impatience, uncertainty about the future and the decreasing marginal value of goods (i.e. inflation). Therefore, to assess the net present value of an intervention, all future monetary and health effects are discounted to the moment the intervention took place, by dividing the monetary or health effects by the discount rate for each subsequent year. Consequently, future monetary and health effects receive less weight compared to current ones. 181 Vaccination programmes often involve costs in the present and benefits in the future. Therefore, specifically for vaccines, outcomes are highly sensitive to the discount rate applied. In the Netherlands, future health effects are discounted with a relatively low rate (i.e. 1.5%) compared to rate used in other countries (i.e. 3-4%) and the rate used for costs. Still, it was found that despite the use of this low rate of 1.5% for discounting benefits in the future, the health gains derived from HPV vaccination are strongly devalued due to discounting. Indeed, HPV vaccination can be considered as one of the most extreme examples of the impact of discounting. After all, 12-year-old girls are vaccinated against HPV to prevent cervical cancer morbidity and mortality several decades later when these girls have become 40 years and older. Generally, a constant discounting rate is applied in healt-economic analyses. In the literature, however, alternative discounting approaches have been suggested, including step-wise, hyperbolic or proportional discounting, and also time-shifted approaches. In Chapter 7, it was shown that the present value of health gains through HPV vaccination varied strongly when alternative discounting approaches were applied. In particular, application of hyperbolic or proportional discounting approaches, reflecting commonly observed declining time preferences of individuals, resulted in cost-effectiveness estimates of HPV vaccination III of \u20ac165,000 per QALY gained. Step-wise and time-shifted discounting approaches resulted in more favourable outcomes, \u20ac37,000 and 9,000 per QALY gained, respectivel y. Given the impact of discounting on final outcomes of preventive interventions, the discount rules adopted in studies and prescribed in guidelines need to be fully transparent and well- embedded in a solid reasoning. In the Netherlands, differential discounting is prescribed in the national guidelines for health-economic evaluations. Differential discounting itself is also subject of intense debate in the literature, some arguing that this approach might provide inconsistent results. In Chapters 8, it is argued that differential discounting is both empirically and theoretically well underpinned and should, therefore, be more often applied in health-economic evaluations. In Chapter 9, a future perspective on cervical cancer prevention is given. In particular, with the current moderate vaccine uptake, alternative vaccination programmes parallel to the existing programme should be considered. It was found that vaccination of girls at an older age might be an effective and cost-effective strategy, in addition to an improved coverage in the existing programme among 12-year-old girls . If vaccination coverage increases to high levels, alternative screening programmes could be considered for vaccinated cohorts, including less frequent screening rounds. Furthermore, recent clinical trials have shown that the HPV vaccines provide protection against other HPV-induced cancers, next to cervical cancer. Obviously, when these additional benefits are taken into account, vaccination 182 Summary becomes more favourable for both 12-year-old girls and for older girls/women in potential new catch-up programmes. The thesis ends with a number of recommendations for health-economic modelling of vaccination programmes. It is shown that, due to discounting, opposite conclusions can be drawn. In particular, application of a 4% discount rate for both future costs and health effects results in unfavourable cost-effectiveness outcomes. It is recommended that, whatever discount rate is applied, always both the discounted and undiscounted results should be presented in a fully transparent fashion. Furthermore, in this thesis it is shown that dynamic modelling is often preferable over static modelling for infectious disease simulations. Therefore, it is recommended that, generally, dynamic modelling approaches should be used for evaluation of vaccination programmes. However, in specific settings, simple static models may still give accurate estimates. In particular, if vaccination is highly effective, vaccine\u00ad induced immunity provides lifelong protection, and vaccination coverage is high, the use of static models appears to be justified.
