Holistic medicine is a form of healing that considers the whole person -- body, mind, spirit, and emotions -- in the quest for optimal health and wellness. According to the holistic medicine philosophy, one can achieve optimal health -- the primary goal of holistic medicine practice -- by gaining proper balance in life. Principles of Holistic Medicine All people have innate healing powers. The patient is a person, not a disease. Healing takes a team approach involving the patient and doctor, and addresses all aspects of a person's life using a variety of health care practices. Treatment involves fixing the cause of the condition, not just alleviating the symptoms.

Heart Disease: 81 million people Cancer: 11 million people Depression: 1 in 20 Americans >12 years of age Diabetes: \"One in every 3 children born today will develop diabetes during his/her lifetime\" FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE is a personalized, systems- oriented model that empowers patients and practitioners to achieve the highest expression of health by working in collaboration to address the underlying causes of disease.

Not Well patients : use multiple healthcare resources (expensive and redundant care) may require longer hospital stays pose increased risk of readmissions (\"poor baseline\"), lower medication compliance seek out alternative care practitioners resulting in revenue diversion of their discretionary income unsupervised supplements intake and variable quality alternative interventions are of limited value, pose a safety concern, may be expensive and ineffective Take control by creating structured and supervised integrative cardiology programs based on evidence and outcomes to increase your value to your patients, and your patients lifetime value (PLV) \u00a9 Copyright 2015 Fit in Your GENES The Paradox of Health Although the collective health of the nation has improved dramatically in the past 30 years, surveys reveal declining satisfaction with personal health during the same period . Increasingly, respondents report greater numbers of disturbing somatic symptoms, more disability, and more feelings of general illness . Four factors contribute to the discrepancy between the objective and subjective states of health . First, advances in medical care have lowered the mortality rate of acute infectious diseases, resulting in a comparatively increased prevalence of chronic and degenerative disorders . Second, society's heightened consciousness of health has led to greater self-scrutiny and an amplified awareness of bodily symptoms and feelings of illness . Third, the widespread commercialization of health and the increasing focus on health issues in the media have created a climate of apprehension, insecurity, and alarm about disease . Finally, the progressive medicalization of daily life has brought unrealistic expectations of cure that make untreatable infirmities and unavoidable ailments seem even worse . Physicians should become more aware of these paradoxical consequences of medical progress so that they do not inadvertently contribute to a rising public dissatisfaction with medicine and medical care .

As a result, patient experienced weight loss, and reversal of metabolic cardiac disease risk factors, such as diabetes and dyslipidemia. Her ASCVD short -term risk was decreased in half in 4 months on the program. She experienced dramatic improvement in symptoms, and regained wellness and vitality .

Conclusion Functional Medicine provides a powerful framework to address root causes of chronic diseases Cardiac patients or those with risk factors benefit from functional medicine Your practice needs proven and evidence -based protocols and strategic and cohesive team to deliver the new practice paradigm to patients Destination: HEALTH Decline in generational health Cost per year $ 3 trillion Epidemic of chronic diseases Food as Medicine 80% disease prevention "}
