This study examined the use of CAM and beliefs about CAM as expressed by patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Taiwan. Methods TBI patients and their accompanying relatives were interviewed by using a structured questionnaire at an outpatient clinic in a medical center in northern Taiwan. Results A total of 101 patients with TBI participated in the study. Sixty-four (63%) patients had used at least one form of CAM after sustaining TBI. CAM users had used an average of 2.72 forms of CAM after sustaining TBI. The most frequently used CAM category was traditional Chinese medicine (37; 57.8%), followed by folk and religious therapies (30; 46.9%), and dietary supplements (30; 46.9%). The majority of the patients (45; 70.3%) did not report CAM use because they felt it was unnecessary to do so. Patients who used CAM had a significantly stronger positive belief in CAM than those who did not (t = 2.72; P = .008). After using CAM, most of the patients (54; 85%) perceived moderate satisfaction (2.89 \u00b1 0.44), according to a 4-point Likert scale. Conclusion Although the use of CAM is common for TBI patients receiving conventional medical health care in Taiwan, most patients did not inform health care personnel about their CAM use. TBI patients perceive combined use of CAM and conventional medicine as beneficial for their overall health.", "sitename": "BioMed Central", "date": "2012-11-06", "cleaned_text": "complementary and alternative medicine for patients with traumatic brain injury in Taiwan](/articles/10.1186/1472-6882-12-211) Variable n % Mean \u00b1 SD (Range) Use of CAM following TBI Yes 64 63.4 No 37 36.6 Time after injury until beginning use of CAM (months) 1.73\u00b12.27 (0-12) Most commonly used CAM categorya Traditional Chinese medicine 37 57.8 Folk and religious therapy 30 46.9 Dietary supplements 30 46.9 Mind-body medicine 7 10.9 Herbal and Arcanum therapy 6 9.4 Most commonly used CAM forma Chinese herbs 30 46.9 Spiritual healing, such as shamanism, dang-kis 21 32.8 Special diets 17 26.6 Megadose vitamins 16 25.0 Holy water, reciting a Buddhist mantra 15 23.4 Acupuncture 14 21.9 "}
