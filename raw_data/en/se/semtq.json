Little evidence exists on the cultu ral adaptation of such interventions. Cultural adaptation of evidence-based interventions distinguishes between surface and deep structure adaptation. Surface refers to matching materials (e.g., illustrations, language) or meth ods of treatment delivery to the target population, whereas deep structure adaptation considers cultural concepts of distress (CCD). So far, CCD have only been considered to a limited extent in cultural adaptation of psyc hological interventions, and there is a lack of well documented adaptation procedures. Aims: With a cross-disciplinary and mixed-method approach, following a new conceptual framework for cultural adaptation of scalable psychological interventions, this study aimed to develop both surface and deep structure adaptations of an internet- and mobile-based intervention ca lled Hap-pas-Hapi for the treatment of psychological distress among Albanian migrants in Switzerland and Germany.

Introduction High prevalence rates of common mental disorders among migran ts from dierent ethnic groups (i.e., naturalized, immigrant s, asylum- seekers, refugees) (e.g., B\u00e4\u00e4rnhielm et al., 2017 ; Eytan et al., 2002 ; Hassan et al., 2015 ) appear to be inconsistent with the use of mental health services worldwide ( Bemme and Kirmayer, 2020 ; Fernando, 2014; Kirmayer et al., 2007 ). Although specialized mental health ser- vices are available in high-income countries, data from se veral studies have identied limited access of migrants to mental health care utili- zation. Findings indicate that structural and cultural fac tors (in parti- cular immigrant status, economic status, language, relian ce on family members for support, stigma, or varying assumptions about ment al illness) may limit access to treatment ( Dow, 2011; Kayrouz et al., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100339 Received 29 May 2020; Received in revised form 24 July 2020; Accepted 31 July 2020 Corresponding author.

But also in low- and middle-income countries there is growing interest in delivering psychological inte rventions to culturally diverse populations, in order to narrow the large treatment gap for common mental disorders ( Alonso et al., 2018 ; B\u00e4\u00e4rnhielm et al., 2017; Cuijpers et al., 2018 ; van't Hof et al., 2020 ). In the last decade, there has been an increasing number of pub- lications that point to the necessity and importance of devel oping cul- turally adapted evidence-based interventions (e.g., Bernal et al., 2009 ; Bernal and S\u00e1ez-Santiago, 2006 ; Castro et al., 2010 ; Chu and Leino, 2017; Hinton and Patel, 2017 ), that are potentially scalable (e.g., de Graa et al., 2020 ; Heim et al., 2018 ; Heim and Kohrt, 2019 ; Patel et al., 2018; Robles et al., 2019 ; Sijbrandij et al., 2017 ; van't Hof et al., 2020; WHO, 2017). The main purpose of cultural adaptation is to in- crease acceptability, relevance and eectiveness of psych ological in- terventions in culturally diverse populations worldwide. Sever al studies showed that culturally adapted interventions are eective (Chowdhary et al., 2014; Griner and Smith, 2006 ; Rathod et al., 2018 ), and more eective than the unadapted version of the same intervent ion (Hedge's g = 59 0.52) ( Hall et al., 2016 ). Smith et al. (2011) and Harper Shehadeh et al. (2016) found that the more adapted elements are considered in the adaptation, the higher the eectiveness of interven- tions. However, empirical studies still \"what works\" ( Bemme, 2019; Degnan et al., 2018 ; Hall et al., 2016 ; Rathod et al., 2018 ). Especially the lack of standardized procedures for cultural adaptation makes it dicult to validate and replic ate adapta- tion methods and to compare outcomes. Several meta-analyses have pointed out that the vast majority of original studies do not prov ide detailed descriptions of the cultural adaptations applied ( Harper Shehadeh et al., 2016 ; Kalibatseva and Leong, 2014 ; Pedersen et al., 2015), and a systematic understanding of substantial modications is still lacking (Castro et al., 2010 ; Chu and Leino, 2017 ; Elliott and Mihalic, 2004). Internet and mobile-based interventions appear to be promisi ng for potential scalability and may therefore contribute to nar row the worldwide treatment gap, particularly among \"hard-to-reac h popula- tions\" such as culturally diverse populations (e.g., Abi Ramia et al., 2018; Atallah et al., 2018 ; Burchert et al., 2019 ; Carswell et al., 2018 ; Cuijpers et al., 2008 ; Garabiles et al., 2019 ; Hedman et al., 2012 ; Kayrouz et al., 2018 ; Mu\u00f1oz, 2010; Sijbrandij et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2013). Through large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pilot studies, several research groups seek to examine the eectiv eness of culturally adapted online-interventions for treating common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and culturally shaped concepts of distress in dierent indi genes cultures and their diaspora ( Harper Shehadeh et al., 2020 ; Kayrouz et al., 2015a, 2016b ; Reich et al., 2019 ; Salamanca-Sanabria et al., 2018, 2020; Sidani et al., 2018 ; Slobodin et al., 2018 ; \u00dcnl\u00fc Ince et al., 2013; van't Hof et al., 2020 ). However, due to small sample sizes and high attrition rates i n the pilot studies (Harper Shehadeh et al., 2020 ; Kayrouz et al., 2016b, 2016a; Salamanca-Sanabria et al., 2020 ), only cautious assumptions can be made concerning statistically substantial eects on the reduction of distressing symptoms. However, the largely positive results on fea- sibility and acceptability of the mentioned studies seem prom ising, emphasizing the need for culturally adapted interventions. In recent years, several studies have provided detailed inform ation on the cultural and contextual adaptation of such internet - and mobile- based interventions. For example research on ethnically diverse groups in Lebanon (Abi Ramia et al., 2018 ), Syrian refuges residing in Ger- many, Sweden, and Egypt ( Burchert et al., 2019 ), overseas Filipino domestic workers living in Macao ( Garabiles et al., 2019 ), Arabs from countries of origin or immigrants in Australia ( Kayrouz et al., 2016b, 2016a), university students in Colombia ( Salamanca-Sanabria et al., 2020, 2019, 2018 ), Chinese Canadians ( Sidani et al., 2018 ), asylum seekers from Middle East residing in the Netherlands ( Slobodin et al., 2018), and Turkish migrants in the Netherlands ( \u00dcnl\u00fc Ince et al., 2013 ). Despite these attempts, there is still no golden standard on how cultural adaptation should be implemented ( Rathod et al., 2018 ; Salamanca-Sanabria et al., 2019 ). Over the last decades, several fra- meworks have been developed to tackle this issue ( Bernal et al., 2009, 1995; Bernal and S\u00e1ez-Santiago, Cardemil, 2008 ; Chu and Leino, 2017; Naeem et al., 2016 ; Rathod et al., 2019 ; Resnicow et al., 1999 ). Numerous studies on the cultural adaptation of psychological in ter- ventions used the framework of Bernal et al. (1995 ; Bernal and S\u00e1ez- Santiago, 2006 ). However, studies have criticised the framework due to reported diculties with implementing the elements in rea l-world settings (Chu and Leino, 2017 ). Further, the framework was developed for face-to-face treatments and its use for internet-based i nterventions is limited (Harper Shehadeh et al., 2016 ). Resnicow et al. (1999) distinguish between surface and deep structure adaptation of health interventions. Surface adapt ation aims to match materials to the visible characteristics of the tar get population, e.g., by tailoring illustrations and language or channels and settings for treatment delivery. Deep structure adaptation, on the oth er hand, refers to the fact that cultural, social, environmental, or hist orical aspects aect health. Such adaptations are rooted in explanatory mode ls (Kleinman, 1978 ) about the cause, course, and treatment of disorders in the target group. Resnicow et al. (1999) developed their framework for health promotion programmes in general. In view of deep str ucture adaptation of psychological interventions, we argue that it may be re- levant to consider cultural concepts of distress ( American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ; Kohrt et al., 2014 ). 1.1. Cultural adaptation of scalable psychological interventions - a new conceptual framework Based on empirical evidence from ethnopsychological studies, cul - tural adaptation research, and psychotherapy research, Heim and Kohrt (2019) developed a new conceptual framework for cultural adaptati on of scalable psychological interventions for the treatment of common mental disorders. This framework encompasses the following three elements: i) cultural concepts of distress; ii) treatment comp onents; and iii) treatment delivery. The authors suggest considering the se elements sequentially. i) Cultural concepts of distress encompass idioms of distress, cultural explanations, and cultural syndromes ( Lewis-Fern\u00e1ndez and Kirmayer, 2019 ). Cultural adaptation may benet from exploring discursive constructions of psychological distress and mental illne ss, which are inherent in the cultural context of the tar get population. Diagnostic categories for mental disorders developed in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) countrie s (Henrich et al., 2010 ) may not be applicable among culturally di- verse groups. Ryder and Chentsova-Dutton (2015) therefore re- commend using the broader term \"serious distress\", which they dene \"as the set of clinically signicant problems charac terized by dysphoria and anxiety rather than on specic diagnostic cate gories such as major depression, social anxiety disorder\" (p. 403). With regard to psychological distress, it is important to consider symp- toms that are pathologized or non-pathologized ( Acharya et al., 2017) in a given culture, along with idioms of wellness or resili ence (Lewis-Fern\u00e1ndez and Kirmayer, 2019 ). In addition, other cultural aspects shape people's experienc es of psychological distress, such as cultural concepts of the self. Kirmayer (2007) distinguishes between the \"egocentric\" and \"sociocentric\" no- tion of the self. The egocentric self-concept is shaped by p ersonal his- tory, individualistic and autonomous values, whereas the sociocen tric self includes the family and community, thus refers to colle ctivist and interdependent values. With regard to mental health, shar ed suering and social support within the family and the community are typical for M. Shala, et al. Internet Interventions 21 (2020) 100339 2socio-centric societies ( Heine, 2016; Kirmayer, 2007 ; Triandis, 1989). Health beliefs are also shaped by culture. As an example, Reich et al. (2015) showed in a study that fatalistic beliefs about mental distre ss resulted in lower motivation for psychotherapy among Turkish im- migrants in Germany. Reich et al. (2019) developed an internet-based intervention to reduce such fatalistic beliefs. Their resu lts suggest that addressing fatalistic beliefs in cultural adaptation of psych ological in- terventions may enhance treatment motivation. ii)The second element of Heim and Kohrt's (2019) conceptual fra- mework refers to the cultural adaptation of treatment comp onents. The authors drew on a taxonomy developed by Singla et al. (2017) , which distinguishes between specic and nonspecic treatmen t components, and in-session techniques. Specic components are grounded in basic psychological mechanisms (e.g., emotional, be - havioural, cognitive, or interpersonal interventions), wher eas the nonspecic components are universal to the therapy experie nce (e.g., collaboration, empathy, normalising). Techniques are skills that the therapist implements during a session. Heim and Kohrt (2019) suggest that the selection of components and techniques should ideally be dovetailed with evidence on cultural concep ts of distress in the target population. iii)And third, the authors suggest adapting methods of treatme nt de- livery to the target population and context, to enhance e ngagement. This includes an appropriate selection of the delivery forma t (e.g., face-to-face, internet-based, minimally guided), as well a s the sur- face adaptation of the intervention materials (e.g., cult urally ap- propriate language and metaphors, relevant illustrations). Most adaptations described in recent studies can be situated within this third element of the conceptual framework (e.g., Abi Ramia et al., 2018; Burchert et al., 2019 ; Garabiles et al., 2019 ; Salamanca- Sanabria et al., 2019 ; Sidani et al., 2018 ). Although these elements have been discussed in the literatu re, there is a lack of empirical evidence on their respective rele vance. Heim and Kohrt (2019) encourage to empirically test these adaptation elements with innovative research designs, in order to gain a better under- standing of substantial modications in cultural adaptation. I n this study, we used an e-mental health intervention called Step -by-Step (Carswell et al., 2018 ) and culturally adapted it for Albanian-speaking migrants in Switzerland and Germany following this framewor k. 1.2. The Step-by-Step intervention Step-by-Step was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in close collaboration with the Ministry of Public Healt h in Lebanon and Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany. The inter vention is built on the following evidence-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques: i) stress management, ii) behavioural activa tion, iii) positive self-talk, iv) promotion of social support, and v) relap se pre- vention. It comprises ve sessions and uses a narrative approach , in which dierent ctional characters tell their illustrat ed story of how they overcame psychological distress. An illustrated doctor provi des psychoeducation and introduces the interactive exercises, e.g ., a breathing exercise (audio) or planning positive activities u sing input elds and a calendar. The concept of Step-by-Step is further described by Carswell et al. (2018) . The rst English version of the Step-by-Step content was writ ten in a \"generic\" manner, designing illustrations and narratives i n a way that they can potentially speak to people from dierent context s (Carswell et al., 2018). Thereafter, it was translated into Arabic and cultural ly adapted for dierent cultural groups living in Lebanon ( Abi Ramia et al., 2018). This cultural adaptation was based on an unpublished WHO adaptation protocol, in which the entire intervention is read through in focus groups. Based on cognitive interviewing tech niques, participants give feedback on their understanding and the acceptability of the content. The adaptations done in the Arabic version w ere mostly surface adaptations according to Resnicow et al. (1999) . The rst version of Step-by-Step was programmed as a web-based intervention and tested in an uncontrolled pilot study in Leb anon (Harper Shehadeh et al., 2020 ). Dropout rates were high in this rst study (approx. 80%). Feedback from a qualitative process analysis showed that the story was overly long and repetitive. Also, you nger participants expressed that they could not relate to the ma rried prota- gonists of the stories who had children. In addition, most partici pants expressed their wish for a more interactive intervention t han this rst web-based platform oered. Based on this feedback, a smartphone- app version was programmed, which can be accessed through a mobil e app (iOS or Android) or a web-browser ( Burchert et al., 2019 ). In addition, a story writer was contracted to render the story more engaging and to create two additional storylines for unmarried characters. The WHO plans to use Step-by-Step among culturally diverse g roups in low-resource settings, with minimal (surface) adaptations b eing done for economic reasons. A version for Filipino immigrants was devel oped in Macau (Garabiles et al., 2019 ). Eectiveness and cost-eectiveness of Step-by-Step will be tested in three parallel RCTs among Sy rian refugees in Germany, Sweden, and Egypt ( N = 500 per site) within the EU- funded STRENGTHS project ( Sijbrandij et al., 2017 ), and in two parallel RCTs among Syrian refugees and other people residing in Leban on (N = 500 per group), under the lead of WHO and the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. The original version of Step-by-Step is m inimally guided, which means that e-helpers provide a maximum of 15 m in weekly support. For the STRENGTHS trials, a contact-on demand m odel was developed for reasons of scalability. In this model, users can con- tact the e-helpers through a chat system if they have a specic question (Burchert et al., 2019 ). In the present study, the Albanian version of Step-by-Step, called Hap-pas-Hapi, was culturally adapted for Albanian-speaking migrants i n Switzerland and Germany. Two dierent versions were developed: A surface and a deep structure adaptation ( Resnicow et al., 1999 ). These two versions will be compared in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to gain evidence on the eect of deep structure adaptation on the ac- ceptability and eectiveness of Hap-pas-Hapi ( Heim et al., 2020 ). This paper aims to document the process of cultural adaptation for the target population in a transparent and replicable manner. 1.3. Target population The target population of Hap-pas-Hapi are adult particip ants with Albanian-speaking migration background living in Switzer land and Germany, which show mild to moderate symptoms of psychological distress. This target population was described more in detail in Shala et al. (2020). Due to pre-migration stressors (e.g., war, political perse- cution) and post-migration living diculties (e.g., language barriers, integration, family problems) this population group is describ ed as vulnerable in several studies, showing high prevalence ra tes for de- pression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders (e.g., Morina et al., 2016 ). With reference to Ryder and Chentsova- Dutton (2015), we use the transdiagnostic concept of psychological distress for the present study. As Resnicow et al. (1999) point out, it is vital to assume signicant heterogeneity of the target population, because subgroups di er in their religious beliefs, educational levels, degree of acculturat ion and country of origin. Ethnic Albanians largely migrated to Switzerlan d or Germany from countries such as Kosovo, North Macedonia, Serbia, Albania; through labour migration, flight, or family reunication ( Burri Sharani et al., 2010; Dahinden, 2013 ; German Federal Statistical Oce, 2019 ; Swiss Federal Statistical Oce, 2017 ). Besides the dierent migration patterns, the distinctive historical and political developme nts of these countries should not be underestimated in the analysis of etiolog ical assumptions about suering and trauma among this population. Se veral studies in Switzerland and Germany have shown that migrants of M. Shala, et al. Internet Interventions 21 (2020) 100339 3Albanian or Kosovan origin are the most exposed to labour marke t discrimination ( Koopmans et al., 2013 ; Zschirnt and Fibbi, 2019 ). Further, several studies have shown that it is a distinct cha racteristic of Albanian individuals that the needs of family members are put above one's own needs ( Dow, 2011; Heigl et al., 2011 ; Shala et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it seems highly important that the intervent ion not only addresses the individual, but also respects collective narrativ es, com- munity needs and the sociocentric self-concept of the user. 1.4. Ethnopsychological study on CCD among Albanian-speaking migrants In line with the cultural adaptation framework by Heim and Kohrt (2019), we started with an ethnopsychological study to examine the target populations' cultural concepts of distress. For this purp ose, we conducted 20 qualitative interviews to nd out which CCD are r elevant among the Albanian-speaking migrants in Switzerland. The results of the ethnopsychological study have been publish ed elsewhere in detail ( Shala et al., 2020 ). The key mental health-related were \"vuajtje\" (suering, misery), \"breng\u00eb\" (concern , care), \"m\u00ebrzi\" (sorrow, grief, sadness), \"nervoz\u00eb\" (tension, anger, fur y), and \"frik\u00eb\" (fear, anxiety), and they were perceived as \"zin xhirore\" (chain- like) or \"pandash\u00ebm\" (inseparable). The study also revealed tra uma- related metaphors and symptoms such as \"pik\u00eb n\u00eb zem\u00ebr\" (point i n the heart), of the soul/spirit), and blood). As causes for the participants' distress, pre-migration stressors (e.g., war, torture) and post-migration living diculties (e.g., int egration, loss of social status, discrimination, language) were named above all. In addition, unfullled desires (e.g., economic wealth, return t o the country of origin) were perceived as particularly stressful and led to rumination and hopelessness. In Albanian explanations of distre ss, causes appear to be inherent in symptoms; thus, when using a specic idiom of distress, the corresponding cause seems to be implicitly meant, as well. For example, \"vuajtje\" can implicitly refer to p ost-migratory living diculties, and \"m\u00ebrzi\" can point to homesickness/nostal gia or the loss of a beloved person. There was also a tendency towards low expectations of change du e to the fatalistic notion that suering is part of life and has to be endured with \"durim\" (patience) and that this would last a lifetime . An age dierence emerged with regard to fatalistic beliefs: Whil e older parti- cipants expressed that psychological problems can be solved mostl y within the family; younger participants' reports showed a higher ten- dency to seeking mental health care in severe cases. Howev er, although the social environment seems to play a vital role in coping with pro- blems, most participants (of dierent age) pointed out that th ey deal with emotional diculties on their own and do not want to burden their family with it. Self-management and social support were described as the most important coping behaviours, while little trust in psy- chotherapy was expressed. 2. Methods and materials 2.1. Procedure We developed a theory-based, cross-disciplinary and mixed-method approach to facilitate a surface and deep cultural adapta tion of Hap- pas-Hapi for Albanian-speaking migrants in Switzerland an d Germany. In the following, we describe the phases of the adaptation p rocedure. 2.1.1. Translation and surface adaptation of content The original Step-by-Step story in English language was tra nslated to Albanian by an independent translator in Pristina, Kosovo, and then reviewed for accuracy of the psychological terminology, comp rehensi- bility, and linguistic accuracy by two native-speaking mental-health professionals from Kosovo and Albania, who were not part of the r e- search team. To maintain comprehensibility and legibilit y of meanings (especially in regards to idioms of distress and metaphors), dierent translation methods were applied. Venuti (2000) distinguishes between the direct, or literal translation and oblique translation. Adaptation is considered to be one method of oblique translation, that is used w hen the content of the source language is unknown in the targ et language. This special kind of \"situational equivalence\" ( Venuti, 2000, p. 90) was the aim of both translators and researchers that carried out the cultural adaptation. In this process, several text passages were identi ed that did not permit a literal translation but required adaptati on. Metaphors and idioms collected in the ethnopsychological study ( Shala et al., 2020) were used in such adaptations, inspired by research on meta- phors and idioms of distress in cultural clinical psychology ( Rechsteiner et al., 2020). Translations were validated by consulting dictionaries, discussing essential idioms and metaphors in focus group discussions (FGDs), and gathering opinions of the Albanian-speaking team mem- bers. 2.1.2. Literature review The main ndings of the ethnopsychological study ( Shala et al., 2020) showed that external control attributions hindered help-seek ing and treatment motivation among the target population. Based on these results, we conducted a literature review to search for evi dence on how to address fatalism and enhance treatment motivation among cu lturally diverse groups, mainly through Internet-based interventions. In this search, we used search terms Psy chInfo, and PubMed were used for this purpose, without any time, lang uage, or geographical limitation. 2.1.3. Development of new intervention components Based on the formative research and the literature review, new in- tervention components were developed and iteratively adapted based on FGDs, the online survey, and key informant (KI) interview s (see below). 2.1.4. Focus group discussions Ten FGDs were conducted in Albanian language by the rst author (MS) following recommendations for cognitive interviewing techn iques by Willis and Artino (2013) . The FGDs were carried out between July 2018 and January 2019 in Zurich, Switzerland, and Berlin, German y. FGDs lasted two and a half hours on average, directly protocolle d by two study assistants. In addition, the group discussions were audio re - corded and transcribed. At start, rules on the procedure of the FGD were presented i n Albanian and German language. The participants were f ree to speak in their preferred language. They were informed about the concept and the story of Hap-pas-Hapi. In the rst round (July 2018, Zurich , three groups), participants were asked to read aloud through the entir e story of the translated original (generic) version, and everyone wa s en- couraged to speak up if anything was unclear or irritatin g to them. In addition, acceptability of the character proles, illustra tions, and ac- tivities for behavioural activation were discussed. Feedback w as in- tegrated before conducting the second round, especially concer ning character proles, examples of activities, and language. In the second round (January 2019, Zurich & Berlin, seven groups), the deep str uc- ture adaptation was presented and discussed (for details, see below). Comprehensibility and adequacy of the adapted idioms of distress an d metaphors, as well as the feasibility of the stress reduction techniques (breathing and grounding exercise), were examined. The na l discus- sion of every group was prompted by the following questions: 1) W ould you use this programme? 2) Do you have your own phone, or do you share it with another person? When would be the best time to use the programme? 4) Where would be the best place to use the progr amme? Participants of the FGDs and the online survey were divided i nto M. Shala, et al. Internet Interventions 21 (2020) 100339 4two groups (medical/cultural/language experts and potential users) based on their experience and knowledge about the Albanian -speaking community in Switzerland and Germany. Experts ( n = 15) were re- cruited through web searches for health or social services an d social media. They were i) general practitioners or specialized doc tors who had frequent contact with Albanian-speaking patients; i i) chairs of Albanian cultural associations; iii) teachers; iv) employees of public institutions; v) researchers focusing on the Albanian-speakin g commu- nity. Nine experts had experience in mental health (i. e., in research, counselling or therapy) ranging from three up to 11 years ( Table 1). Participants who were potential users ( n = 27) were recruited from the general population through social media and via direct contact within the personal social network of the research team me mbers. The only selection criterion was Albanian language prociency . Participants were not asked about their mental health status. All part icipants themselves had a migration background from Albanian-speakin g countries and could identify content in the intervention th at did not or only slightly correspond to their respective cultural group. Sociodemographic characteristics were assessed to have a well-ba - lanced representation of dierent subgroups (e.g., gender, ag e, marital status, immigration status, educational level, use of langua ge). A total of N = 42 persons participated in the FGDs (female: n = 28, male: n = 14; n = 20 unmarried, n = 21 married, n = 1 widowed) with a mean age of 35 (range: 19-65). Of these, n = 10 were born in Switzerland, n = 10 in Albania, n = 16 in Kosovo, n = 4 in North Macedonia, n = 2: not specied. The mean duration of stay in Switzerland/Germany was 15 years (range: 0.5-55; n = 3: not speci- ed). The educational level was reported as follows: Primary or lower secondary level: n = 1, Upper and post-secondary level: n = 19; Tertiary education and above: n = 22. As main language in everyday life, n = 26 participants stated that they use Albanian-language, while n = 9 use German-language, and n = 7 were bilingual. The consent form, which was sent to participants prior to th e in- terview, was discussed point-by-point verbally before being signed. The participants were informed that they could stop the interv iew at any time without explaining. 2.1.5. Online survey An online survey was conducted to nalise adaptation. With th is survey, we aimed to identify the most common and essential symp toms and causes of distress in the target population. Based on the eth nop- sychological study and the suggestions from the FGDs, 19 symptoms and 14 causes of distress were compiled for rating. The survey wa s done between April and May 2019. Of the 42 invited FGD participants, n = 25 participated in the symptom ranking and n = 24 in the causes ranking. 2.1.6. Key informant interviews In the nal phase of the adaptation process, n = 8 key informants (female: n = 4, male: n = 4; mean age of 36, range: 21-56 years) were asked to beta test Hap-pas-Hapi and \"think aloud\" ( Willis and Artino, 2013) on their experiences and reflections about the acceptabili ty and usability of the app. In addition, a semi-structured interv iew was de- veloped, especially to gather their views on fatalism and t reatment motivation. 2.1.7. Decision-making and expert reviews A two-day adaptation workshop took place in Berlin, Germany, which was attended by ve research members and three study assis- tants. The workshop was used to evaluate results of the rst FGD s and to decide on the most essential adaptations and further steps. For the nal version of the adapted intervention, a decision-m aking process was developed. First, MS (the rst author) and a psychology student (AH) collected and incorporated linguistic suggestions from the FGDs into the story of Hap-pas-Hapi. Second, MS marked the text passages in the story that required decisions from the team (be cause the Table 1 Professional background of the medical and cultural experts i n FGDs. Expert-Nr.

Third, the other te am mem- bers read the corresponding text passages, gave their agreem ent, or made additional suggestions. In an iterative process (by includi ng web- calls and e-mails) nal agreements were achieved across the ve Albanian-speaking team members (MS, NM, ACP; and the two psy- chology students AH, AM*). Minor suggestions on syntactic and stylistic sentence changes for better legibility were directly accepted by the rst a uthor (MS) and not documented due to the large quantity. Major suggestions for sente nce and word changes, and comments based on regional and dialectal di f- ferences, were discussed among the team members. As the team con- sisted of members from Albanian or Kosovan descent, terms and sen- tences were found that seemed comprehensible for both regions (gheg and tosk dialects). 2.2. Monitoring and documentation of the adaptation procedure An adaptation monitoring sheet (see Supplementary materials) was developed to guide the decision-making and adaptation procedure. This method had several advantages and purposes: The sheet was used during the adaptation process as a basis for decision-making as w ell as for documenting all modications in the dierent interventi on com- ponents. By numbering all decisions and setting the correspondin g number in the story text, team members were able to qui ckly nd the location of parts to be adapted. Two columns provided information on the results of formative research in relation to the quali ty of the evi- dence (strong: discussed and agreed in > 3 focus groups; moderate: discussed in 1-2 focus groups or divided opinions; weak: opinion of individual persons). This information served as a basis for discussion and decision-making. The column containing the research te am's sug- gestions and decisions was continuously updated during the iterati ve adaptation process. The last columns showed decisions that were made and the ones that were pending. The content was provided (and con- tinuously adapted) in English and Albanian; hence, all team members could follow the decision-making process. 2.3. Data analysis FGDs were transcribed in original Albanian language (total number of pages: 417). Data analysis on Albanian transcripts was carri ed out by the rst author (MS) and reviewed by the co-authors (NM, EH) for re - liability and validation, based on the quality criteria de ned by Mruck and Mey (2000) . Quantitative data from the online survey were ana- lysed in SPSS software, version 25 ( 2019 ). Quali- tative data were analysed using content analysis, according to Kuckartz (2018) to identify categories, evaluate themes, and prepare infor mation for the decision-making workshops and ( Kuckartz, 2019 used for coding, summarising, and checking statistical inter-rater reliability. 3. Results Four main results from our formative research served as the ba sis of the deep structure cultural adaptation of Hap-pas-Hapi: i ) The ve key idioms of distress in Albanian language (\"vuajtje\", \"m\u00ebrzi\", \" breng\u00eb\", \"frik\u00eb\", and \"nervoz\u00eb\") that were described as \"zinxhirore\" (chain-like); ii) the fact that participants did not dierentiate betwe en causes and symptoms; iii) the fatalistic assumption that suering is giv en by fate or by God, that suering has to be endured (\"durim\") and that it cannot be changed; and iv) the insight that suering concerns the inte rdependent (or socio-centric) self, not only the individual. The following section describes how these ndings were integra ted into the deep structure adaptation. Adaptations are described along the elements of Heim and Kohrt's (2019) framework of cultural adaptation, i.e., specic and non-specic treatment components, techni ques, and treatment delivery. Table 2 provides an overview of the deep structure adaptations of Hap-pas-Hapi. 3.1. Specic components In the rst round of FGDs, the story was found to be too long, too generic and the translation was considered linguistically de cient (FG: n = 3). In the second round, feedback on deep structure adaptations was mainly positive in terms of relevance and acceptance: \"It is ideal for someone who speaks the Albanian language.\"; \"The context a nd the concept are very good.\"; \"The programme is valuable and im portant.\" (FG: n = 7). Therefore, the specic components of the original inter - vention (i.e., behavioural activation, stress management, cognitive re- structuring, social support, and relapse prevention), were n ot modied. However, evidence from FGDs reflected concerns about the accep t- ability of stress management techniques among elderly users. It was discussed that \"meditation\" as a practice to ease stress is not pa rt of traditional Albanian healing methods. Nevertheless, partic ipants as- sumed that an appropriate description and rationale could inc rease acceptance, e.g., that this technique is evidence-based and eective Table 2 Overview of adaptations for Sub-category Original (generic) Step-by-Step Adaptat ions Hap-pas-Hapi Source of information Treatment components Specic elements Behavioural activation Stress management Cognitive restructuring Social support Relapse prevention None Non-specic elements Normalisation Validation Involvement of signicant other In addition to the original elements, providing a convincing treatment rationale: Including idioms of distress in symptom narratives Disentangling symptoms and causes Explaining how behaviour and mood are linked Ethnopsychological study Focus groups Online survey Key informant interviews In-session techniques Psychoeducation Assigning homework Giving praise Goal setting Involvement of a person of trust Ethnopsychological study Focus groups Key informant interviews Treatment delivery Delivery format Self-help intervention provided through mobile app Minimally guided or contact-on- demand None Contact on-demand Surface adaptations Language, illustrations Language, metaphors, illustrations Focus groups M. Shala, et al. Internet Interventions 21 (2020) 100339 6across dierent cultural groups (FG: n = 5). Traditional Albanian healing methods were not explicitly integrated as an additi onal com- ponent in the intervention because the participants hav e hardly raised them in formative research. Solely handicrafts or gardening were mentioned by one FG participant. In addition to the proposed com po- nents of stress management (breathing exercise and grounding tech- nique), users are free to register and use their native he aling methods in the Explanatory Model Builder (that will be described in the u pcoming section) in order to carry out these activities and monitored by inter- active calendar planning tool. 3.2. Non-specic components The main focus of the deep structure adaptation of Hap-pas-H api was the modication of the non-specic components. The litera ture search had revealed only one study by Reich et al. (2019) , who had developed an internet-based intervention for reducing fatal istic beliefs and increasing motivation for psychotherapy. The authors had tested the intervention in a pilot study with promising results. Fol lowing our request, the authors kindly shared the content of their int ervention, based on which a new treatment component for the deep struc ture adaptation of Hap-pas-Hapi was developed. This new component, called \"explanatory model builder\", aims to provide a convinc ing treatment rationale at start of the intervention. It he lps users to dis- entangle causes from symptoms, and to better understand how beh a- viour and mood are connected. 3.2.1. Symptoms and causes of distress In the deep structure adaptation of Hap-pas-Hapi, the most salient idioms of distress gathered through the formative research were in- tegrated into new symptom narratives of the illustrated story . In the adapted version, users rst read these new symptom narratives a nd are then asked by the virtual doctor to list their own symptoms. T hey can either choose from a list which contains cultural concepts of distress such as \"m\u00ebrzi\", \"breng\u00eb\", or \"nervoz\u00eb\", or they can list own symptoms. In a second step, the narrator tells how it all started and p rovides a narrative on causes of symptoms that was developed based on the formative research, as well (e.g., focusing on post-migration living diculties and referring to fate and endurance). Thereafter , users are asked to list what they think caused their symptoms. Again, they can pick from a list containing causes that are typical for t he target group, including fate, or they can write down their own assumed ca uses. Based on this exercise, the virtual doctor explains that there i s a dierence between what causes the suering and what symptoms emerge as a consequence. In the FGDs, over 20 symptoms and causes of distress were compiled and discussed, and participants highlighted that such symptoms a nd causes dier depending on age, gender and personal migrations h istory (FG: n = 7). For elder participants, the desire to return to the home country seems to be an important issue, although the genera l opinion recognizes that return is unlikely (mainly because the de scendants would not go back with their parents). A further important cause of distress is unfullled desires (expressed by the metaphor \"point i n the heart\"), i.e. the lack of wealth in retirement as a re sult of the social decline that has followed migration. By contrast, younger adul ts suer from social pressure to achieve higher education, fullling jobs, and marriage (preferably to someone within the same ethnic gr oup). In addition, both age and gender groups mentioned discrimination (especially in labour market), diculties in cultural belon ging (\"for- eigners here and there\"), and incongruent values between parents and children as potential causes of distress. As over 20 dierent symptoms and causes were mentioned, we conducted an online survey among participants of the FDGs. Th ey were asked to rank the ve most salient symptoms and causes of distress f or both gender and two age groups. Tables 3 and 4 present the ve symptoms and causes of distress than were ranked highest by participants. The top ve symptoms and causes were then integrated into th e narrator's story. The new narratives were written directl y in the Albanian language, with the aim of staying as close as possi ble to the original illness narratives and idioms of distress that emerged i n the formative research. For example, the chain-like descripti on of symp- toms has been adopted as follows: \"The symptoms were often chain- like; when [Albanian, 'e/i lodhur'], my sadness [Albanian, 'm\u00ebrzi'] increased, when I was sad, my fatigu e increased.\" (introductory session, symptom narrative). Causes of distress were ad- dressed by new narratives for the four characters (male/fema le and married/unmarried). Also, key informants at beta-testing ( n = 8) found the adapted examples acceptable and identied well with t he story. \"This has been necessary for a long time. It is good that Alb anians are sensitized to these issues and that they understand that they h ave to take certain things into their own hands.\" (KI: pot. user, female, 35 years). Both, FGDs participants and KI mentioned that the app becam e more personal and welcoming to them, and that they felt un derstood and less likely to feel alone with distress: \"The stories show th at you are not alone, but that there are others who are going through similar ex- periences.\" (FG: E7, female, 36 years). 3.2.2. Addressing fatalistic beliefs As described in the ethnopsychological study ( Shala et al., 2020 ), \"fati\" in Albanian culture is not primarily a religiou s term or spiritual belief but rather a culturally shared attitude for life that is embedded and influenced by socio-cultural elements. These ndings were con- rmed in the FGDs ( n = 7). The perception of suering determined by fate that has to be endured (\"durim\") was associated with hopele ssness and reduced expectation of change. Further, we received re - commendations for the cautious use of religious content, since A lbanian culture is more oriented towards national identities than towa rds re- ligion, which is multifaith. Against this background, we understand and address the concept \"durim\" independently of religious convicti ons and spiritual beliefs. In the deep structure adaptation, it seemed essential to addre ss fatalistic beliefs at start of the intervention to enhanc e treatment mo- tivation (see Maercker et al., 2019 ). To create positive expectancy, we followed Hinton and Patel's (2017) recommendation to use culturally specic metaphors, proverbs, stories, and analogies. In the ada pted story, the narrator now emphasizes that one can achieve posi tive changes by taking destiny into one's hand: \"I did not think t here was any chance to improve the situation. I thought I would hav e to endure this situation forever. But as a wise saying goes: 'Endurance a lso has its limits'\" (session 1, causes narrative). The ending part of this narrative indicates an Albanian proverb that is linked to hope. This modication was evaluated positively in FGD ( n = 7), as participants seemed to have people in their family who would express such fatalistic be liefs. The virtual doctor then summarises: \"Some people also think that t heir symptoms are caused by bad luck, fate, or God's will, and they have to endure it.\" (session 1, causes narrative). This is followed by an ex- planation that there are strategies that can help peopl e feel better, and that Hap-pas-Hapi aims to provide these strategies to the use r. 3.2.3. Explaining the link between behaviour and mood The story continues with a narrative of how dierent activ ities made the narrator feel better or worse, regardless of the ori ginal pro- blem(s) that had caused the symptoms. Thereafter, participan ts are invited to write down their assumptions about what makes them feel better and what leads to worsening the symptoms. The four aspe cts - 1) symptoms, 2) causes, and activities that make one feel 3) bette r or 4) worse - are then summarised in the nal explanatory model (see Fig. 1). This model aims to visually emphasise the rationale of Hap-pa s-Hapi through the technique of discovery\", in psychotherapy ( Overholser, 2011 ). M. Shala, et al. Internet Interventions (2020) 100339 7In the FGDs the \"explanatory model builder\" was well recei ved (n = 7). The examples were considered to be realistic, and the fa ct that one can add their examples was highly valued. Mainly it was described as an excellent opportunity to help the user to reflect and deal with their own situation. Participants also reasoned that it would be essential to explain that this programme has helped many people: \"T he goal of the app is to convey that it is not a bad thing to seek hel p, there is no shame in seeking professional help\" (FG: E11, female, 50 years). Results of the key informant interviews reflect in a broad se nse those of the ethnopsychological study ( Shala et al., 2020 ) and those of FGDs. In particular, age-specic dierences became once a gain evident. The adapted version seemed to increase the interest especiall y of older participants, because they identied strongly with the stor y of the characters and therefore felt understood and more visible. The y found it stimulating to get an insight into the topic of emotional di stress and to be sensitized through psychoeducation. 3.3. In-session techniques 3.3.1. Goal setting and involving a person of trust To further enhance treatment motivation, we also added a goa l setting component to the intervention. In the goal setting task, which was inspired by Reich et al. (2019) , the user is rst asked about possible negative consequences of their symptoms, e.g., ghting wit h family members or not being able to work. The illustrated doctor the n explains that such negative consequences are common, and users are ask ed to set their own goals within the areas of family, household, work, leisure time, and others. With this goal setting task, we aimed to a ddress the socio-centric self-concept in the target population. In th is context, it seemed important to take into account possible consequences in the family and community that might be more relevant for pa rticipants than their own, individual suering. Having these thought s in mind, new narratives for the goal setting task were written to express age- and gender-appropriate treatment goals that addressed not only the in- dividual needs of the main character but also their famili es and friends. For example, suggested goals for the character Drita (female , married, with two children) would be: \"i) I want to be able to be th ere for my family. ii) I want to meet my friends for coee again, ii i) I would like to do sports with my friends again\" (session 1, goal-setting exercise). Participants conrmed the importance of the social environm ent for the user in the process of treatment and recommended the inv olvement of a person of trust (FG: n = 5, KI: n = 3). Based on that, we added a small task, in which users are asked whether they would lik e to share their experiences of Hap-pas-Hapi with another person. The y can write down the name of a person they trust, e.g. a family membe r or a friend, and integrate Hap-pas-Hapi into their lives. All changes to treatment components were done in the introdu ction and in session 1, no signicant adjustments were made in the sub- sequent narratives. In these later sessions, minimal adjustmen ts were made with regard to the story content. Table 3 Top 5 symptom-ranking per character.

Treatment delivery The deep structure adaptation uses the same delivery format (self- help provided through an app) as the original Step-by-Step p rogramme. As to the original support model, we decided to use the contact- on- demand version that was developed for the STRENGTHS trials (see above). Participants of FGDs and KI interviews considered this a s an innovative format, which was new to them, as a promising op portunity concerning barriers in mental health care: \"The app h as the potential to break down barriers, as mental health is still dicult in t he Albanian population\" (FG: E5, female, 28 years). With regard to treatmen t de- livery, several surface adaptations were made concerning l anguage, illustrations, migrations-specic content, and technical issu es. 3.4.1. Language Improving the quality and acceptability of the translat ion was an intensive and time-consuming process. It was essential to invol ve sev- eral Albanian-speaking (non-) mental health experts and t o get FGDs' feedback on the comprehensibility of the content. The vast majority of participants in the FGDs and KI interviews perceived the translated story as highly appropriate, culturally relevant, and in teresting. Illiteracy was not mentioned as a barrier in any FGD. It was suggested to nd a language that speaks to people with dierent leve ls of edu- cation. However, it was highlighted that second-generation migrants might have limited knowledge of Albanian language. Part icipants sug- gested oering the intervention in German-language, as w ell, or to in- clude audio recordings, as the spoken language seems to be bett er un- derstood than the written language. In addition, regional dierences in the Albanian language had to be deliberated. The idea of adapting the language to the spoke n dialect had to be withdrawn since the main Albanian dialects, Ghe g (mostly spoken in North-Albania, Kosovo, and North Macedonia) and Tosk (spoken in South-Albania), are too dierent from each other. Participants in FGDs recommended using the standard Albanian lan- guage but being cautious when it comes to the proper use of idioms of distress. For example, the word for \"mood\" in Albania is \"humor\", whereas \"disponim\" is used in Kosovo and North Macedonia. Also, the idiom \"trishtim\" is understood as \"shock\" or \"fright\" in Kosovo, whereas in Albania, it means \"sadness\". Based on the ethnopsych olo- gical study, the FGDs, and experts' reviews, we decided to use the word \"m\u00ebrzi\" throughout the intervention, which was mentioned sponta- neously by most participants for \"low mood\" and \"sadness\". Culture-specic metaphorical expressions were translated by adopting a suitable equivalent from the narratives that were gathered in the ethnopsychological study, or from suggestions by Albanian- speaking research team members. For example, the expression \"My stomach was twisted with doubts\" was translated into \"por stomaku mu b\u00eb l\u00ebmsh nga dyshimet\" (English, \"but my stomach became a t angle of doubts\") (session 1). 3.4.2. Illustrations We decided to adapt the original Step-by-Step illustrations ( Carswell et al., 2018) only minimally, as focus group participants considered them to be culturally appropriate in general. The sugg ested changes on the illustrations were largely based on the individual taste s of certain participants (e.g., the images could be less childish and more realistic, with more colours, dierent clothing style or show real persons). The possibility of adding religious markers to gures (veil for women , beard for men) was rejected by most participants, mainly because t his would give preference to the Muslim religion but would exclude Ch ristian or Orthodox believers. This also does not represent the contextual r eality neither in Kosovo nor in Albania ( Dow and Woolley, 2011 ). New il- lustrations were drawn only for the newly developed treatmen t com- ponents according to their content. 3.4.3. Migration-specic content In three FGDs, recommendations were made to adapt the exempl ary activities in the story more to the living conditions in the migration context, in order not to evoke a stronger longing for family members in the homeland. For example, social activities with grandpare nts or aunts and uncles are often not possible if they live in another c ountry or died during the war. The story and suggested activities were adap ted ac- cordingly. 3.4.4. Technical issues All participants stated that they had their own mobile ph one, and nobody shared it within the family. They still welcomed the option to password-protect their access to the intervention. Problems wi th access to internet were not addressed by anyone. 4. Discussion This study developed an empirical and theory-based methodology to culturally adapt an internet and mobile-based interven tion for the treatment of psychological distress among Albanian migrants i n Switzerland and Germany, named Hap-pas-Hapi. In addition, a trans- parent and replicable documentation of the adaptation proce dures was developed, as several systematic reviews claimed that such doc- umentation of cultural adaptation procedures is lacking in the literature (e.g., Harper Shehadeh et al., 2016 ; Kalibatseva and Leong, 2014 ; Pedersen et al., 2015 ). The uncritical transfer of an intervention from one cult ure to an- other can not only reduce its eectiveness and usefulness but can also create risks to cause harm ( Heim et al., 2018 ; Rogler, 1999). On the other hand, conducting ethnopsychological studies among many dif - ferent cultural groups all over the world does not seem to be a realistic prospect. Heim et al. (2018) therefore recommend nding a balance to achieve the right level of cultural adaptation in larg e-scale interven- tions. More empirical evidence is needed on the substantial modi ca- tions that may enhance treatment adherence and eective ness. To provide such empirical evidence, the present study describes the pro- cess of a deep structure adaptation ( Resnicow et al., 1999 ) that will be compared to a surface adaptation in a randomized controlled tri al (Heim et al., 2020 ). Following the conceptual framework by Heim and Kohrt (2019) , this study rst examined the person perspective on the exper ience of psychological distress through an ethnopsychological study. Second, the intervention was adapted in an iterative process based on formative research (i.e., ethnopsychological study, focus group discussions, on line survey, and key informant interviews). As most prominent adap tation, an explanatory model builder was developed, in which the tr eatment rationale is transmitted in a process of guided discovery. This e x- planatory model builder is expected to reduce fatalistic bel iefs and to enhance treatment motivation. Third, two small intervent ions were included to address the socio-centric concept of the self in the target group. And fourth, adaptations were made with regard to trea tment delivery and \"surface\", i.e., language, illustrations, mi gration-specic content and technical issues. The specic components of the i nterven- tion (i.e., behavioural activation, stress management, cogn itive re- structuring, social support, and relapse prevention) remaine d un- changed. Our reporting system facilitated the decision-makin g process in a multicultural research team, the coherent and stri ngent monitoring of changes in the intervention, and transparent documentat ion. 4.1. Person-centred cultural concepts of distress As noted in the introduction, with regard to the heterogenei ty of the target population, it should be kept in mind that cultura l adaptation does not refer exclusively to ethnicity and nationality ( Castro et al., 2010; Resnicow et al., 2000, 1999 ). In this study, cultural adaptation relates beyond ethnicity of Albanians, since our target gr oup's culture M. Shala, et al. Internet Interventions 21 (2020) 100339 9has heterogenous characteristics. Our formative research emp hasized the signicance between acceptance of culturally adapt ed elements and socio-demographic factors such as age, gender, generation, exp erience of migration, language skills, belonging, economic class, or education, in addition to more cultural aspects such as acculturation, t he self- concept or the social role in the community/family. There fore, re- presentatives of dierent subgroups were interviewed to lear n more about the most salient symptoms and causes of distress that emerge in subgroups, and the ones that can be found independent of socio- demographic factors. Our formative research indicates that f atalistic beliefs, low treatment motivation and unfullled desires can be found mainly in older adults, and specic symptom expressions and perc eived causes dier across age groups and gender ( Shala et al., 2020 ). In contrast, there are shared narratives, independent of gender and age, concerning discrimination, diculties in cultural belonging and in- congruent values between the generations. The newly developed explanatory model builder addresses such cultural concepts of distress, encourages users to reflect on thei r own situation, helps them to disentangle causes and symptoms of distre ss, and fosters their understanding of how behaviour and mood are rel ated. The two newly added techniques, i.e., goal setting and the involvement of a person of trust, aim to address the socio-centric notion of th e self in this target group. This was done based on our formative researc h showing that suering and healing does not involve only the i ndividual, but also the social environment. 4.2. Treatment delivery and surface adaptation Large parts of the adaptations were based on linguistic modic ation, and the question arose as to the dierence between translati on and adaptation. As mentioned in the Methods and materials section, we distinguish between techniques for literal translation and techniques for oblique translation, such as adaptation ( Venuti, 2000). The adaptation technique is the methodological step where the work of the translator's overlap with the surface adaptation carried out by the re search group. A deep understanding of the source and target language of the interven- tion was required from decision makers who carried out and appr oved the adaptation. First, general grammatical and stylistic e dits were made but not documented (e.g., syntax, diacritics, flexions of words base d on gender, person, tenses, formal personal pronoun etc.). Second, sur face adaptation focused on semantics, notably including the use of m eta- phorical concepts, but also linguistic characteristics that refer to social practices (e.g., greetings formulas), and regional dierence s in the use of certain idioms. The ndings from this study add to the current literature on surface adaptation of the Step-by-Step intervention for dierent gr oups residing in Lebanon (Abi Ramia et al., 2018 ), Syrian refugees living in Germany, Sweden and Egypt ( Burchert et al., 2019 ), and Filipino domestic workers living in Macao ( Garabiles et al., 2019 ). With regard to lan- guage, we decided to stay closer to the standard language and n ot using spoken dialect, which diers from these previous studies. Simila r to Arabic, Albanian language shows striking regional dieren ces (Murati, 2015), and may display variations in the use of idioms of distress. Whereas the Arabic version of Step-by-Step uses the spoken dia lect of the \"Levantine\" region (i.e., Syria, Lebanon, Palestine), Hap-pas-Hapi uses a language that can be understood by people from very di erent regions where Albanian is spoken. For this purpose, it was nec essary to dierentiate between terms that are used in active vocab ulary (ex- amined through FGDs) and the ones listed in dictionaries. In case of doubt or disagreement, we preferred the latter. In contrast to previous studies on the cultural adaptation of St ep-by- Step, no diculties were anticipated in our target group wi th regard to access to internet or shared mobile phones. However, our results also conrmed the previously found request for more realistic and less comic-like illustrations what wer e perceived as childish (Abi Ramia et al., 2018 ; Burchert et al., 2019 ). 4.3. Lessons learned and suggestions for future research As we have considered the new conceptual framework for cult ural adaptation by Heim and Kohrt (2019) and developed a procedure with dierent methodological approaches, much valuable experien ce was gained during the study. In particular, we have found tha t it is worth- while in the planning process to consider the focus of the stu dy and the resources required for a deep and surface adaptation. The foll owing questions and conditions should therefore be considered. Content modication: Which components should be adapted? Do parts of the content have to be newly written? Which language and which regional dierences are considere d in order to integrate proper idioms of distress, metaphors, and psychological terminology i n the target language? What is the quality of the translation? Does the translation need a linguistic correction regarding semantics, syntax, and stylistics? Translators, key informants, and decision-makers: Who translates the original story? Where do the translators come from? Who writes the new content? Who checks the translation and new content drafts through wh ich methods? Which key informants should be invited to give feedback on comprehe nsibility and acceptance of the intervention? Should individual interviews or group interviews be conducted? What language and cultural knowledge do the decision-makers have? Are the suggested adaptations necessary because they concern comprehensibility and acceptance, or are the suggestions based on linguistic pr eferences of the decision-makers, which would be correct and appropriate anywa y? How are decisions made and documented? Who incorporates the decisions into the intervention? Documentation of formative research: Taking notes and protocols while conducting FGDs was useful, espe cially for faster data evaluation and analysis of main topics, as well as for the notation of content that could not be taken from the recordings (e.g., bodily rea ction, pointing out). Organisation, implementation, and analysis of FGDs should be in relation to the research purpose and should be organised economically in terms of time. Documentation of adaptation procedures: The more FGDs participants are invited, the more data must be processed, and the more suggestions for changes and topics must be considered. The more drafts are written for the deep adaptation, the m ore revision loops are needed. The more research members make decisions about the adaptation , the more eort is required in the change and documentation process because seve ral circles are worked through. 4.4. Limitations Some limitations of this study must be considered. Many interested persons could not participate in FGDs for occupational reasons, a s not all FGDs could be conducted on weekends. Scheduling reasons also made it dicult to divide the groups into potential users/exper ts, el- derly/young, or male/female. In general, we assume, that mixing the groups had no signicant influence on results. However, the cu ltural norm of respect for the elderly sometimes made it dicult to in terrupt them, both for the younger participants as well as for the moderator (MS). After the FGDs some younger participants expressed that th ey felt inhibited to express themselves freely in the presence of t he elders. From our point of view, gender specic grouping was not absolut ely necessary, as cultural norms allowed it. The participants in Berlin were mainly from Albania, while most of those in Zurich were of Kosovan origin. However, this indicated no major dierences in their feedback. Further, the results of the online survey could be influenced by the previously conducted FGDs. The sequence of options oered for the M. Shala, et al. Internet Interventions 21 (2020) 100339 10ranking of symptoms and causes of distress was randomized; however, arbitrariness of answers could have influenced the results. 5. Conclusion Research and practice are challenged to make psychological inter- ventions available and acceptable to ethnic groups. Scalab le e-mental health interventions seem promising to narrow the treatmen t gap. Literature recognizes the need to consider the patient per spective by culturally adapting evidence-based interventions to render them more congruent with patients' own explanatory models of their psy chological distress. Overall, the present work lays the groundwork for future re search on deep structure cultural adaptation that acknowledges cul tural con- cepts of distress. An iterative process and mixed methods approach can serve to successively identify the most salient elements and g uide the transition from formative research to evidence-based cultura l adapta- tion. In an upcoming randomized controlled trial, we will e xamine the eect of deep structure adaptation on the acceptability a nd eective- ness of Hap-pas-Hapi. Consequently, we aim to deliver much-n eeded empirical evidence on the eect of dierent levels of cul tural adapta- tion.
