Eden Energy Medicine (EEM) Energy Medicine awakens energies that bring resilience, joy, and enthusiasm to your life - and greater vitality to your body, mind, and spirit! Balancing your energies balances your body's chemistry, regulates your hormones, helps you feel better, and helps you think better. It has been called the self-care and development path of the future, but it empowers you NOW to adapt to the challenges of the 21st century and to thrive within them. Donna Eden incorporated techniques from yoga, tai chi, and acupuncture as well as many other modalities to formulate EEM. EEM focuses on moving, balancing, enhancing, and restoring the body's energies. EEM employs \"energy testing\" to assess how your energies are flowing through specific areas of your body and may help identify the techniques that will be most beneficial for you. These methods will lend themselves to highly individualized sessions based on your needs. Self care is a foundation of EEM. Your active participation in the session as well as outside the session will enhance your transformation. \"Conventional medicine, at its foundation, focuses on the biochemistry of cells, tissue, and organs. Energy Medicine, at its foundation, focuses on the energy fields of the body that organize and control the growth and repair of cells, tissue, and organs. Changing impaired energy patterns may be the most efficient, least invasive way to improve the vitality of organs, cells, and psyche.\" - David Feinstein, Ph.D. Certified EEM practitioners have completed an intensive training program.

EEM Level 1 Essential Oils Essential Oil therapy can be defined as the art and science of utilizing naturally extracted aromatic essences from plants to balance, harmonize and promote the health of body, mind and spirit. It seeks to unify physiological, psychological and spiritual processes to enhance an individual's innate healing process. It was the French perfumer and chemist, Rene- Maurice Gattefosse, who coined the term \"aromatherapie\" in 1937 with his publication of a book by that name. His book \"Gattefosse's Aromatherapy\" contains early clinical findings for utilizing essential oils for a range of physiological ailments. It seems vital to understand what Gattefosse's intention for coining the word was, as he clearly meant to distinguish the medicinal application of essential oils from their perfumery applications.
