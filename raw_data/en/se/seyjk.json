Executive s ummary During 2019 , the EIP-AGRI Focus Group on Plant -based Medicinal and Cosmetic Products has analysed the key factors that influence farmers and foresters to enter the Medicina l and Aromatic Plant (MAP) sector . The main question was: 'How to create diversification opportunities for farmers through innovative value chains of plant -based medicinal and cosmetic products? ' For the purpose of the Focus Group , a 'Plant -based medicinal and cosmetic product ' is defined as raw or semi-processed plant material (e.g. dried herb, essential oil, plant extract) that can be o btained by a producer (i.e. grower or wild collector) and used for manufacturing various plant -based products such as herbal medicines, cosmetics, supplements and functional food. In summary, MAPs contribute to integrated agro -industrial pathways through providing plant raw materials and intermediate products which have significant economic value to different industrial sectors beyond agriculture. Apart from technological inn ovations , there is a need to create opportunities for diversi fication in rural areas through sustainable social innovations , e.g. to increase the territorial capital through diversification of landscapes, preservation of biodiversity, cross -sectoral and territorial integration and combinations with other sectors like bio -economy activities and agro -tourism . In this regard , MAPs may be considered as a valid tool for multifunctional development of agricultural activity. The Mediterranean basin, for instance, is characterised as the epicentre of economic diversification and sustainable development , e.g. exploitation of low input agricultural productive systems, medicinal agroforestry, bio -economy and agro - touristic activities. In response to the ongoing challen ges, f armers and foresters must adopt or create new business models , adapted to the regional MAP production systems . Furthermore, the Focus Group experts emphasised the need to increase the possi bilities for women, young people and local people to particip ate in innovative processes involving the MAP value chain . The Focus Group identified new ideas for potential Operational Group s and other innovative project s, covering a full-spectrum of innovative solutions in the MAP sector and which can be implemented all over Europe. Also, they identified research needs from practice and possible gaps in technical knowledge , specifically working on themes around domestication and cultivation , conservation and sustainable use of wild resources , postharvest technologies, drying and extraction , product development, access to markets, logistics and distribution , multi-functionality management and benefits of MAPs to other ecosystem services.

Introduction The need for plant materials intended for cosmetic and medicinal purposes, combined with the need to protect plant biodiversity, create s an opportunity for farmers and foresters to diversify their production and improve their income. However, the competitiveness and sustainability of the value chains working with newly cultivated or wild managed plants used for medicinal and cosmetic products is often under pressure. The Medicinal and Aromatic Plant (MAP) sector is undergoing changes , and societal d rivers such as digitalisation and environmental changes - especially cli mate change - create both risks and opportunities. This report summarises the comprehensive work carried out by the EIP-AGRI Focus Group on Plant - based Medicinal and Cosmetic Products (Annex I ), which brought together 20 experts with complementary types of knowledge from 15 European countries , offering a wide range of expertise in terms of multidiscipli narity and geographic diversity. The Focus Group linked researchers and advisers with herb growers, practitioners and other stakeholders know ledgeable about the MAP sector. A starting paper (Argyropoulos, 2019 ) 0F1 was circulated to the experts prior to the first meeting in Setubal, Portugal . This served as a starting point for the discussions during the first meeting . The main question addressed by the F ocus Group was: 'How to create diversification opportunities for farmers through innovative value chains of plant -based medicinal and cosmetic products?' Definition: A 'Plant -based medicinal and cosmetic product' is defined as a raw or semi-processed plant material (e.g. dried herb, essential oil, plant extract) that can be obtained by a producer (i.e. growe r or wild collector) and used for manufacturing various plant -based products such as herbal medicines, cosmetics, supplements and functional food. A number of key topics were discussed in eight mini -papers , which represent the building blocks of this repo rt: MP1 Main actors, m arkets and collaboration of MAP value chain ; MP2 Business models and empowerment of farmers/collectors in the value chain ; MP3 Benefits of MAPs for farming/forest systems: multi -functionality, ecosystem services and social benefits ; MP4 Plant raw materials for herbal medicinal products, botanical food supplements and frontier products: requirements for quality, safety and efficacy ; MP5 Wild collection: recommendati ons to avoid over exploitation and to promote sustainable use of wild resources ; MP6 Technical needs in the primary sector (propa gation, cultivation, harvesting and weed management) ; MP7 Postharvest handling and dr ying of MAPs ; MP8 Knowledge exchange, flows, training needs and tools . 1 https://ec.europa.eu/eip/ agriculture/sites/agri -eip/files/fg35_starting_paper_2019_en.pdf PLANT -BASED MEDICINAL AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS JULY 2020 5 3. State of play MAP production data, challenges and opportunities In the last decades , the rising concern about potentially harmful synthetic additives (both because of reported side effects and due to economic worries ), resulted in a reallocation of consumer p references to the use of natural resources as functional ingredients for products in pharmaceutical, food & beverage, cosmetic and agrochemical industries. This included a shift toward the use of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants ( MAPs ), their extracts and ess ential oils . Nowadays, there is an expanding interest in plant -based extracts where end-use industries are looking for efficacious, safe and cost -effective natural bio -actives with clearly defined modes of action and proven benefits. The global market for botanicals continues to grow and was valued at $108 billion in 2015 , with herbal medicines making up 48%of that , cosmetics 17% and supplements & functional food 35% 1F2. Apart from the traditional market segments, the rapidly growing market of supplement s and functional food in Europe creates significant opportunities for key actors in the value chain , i.e., farmers, local collectors, resource managers, processors and distributors. Europe has a long tradition in collecting wild plant resources. Uncounted MA P species are used in the cosmetic and botanical industries and the great majority of these materials is provided by collecting MAPs from natural habitats . Greece , for instance , is home to more than 6,600 herbs, many of which (approximately 1,400) are indigenous. Although collection of MAPs from wild resources is a common practice, it often reduces the natural population 's size, resulting in highly heterogen ous raw material due to the existing genetic and chemical diversity 2F3. Given their positive impacts on local economies and higher value to local collectors, s ustainable collection is often considered the most important conservation strategy for wild plant species 3F4. MP5 provides recommendations on how to promote the sustainable use and avoid the overexploitation of wild resources. On this point, the Nagoya Protocol of the Convention on Biological Diversity 4F5 creates greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resou rces. An enhanced production and steady supply of plant raw materials in Europe can be guaranteed under controlled conditions by field or greenhouse cultivation of MAPs (MP6). In some cases this may contribute to conservation of thre atened medicinal plant species , especially when these are considered high added -value products. However, i t is not easy to precisely assess how many MAPs are commercially traded on an international or even national level. Also, the vast majority of the trade worldwide is based on dr ied plant material . In Europe, MAPs are cultiv ated on an area exceeding 200,000 ha, most of which is located in France (52,000 ha), Poland (30,000 ha), Spain (27,800 ha), Bulgaria (16,800 ha), Germany (13,000 ha), Croatia (8,500 ha), Czech Republic (7,225 ha), Italy (7,191 ha), Greece (6, 800 ha) and A ustria (4,136 ha). Some important MAPs (indicative only) in terms of economic value, end -use and demand from industry are shown below: Common name Species Part of plant used Chamomile Matricaria chamomilla L.

Springer, Berlin, pp. 75 -95. 5 https://www.cbd.int/abs/doc/protocol/nagoya -protocol -en.pdf PLANT -BASED MEDICINAL AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS JULY 2020 6 Indeed , domestic cultivation of MAPs in Europe is still very small compared to other crops. The fact that the majority of dried plant mat erial is wild -harvested and/or imported from outside the EU, appears a good opportunity to intensify the sustainable production and processing of MAPs in Europe. From the marketing perspective, domestication and cultivation of MAPs offer unique new opport unities , such as an increase in authentic and bo tanically reliable products; a guaranteed st eady source of raw material; better rapport bet ween growers and wholesalers; controlled postharvest handling and theref ore rigorous quality control; possibilities f or adjustments of product standards to regulations a nd consumer preferences; and product certification 5F6. Many farmers, in turn may consider MAP cultivation as more profitable than traditional crops . However, farmers and foresters must adopt or create new business models, adapted to the regional MAP production systems . MP2 gives an insight into business models and the empowerme nt of farmers/ wild collectors in the MAP value chain . Requirements for sustainability in wild -collection and cultivation of MAPs from the side of consumer s and regulatory bodies are increasing. The actors in the value chain should a ddress consumers' expec tations , e.g. raw material sourcing, product traceability , quality regulation , efficacy and safety (MP4), while also considering susta inability in different contexts , e.g. env ironmental, social and economic and transparency throug hout the supply (value) chain. MAPs may be regarded as industrial crops , since their products can be used in different ind ustrial sectors beyond agriculture , such as in pharmaceutical or flavour and fragrance industries. With the increasing demand for these plants and their value-added products, a number of business opportunities may ari se that can contribute to the sustainab le development of resource -efficient and econom ically profitable crops in rural areas of Europe. This approach can help to increase farmers' incomes through access to new markets, as well as increasing the value of marginal land.

International Forestry Review 5, 138 -147. PLANT -BASED MEDICINAL AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS JULY 2020 7 MAP value chain MAP-derived natural products, either as pure compounds or as standardi sed plant extracts, provide numerous opportunities for novel applications. There are four types of plant materials a ccording to the degree of processing, preparation and transformation: Fresh plant material: whole, cut or speci fic parts of fresh and cleaned plant raw material Dried plant material: whole, or selected parts of MAPs Essential oil: product derived from th e distillation of MAPs Plant e xtract: product derived from dissolution and extraction of the active ingredients The MAP sector is a long agro -industrial sector producing 'intermediate products' . The value chain of MAPs encompasses all production/collectio n and processing steps to produce plant -based medicinal and cosmetic products : selection of plant raw materials, cultivation and/or wild -harvest, postharvest handling (drying and dry herb processing), distillation or extraction, purification (and/or isolat ion), product formulat ion and packaging. It usually consists of a set of interdependent enterprises with complementary activities ( e.g. production, processing, trading and end -use industry). The core actors in the MAP value chain (MP1) typically include input suppliers, farm machinery manufacturers or technology providers, primary producers (wild -collectors or herb growers), primar y and secondary processors (drying and extraction) , wholesalers (agents or traders), service providers (quality assurance, certif ication) and end -use industries . The process steps of raw material sourcing, postharvest handling and drying are performed by herb growers /local wild collectors or processors - individually or in a cooperative. Figure 3 shows the value chain of medicinal and aromatic plants from the raw material to a final formulated product. In order to ensure appropriate and consistent quality of herbal substances via active ingredient purification, high quality requirements, such as Good Agricultural and Collection Practice (GACP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) need to be fulfilled.

The active ingredients of medici nal plants are typically localis ed in different parts , e.g. leaf, flower, seed, fruit, bark, rhizome or root. Plant raw materials vary significantly in terms of consistency and physical properties . Therefore, the harvesting and processing equipment of individual parts is usually selective. Standardi sation of r aw material producti on and quality assurance of MAP ingredients throughout the supply chain begins with the sourc ing of verified/certified plant species. The industry worldwide, especially herbal ingredient manufacturers, relies on proper MAPs identificati on, as described in Pharmacopeia herbal monographs. Figure 4 Harvesting of herbs in Spain (source: Mor\u00e9) On-farm drying process Postharvest processing and on -farm drying begin s immediately to prevent spoilage by enzymatic processes with subs equent quality deterioration. Different dryer types are used for MAPs , e.g., typical grain dryers for seeds, tray dryers for flowers, fruits and roots. Drying of herbs, in turn, is performed in flat-bed dryers or conveyor -belt dryers , following low or high mechani sed processing lines respectively (MP7). The drying behaviour of MAPs is mainly affected by the conditions of the drying air , such as temperature, relative humidity and velocity. The choice of the optimal drying conditions is a key economic and ec ological criterion , as it affects both the quality of production and the energy requirements 7F8. To achieve high drying capacity, while saving energy at the same time, a maximum allowable temperature should be applied, but with a minimum d eterioration in q uality . Drying of MAPs involves low drying temperatures in order to protect the heat -sensitive active ingredients 8F9. The e nergy requirement of MAP drying represents a significant cost factor (e.g., twofold in comparison with grain drying11), due to the hi gh moisture content of the individual plant parts to be dried. In general, o n-farm storage is very important to both farmers and buyers , since t he demand for a continuous and uniform supply of dried medicinal herbs requires advanced traceability tools and short supply routes to the end -use industries. 8 M\u00fcller J & Heindl A, 2006.

PLANT -BASED MEDICINAL AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS JULY 2020 9 Figure 5 Conveyor -belt dryer of herbs in Germany (source: Argyropoulos & M\u00fcller) On-farm e xtraction of active ingredients Extraction of active compounds from MAPs is a key process in the value chain. It requires a technical and operational know -how in order to get the most out of plant matrix , and is t herefore carried out by professional companies. Distillation is the most common method used to extract and isolate essential oils from MAPs . It is carried out by passing dry steam through the plant material , whereby the steam vaporises the volatile compounds , which then eventually conde nse and are collected in receivers . The minimum quality requirements for herbal drugs are postulated in the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) 9F10. Figure 6 Steam distillation of herbs in Italy (source: Primavera) 10 https://www.edqm.eu/en/eu ropean -pharmacopoeia -ph-eur-10th-edition PLANT -BASED MEDICINAL AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS JULY 2020 10 Market of plant -based extracts In a first appr oximation of the MAP markets , two types of intermediate products can be distinguished: Plant materials or parts thereof, whole or cut, fresh or dried The extracts, essential oils and oleoresins obtained as the fi rst transformation of the plant material Both groups of products constitute the raw materials of the perfumery, cosmetics, pharmaceuti cal, food and chemical industries. A single MAP species may have multiple uses in various end -use industries. Functional foods MAPs are used for flavouring : either directly in condiments for seasoning (fresh, frozen or dry) and in herbal teas, or in the fo rm of their derivatives in the industry for ma nufacturing food products (extract, essential oil) : Products addressed directly to the consumer condiments/seasonings (dried herb s) herbal teas (dried herb s) Products addressed to the industry food ingredients and additives (flavours, colours) functi onal food (dried herb , extracts) food supplements (dried herb, extracts, essential oil) Ingredients for cosmetics Extracts and essential oils are used t o manufacture fragrant products , competing with synthetic compou nds: Perfumes and other low cosmetic industry products (soaps, moisturising creams , deodorants, insect repellent) Drugstore (detergents and air fresheners) Scented decoration products Herbal medicine Other frontier products are growing market segments , which therefore may present increasing opportunities for MAP producers: Herbal Medicinal Products are plant -derived health products exclusively containing as active ingredient s one or more herbal substances/ herbal preparations aimed to treat or prevent disea se or to restore, correct or modify physiological functions. Medical Devices segment comprises a wide range and different kind of tools or objects and substances intended to be used, for diagnosis, monitoring, prediction, prognosis of disease, also for pr evention treatment or al leviation of disease or injury. Botanical Food S upplements are foodstuffs containing high concentrations of nutrients or other substances with a nutritional or physiological effect, marketed in dose form, such as capsules, tablets, sachets of powder and ampoules of liquids. MAP producers should be aware of the requirements of the regulatory frameworks , conditions to understand t he opportunities for the utilisation of the plant raw materials . The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA ) issued a guidance document on the assessment of the safety of botanical material and preparations 10F11 and, with reference to the efficacy, published a scientific guidance for stakeholders 11F12. The safety and efficacy of botanical food supplements (classi fied a ccording to their intended use and their mechanisms of action) is guaranteed by the whole complex of natura l substa nces and not by individual ones (MP4). 11 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2009.

The Focus Group identified the different skills and knowledge requirements needed by the actors involved in the MAP sector .

MAPs play a key role in sustainable agriculture and biodiversity . Moreover, they contribute to the stabilisation of micro -climates in rural/marginal regions through their perennial production and rooting systems that are capable of adapt ing to marginal lands. The regional MAP production systems are characterised by the establishment of cooperatives , typically aimed at commerci alisation, but which have expanded their role over time and have become integrated into the territorial framework and have combined with other sectors beyond agriculture . A noteworthy particularity of the MAP sector is the varying layers of network partici pation needed to stay competitive and be resilient against shocks and changing market conditions. MAPs may be considered a valid tool for the advancement of agricultural practice towards multi functionality 12F13. They can contribute to economic diversifica tion in rural areas, to aesthetic land valorisation and to creating region -specific dynamics for sustainable development of many areas - especially when these are marginal or at risk of marginali sation. Various plant species fi nd optimal growth condition s in Mediterranean environments. The Mediterranean basin can be the epicentre of economic diversification and sustainable development , e.g. the exploitation of low input agricultural productive systems, medicinal agroforestry, bio-economy and agro-touristic activities. MAPs combat soil erosion, help to mitigate climate change by fixing substantial amounts of carbon dioxide , and play a role in preserving traditional landscapes and maintaining biodiversity. Therefore, in the Mediterranean region the traditional MAP production may contribute to the configuration of areas of high environmental and landscape value . It also represent s an important factor in generating employment and income for these MAP-producing regions . All these challenges in the MAP sector can b e appro ached with social innovations and/or by new business models . To ensure the continu ed success of the MAP sector in rural areas , specific actions must be taken. These must among others include the development of innovation, the promotion of product qu ality, a greater professionali sation, the efficient structuring of inter -sector partnerships, the promotion of well -integrated and suitably -sized marketing structures. Mo reover, the risk of lands becoming abandoned or marginal ised highlights the importance of non-commercial functions of this sector , such as the provision of public goods, the production of heal thy, high -quality products, the maintenance of rural populatio n and local production systems. For instance , medicinal agroforestry - where medicinal p lants are grown with multipurpose trees - can be a profitable alternative to traditional cropping systems. This system is more sustainable than a mono -cropping system and also provides economic and environmental benefits.

Chios Mastiha Growers Association (Greece ) www.gummastic.gr/en The Chios Mastic Growers Asso ciation is a cooperation which comprises 4,500 families that reside on the island and cultivate a unique and indigenous product that plays an important role in the economy of the island. Chios Mastiha is the name of a resinous sap produced from the mastic tree ( Pistacia Lentiscus var. Chia). It is a natural, aromatic resin in teardrop shape that falls on the ground in drops from superficial scratches induced by cultivators on the tree's trunk and main bran ches with sharp tools. The know -how of cultivating Mastiha has been included by UNESCO on its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Krokos Kozanis Cooperative (Greece) krokoskozanispdo.eu A cooperation developed to supp ort over 1,500 families in 20 villages around the area of Kozani. These families grow and collect what is considered to be one of the best organic saffron varieties worldwide. Over 150,000 flowers are collected by hand to produce just over two pounds of sa ffron. The cooperative has the complete responsibility to collect, process, pack and distribut e the product in order to ensure its quality and to avoid the adulteration done by traders in the past that result ed in the degradation and negative image of the product.

The hemp c ooper ative of Ireland is a registered c ooperative with the aim of creating an infrastructure for farmers and local businesses to develop the hemp industry in Ireland. The cooperative will support its member s by providing shared access to resources, equipment and markets through a national body and local hubs. Innovation examples Under the Sun www.underthesun.pt 'Under the Sun' is a local small -scale herb production and processing centre which represent s an associat ion of five organic herb producers, located in the south of Portugal, where different herbs are cultivated on a marginal, previously abandoned piece of land. For herb drying, a patented modular hybrid solar dryer is used. Black Block\u00ae is a modular, hybrid solar drying system using both solar and electric energy, designed to dry herbs and other crops in recycled black containers, insulated with a new wall and covered by polycarbonate sheets. The hybrid solar dryer consists of the solar collector, where the air used in the drying process is heated, and the drying container, where the material to be dried is placed in sacks, trays or trolleys. Automatic control of drying conditions in the container is achieved by real -time acquisition and analysis of temperatu re and humidity data through a network of sensors and artificial intelligence. Air is heated throughout the day in the solar collector . However, in conditions of low radiation intensity (a cloudy sky or night time operation), the dryer activates the auxili ary heating system. Practical experience highlights significant savings in energy co sts (https://blackblock.eu/ ).

PLANT -BASED MEDICINAL AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS JULY 2020 16 Funded research projects Only a few large -scale research projects deal ing with the priorities of the Focus G roup on plant -based medicinal and cosmetic products have recently been carried out or are currently ongoing across Europe. These activities are funded under EU programmes managed by the European Commission in the areas of research, innovation and competitiveness - in particular the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, the Erasmus+ Programme and the European Territorial Cooperation (INTERREG) as well as national research and demonstra tion initiatives. Some examples of funded activities are listed below to illustrate the complexity of the topic and to highlight that a multi-actor approach is needed to address challenges and grasp opportunities for farmers/foresters in the MAP value chai n.

What can be done Knowledge exchange and training The F ocus Group recogn ised the dynamic roles of both advisers and herb producers , and the importance of trust to enhance impact. In line with today's 'Digital Era', t he use of visual and digital aids in the MAP sector have the potential to facilitate knowledge exchange and trai ning. This may include video clips, factsheet s, infographics or webinars to demonstrate skills training and research findings. Such knowledge transfer tools can ease learning experiences and can enhance learning abi lity and information retention. Digital t ools and platforms enable growers to have instant access to a broad range of information in a use r friendly, non -location depende nt format at a time most suitable to their working routine , and which are compatible with multiple devices. Moreover, on-farm d emonstration activities can provide an ideal opportunity for providing training to industry and relevant stakeholders in the MAP sector . Figure 8 Left: Field day event in France; Right: On -farm demonstration in Spain (source: Mor\u00e9) Demonstration activities can range from one -off 'field day events ', to multi -year ' monitor farms' where farmers, advisers and industry members come together to assess farming opportunities in practice, to permanent 'research farms' where researchers test and demonstrate innovative practices and techniques .

Conclusions MAPs may be regarded as industrial crops because their products can be used in different industrial sectors beyond agriculture , such as in pharmaceutical or flavour and fragrance industries. With an increasing demand for these plants and their value -added products, a number of business opportunities may arise that can contribute to the sustainable development of resource -efficient and economically profitable crops in rural areas. A steady supply of pl ant raw materials in Europe can be guaranteed through the domestication and cultivation of MAPs, which in some cases may contribute to the conservation of over-exploited plant species. However, cultivation of MAPs in Europe is still very small compared to other crops. The fact that the majority of medicinal herbs are collected from the wild and/or imported from outside the EU, appears as a good opportunity to intensify the domestic production and processing of MAPs . Frontier products such as h erbal medicina l products, medical devices, botanical food supplements and natural cosmetics are growing market segments , which thereby are linked to increasing opportunities for MAP growers. However, to ensure overall quality, efficacy and product safety, raw material s ourcing and primary processing (e.g. postharvest handling, drying and extraction of bioactive compounds ) are key steps. Information on the production, wild collection of, and trade in MAPs is scarce and data are rarely collected or published at a national level and European level . The Focus Group highlighted the need for legislative and policy support for wild -harvesting schemes. Given their positive impacts to local economies and their higher value to local collectors, s ustainable collection is often considered as the most important conservation strategy for wild plant species. On this point, the Nagoya Protocol of the Convention on Biological Diversity creates greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources. MAPs may be considered as a valid tool for a multifunctional development of agricultural activity . Besides technological innovations, t here is broad interest in the use of social innovation to increase the territorial capital through diversification of landscap es, preservation of biodiversity, cross -sectorial and territorial integration, and combinations with other sectors like bio -economy activities and agro -tourism in rural areas. Analysis of current research results clearly showed that only a few large -scale projects that align with the priorities of the Focus Group have been recently carried out or are c urrently ongoing across Europe. This indicates an urgent need for fundamental, applied and collaborative research in the MAP domain . The F ocus Group recognis ed the dynamic roles of both advise rs and herb producers , and the importance of trust to enhance impact. In line with today's 'Digital Era', the use of visual and digital aids in the MAP sector have the potential to facilitate knowledge exchange and traini ng. Digital tools and platforms will enable growers to have instant access to a broad range of information in a user friendly format . Moreover, farm demonstration activities can provide an ideal opportunity for providing training to industry and other rele vant stakeholders involved in the MAP sector.

The EIP-AGRI aims to catalyse the innovation process in the agricultural and forestry sectors by bringing research and practice closer together - in research and innovat ion projects as well as through the EIP -AGRI network. EIPs aim to streamline, simplify and better coordinate existing instruments and initiatives and complement them with actions where necessary. Two specific funding sources are particularly important for the EIP -AGRI: the EU Research and Innovation framework, Horizon 2020, the EU Rural Development Policy. An EIP -AGRI Focus Group* is one of several different building blocks of the EIP-AGRI network, which is funded under the EU Rural Development policy. Working on a narrowly defined issue, Focus Groups temporarily bring together around 20 experts (such as farmers, advisers, researchers, up - and downstream businesses and NGOs) to map and develop solutions within their field. The concrete objectives of a Focus Group are: to take stock of the state of art of practice and research in its field, listing problems and opportunities; to identify needs from practice and propose directions for further research; to propose priorities for innovative actions by suggesting potential projects for Operational Groups working under Rural Development or other project formats to test solutions and opportunities, including ways to disseminate the practical knowledge gathered. Results are norma lly published in a report within 12 -18 months of the launch of a given Focus Group. Experts are selected based on an open call for interest. Each expert is appointed based on his or her personal knowledge and experience in the particular field and therefor e does not represent an organisation or a Member State. *More details on EIP -AGRI Focus Group aims and process are given "}
