Within a year, the Anaheim Public Utilities (Anaheim) was bringing energy to the downtown area and generating energy from 1895-1916. From 1916-1976, Anaheim purchased its power supply from Southern California Edison Company, and from 1976 - 2003, Anaheim began receiving power from its ownership shares in conventional resources, including nuclear, coal and natural gas resources, until providing customers with [renewable resources](/5090/), beginning in 2003. In 2006, Assembly Bill 32 established a statewide Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction target of 20% below 1990 levels by 2020, which later increased to 40% by 2030. To help achieve the State's GHG emissions reduction goals, we have been providing our customers with increasing amounts of energy from renewable resources, while reducing the consumption of conventional energy resources.
