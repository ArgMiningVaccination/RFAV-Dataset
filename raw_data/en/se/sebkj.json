[July 2021 edit: updated guide with now 70 pages total 3rd edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/w8njnr/heres_70_pages_of_notes_ive_taken_from_20/?) Note: Reddit has a limit on how quickly I can post, so check back for more notes posted in the comments section. 4/4 2pm MST Update: Check back for notes on sumo deadlift form checklift, squat form checklist, vertical diet summary, and an updated women's advice section. Quick Intro: Over the past 6 months I've been reading books, watching documentaries, listening to podcasts, and trying new methods of training all in my pursuit to be more fit. That said, I've decided to share notes I've taken on the three coaches I consider to be the top teachers and doers of the strength, conditioning, and nutrition industry, whose pedigree spread across the experienced trenches of Olympians, US Special Operations, World Strongest Man, UFC, NFL, etc --just to name a few. Now, they are by no means the holders of the gospel of fitness, nor are they the only voices worth listening to, but here's why I chose who I chose: Philosophy of Choice: - Achievements in personal fitness - need to be fit, and have fitness results in their own life. Can't be all head knowledge or studies. No book worms or science nerds without the in-the-trenches experience. - Achievements in client fitness - need to have produced results in others lives, because knowing what works for you is vastly different than being able to identify, correct, and advance what works for others. - Renown and respected by the community - peers need to recognize contributions to the community - Longevity - How long have they been in the game? How long have they stayed healthy? How long have they been training clients? All important questions in establishing reputation. Why I Chose Stan Efferding: To me, Stan is the summation of an average guy with absolute discipline who's taken the best advice from the best gurushe's personally trained with from around the world for decades, and becoming himself an absolute beast. I chose Stan because of his humble demeanor, and because he's also one of the strongest bodybuilders in the world. Additionally, he has trained the Mountain to win his first Arnolds Strongest Man 2018 this past March. - Blue collar guy who presents some info. No tips or tricks. Turned over every rock looking for the secret. Spent loads of money, and there is only one answer: sleep, eat, and train. - Matt Wenning calls him \"the strongest bodybuilder on planet earth.\" - Helped get Hapthorr \"The Mountain\" diet in check, where he set records in elephant bar (1000lbs+) and bag-over-bar, and take first as Arnolds Strongest Man 2018. - Coached various bikini competitors, NBA, NFL, MLB, UFC, etc - Worked with Brian Shaw's diet and helped him achieve second place at Arnolds Strongest Man 2018. - Coaching Larry Wheels (aesthetic and powerful beast) and Dan Green. - Has trained with almost every guru in the business, directly or indirectly. - Former bodybuilding and powerlifting competitor. - Squats in the 800lbs+ at 50+ years of age. Why I Chose Charles Poliquin: One of the first world renown and truly experienced strength coaches of the modern era. \"Research catches up to Charles,\" has been said about his bleeding edge yet common sense approach to training. While considered by a few to be the king of psuedo-science, the ironic part of this claim is that from all my note-taking from the past 6 months --from books on Green Berets to interviews with the Mountain to 3-hour long seminars with various teachers-- Charles cites his sources and explains the history of what he's talking about more often than any other individual or source I've been reading, watching, or listening. - One of the best and most distinguished strength coaches in the world. - Trained various Special Operations (Seal Team 6, SAS included) - Coached the US womens team to win their first Olympic gold in history, and defeated Japan in their 20 year reign. - 38+ years of Olympian training across 23 different sports, went to 3 different Olympics as a coach. Also have trained various high-level professional athletes and coaches in the military, Crossfit, NFL, NHL, MLB, etc. - Researches studies from as far back as 1890's - Ability to recall information, facts, research papers, all to the date, location of study, and to the author/researcher, a skill second to no other fitness expert (reminds me of the level of expert recall Robert McNaramara displays in the documentary \"Fog of War\"). - Lectures around the world with book authors like Jay Papasanas, Ed Coan, and world renown athletes like Dmitry Klokov. - Always ahead of the curve (attributed as first in the US to recommend BCAAs, fish oils, German Volume training, tempo training, cluster training, neuro transmitter profile training, etc). - Stan Efferding, Matt Wenning, and Mark Bell have all implemented information from Charles into their personal training, and how they train clients, and all speak highly of him. - Has huge biceps and abs for an old man. Why I Chose Matt Wenning: I chose Matt because of his personal and professional achievements. Hired to train various Special Operations for the military and is the first to be implemented at a large scale. His methods have reduced injury rates across the board for fire, police, and military (and thus saved money for those organizations), and is a master of training and preventing overtraining. - Multiple records in the squat alone, including a 1196lb squat. - Broke 4 world records; second highest RAW at 208 class with 2204lb total. - Works with thousands of US military, including various Ranger regiments, 4th Infantry, and paratroopers out of Bragg. - Developed Mountain Warrior Athlete program out of Ft. Carson. - Clients include NFL, US Special Operations, law enforcement, fireman, professional athletes, universities, elderly (difficult to train and yield safe results) and kids with disabilities - His training with first responders and military has reduced site budgets significantly, due to decreased injuries and insurance claims. - Attended university in Indiana where NASA funded the strength and conditioning programs and recruited top-tier professors. - Top ten in the world for almost two decades with no major injuries (rare in the strength industry) - Masters degree in sports biomechanics under Dr. Kramer - Trained closely and mentored by various powerlifting legends like Louie Simmons, Ed Coan from his teen years, and was one of the youngest to squat 900lbs Notes on Notetaking: Each section of notes will include everything I felt was noteworthy, even if it's repeated 3 times in 3 other podcasts. I did this as people will cherry-pick which seminars they want notes on, and I don't want them to miss out on key information just because I wrote it down elsewhere. Also, rehearing the same things over and over again just works as positive reinforcement and mentally conditioning good habits. Can't hurt to hear solid advice over and over again. Additionally, these notes are taken as a stream-of-thought process and later revised and edited, so they may seem short, fluid, or lacking in information. I reread the notes a few times and tried to expand and clean up, but I will have missed some parts.

Doesn't breakdown muscle, still helps with fat loss. - If on a limited calorie diet, then the caloric limit will yield results in body composition and performance based on the choice of foods, not just calorie choice. Choose nutrient rich foods like steak. - 3oz of OJ or milk a couple times a day: liver and thyroid stimulus for metabolism. - Long cardio has high water demand. Sends wrong message to body: body holds on to fat to endure the longer workload. Also, body thinks heavy muscle is bad, gets rid of it. - Stan noticed how joggers carry fat. Body holds on to fat for fuel, gets rid of muscle. Body responds to stimulus you provide. - Still need to develop cardio. Recommends HIIT under load: improves cardio while stimulating muscle. Weighted exercises with higher reps (why Matt and Stan recommend loaded exercise under distance). Performing 20 rep sets, or 30 second rest between weighted carries, running stairs (all concentric loading), pushing prowlers, 30s sprint/rest on recumbent bike (ten mins) are all great examples of cardio development. - \"How do you talk people into losing weight by lifting weights?\" Cites his 60 year old women who lift weights and are lean. They don't have prior exercise experience, and they're stronger than most men. - How much weight you have on you is 80% diet. Cardio isn't what gets bikini and stage competitors lean, it's they eat better. \"Don't want to be huge? Don't eat huge.\" - When you start training weights you start to retain water, so swelling occurs. Hypertrophy occurs, diet cleans up, everything will lean out. - \"Foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue.\" Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. - Research: Sleep loss limits fat loss. Insulin resistance goes up; blood pressure goes up; hunger goes up; cortisol (breaks down muscle tissue; decreases testosterone, effects your thyroid; etc) - Juicing and detox is completely worthless. All you can do is optimize how your body filtrates toxins, which is the liver. Best way to detox is to just not put the processed foods and oils into your body. - 10 minute walks for athletes wanting to gain weight, with caloric gain. Also female competitors in bikini, but with calorie deficit. Helps digestion and insulin resistance. - Stan trained 40-50 minutes morning, 30 mins at night. - Women tend to restrict and end of missing much needed fats and nutrients. Ability to absorb nutrients depends on using fats as a shuttle. - \"There's no black and white, there's only gray. Find out what fits you and do that\" - States foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue. Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. - If not yet deserving then stick to glutamine, amino acids, and whey. Losing body fat will make you more insulin sensitive. - Steady-state cardio will cause you to get fatter. - Restricting fats causes fat. Fats help with insulin sensitivity. - Common mistakes with trainers and female clients: not wanting to get strong. Not enough time on overload with women (don't have goals for strength). Short term goals to comply to regarding big lifts. Lean muscle tissue leads to insulin sensitivity. - Believes most women in the gym are busy, not productive - Better glute development: split squats, squats, deadlifts (all of which develop horizontal and vertical jump). TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons: There's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months. - Carbs: Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states \"you need to earn your carbs,\" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can. - Sleep: The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality. - Programming: I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. \"Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements.\" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio. - Food choice: Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. \"Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to.\" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily ( [FodMap](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/)). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day. - Warm-Up: Stretching is apparently a waste of time, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: \"brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier.\" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up. Here's the warm-up in practice with Mike O'Hearn, Stan, and Matt. - Walking: Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. \"Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients.\" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results. - Cardio: Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth and fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen. - Build the Backside: If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press. - Salt: Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium. - Post-workout drink: Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption. Edit: lot of questions about this topic specifically, so I rewatched the video. It's about the 1:25:00 of the Komplettes seminar. Didn't specify the amount of fructose and dextrose. Just says a scoop of dextrose and some OJ. I'd recommend 3oz oj since "}
