NEW OFFERINGS BY ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES AND PRACTITIONERS Meditation teacher Carol Blotter is leading a new two-year meditation training program for serious students. In the tradition of The Forest Way, \"an age-old tradition of people going into the forest to intensely practice meditation under the guidance of a teacher,\" her students follow \"a path towards spiritual insight,\" The program follows \"The Seven Concentric Circles of Spiritual Development,\" a training model developed by Carol's teacher Matthew Flickstein. According to Flickstein, spiritual development past issues; ethics; aging and practice; relationships; the three marks of existence; and surrender.\" Although the model incorporates many Buddhist teachings, Carol describes it as \"a consolidation of paths from lots of different traditions.\" The training program occurs through regular contact with Carol by phone or email, and occasional group retreats. She sends students frequent contemplations and meditation instructions via email that they can incorporate into their daily meditation practice. Although Carol provides guidance for her students, her \"role as the teacher in this program is to help people see when and where they are stuck, and then allow the students to learn for themselves,\" she says. During their first year, students focus on \"unresolved issues in the past, our behavior in the present, and thoughts about aging, illness, and death - in order to find issues that are psychologically blocking you. To know who you really are, these blockages need to remove themselves,\" Carol explains. \"Blockages are like a glass ceiling that people can't get through. So, the first part [of the training program] is like scratching the surface with sandpaper to see what comes up,\" she says. Then in the second year, students continue working through the \"Seven Concentric Circles\" with a focus on practicing insight meditation and recognizing the non-dual nature (or oneness) of ourselves and everything else in the universe. Carol also assisted in the production and distribution of a new documentary , \"With One V oice,\" which was produced by Matthew Flickstein and directed by Eric Temple. The film includes interviews with clergy and mystics from fourteen of the world's spiritual traditions in order to highlight \"the unifying truth that transcends all religions,\" according to the film' s description. View the trailer for \"With One V oice\" online, at http://www.withonevoicedocumentary.org \"The reason I got involved in the movie is - all spiritual traditions point to the same truth. There are different paths, but they are all going to the same place. As a kid, I didn't understand why people thought God was a different person, so when I was asked to help with the film, I was excited,\" Carol says. Carol has been practicing insight meditation since 1989. She works through her business, Chelsea Meditation, as well as through Deep Spring Center with her teacher, Barbara Brodsky. In January, her current students will embark on their second year in the program, and she will be accepting a new set of students to begin the program.

Contact her by email, at cb.meditate@gmail.com The expansion and remodeling of Relax Station Massage Therapy has created a new, delightful and light-filled massage space in the heart of downtown Ann Arbor. Owner Eileen Bristol explains, \"we weren't really turning people away because of a lack of space,\" before the remodel. \"However, some clients found it a bit too crowded.\" Now, with more space and improved interior design, Relax Station is settling into a new phase of its history. Relax Station has become a kind of \"massage phenomenon,\" according to one knowledgeable observer. \"Eileen is doing something no one else has done. She has created a happening massage place; at any given time, 5 or 7 people are being massaged, some indoors and some outdoors. The light is pouring in, the music is on, and the cars are whizzing up Huron. It's a really sweet and relaxing scene.\" Years ago, the building on the corner of Huron and First Street was a small gas station. When Relax Station moved in, the drive-through archway became \"a mixture of a garage and a Greek temple,\" Eileen says. The space was used for outdoor massages, and the interior space was limited to what is now a semi-private back room massage area. Later, they added private table massage studios in the nearby Phoenix building. Eileen really enjoyed giving massages out in the \"Greek temple,\" which held her back from remodeling the building earlier than she did. However, now that the space is enclosed, she enjoys the \"sun-room experience\" in the front room. The expanded and remodeled building was designed by architect Robert Black. Robert Logsdon designed the What's New in the Community Ellen Livingston \"Illuminating the Era of Raw Foods.\" (See page 9.) By Jen Eberbach Ann Arbor's annual FestiFools parade (See page 10.)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 7 Continued on page 8walls and ceiling, using a textured, layered wash technique called lazure. The building's interior design was also inspired by Feng Shui and Rudolf Steiner. One of the beautiful features of the remodeled building is a travertine floor equipped with radiant floor heat. Eileen particularly likes how it creates a quiet, warm atmosphere in the \"sunroom\" space. Since the beginning, Relax Station has featured a bio-dynamic garden of perennial plants. They tore up concrete in the expansion to grow the garden along with the building. This summer, Eileen added an arbor and she thinks that she might add a water feature next. She likes growing perennials because they follow \"the cycles of life, and you get to see a lot of changes throughout the year,\" which compliments Relax Station's focus on helping people along a path towards self-care and health. The studio's downtown location brings in a lot of walk-ins including neighbors strolling by during the walkable, warm months. It also attracts people driving downtown throughout the year. \"Everybody always says, I drive by here all the time. One day, they wake up and their neck really hurts, or they can't turn their head, and that's what gets them to come in,\" Eileen observes. She has found that by offering walk-in appointments as an option to people, her therapists are more accessible, whenever clients are in pain. \"We get a lot of people in here that have never had a professional massage before, so we try to create a situation here that's accessible where everybody can feel comfortable,\" she says. Relax Station is offering a new membership program designed to encourage clients to make massage a part of their regular, monthly schedule. Instead of paying up front, like many programs, this membership automatically prepays for a one-hour massage each month. \"It's a good way to encourage people to take care of themselves. If you prepay, you know you're gonna be more likely to do it,\" she explains. Relax Station Massage Therapy is located at 300 West Huron, in downtown Ann Arbor.

Social worker Violet Martin opened Mindful Heart Counseling, her new private practice, in Pinckney, last year. After working for healthcare institutions for years, Violet wanted to move her sessions into \"the kind of space that would make people feel really comfortable - like they were sitting in somebody's living room, only better.\" After setting up a cozy interview room, the suite next door became available. She decided to transform the space into a mediation studio, which has allowed her to better incorporate mindfulness meditation practices into her counseling work.Violet has also created an original program for \"anyone dealing with issues in their relationship with food,\" she explains. The group \"Foodwise, Lifewise\" is a two-phase program, currently underway. She will be repeating the program in March, which will be open to new participants. Mindfulness meditation, which comes from the Buddhist tradition, is already being used in counseling, however, \"I wanted to do something more experiential with it,\" in order to help people \"connect to the fact that when you are eating, you're using all of your senses. We don't even look at what we are eating all of the time. We have our minds on something else - we are barely tasting it,\" Violet explains. She stresses the importance of \"recognizing the beauty in the food we eat and the miracle that this food is to you. It takes the whole cosmos to make a carrot,\" she says. By exposing people who are struggling with eating issues to \"small experiments\" that help them \"see and sense their food,\" Violet helps people become aware of their body image, their impulses, and feelings of self-loathing. Through meditation, guided imagery exercises, journaling, role-playing, other activities and one-on-one counseling sessions, whenever needed, participants in \"Foodwise Lifewise\" work towards having \"gratitude towards the body\" and finding \"self-love,\" Violet says. Visit Violet Martin online, at www.mindfulheartcounseling.com. Contact her by phone (734) 308-8360, or email her at violet@mindfulheartcounseling.com. Mindful Heart Counseling is located at 5300 East M - 36, in Pinckney. Barbara Brodsky of Deep Spring Center for Meditation and Spiritual Inquiry is leading 20 students through a two-year commitment, entitled \"Venture Fourth,\" to deepen their meditation practice. Barbara is also writing a book that records her life journey - suddenly going profoundly deaf in 1972, channeling a \"discarnate spirit,\" her experience of mediation and channeling, and the journey she is taking to heal her deafness. After going profoundly deaf, Barbara experienced the appearance of a non- physical entity in her meditation practice. \"I didn't take it casually. He began to guide me and that guidance was very clear. I asked, who are you, why are you here? I had no concept of channeling. He said, you asked for help.\" The entity identified himself as Aaron. Barbara says, \"He guided me to deepen my meditation practice.\" Barbara explains that \"Venture Fourth\" is Aaron's program. \"We're moving into a fourth density of consciousness. That's what the new age is all about. The program is geared toward doing the inner work on our own with meditation, and realizing that we are venturing forth into a higher level of consciousness,\" she explains. This higher consciousness is non-dual consciousness, which in Buddhism equates to the concept that all is one. \"It's taught in every religion - it's unity consciousness, Christ consciousness, Buddha consciousness,\" she says. Barbara has written numerous books recording what she channels from Aaron. However, she recently decided to tell the story of her life and her path toward healing in her own words - from an autobiographical perspective. The book also chronicles her experiences with John of God, who runs a healing center in Brazil. She reports that she has begun to regain a sense of sound, even though she remains profoundly deaf. She can now hear tuning fork tones and she reports that speech is coming through as static. \"A lot of this book is about letting go of our limitations,\" she explains.

Lee Schaberg has become a certified Oneness Blessing facilitator, after completing Level 1 and Level 2 training at the Oneness University, in Fiji. According to Lee, \"a blessing event consists of a chakra meditation to open and clear the energy field, the Blessing, and a short, quiet relaxation. The Blessing is given when a Blessing giver places their hands on the recipient' s head to assist in the transference of Divine energy...Nothing is coming from me, only through me,\" she writes. Lee has found that the blessing \"initiates a neurobiological shift in the brain,\" and \"allows us to deepen our relationship with ourselves, those we love, strangers and the Creator.\" Contact Lee by email, at lee.k.s@comcast.net Wu Style Tai Chi Chuan Academy of Ann Arbor has moved to 4117 Jackson Road. The academy offers classes in basic forms, advanced studies in meditation, weapons work, and martial applications. Sifu Genie Parker , the head of the martial arts school, is the first non-Chinese female disciple of Wu Style Grandmaster Kwong Yu Eddie Wu of the Wu Chuan family lineage. \"With its mirrored walls and comfortable wood-laminate floor, our new school offers a commodious space in which to learn this internal soft-style martial art.\" Call Wu Style Tai Chi Academy of Ann Arbor, at (248) 229-1060, or visit them online, at www.wustyle-annarbor.com UPCOMING EVENTS Nutrition, fitness and health expert Dr. Douglas Graham will give a two-day seminar at the Quality Inn & Suites in Livonia, on February 19th and 20th. Yoga instructor Ellen Livingston of Living Yoga studio is hosting the event. She decided to bring this national speaker and health expert to Southeastern Michigan after following his plan for natural hygiene, and participating in Dr. Graham's fasting retreats. Ellen follows Dr. Graham's suggested diet of raw foods - mostly fruit, as well as vegetables, nuts and seeds. The diet cuts out all spices, salts, oils and refined foods, leaving her with \"the natural packages that are already designed for us,\" Ellen says. She describes the raw food diet as a \"simple natural diet,\" that gives you high levels of energy and healthful balance. \"You can't improve upon a fresh papaya, because it's already a perfect recipe. You don't have to add ten things to it. We tend to have this concept that we've always got to mess with everything - the more complicated the better , the fancier the better. But the papaya is fancy already. There's billions of nutrients already working in perfect synergy inside that piece of fruit,\" Ellen says. On Friday, February 19, from 7 - 10 p.m. Dr. Graham will give a lecture-style seminar, entitled \"Your Health, Nutrition and Fitness Questions Answered.\" Then on Saturday, February 20, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Dr. Graham will lead an all-day event, entitled \"Illuminating the Era of Raw Foods,\" which will include new topics about every hour, with a raw food lunch in the middle of the day. During the event, Dr. Graham will introduce concepts related to natural hygiene, and he will focus on a range of topics including uptake, transport and delivery of nutrients, craving and satiation, optimum nutrition, how food becomes you, and health management, followed by question and answer sessions. Another aspect of Dr. Graham's natural hygiene program is fasting. Ellen explains that \"the body is a natural organism that knows how to heal itself.\" Although, during a fast, the body gets \"weak and tired, at the same time your body frees up a lot of energy. Fasting is one of the big healing tools in the natural hygiene toolbox. That's sort of nature's ultimate cure, in a way. It gives your body the maximum opportunity to spend all of its nerve ener gy healing,\" she says. According to Ellen, \"Doug would say, fasting equates with rest. That means resting on all levels - sensory levels, emotional levels, physical levels, and dietary levels. But inside there is a lot of work going on.\" Ellen also offers related classes in yoga, as well as raw food groups through her studio Living Yoga. Visit her online, at www.livingyoganow.com to find out about her offerings and register for Dr. Graham's visit, or call her at (734) 995-0875. Find out more about Dr. Douglas Graham online, at http://foodnsport.com (For more about Ellen Livingston, read about her in our article, Michigan in the Raw - The Living Foods Scene , in our Fall 2008 issue, archived on our website at: http://crazywisdom.net/upcomin/interviewpdfs/michigan in the raw.pdf) Repasts Present and Future founders Lisa Gottlieb and Jeff McCabe are using donations gathered at their weekly neighborhood breakfast salon, \"Friday Mornings @ SELMA\", to construct hoop house gardens on small farms. They also plan to construct the gardens in schools, sometime this spring. Hoop houses are enclosed greenhouse structures made of plastic and piping that are appropriate for urban agriculture, as well as rural farming. Jeff explains that this effort supports \"a campaign or pitch to everyone in this community - to grow 10% of our food that we eat here in Washtenaw County.\" Each Friday morning, Gottlieb and McCabe (who are married) invite the community over to share breakfast together. Friday Mornings @ SELMA attracts neighbors from the \"Soule-Eberwhite-Lutz-Madison-Affiliation,\" as well as many green-thinkers and foodies from all over Ann Arbor. Their house is lively and crowded on Friday mornings, and we've gotten reports that the food is bountiful and delicious, and the social scene is very fun and friendly. Sometimes as many as eighty people have been eating breakfast at the Gottlieb/McCabe household on Friday mornings! Jeff reports that he and Lisa get around 50-70% of their daily diet from food produced in the surrounding area. \"I think we as a community The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 9 Meditation teacher Carol Blotter (See page 7.) Nutrition and Health Expert Dr. Douglas Graham is coming to town. Continued on page 10can easily get to 10% - all seasons,\" he says. Jeff also explains that hoop houses work well in Michigan's cold climate and support year-round local food production. \"Instead of having this big bounty of food with squash and tomatoes in the middle of summer, with hoop houses, if you plant the right thing at the right time, you can pick something from it and eat something from it everyday of the year,\" he says. Repasts Present and Future built two hoop-houses last summer, equaling approximately 4,000 square feet of gardens. Greg Willerer is farming 1,000 square feet at his farm Brother Nature Produce, located on Rosa Parks Boulevard, in downtown Detroit. In Ann Arbor, Tomm Becker's SunSeed Farm has begun supplying food to the People's Food Co-op and Zingerman's, Jeff reports.Hoop houses also work particularly well at schools, according to Jeff. Although many schools have gardens, they are usually mostly used in the warm months, and in the summer when kids are out of school. \"Hoop houses are the key because you can really match the school year with the growing year. There can be something green going on every day of the year,\" Jeff says. Educating kids about food and how it is grown supports life-long, healthy eating habits. \"When kids eat good food, they are more likely to try different foods and have an attachment to it. If they grow it, they have the ownership of growing it themselves,\" he explains.

What started as a University of Michigan-based community event has grown over the years because of local participation, visitors from outside of our area, and support from local institutions like 826michigan and the Public Library. This year, \"we are looking to make it 50/50 in terms of the University's and the community's involvement,\" explains director Mark Tucker. The next installment of FestiFools will occur on April 11th, 2010, from 4 to 5 p.m. down Main Street, in Ann Arbor. On February 13th, \"Puppets and Pancakes\" will kick-off FestiFools' open studio days. The event is a free Valentine's Day themed breakfast, open to the public. After the kick-off party, anyone is invited to visit the studios on Saturdays and Sundays leading up to the event. Open studio days will feature workshops and assistance for people who want to create their own puppets for the parade. Visitors will also leave with a \"kit of stuff\" that will help them create their puppets, according to Mark. The public is also invited to visit the studio to contribute to \"assembly-line projects\" that will be featured in the parade. The suggested theme for FestiFools 2010 is Ann Arbor's Museums . Mark challenges you \"to think about an artifact or a piece of art that you'd like to set free, or take out on the road, or make fun of, or elevate, or perhaps find the person behind the artwork and make a puppet out of them,\" he suggests. Of course, this challenge is only a suggestion. \"A lot of people just deviate from our themes anyhow,\" Mark says. \"I don't know what it'll look like exactly, but I like to think we're gonna have these kinetic, 3-dimensional pieces of art or artifacts chasing people around on the street - it should be fun,\" Mark predicts.

She will visit Crazy Wisdom for a seminar and book signing, on January 9th from 2 - 4 p.m. Nicole has been studying crystals and energy healing practices for about fifteen years. \"A lot of work built up over fifteen years of [pursuing] this knowledge, which is pretty much what the book summarizes,\" she says. The book \"walks anyone through the basics of crystals, how to choose crystals, cleansing methods, programming, how they correspond with chakras and auras, and how they are used in healing,\" Nicole explains. The final chapter of the book lists 555 tips and techniques she has developed, or ganized alphabetically by subject, on \"the issues the person may be having,\" whether it be \"acne\" or their \"marriage,\" she says. At first, Nicole considered writing a book on Reiki or some other type of energy work. However, she describes crystals as \"one of my passions,\" and she was already receiving a barrage of emails and questions from people about crystals -- how to choose crystals and how to use them. She took this as a sign that people wanted the information she had to share on the subject of crystals and energy healing. Nicole's book signing and seminar will include a lecture-style introduction to the book. She will walk people through the basic, and highlight some of the more popular tips and techniques. Practical Crystal Healing: 555 Tips & Techniques is available through Nicole's website, http://www.healingartforms.com, as well as at Crazy Wisdom.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 10 Husband and wife psychiatrists, Dr. Marnie Burkman and Dr. David Leavitt, have opened Michigan Integrative Psychiatry, and will have a Grand Opening for their Aprill Wellness Center in late March. (See feature on next page.)What's New in the Community Continued from page 9NEW PRACTITIONERS AND BUSINESSES Husband and wife psychiatrists, Dr. Marnie Burkman and Dr. David Leavitt, have opened Michigan Integrative Psychiatry in Ann Arbor. Marnie and David both follow a traditional approach to psychiatry , while also integrating complimentary and alternative therapies into patients' treatment plans at the same time. \"Everyone has their own lock, and there is no magic pill, or magic answer. It's usually a combination of things,\" Marnie explains. The couple tries to \"approach each patient creatively,\" she says. As medical doctors and licensed psychiatrists, Marnie and David can proscribe medication for patients suffering from mental health issues and medical problems. However, \"both of us love using evidence-based complementary therapies - a lot of relaxation or stress reduction therapies and nutritional therapies... and having that really minimize the medication that our patients are using, and minimize the side-effects, or optimize the effect they are getting from it,\" David explains. Marnie adds that \"We have a toolkit with all of these different tools in it, and medicine is just one of those tools. It's not the only tool.\" Marnie and David employ a range of complementary and alternative therapies and strategies in their work with patients. Their work involves coaching sessions with patients, and psychotherapy is an integral part of their work. They also run a series of screenings and lab tests to look for nutritional deficiencies or other physical imbalances that could be contributing to or causing emotional and mental imbalances. They each also counsel their patients on nutrition and diet, by identifying and recommending diet plans and natural dietary supplements that will increase the body's natural balance. Marnie explains that she has a particular interest in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which she describes as \"a body-centered therapy\" that \"accesses different parts of the body to unblock trauma.\" She also recently received certification in medical acupuncture to help her patients relax or deal with pain, and deal with mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder. David highlights their use of HeartMATH, a system of biofeedback that \"looks at how responsive the heart beat is, which is one of the critical measures of someone's well-being.\" Marnie adds that HeartMATH is a particularly useful tool in their toolkit because \"it's something patients can do on their own, at home, to regulate their anxiety.\" In addition, both doctors use guided imagery and mindfulness meditation in their work with patients. David says that one of his favorite therapies is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which he describes as \"a form of cognitive therapy that allows people to recognize their present state and help learn how emotions and feelings change from moment to moment. It can help people feel a sense of strength and equilibrium,\" he says. Marnie and David practice from two locations, the Parkway Center , and a new business, The Aprill Wellness Center, which they have just built on Aprill Drive, off of Jackson Avenue in Ann Arbor. Michigan Integrative Psychiatry will share the space with complementary and holistic practitioners, who are working in a range of modalities. There will be a Grand Opening party on Sunday, March 28th that will feature sessions with practitioners, food cooked in the center's kitchen, and an art show. Marnie would like to incorporate art and music into the space, and she envisions it as \"a venue. It will be a vibrant, dynamic space,\" she says.

Naturopathic Doctor Mary Light has opened a licensed college for the study of naturopathic medicine in Ann Arbor, the Naturopathic School of Ann Arbor. Eighteen students began their studies last fall, most of whom are pursuing a three-year program to become naturopathic physicians. Mary has been an established healthcare provider, and she has been in private practice for years. However, the school is a unique, new, local institution, for anyone seeking education in natural medicine. The next school year starts in the fall of 2010, and Mary is accepting inquiries from potential students now. So far, her current set of students, who are embarking on the second half of their first year of courses in February \"are an inspired, diverse group of students,\" and many of them are taking advantage of lodging available on the property, according to Mary. In their first year, students \"are getting a good orientation and good foundation for what natural medicine really means,\" through their assignments and study. After Winter break, courses will \"lay the ground work for many topics, like diet and dietary healing, bodywork and natural therapeutics. In the second year, \"They'll start seeing each other as case histories and eventually branching out into student clinician work,\" Mary explains. \"Right now they are working a lot with their own process, and The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 11 Yoga instructor Shannon Walter is offering workshops on Ayurveda. (See next page.) Continued on page 12 Eileen Bristol's Relax Station has hit on a really winning formula: let people drop in for a massage whenever they want to! (See page 7.) Photo by Cristo L. Bowers, Imagistthen when they start as second year students, they'll start working with each other's processes. In the final year of the program, students will gain clinical experience working with the general public in a mentored situation, according to Mary. She hopes to add a medicinal herbalist certification to the curriculum in 2012, which would be an option for students to continue their studies after they graduate from the three-year program. Faculty and staff include new addition Chetna Desai, a physical therapist and naturopath in private practice, Shiatsu bodyworker and nutritional counselor Milagros Paredes, medicinal herbalist Michelle Medley, community herbalist, traditional healer and wild edibles expert Rowena Conahan, dance and therapeutic movement expert Stephanie Cohen, medicinal herbalist Peggy Jones, and dental health expert Aleta Luesse. The school also offers additional modalities, like yoga and Feldenkrais. Continuing Naturopathic Education is also available for health providers, as well as individual short-term classes to those who want to try the school out for a weekend. Although Mary is enjoying the school's current location at the Rudolf Steiner House, at 1923 Geddes Avenue, \"We need a little more room already,\" she laughs. \"As we grow, we are asking ourselves where is our next building going to be? I feel like, eventually, I will have to put that out there to the community. Maybe there is a building that we can grow into, because we are certainly filling this one out.\" For more complete information about the Naturopathic School of Ann Arbor and all of their courses and offerings, visit them online, at www.naturopathiccollegeofannarbor.net.

She is now offering workshops for groups and one-on-one informational sessions with individuals who want to learn \"tip and tricks\" for how to incorporate Ayurvedic practices into their everyday lifestyle. Although Ayurveda is used as a medical practice in a clinical setting by some, \"what I do is workshops and giving people information. At this point, I'm not that interested in consulting patients. My whole purpose is to provide information to educate people about what they can do. With a few key principals, you can really bring balance to your life,\" Shannon says. Ayurveda uses a classification system based on ancient Indian knowledge of the dosha, which Shannon describes as \"structures of understanding things and the qualities they embody.\" According to tradition, a person's constitution is determined by a combination of two of five elements; ether, air, fire, water and earth. Shannon shares her knowledge of the many different principals and practices that are meant to bring individuals' constitutions into balance, including meditation and yoga, which \"allow our bodies to come to a quiet place, and then also to allow the mind to start to transcend what we call in yoga the 'monkey-mind.' When the mind is quiet, we can make big decisions.\" She also shares her knowledge about food and nutrition, good lifestyle and sleeping habits, cleansing techniques, aromatherapy, and oil massage techniques.

She became interested in the Transition Town movement after working to \"re-localize the food system, as an The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 12 What's New in the Community Continued from page 11 activist,\" she explains. After getting her certification in permaculture through Midwest Permaculture, in Illinois, she discovered the work of mathematical cosmologist Brian Swimme. \"Chrysalis Traditions is about the work of integrating the knowledge of just how difficult the situation is that we are facing - whether you are looking at it through the lens of peak oil or global climate change, global economic disruption and potential collapse, the huge amount of job loss in this country and the radical uncertainty that we are all living with,\" Claire explains. Claire hopes she can help people \"turn feelings of being challenged into a sense of possibility and opportunity,\" she says. From Claire's view, the Transition Town movement \"takes a look at the high-price we have all paid for hyper-individualism, in terms of the loss of connections and the amount of stress that has been created in our lives.\" Then, \"in order for us to make this transition into what comes next, we need to recapture and appreciate everything we've been in order to enter into the next level of complexity of human culture,\" which she describes as \"a global complexity.\" Through her business Chrysalis Traditions, she works with individuals one- on-one and hosts group events. Claire hopes to \"empower people, because they have a tremendous amount of power in their individual sphere of influence,\" according to Claire. She is planning a film series, which will feature lectures by Brian Swimme, followed by \"conversations with people about what comes up for them in watching each segment.\" She also of fers \"experiential workshops\" that incorporate exercises and group participation.

Main Street, Ann Arbor 734-665-2757 www.crazywisdom.net Bill Zirinsky: Carole, how did you come to do counseling work with gay and lesbian couples? And how long has it been? Car ole Kirby: I realize that it may seem strange, but even as a little girl, I saw through the racism, sexism, and economic privilege that was so prevalent in my Texas upbringing. So, fairly early in my adulthood, I became an activist in social justice movements. My interest in working with Lesbians and Gays was just an extension of my effort to do my part in \"righting the wrongs\" of injustice. BZ: Do you counsel gay and lesbian couples privately , in addition to doing workshops and retreats? Car ole Kirby: I have worked with Lesbian and Gay individuals and couples for 20 years, first as a straight Lesbian/Gay friendly therapist and then, after being in a ten year relationship with Lori, my partner, I even better understand the challenges and growth opportunities for Lesbians and Gays and their relationships. I am a workshop presenter of Getting the Love You Want Couple Weekends. Some years ago, I gave separate couples weekends just for Lesbian & Gay couples thinking that was the best way to meet their needs. In the past few years, I only give workshops that are open to all couples - same sex and Lesbian & Gay couples. All attendees are aware ahead of time of the inclusive nature of the workshop and it works very well. There certainly are issues for Lesbian and Gay couples that are unique to them, but for the most part, there are more similarities than differences. All the couples benefit from becoming aware of the universal nature of the challenges that couples face and that they are not alone. BZ: What's been most challenging to you, in recent years, about your work with gay and lesbian couples? Kirby: Since Lesbians and Gays have had to face so much prejudice and often have a lack of support from friends and family, it's hard for their relationships to endure. So, just like straight couples, they often wait too long to reach out for help making it more challenging to mend the hurts and create the mutually satisfying partnership they so desire. Another challenge is helping individuals recognize and then gradually come out of denial about their internalized self hate. My job as their therapist/coach is to help them grieve, shed shame, and recover their rightful life ener gy and place in the world. There's certainly been progress, yet homophobia and heterosexism prevail. Without the rights of equality in marriage and job protection throughout the states, it's challenging to feel equal and entitled. When only one L/G person can adopt a child, it impacts the couple and the family. \"Don't ask, don't tell\" impacts everyone, not just those in the armed services. All of these injustices add to the challenges in the therapy process. Do you find younger couples much less encumbered by not having lived in the closet to the degree as their elders, or by not having had to live with as much societal meanness and disapproval? It's delightful to work with younger couples who haven't had as many oppressive experiences, but that doesn't mean there aren't vestiges of internalized homophobia that underlie some of the relationship issues. I wish more younger couples would reach out for counseling. If they did, there would be fewer short- term relationships that only add to the skepticism. Can you describe a few of the exercises you regularly bring into your workshops for gay and lesbian couples, exercises which are framed differently from exercises you might introduce into a workshop for heterosexual couples, or a workshop for couples of all persuasions? The approach I use with L/G couples is the same as with heterosexual couples. I use the theory developed by Dr. Harville Hendrix, which is called Imago relationship therapy. A center piece of Imago is a structure for talking and listening called the intentional dialogue . Each person gets an opportunity to share his/her thoughts and feelings without interruption and be heard and better understood by his/her partner. The readers could go to my website to get more information about Imago therapy. The general issues for all couples are closeness/distance, power/control, inability to truly understand each other and accept difference, emotional/sexual intimacy, making the children their primary connection, taking energy outside the relationship, etc. Using the dialogue, helping couples really hear and understand each other , is the method I use with everyone. However, Lesbians and Gays have additional issues that \"overlay\" and \"underlay\" the general issues. For example: the complexities and on-going nature of coming out issues are challenging for couples. Another issue that creates heartache for many L/G relationships is internalized homophobia, which is often denied as being a significant factor in their relationship challenges. In all relationships, good communication is a key issue. Can you think of some examples of communication issues that you have found to be particular to gay men or lesbian women in romantic relationships? I don't think couples have communication issues per se, but rather issues connected to childhood hurts, disappointments, and insecure attachments that they bring to the relationship hoping to have a more positive outcome. They aren't aware and don't understand the impact of these underlying issues. Couples do need to learn some new ways to talk, listen, and understand each other . I help them develop the discipline and patience that it takes to be able to dif ferentiate, to hold onto his/herself while truly allowing a partner's reality to come forth. By so doing, both individuals in the coupleship get to show up. Without deeper understanding and compassion for each other, they will be stuck in a power struggle and eventually have a lifeless, unhappy relationship. Each individual is unique. I know it's hard to generalize. Even so, can you think of a particular aspect of gay men partnering which comes up, again and again, in your work? And what about a particular aspect of lesbian partnering which is a recurrent theme? I have more experience with Lesbian partnering as women are more apt to seek therapy. Given that Lesbians are socialized as young girls and then as young women, it's hard for them to differentiate and deal with difference and conflict. They often suffer from \"the tyranny of the nice and kind\", Carol Gilligan's term for women in general, and it's certainly applicable for Lesbians. For this reason, some describe Lesbian couples as being \"enmeshed\" or \"merged\". Helping Lesbian couples break out of symbiosis into comfortable differentiation is a recurrent theme. It is recurrent theme for all couples; however, \"merging\" seems more prominent in Lesbian couples. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 14 Couples Therapist Carole Kirby, LMSW Questions for Therapist Carole Kirby on Counseling Gay and Lesbian Couples Photo by Lori FithianThe socialization of males in our patriarchal culture cuts boys and men of f from certain emotional feelings and encourages competition. The result is often discomfort with the expression of feelings, needs, and desires, all of which are key aspects of emotional intimacy . Gay men often suffer even more intensely with homophobia, as the culture is more tolerant of two women being together than two men. It's another element of sexism. If a young boy was taunted and bullied because he didn't fit the male model of what a boy should be, then he brings that deep hurt into the relationship. All of these things that are specific to Gay boys and men are the extra challenges that Gay couples work with in therapy . Issues around sexuality, desire discrepancy, pornography, and affairs are issues that often come up in therapy with all kinds of couples. Sexuality outside the relationship is more common with Gay males; often times it's consensual. In my experience, I have found that it undermines the intimacy of connection even when consensual, What do you love most about working with gay and lesbian couples; what is most satisfying? One of my long time goals has been to help folks (that includes me) create safe, loving relationships. I'm particularly well placed and knowledgeable about heterosexual privilege given that I have lived heterosexually for most of my life. I also now have ten years experience in a Lesbian relationship. I know what it is like not to feel comfortable walking down the street hand-in-hand with my partner. As I mentioned earlier, at the core of my being is the desire for social justice, so counseling Gay and Lesbian individuals and couples is my contribution to one of the changes that need to happen in our culture. I want folks to be able to love whom they choose and love well. I enjoy helping all couples and find it particularly gratifying to help Lesbian and Gay couples believe in their capacity to love and be loved. They deserve my support, advocacy, and love! Anything else you'd like to share, or add?Gay and Lesbians need allies in obtaining their rights and their rightful place in society . I hope the readers will support the legal right for Gay and Lesbians to marry , the right for two parent adoption, the repeal of \"Don't ask, don't tell,\" in the armed services, and for protection in job discrimination. Naturally, I hope Gay and Lesbians will empower themselves by doing what they can to right these wrongs. Thanks, Bill, for giving me the opportunity to share some of these thoughts. ### (Carole Kirby' s website address is: www.therapy4couples.com .

On one side were the Beasts and on the other were the People. The line grew so deep and so wide that neither side could be near the other again. But at the very last moment, Dog jumped over, to remain forever at Man' s side. Lakota Creation Story What a wonderful idea, that even though we as humans have often mistreated animals throughout our history even to the present time, that dog would still choose to remain by our side. This story provides some insight into a level of intelligence that animals have, for which we often don' t give them credit. In this story, it seems that Dog made a choice, and inherent in that choice is the ability to think and reason. For some, this might be a totally new way of looking at animals, but ask yourself, is it really that far -fetched an idea? How different would our lives be had Dog chosen to stay on the side of the Beasts? How lonely, and in many ways, unfulfilled would we be without the love and loyalty of our animal companions? The reality is that we choose animals to be our companions out of a need we have within ourselves. If we have a need for unconditional love and acceptance, or absolute loyalty , our choice may, of course, be a dog. How satisfied we feel when we come home from a long day at work to a welcoming bark, a wagging tail, and eyes full of admiration and love. Or how thankful we feel when the dog barks, alerting us to a suspicious or potentially dangerous presence nearby. Or perhaps for the feline lovers, to come home to the soft, but insistent mews for food (treats), water, and a gentle rub that is then rewarded with a soft purr. And what of the days when we are feeling blue or ill and the cat stays by our side. Add to these the many animals around us that brighten our days, give us hope for better weather to come or a sorrowful reminder that winter is fast approaching, and those that simply give us pleasure because of their majestic beauty and awesome strength, for which we should have a healthy respect. The feelings listed above are known as the Human-Animal Bond. This bond is an attachment we feel toward animals stemming from an emotional connection which expresses itself in forms such as; the need to be near or have animals with us, the pleasure we feel from their love, and yes, even the sense of loss we feel when they are no longer with us. All humans feel this connection to some extent, whether we have animals living in the same space with us or not. The fact is that animals, domestic or wild, are as much a part of our lives as we are a part of theirs. When we allow ourselves to feel the natural bond that exists between us, we begin to realize that we have a responsibility to take care of their well-being. The animals that surround us, both in our homes and out of doors, need to be loved and cared for , looked after, honored, adored, and told they've been good or have done a good job. These all sound very similar to our own human needs, don't they? They are. We have more in common with animals than you may believe. If we just take the time to really connect with them, and move past being pet-owners, and truly become their friends and companions, we'll begin to find ways to nurture and love them the way we would ourselves. For all the needs that animals meet, it's really the least we can do in return. The first and most important thing you can do for your animals is to provide them with good quality veterinary health care. The importance of this particular piece of the human-animal bond cannot be stressed enough. Finding a good vet is as important to the health and well-being of your animal, as finding a good doctor is to your own health and well-being. Do some research on local veterinarians, go to the clinic to talk to them, make sure your animal feels comfortable with them, and you feel comfortable with the way they handle your animal. And yes, the level of trust between you, your animal, and the veterinarian should be the same as the level of trust you have with your own doctor. You wouldn't sell yourself short, so don't sell your animal short. Your veterinarian is your first line of defense when it comes to maintaining your animal's health. That care should include, at the least, shots, a general physical examination, a discussion of nutrition and diet, dental care, and ongoing health maintenance methods. Beyond veterinary care, however, there are a number of other ways to provide good care for your animal, such as: Acupuncture, the use of Homeopathy and Homeopathic therapies, and then some more esoteric Complementary Health and Healing for our Animal Companions and FriendsThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 16 We're energy beings, and people who work with energy can help bring it into line for me, for my dog, for my cat, and for anyone. Animals seem to be more open to these other modali-ties than humans because they haven't learned otherwise, so why not make them available to them?\" ~ Marliesa Back Veterinarian Dr. John Smith of Petcare Animal Clinic Setting functionality as the key factor in an animal's overall health allows Dr. John Smith to explore options with his patients. \"I don't have preconceived notions about what I'm going to do for a given patient,\" he said. \"If I think chiropractic care or acupuncture would be beneficial, that's what I recommend.\"kinds of practices like Reiki and Animal Communication. With these particular things in mind, I decided to find some people in and around the Ann Arbor area who work in these areas that I could talk to, and then pass the information along. However, keep in mind, these are not the only people in the area that practice these kinds of healing techniques. The profiles that follow are meant to give you a sampling of the options available for you and your animals. Petcare Animal Clinic Dr. John Smith, the veterinarian at Petcare, an animal clinic on Washtenaw Avenue in Ypsilanti, considers nutrition to be at least 75% of an animal's good health. \"Feeding an animal a poor or inferior food with toxins and filler type ingredients will cause the animal to develop health issues,\" he says. By the same token, if you feed them too much of a good food, they're going to develop a problem there as well. Everything else is sort of a footnote on nutrition.\" Six years ago, Dr. John Smith was diagnosed with a medical condition called Trigger Finger. \"What that means is that when someone bends their trigger finger, it becomes locked in place. The conventional treatment is surgery that must be repeated every three years.\" he explained. These were unacceptable conditions for him, yet as a veterinarian, the complete use of both of his hands were necessary. After refusing the surgical procedure, the doctor who diagnosed him with the condition told him that when he was in enough pain, he would be back. \"Not likely,\" Smith told him. Having been a vegan for more than twenty years, he knew the importance that food played in a person's overall health, and also knew that many chronic problems could be attributed to food allergies; using that knowledge, he discovered that when he cut wheat (gluten) out of his diet, the Trigger Finger was no longer a problem for him. That particular situation, according to 'Dr. John', (as he is commonly known in his office), transformed and reinvigorated his professional life. Now, he is an advocate of \"maintaining the optimum functionality of an animal\", and one of the best ways to achieve that is to give an animal proper nutrition. \"Almost any holistically oriented veterinarian is going to address nutrition. Chinese medicine, we think of it as acupuncture and herbs, is based on nutrition.\" Simply stated, nutrition is the cornerstone of good health and optimum functionality. Functionality is different for each animal. Some dogs, for example, have the function of being the family pet, while others are athletes, or are trained for service. Each of these kinds of animals must have the nutrition they require to perform their particular function. \"Most animal owners want to have their animal around for fifteen or twenty years, and through proper nutrition and disease prevention, you can do that.\" Setting functionality as the key factor in an animal's overall health allows 'Dr. John' to explore options with his patients. \"I don't have preconceived notions about what I'm going to do for a given patient,\" he said. \"If I think chiropractic care or acupuncture would be beneficial, that' s what I recommend.\" 'Dr. John' shared a brief story about a client, a Great Dane that had some disk issues. \"By conventional terms, the dog needed sur gery, but even with surgery, he stood a 50% chance of being completely paralyzed for four to six weeks afterwards. The owners decided to try something different. They knew a chiropractor who adjusted the dog one time, and he's been fine since then, and that's been two years ago.\" So there is definitely some benefit to chiropractic care for animals. There are often several different ways to treat a condition. \"The first principle of medicine is to do no harm,\" says 'Dr. John'. \"In other words, try to find the best thing that you can for your patient that will help, but also won't hurt them\". The options for animal healthcare -- whether they are conventional medicine and surgical procedures, acupuncture, chiropractic, physical therapy or hydrotherapy (especially for athletic animals and those that do agility kinds of sports), or massage and energy work -- all are like a toolbox. All options should be explored until you find the right one for your animal. \"At nearly 70 years of age, I have no plans to ever retire,\" Dr. John Smith says, \"unless Michigan State University (which is where I got my DVM in 1972), and other veterinary schools, begin teaching functional medicine. There are so many animals that are suffering because conventional veterinary medicine is 'barking up the wrong tree' when it comes to chronic disease.\" I'm sure his local clients and patients will be glad to hear this! Washtenaw Veterinary Hospital While there are several traditional medical approaches that can be used to deal with health issues, there are also many non-traditional methods that can be used to address them. Many of these approaches can and should be used in tandem, and with your veterinarian's knowledge. This is another important reason to have a solid level of trust with your veterinarian, as well as a strong level of communication. Dr. Monica Turenne, at Washtenaw Veterinary Hospital on Packard Road, received her doctorate of veterinary medicine in 1999 at Michigan State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. She explained that several years ago, she had a back problem from which she was unable to get any relief. She finally found a Doctor of Osteopathy who performed acupuncture, so she gave it a try and found out that it worked! While attending veterinary school, she had the opportunity to work with an equine acupuncturist for one week. \"That hooked me,\" she said, knowing that once she finished school and got comfortable with western medicine, this was something she wanted to pursue. And she did. She attended the Chi Institute in Reddick, Florida, and became a certified Veterinary Acupuncturist in 2005. \"It has brought me so much reward, has made me a better veterinarian, and has given me something to offer when nothing else has worked, or when owners are just interested in trying a different approach.\" \"Acupuncture is a method of restoring balance to the body. When an animal is born, they're born with a certain amount of energy, and as they age, that energy basically gets depleted because they work, their bodies are moving around, and their bodies metabolize things. So as they're doing these things, they lose energy. The only way to put the energy back is by eating foods that have energy, or by breathing.\" Dr. Turenne explained. Acupuncture and Chinese medicine are based on the balance between the Yin and the Yang. Medically speaking, Yin corresponds to cold and Yang corresponds with hot. As an animal gets older, one or the other can be depleted, thus causing an excess in one area and a lack in another . The lack of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 17 Veterinarian Dr. Monica Turenne of the Washtenaw Veterinary Hospital Dr. Turenne became a certified Veterinary Acupuncturist in 2005. \"It has brought me so much reward, has made me a better veterinarian, and has given me something to offer when nothing else has worked, or when owners are just interested in trying a different approach.\" Continued on page 18 either Yin or Yang then corresponds to physical malfunctions in the body. \"In Western Medicine,\" Monica explains, \"You could have five different dogs that all have hip dysplasia, and they would all be treated in the same manner . But in Chinese Medicine, the reason for the presence of hip dysplasia is dif ferent for each of those dogs. After conducting the Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medical exam, also known as the Tongue and Pulse exam, the underlying cause of the ailment can be discovered and treated according to the deficiency present.\" Once diagnosis is made, acupuncture can then be used by placing needles in sites that correspond to the underlying cause, thus treating the overall health issue. \"It's pretty amazing,\" Monica adds, \"because it goes beyond what Western medicine provides, which is often just merely placing a band-aid over the problem.\" Kaya, a ten year old Yellow Labrador Retriever/Husky mix, has Hip Dysplasia. Lisa Bain, Kaya's human companion, did not realize that she was in pain. The telling sign that the dog was uncomfortable was that she no longer wanted to go for walks, an activity she had previously always enjoyed. Lisa took the dog to her veterinarian to have her checked out, and explained how she was behaving. After examining Kaya, the veterinarian explained that the Hip Dysplasia had advanced and was causing the dog pain and discomfort, and was making it hard for her to perform normal activities. Lisa and the veterinarian talked and decided on a traditional method of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving medication. While Kaya seemed to experience some relief from the medication, Lisa felt as though there should have been more of an improvement. She talked to a friend who told her about getting acupuncture treatments for his dog. Lisa talked to her veterinarian about the possibilities, and he told her that she should definitely try it and see if it helps. None of the doctors at that practice are acupuncturists, so she had to go outside of that care facility to find someone who could work with Kaya. Her veterinarian was not at all upset because it was in the best interest of the health of the dog. Lisa and Kaya went to the Washtenaw Veterinary Hospital, and began acupuncture treatment with Dr. Turenne's colleague, Dr. Jennifer Wass. While Dr. Wass suggested that results may not be seen for up to a month, Lisa saw definite signs of improvement almost immediately. \"She seemed to have more energy, she wanted to go for walks again (though only for shorter distances), and she just seemed happier. I was afraid that I was going to have to put her down by the end of the summer , but now, I think she can be with us for some time yet, having a good life and not being in horrible pain.\" According to Dr. Wass, \"Kaya is a sweetie, and it really seems like we've seen her personality emerge as we've gone along. She doesn't act like an old dog anymore. She still has her lameness, and obviously still favors that leg, but if she's feeling well enough to do the things she wants to do, that's what we want.\" She explained that for Kaya, she does some points to stimulate her Chi and improve her energy, some points for pain relief in the hips, and some points to reduce anxiety. \"Lisa told me that Kaya dreams a lot, meaning she isn't always sleeping well, and that could be from anxiety.\"Another acupuncture success from the Washtenaw Veterinary Hospital is the story of Beau. Sue Remington brought Beau, her Labrador Retriever, in with two problems. \"His back feet would curl under,\" Sue explained, \"and he couldn't get them to uncurl. Also, when he walked, his back legs would cross, often times causing him to fall over.\" Dr. Turenne explained that there could be any number of reasons that Beau was having these difficulties, but it boiled down to the fact that the signal was not getting from his brain to his hind leg that he needed to uncurl the foot or uncross his legs. Sue had not taken Beau to see any kind of specialist, but instead opted for a more holistic approach first. \"After four treatments, Beau was almost completely normal,\" Monica Turenne said. \"And after five treatments he was completely normal. Now, he won't even allow you to curl his paw.\" (Dr. Turenne demonstrated, and sure enough, Beau would have none of that.) For those who are concerned about the pain factor with the acupuncture needles, Dr. Wass explained that there is very little pain involved. \"There may be points that are uncomfortable, especially in the areas where an animal is experiencing pain, but because the needles are so small, very little (if any) actual pain is felt.\" Kaya tends to be more sensitive with acupuncture points in her hip area, and Beau is not too fond of the points between his toes, but they do tolerate them. So, how exactly does acupuncture work to help heal and restore the health of Kaya and Beau? \"Looking at it from a more scientific standpoint,\" Monica said, \"there are three reasons why acupuncture works. First, when you place a needle into a point, you increase blood flow to that area and that promotes healing. Second, many animals, like humans, when experiencing pain will contract and tense their muscles, so the placement of the needle helps reduce muscle spasms, which in turn causes them to feel better. And then the third thing it does is release endorphins, and when you release endorphins, an animal is going to feel better. That is why many animals feel so much better when they leave, even after only one treatment, because they have that endorphin high.\" The array of animals that can experience help and relief from acupuncture is nearly limitless. Neither Monica nor Jennifer could think of an animal that could not be helped by acupuncture, although it is easier to perform on domesticated and farm animals, as well as some more exotic animals like rabbits, ferrets, and birds. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 18 Complementary Health and Healing for our Animal Companions and FriendsContinued from page 17 Veterinarian Dr. Jennifer Wass of the Washtenaw Veterinary Hospital Dr. Wass explained that for Kaya, a ten year old Yellow Labrador Retriever/Husky mix, she does some acupuncture points to stimulate her Chi and improve her energy, as well as some points for pain relief in her hips, and some points to reduce anxiety. \"Lisa told me that Kaya dreams a lot, meaning she isn't always sleeping well, and that could be from anxiety.\" Homeopathy, Craniosacral therapy and Other Modalities for Animals Judy Stone Another well established avenue that can be taken with your animals is Homeopathy, a holistic therapy that treats the underlying cause of disease and illness while addressing the whole animal on the physical, emotional, and mental levels. Its focus is to treat the symptoms that are exhibited by an animal rather than focusing on a given disease. Homeopathic therapy promotes health by strengthening internal defense mechanisms, which begins the recovery process that is ongoing with continued use of the proper remedies. The cornerstone principle behind Homeopathic medicine is the Law of Similars, meaning like cures like. A substance that produces adverse symptoms in a healthy animal will cure those same symptoms in a sick animal. Homeopathic remedies are diluted substances derived from mineral, plant, and animal sources. The medicines made from these sources are presented in either pellet or liquid form, and when administered, release the energy inherent in the original substance, thereby initiating the healing process. The trend, in general, in this country, is to take better care of ourselves. With the rising cost of healthcare and the ongoing turmoil over healthcare reform, it's becoming necessary to step outside of conventional thinking to accomplish this goal. We must become the guardians and stewards over our own bodies and health, and the same holds true for our animals. \"People are thinking differently about their own healthcare today, so why not think differently about the healthcare of their animals?\" said Judy Stone, a well-known local nutritionist who works with humans, but still has some pretty solid ideas, as well as relevant personal experience, as to how homeopathy can work very well with animals. Homeopathic remedies are much less expensive than conventional medicine and prescriptions, and the risk of side effects is greatly reduced. Healthcare for animals should be viewed in a similar fashion as human healthcare. You should use your veterinarian as a partner who will listen to you about your concerns, and work with you to achieve your healthcare goals for your animal. Judy Stone, like Dr. Smith, is an advocate of good nutrition. \"In order for the body to function well, we have to feed it properly ,\" Judy said. And this same principle applies to our animals. Healthcare costs for animals are increasing as well as human healthcare costs. There are several viable and valuable healthcare options for animals, but the first thing that should be considered is the nutritional value of the food that you feed them. Check the labels on the food to make sure that they are nutritional, and, preferably, whole ingredients. Nutritional food is the building block for overall good health. Beyond feeding your animals well, there are a variety of ways that you can maintain their health, and even treat certain conditions homeopathically, without having to run to the veterinarian for a shot or a pill. Judy found out, in an emergency situation, the power of Belladonna. One night her Sharpei, Rocky, suddenly woke from a deep sleep and began having difficulty breathing. \"It was as though he was having an asthma attack or an allergic reaction to something, but he'd never had asthma, and it was late at night and he'd been asleep for hours, so I couldn' t imagine what he might be reacting to. But, it is really quite scary to see him struggling for breath, and I wasn't sure what to do.\" Judy explained that she mentally went through her list of \"potions\" she had on hand that might be useful. \"I had never used the remedy Belladonna before, but I remembered its descriptive characteristics\u2014that it was for things that were acute, and with sudden onset.\" Since there was no doubt that Rocky' s symptoms fit both criterion, Judy got the bottle from her remedy kit and gave him a few globules, \"and literally within a couple of minutes, he was breathing normally and was sound asleep, as though nothing had happened.\" Judy shared another 'acute with sudden onset story' about using the same remedy on herself while traveling. She woke up with food poisoning one morning, a day that she needed to travel via buses and planes, activity that was definitely not conducive to food poisoning. But she took a few globules of Belladonna, and it sped up the process of expelling the toxins from her body quickly so that she could travel without needing to do anything other than to sleep it off. \"Those two incidents,\" Judy said, \"have really cemented in my brain that Belladonna can be very helpful in a variety of situations that look very different, when the symptoms come on strong and fast.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 19 Animal Lover (and Herbalist) Linda Diane Feldt and Nala, a 4-year-old Rhodesian Ridgeback \"I prefer to teach animal owners to do the work themselves, because all of these things can be easily learned.\" Continued on page 20 Photo by Liz Brauer Photography Photo by Ruth Schekter Animal Lover (and Nutritionist) Judy Stone with Coby Louis (Boxer-Siberian Husky mix) and Jessam (a Standard Poodle) \"People are thinking differently about their own healthcare today, so why not think differently about the healthcare of their animals?\" said Judy Stone, a local nutritionist who works with humans, but still has some pretty solid ideas, as well as relevant personal experience, as to how homeopathy can work very well with animals.Many illnesses can be treated homeopathically. Judy suggests using Wormwood, Garlic, and Paud'arco as an anti-parasitic treatment for animals. \"A course of these types of remedies can be used quarterly to keep the 'cooties' away.\" Turmeric is good for anti-inflammatory issues, while oil of Oregano is a good, natural antibiotic. Judy also told me the items that she keeps in her \"first aid' kit for her dogs, along with their indications: Belladonna -- as noted above, it's a good remedy for instantaneous onset of symptoms; Traumeel -- used for trauma, sprains, and ligaments; Apis -- great for bee stings. In addition: Arnica is good for trauma, both emotional and physical; Staphysagria is a good healing agent when cuts inside the body are necessary; and Milk Thistle protects and restores the liver; these two are great remedies that can be used before and after surgical procedures. Linda Diane Feldt I also spoke with Linda Diane Feldt, a highly respected holistic healer in the Ann Arbor area, who does work with Herbs, Massage, Polarity and Craniosacral therapy, primarily with humans. She has done work with animals in the past, and still does, though infrequently . \"I prefer to teach an animal owner how to do the work themselves, because all of these things can be easily learned,\" Linda Diane said. From her own experience with her dog, she suggests using St. John's Wort for animals that display fear-aggressive behavior. Tea tree Oil, a natural antibiotic, can be used for things like puncture wounds, or for healing wounds left from declawing a cat. In general, she suggests that Essential Oils are not good for use with animals because they are too strong. Bach Flower (the essence of flowers in a diluted tincture) combinations, on the other hand, make a wonderful \"rescue remedy\" for animals. In a rescue situation, an animal may experience different states of emotional trauma, so different essences are used for each different emotional state. Linda Diane has also found Cranialsacral therapy to be very beneficial to animals, especially cats. This is a gentle massage therapy that works to balance the flow of the Cranial Sacral Fluid. It is a subtle technique consisting of light touch that is relaxing to the recipient and produces positive change in tissue. It is an excellent method of releasing long lasting tension caused by accident or trauma, or simply from being forced to maintain a particular posture for an extended period of time. Cranialsacral therapy is deceptive because of its subtle nature. \"It looks like very little is actually being done, but sometimes those are the most productive kinds of healing modalities,\" says Linda Diane. (For an in-depth look at craniosacral therapy practiced on humans, see the interview in this issue with Karen Kerns.) I would like to use Judy Stone's own words, taken from her nutrition article 'Creating Your Own Health Reform' in the last issue of the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal, as a closing thought on using complementary and alternative healing modalities on animals. \"Before there were pharmaceuticals, people used herbs, homeopathic remedies, essential oils, and healthy, chemical-free, grown-close-to-home food to nourish the body, in order to restore and maintain health, and these tools still work.\" And they can work for your animals as well as they can for you.Reiki Ray Golden Further removed from conventional approaches to healthcare is the energy work of Reiki. Reiki is an ancient spiritual practice which promotes healing through the transfer of universal Ki (life-force) energy. It is also a holistic therapy which brings about healing on the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual levels. Reiki can be performed by placing the hands on or over a recipient, using either fixed hand positions or allowing intuition to guide them to where treatment is needed. And Reiki can also be performed across distances, generally using a special symbol to form a temporary connection between the practitioner and the recipient. Since Reiki spurs the natural ability of the body to heal, spontaneous or miraculous healings are not unusual occurrences. Reiki treatments can be used with the aim of maintaining well-being, and can be practiced daily in self-treatment situations. Ray Golden, a Reiki master for 17 years explained that \"because Reiki is natural and non-invasive, it is a good therapy to use for animals. Treatments are deeply relaxing and energizing and bring about a sense of well-being and harmony.\" According to Ray, Reiki is a powerful, natural, and easy to learn healing technique that can be learned by anyone. And, especially when working with animals, it is often more effective to teach the owner how to perform Reiki when health issues are chronic and terminal because the technique can then be performed on a daily basis, without the need for travel or spending extra money. Ray also explained that Reiki is not one of those kinds of healing modalities that leave you drained and exhausted after a session. \"The key is in understanding that it's not my energy that I am using, but rather I am allowing the universal life energy to flow through me and into someone else. It's not me; I'm not doing anything other than opening myself for the universe to do the work.\" \"It is not uncommon for animals to contribute their own energy toward trying to heal someone else,\" Ray said. He had both a dog and a cat, and they were frequent energy contributors during workshops and healing sessions. Animals, in general, are more accepting and loving of themselves than humans, and they want to please and help us, so it shouldn' t be surprising that they want to contribute their own positive energy to a healing endeavor. Ray was even able to help his own dog, through Reiki and his intuitive capabilities, to transition from life into death. The dog had been ill with cancer for some time, and Ray was able to understand and know that he was ready to leave this life. He used Reiki energy to help the dog be as comfortable as possible, and encouraged the dog to let him know if there was anything he needed. \"It was a very peaceful transition,\" Ray said. Animals seem to be more in tune with their bodies than humans are. \"When I work with animals, I always ask for their permission to give (when actually touching the animal) or send them positive healing ener gy,\" Ray said, and explained that an animal will basically absorb that ener gy until they've had enough. \"Often times, I've noticed, after having received energy from me for a period of time, they will get up and turn another part of their body towards me, basically asking me to now focus the ener gy on that area.\" Because animals are so in tune with their bodies, and more loving and accepting of themselves, it is so much easier for them to receive this kind of healing and positive energy, and it works very well for them.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 20 Continued from page 19 Complementary Health and Healing for our Animal Companions and Friends Photo by Goldenphotos.com Photo by Craig Calvin Pictured here: Ray Golden and his \"grand-dog\" MooseReiki Master Ray Golden leads Animal Energy Healing classes Animals seem to be more in tune with their bodies than humans are. \"When I work with animals, I always ask for their permission to give (when actually touching the animal) or send them positive healing energy,\" Ray said, and he explained that an animal will basically absorb that energy until they've had enough.Animal Communication Betsy Adams Because of their sensitivity to the physical, emotional, and even spiritual needs of humans, animals can, in fact, be seen as \"people whisperers\". Many institutions including schools, prisons, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities have employed different varieties of animals to help people of all ages, abilities, and disabilities. The unconditional love and loyalty that animals possess is an invaluable factor in the health and well being of humans. And this brings us back to the Lakota Creation Story in which Dog made a choice to remain by man's side. That choice was a form of communicating animal's desire to nurture and be nurtured by humans. Because animals do not use words the way that we do, does not mean that they cannot communicate with us. Animal Communication is the process through which impressions, thoughts, images and feelings are transmitted between animals of different species. Communication between animals and humans happens far more frequently than you might think, whether it's through a loving expression, a purr, or the actual transmission of a thought or feeling. For more than 24 years, Betsy Adams has been using her heart and thoughts to communicate with animals. Throughout those years, animals have shared with her how they work with their people, nature, Earth, and each other. \"Communicating with animals is the same to me as communicating with humans,\" Betsy said. \"My main goal is to help humans and animals share their unique experiences with one another.\" When considering domesticated animals, Betsy explained, \"we must realize that these animals have chosen to live with us, to be our companions and friends, they have also made an contract with the Creator to take care of us, and that contract says: 'I will do anything to make you happy. I will do anything to help you be happy. I am in total service, through love, to you.'\" That being the case, they have a tendency to download all of our emotions and feelings, and then try to process those things within their own bodies. Unfortunately, this can be a contributing factor to the sicknesses and ailments and behavioral habits that they develop.\" Communication with animals can sometimes be difficult for humans, because sometimes their demeanor, and even their afflictions, mirror back to us those things that we need to take care of in our own lives and bodies. She went on to explain that we need to communicate with them, verbally and through our thoughts, the love we have for them, and to let them know that it is our responsibility to take care of our 'things', that we do not want them to take on that responsibility as their own. A prayer that Betsy suggested we say over them several times throughout the day, whether they are near us or not, is: \"As of this moment, I want you to stop downloading my stuff. I will, with the help of God, heal myself. It is harder for me to watch you suffer, or feel you suffer, than it is to heal myself through the help of God.\" From this simple prayer, it becomes obvious that the relationship between animals and humans is much deeper than what we generally tend to think. This is something that can be communicated with them whenever we have a moment to do so, and it can be communicated through distance as well. Animals are so willing to love, and as humans, we are willing to receive that love; but we need to come to a place where we understand that we also need to return that love to them for their health and well-being. Betsy explained that her \"meditative method with animals is the same, whether it is domestic, wild, stock, or companion. I allow myself to enter into a place of love, a place where all that matters is love, and when I do, I welcome animals into that place to join in my meditation. And then I simply allow them to communicate their unique experiences and needs.\" Once she has an understanding of the animal's experiences and needs, she can share that knowledge with the human companion and help them to meet those needs through homeopathy, the use of flower essences, nutrition and diet, and body care. She can also help with the difficult issues of the death and dying of humans and animals, and the grief we experience surrounding those events.Gloria Keefer and Patricia Harroun, two clients with whom Betsy has worked for years, shared the experiences they and their animals have had. Gloria said: \"Betsy has been great about being able to meet with us and our animals, do an energy reading to find out what is going on with them, and then recommend things to help. She introduced us to using homeopathic remedies on our dogs as opposed to having them vaccinated. Understand, there are some things that you have to vaccinate dogs for, but you don't have to do the full complement of vaccinations that a veterinarian usually gives. So, we have been vaccinating our dogs homeopathically for years now .\" They also explained that by working with Betsy for so many years, they have learned how to do many things on their own, like knowing what homeopathic remedies are right for their animals at a given time for a certain ailment. Their current dog is a gentle-natured Rottweiler named Zena, and she is a rescue dog. Zena came to Gloria and Patricia with heartworms, though they weren' t immediately aware of it. Betsy encouraged them to use some homeopathic remedies before having Zena vaccinated, in an effort to build up her immune system, and they did. Zena now has much more strength and energy in a much shorter period of time than even the veterinarian had anticipated. \"Zena wants to go on power walks and long walks.\" Gloria said, \"She's raring to go in the morning, and on the go all day, where when we first got her all she wanted to do was sleep. I think using the Wormwood and Black Walnut to boost her immunity was a key factor in her progress and healing.\" Marliesa Back Marliesa Back is another animal communicator. After communicating with an animal, she can easily tell someone that their animal needs medical attention, or that they would appreciate some energy work, and can point them in the right direction. Marliesa enjoys teaching others how to communicate with their animals, \"It's a lot of fun, and it's exciting to see people connecting more deeply, on an energetic and psychic level, with their animals, and with other humans, because really it's the same thing. Sometimes, it's easier to communicate with animals because, although they have personalities, they do not have egos. They have 'issues' just like we do, but for some reason I believe that they accept themselves more easily than we do.\" Communication with animals is an exercise in intuitive development, which is about being in the moment and not hanging onto the past. When you hang on to issues from the past, all you do is block and weaken your own energy field, making communication difficult, if not impossible. Animal Healer and Communicator Betsy Adams and her friend, Zena, a Rottweiler saved from euthanasia on the day she was to be put down. Betsy lives with seven cats in a \"wilderness setting (close to Ann Arbor) with thousands of wild animal friends, plant friends, and spirits\". Betsy explained that her \"meditative method with animals is the same, whether it is domestic, wild, stock, or companion. I allow myself to enter into a place of love, a place where all that matters is love, and when I do, I welcome animals into that place to join in my meditation. And then I simply allow them to communicate their unique experiences and needs.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 21 Continued on page 22 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 22 Marliesa explained that we have to keep in mind that we are energy beings, humans and animals alike. As humans, we carry energy around with us. Whatever kind of energy we've picked up and experienced throughout the day, we also carry home with us, whether it is positive, negative, or perhaps even just anxious. The animals who share our living space can sense that energy when we walk through the door, and they respond to it, sometimes in some not so appropriate ways. And it is usually at this point, when animals act out inappropriately, that we see the need for change, and we generally tend to place the blame and the need for change on the animal. However, when we begin to realize that the bond that exists between our animals and ourselves goes so much deeper than the superficial owner/pet relationship, we can then communicate with them on an energetic level and try to come up with solutions to some of those behavioral issues. Some simple things that can be communicated to animals are: your daily schedule has changed and you are going to be late getting home; you're checking in to see how they are doing, and do they want or need anything? You want their perspective on having a new animal companion in the house, or what do they need to make them happier? Animals can communicate to humans why certain behavioral issues are occurring, and they can certainly communicate how they're feeling. Getting their perspective on their behavior may result in figuring out a solution. And listening to what they have to say about how they feel may help you and your veterinarian decide on a course of action to help them feel better. When asked why she would suggest complementary care for animals, Marliesa answered, \"Because they deserve it! They do so much for us. Mine really ground me, they keep me in line, they love me no matter how much of a butt-head I am; and they deserve it. To think that allopathic medicine is the only way is for me to think that being a Catholic, or a Jew, or a Protestant is the only way to God, and there's so much more, there are so many healing modalities available. Don't get me wrong, I think allopathic medicine is great; I wouldn't work in it if I didn't believe in it, but I believe there is more than just that. We're energy beings, and people who work with energy can help bring it into line for me, for my dog, for my cat, and for anyone. Animals seem to be more open to these other modalities than humans because they haven't learned otherwise, so why not make them available to them?\" Animal communication can be learned, and while it may sound easy , there is a catch. In order to truly love, care, and communicate with your animal, you have to do it from a place of love. Not just out of love for the animal, but out of love for yourself as well. True love, accepting love. The kind of love that recognizes one's issues and faults, accepts them for what they are, but then goes a step further by encouraging you to love yourself through them, until a change is realized. This kind of love exists on a deeply emotional and spiritual level, and it is not easy for humans to spend time in those realms. Throughout our lives, we are taught over and over again through different venues, to ignore the emotional self. But to really have access to our spiritual selves, requires us to sit with and acknowledge our emotional beings. Once we do this, then we can approach our animals from a place where only love exists, and can love them, care for them, and nurture them the way they deserve. From here, we can begin to see them as not just our pets, but as the friends and companions that they truly are. But at the very last moment, Dog jumped over, to remain forever by Man' s side. It is time to truly honor Dog's decision, and to reciprocate their trust and unconditional love. It may seem as though we randomly choose animals to share our living space, but really it is anything but random. We choose animals that we connect with on some level, or we choose the one that will give us that certain something that we need. We need to begin to understand that our animals have chosen us also, or have made an agreement to share their lives with us. We need to come to a point where we honor and nourish that commitment and do everything we can to maintain their health and well being, as well as our own. For all the things are animals do for us, for all the love they shower on us, it really is the least we can do for them in return. The Author's Own Story about the Human-Animal Bond I have been fortunate in many areas of my life, but one area I have been most fortunate in is my relationships with wild animals. When I was doing my undergraduate work at Kent State University, I had a biology professor that developed and ran a program called Mother Nature' s Children, that was geared toward teaching people about the things they could do to protect wildlife that were endangered, or at risk of becoming endangered. Two of the animals that she had that were part of this program were a Pennsylvania Brown Bear and a coyote, and for some reason, I really bonded with them. She would bring the animals to school with her, and I would take care of them while she was in class, and she would always tell me to make sure that I allowed them to interact with other students. So I was often seen walking through the halls and around the school grounds holding the bear's hand or carrying the coyote pup while they were young. On one occasion, I was able to babysit the bear for the day and take her to see my family. We made our rounds to my sister's and my aunt' s, and we all got to enjoy playing with and interacting with the bear. When I got her to my home that day, she was tired and needed a nap so she crawled up onto my sofa and lay herself down. I sat down on the floor beside the sofa because she wanted me close to her. She placed her paw in my hand and I held it and rubbed it as she went to sleep. After not seeing the animals for about a year, I went to visit them at my professor's home, and without thinking I walked up to Genie Bear's den Marliesa Back teaches classes on Animal Communication (She is pictured above with Lotus Blossom, an 8-year-old Japanese Chin.) Marliesa enjoys teaching others how to communicate with their animals, \"It's a lot of fun, and it's exciting to see people connecting more deeply, on an energetic and psychic level with their animals...\"Continued from page 21 Complementary Health and Healing for our Animal Companions and Friends and stuck my finger in the cage as she walked toward me. It was only as I saw her open her mouth that I had the first hint of fear. I was looking at a 6-foot tall bear that weighed around 250 pounds -- she was no longer the cute and cuddly cub that slept on my sofa, now she could do damage. Those things didn't register quickly enough in my mind, and as her mouth came down over my hand, all I could hope was that she would remember me. Amazingly, she did remember me. She took my finger in her mouth, slightly firmer than when she was a cub, and began to suck on it and trill. When I heard her trill, I knew I was still safe with her because bears trill when they are happy, safe, and content. It is similar to a cat' s purring. On that same visit, as though I hadn't been lax enough in my thinking, I also walked into the coyote' s pen unannounced. Again, I was in a potentially dangerous situation, but she came right to me, rubbed against my leg, put her paws on my chest, and then sniffed and licked my face. Still, thinking about the bond that I shared with those two animals brings tears to my eyes because it was like a magical time for me. I felt a communion with them that I have never quite experienced with another animal since then. To this day, I feel lucky for having been able to share in their lives; it' s not something that everyone gets the opportunity to experience. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 23 How to contact the animal health and healing professionals written about in this article Petcare Animal Clinic 2894 Washtenaw Avenue, Ypsilanti, MI 48197734-434-9055; www.dogdoctor.us Road, 734-971-5800; www.washtenawveterinaryhospital.com Ray Golden -- 734-663-9724; IntuitiveHealth@aol.com www.RayOGoldenReiki.com 734-649-6878; marliesa@provide.netLinda Feldt - 734-662-4902; lfeldt@umich.edu ...Without thinking I walked up to Genie Bear's den and stuck my finger in the cage as she walked toward me.

By Sarah Rigg Depot Town is home to an innovative new storefront, the Clean Energy Outlet. The outlet, which opened in summer of 2009, offers a one-stop shop for products, classes and services related to ener gy efficiency. The Outlet is also a more public face for the Clean Energy Coalition, which started as a federally funded \"Clean Cities\" program in Ann Arbor City Hall. Over several years, the CEC grew to become an independent nonprofit headquartered in a fourth-floor office on Pearl Street. The CEC continued to grow from a one-man operation, headed by Director Sean Read, to a larger operation with six full-time employees. When Reed looked for a new office space to accommodate the expanding team, he found what Outlet Project Manager Deb Heed calls \"a lovely space\" in Depot Town. Until recently, the main focus of the CEC has been major public projects, such as clean transportation and biofuel infrastructure and energy efficiency in commercial buildings. However, the new location sparked the idea for a retail space and more public interaction for the organization. Heed started volunteering for the CEC in February of 2009 and later was hired as an employee. She said she had the opportunity to get involved in a variety of projects, but the one that jumped out at her was the idea of the storefront. The retail space on the street level would allow the CEC staff to interact more directly with the public and help the average homeowner or apartment-dweller. \"We had a vision of giving a new public face to our nonprofit and providing more direct education opportunities,\" Heed said. Heed said that area residents who have attended the Outlet's last few classes say they're grateful to have a place to go for all things ener gy efficient. \"We're a one-stop shop for energy efficient products and advice,\" she said. Instead of digging through all the sections in a hardware store to find what they want, customers know that all the Outlet's products are energy-efficient. \"And a lot of products we offer you won't even find in hardware stores,\" Heed added. Some of those products include energy efficient light bulbs in a variety of shapes and wattages, inflatable \"chimney pillows\" which stop heat loss and drafts through chimneys, strips that shut off power to peripherals when they're not being used and backpacks that operate as solar energy chargers for cell phones or other small devices.While the Outlet isn't able to offer large home appliances, the staff will counsel homeowners on how to do research on energy-efficient refrigerators and washers. CEC staff can also help them find appliance dealers who are knowledgeable about energy-efficient appliances. In addition to products, the store offer also offers energy audit services. Through these audits, homeowners can see where they're losing heat and energy and what improvements could be made. Heed said that making small improvements not only makes a home more efficient but can make it more comfortable, for example by making a home less expensive to heat and eliminating drafts. As of October, the Outlet began offering classes, too, both for business owners and for the general public. Classes are usually held on Wednesday evenings or Saturday mornings. Topics for the general public have included green remodeling and green investing. Classes for owners of commercial buildings have focused on ways to lower utility bills and renewable energy systems for commercial buildings. Another class was targeted at first-time homebuyers, and the CEC brought in what Heed called an \"Eco-broker.\" \"The class talked about what to look for in terms of efficiency\" when buying a home, she said. \"That's part of the equation when buying a house as much as how old the appliances are or how many bedrooms it has. You'll want to know how efficient the house is, and you can ask for an energy audit to be included in the home inspection.\" An important part of the Outlet's classes and one-on-one education with customers is banishing myths about clean energy and educating the public about misconceptions they may have. Probably the most subtle but also most common misconception is that clean energy is all about alternative energy systems like solar, geothermal or wind power. \"For some people who come in, the starting point (of their questions or concerns) is the last thing they should be doing,\" Reed said. \"They're looking for renewable energy systems for their home, but they still have incandescent light bulbs and aren't turning them off.\" People often think they need to do something really big and costly to make a positive impact on the environment, but small changes are also important. A Visit to the Clean Energy Outlet An Innovative New Storefront Offers One-Stop Shopping for Energy Efficiency The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 24 Deb Heed, Project Manager for the Clean Energy Outlet, which is located at 44 Cross Street, in Ypsilanti.Photo by Sarah Rigg\"People come in looking to make a green statement or get off the grid, and they want to talk about solar panels or wind turbines,\" Heed said. \"We ask, 'What kind of energy efficiency work have you done in the home?' A lot of times, they don't know what I'm talking about.\" Heed said that energy systems are only part of clean energy and added, \"Energy efficiency products are a form of clean energy, too.\" She doesn't discourage people from installing solar panels if they're interested, but she said those large projects should come last, after other smaller changes are made.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 25 Myths and Misconceptions about Clean Energy,Addressed by the CEC staff: Myth: Clean and renewable energy is just an issue for liberals.Response: \"The CEC is nonpartisan,\" CEC Project Manager Deb Heed says. \"We don't promote one party or another \u2014 we promote clean energy. From our perspective, clean energy creates independent communities. In my time working at the Outlet, I've seen lots of people from lots of different political stripes. There are a lot of different reasons for being interested in clean energy: reducing your carbon footprint, wanting more independence and not depending on energy companies, saving money on utility bills or wanting to make a \"green\" statement. As many people show up for our classes driving pick up trucks as driving (hybrid fuel) Priuses. Myth: Solar isn't a viable energy source in Michigan . Response: \"Solar works in Michigan, no question,\" Heed says. Heed says that installing solar cells on your roof can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and it might be hard to produce enough energy to justify the cost. However, the CEC and other organizations are working on ways to drop the \"cost of entry\" to using these technologies, and there are tax rebates and other incentives at the local and state level that can help. Other solar energy technologies are more practical, she says. For instance, a solar hot water heater may cost $5,000 to $10,000 to install, but homeowners typically see a return on investment within seven to 10 years. Myth: The best way to \"go green\" in your home is to install renewable energy systems using solar panels or a wind turbine.Response: The first step to creating an environmentally friendly home is to make it more energy efficient. Simple lower-cost projects such as updating insulation, switching to compact fluorescent lights and making sure to shut off lights and appliances when you leave home will save energy and money. Even if you ultimately opt for a large renewable energy overhaul in your home, you'll get \"more bang for your buck\" if you've made your home more energy efficient and have modified your daily habits. \"Modest upgrades and behavior changes don't cost anything,\" says CEC Director Sean Reed .\"The more efficient home or lifestyle you've created, the less need for solar panels,\" she said. \"If you get energy efficient, instead of installing three or four panels, you can buy two. The process of getting more energy efficient costs less than renewable energy investments, but it's not as sexy.\" The CEC doesn't just advise others; the staff also practices what it preaches in its new space. Heed said the CEC is working with the landlord to improve the space and make it more efficient. For instance, the office's bathroom has a low-flow toilet and a faucet aerator that conserve water. When the old furnace died, a 95 percent efficient furnace was installed, and Arbor Spray Foam donated spray foam insulation for the outer walls of the building. The staff has plans to replace the windows with more energy-efficient ones at some point in the future, as well. Currently, CEC staff is only using about half the square-footage in their office, but they have plans to expand into the rest of the space and build larger classrooms. When that expansion happens, dual-flush toilets and other energy-efficient technology will be used. \"Talking to people about this is our passion,\" Heed said. \"We lovingly call ourselves 'energy geeks.'\" ### For more information about the Clean Energy Outlet, please call 734-483-9000 or visit www.cec-mi.org/ and click on the \"Energy Outlet\" logo.

I already knew about our nationally recognized LED lights program, the hybrid city buses, and the solar panels on the roof of the farmers market, but I hadn' t put much thought into where these initiatives began. In search of information about the Energy Commission, I was put in touch with Andrew Brix, the city's Energy Programs Manager. Andrew studied at the University of Michigan, where he received a B.A. in Economics in 2003 and a Master in Urban Planning in 2006. He has been working in the city's Energy Office since 2004, and officially became Energy Programs Manager in January 2009. Below is a portion of an ongoing conversation Andrew and I had that began on a cold and rainy October day at Cafe Verde. Andrew, what led you to pursue work at the Energy Office?In school, when I was studying economics and later urban planning, I was always looking for that underlying fundamental something that caused the world to behave the way it does and eventually decided it had something to do with energy. The reality is that energy is just one way of looking at our challenges as a society, but it's where my brain got stuck somehow. What are some of your responsibilities as the Energy Programs Manager? My basic responsibility is simply to help the city save money by using less energy and purchasing energy more intelligently\u2014which is a good thing to be doing, but maybe not as important in the long run as meeting City Council' s goals for renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions reductions. We're trying to get to 30% renewable energy use in government operations by the end of 2010; 20% renewable energy city-wide by 2015; and reduce city-wide greenhouse gas emissions 20% by 2015. In the end, it' s all about helping move Ann Arbor and Michigan toward a future of sustainable energy use. As the City's Energy Programs Manager, what is your relationship to the Energy Commission? My role as staff to the Energy Commission in essence is to get them what they need to make good recommendations on energy issues. That could be data on energy generated by the Farmers Market solar panels, how much biodiesel we used last year, or arranging guest speakers for meetings. In exchange, the city gets a lot of great ideas and direction from a very dedicated and knowledgeable group of folks. What role does the Energy Commission play in city government?The Energy Commission was formed to provide advice to City Council on energy policy, energy savings opportunities, and programs to help the community save energy. As with many commissions, there is a council representative on the Energy Commission to bring items from the commission to council, and since 2006, Mayor Hieftje has served as that council representative. There is often a lot of direct interaction between commission members and city staff on specific projects. In researching the Energy Commission, I was impressed to learn the Energy Commission was born of an Energy Steering Committee appointed in 1980, and that the city adopted an Energy Plan in 1981. In what ways do you think the city's goals for energy conservation and renewable energy have changed in the last 30 years? In many ways the goals are the same, but the climate\u2014so to speak\u2014has changed. There seems to be a sense now that this issue is not going to \"go away\" like it did before. That and the sense of urgency around climate change have been really good motivators for a lot of folks. Are there any goals laid out in the original energy plan that have been met? Absolutely, which is why we're having this conversation in the first place! The Energy Commission was actually first proposed in that original 1981 plan, as was the recommendation that the city government serve as a role model for the community, and I think the city has done a great job with that. The city has also had great success in becoming more pedestrian and bicycle friendly, and generally promoting sustainable transportation choices (thanks in part to the getDowntown program, of which the city is a partner). Ann Arbor has received both state and national recognition for its energy program. What makes our energy program more advanced than other cities? We're ahead of many cities simply by having an energy program in the first place. Beyond that, though, I think the success has largely been due to an ability to find funding for projects and see them through into implementation, as well as a willingness\u2014as with our LED streetlight program\u2014to try new technologies that haven't yet been widely adopted. Ann Arbor was designated as one of twelve Solar America Cities in 2007 by the U.S. Department of Energy (there are now 25) . Can you explain the city's role as a Solar America City? As a Solar America City, we received funding to develop a \"Solar Plan\" for Ann Arbor, and to work on implementing the plan's recommendations. The plan and the whole experience of developing it will be shared with other cities in Michigan and around the county by the Department of Energy. What are some other major initiatives currently being pursued by the Energy Commission? At the November meeting, the Energy Commission discussed a proposed anti-idling ordinance for the city, as well as the idea of a geothermal utility Powering the Future Ann Arbor Energy Programs Manager Andrew Brix \"I was always looking for that underlying something that caused the world to behave the way it does, and eventually decided it had something to do with energy.\" \"We're ahead of many cities simply by having an energy program in the first place.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 26 Photo by Jeremy Chouinarddistrict to supply downtown with renewable heating and cooling ener gy. The commission also heard a presentation from the nonprofit Clean Ener gy Coalition on the Solar Plan, recent grants for clean diesel vehicles, and a proposed community-supported energy project. My last article featured the work Transition Ann Arbor is doing to prepare the community for a low energy future. In addition to educating community members on the realities of peak oil and climate change, Transition Ann Arbor is teaching people how to adopt more sustainable practices in all areas of their lives. What are some ways the city addresses these issues with community members? The city has mostly taken a \"lead by example\" approach of demonstrating new energy-savings technologies and techniques for residents and businesses to follow. However, with new stimulus money available for energy, we are working to put together a financing program that would offer low-interest loans for property owners to make energy-saving improvements to their homes or businesses, which is very exciting! We hope, with the cooperation of the state legislature, to be up and running by next fall. Energy Commission meetings are open to the public and allow for public input. Is there a lot of public interest in the work of the Energy Commission, and if so, are there particular concerns community members often voice? Public interest varies depending on the particular issue. For instance, when the commission was discussing Argo Dam this summer, there were quite a few more audience members than usual. The rest of the time, we get everything from frustration with the poor energy efficiency of rental housing to residents thanking the Energy Commission for all the time and effort they put in to helping us move off of fossil fuels. What do you think will be the most viable renewable energy source for the city of Ann Arbor to adopt? Right now, wind and geothermal are at the top of the list. Installing geothermal heating and cooling for a building moves a major ener gy use from natural gas, which is not easy to generate renewably, to electricity, which is. And if you want to generate that electricity renewably, you can't beat the price of wind power, especially at the utility scale. Thank you Andrew, for taking the time to talk with me about the Energy Commission. ### Energy Commission meetings are held the second Tuesday of every month from 5:30-7:30 in the Washtenaw County' s Board of Commissioners meeting room at 220 N. Main St. (temporary location through 2010). They are open to the public and welcome public input. Meeting minutes, meeting recordings, and additional information are available by visiting the Energy Commission page of the City of Ann Arbor's web site (www.a2gov.org).

In search of cucumbers, red peppers, butter, oats, apples, and filtered water, the predictable and lifeless mall landscape suddenly became a destination location since we knew a large, chain grocery was located there. Once groceries were secured and we were on our way back to our retreat in the woods, I was pulled out of my \"box-store lull\" by the sight of a freestanding Radiation Oncology center at the corner of the mall, a veritable \"Jack-in-the-Box\" of cancer treatments served up like fast food. Or maybe that's with your fast food. I mean no disrespect to anyone who finds him or her self in the position of having to order from that menu. My father was one such person (he never ate fast food) and it literally killed him within days, shockingly more quickly than the cancer would have. I found that sight a symbolic, sad and frightening statement on our collective ill health, and on its growing breadth and depth. And even more disturbing is knowing that whether it's cancer or any other disease, we are encouraged to accept treatments that are sometimes as deadly as the diseases, the medical equivalent of setting off bug bombs without leaving your house. Unfortunately most of us have been scared, or dogma'ed-to-death into accepting these treatments, believing they are the only way. Fortunately we have other options; unfortunately it can be difficult to find the information because so much of the really valuable research has been forgotten, buried or \"discredited\" by those who would have us believe that giving the body what it needs to heal is dangerous stuff. There is truth, and there is official truth. Truth is, most diseases and poor health are the result of nutritional deficiencies in various states of progression, and can be healed by correcting those deficiencies. Official truth is that most diseases require drugs or surgery to get those poorly behaved machines to do what they should be doing. And somewhere in the middle is the reality that frequently the chronic use of drugs, and surgeries, can alter the body's ability to pursue its own innate healing capacities. Example: The chronic use of stomach acid-blocking medications inhibits the body's ability to properly digest and absorb nutrients. Official truth, in the last five years or so, has tipped its hat to nutrition mostly by blaming people who are overweight for their condition and any resulting health problems. It's hard not to notice that media stories about nutrition and health are always accompanied by footage of excess body fat draped and jiggling over the waistlines of unsuspecting photo subjects. I'd love to see those stories illustrated instead by cornfields over which we superimpose the amount of federal money that goes into subsidizing high fructose corn syrup. Or the small farmers who are being sued for patent violation by Monsanto because some of the big M's patented, genetically modified corn, designed to survive applications of Round-Up, has blown into their fields. And why is it people have a hard time eating healthy food? Lack of willpower? Is that it? That's what official truth tells us, sandwiched in between commercials for \"lightly\" sugar coated cereals and the probiotic yogurt with its own specially named \"bifidus regularis\", and just enough sugar to keep chronic bacteria or yeast conditions going.The twentieth century had its fair share of nutrition pioneers whose voices and research have for the most part been disregarded. Fortunately, there are dedicated souls like: Mark Anderson of Selene River Press (www.seleneriverpress.com); Sally Fallon of the Weston A. Price Foundation (www.westomaprice.org); or Andrew Saul, assistant editor of the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine (www.orthomolecular.org) and owner of the website Dr. Yourself (www.dryourself.com). They have committed themselves to reviving the work of those forgotten pioneers. Any of these sites are well worth spending at least an afternoon perusing, to journey into the clinical studies that we so often hear \"don't exist\". Over 50 years ago, in 1949, Dr. William Kaufman pioneered research into the use of Vitamin B3, also known as Niacinamide, for the treatment of arthritis documented in his book, The Common Form of Joint Dysfunction. Kaufman has a side note describing what sounds strikingly like an early description of what we now call ADHD. He writes, \"Some patients have a response to niacinamide therapy which seems to be the clinical equivalent of 'decreased running' observed in experimental animals. When these animals are deprived experimentally of certain essential nutrients they display 'excessive running' or hyperkinesis. When these deficient animals receive the essential nutrients in sufficient amounts for sufficient periods of time, there is a marked decrease in running. A (person) (sic) in this group may wonder whether his vitamin medications contain a sedative. He recalls that before vitamin therapy was instituted he had a great deal of 'energy and drive' and considered himself to be a 'very dynamic person'. Analysis of his history indicates that prior to niacinamide therapy he suffered from a type of compulsive impatience, starting many projects which he left unfinished as a new interest distracted him, returning perhaps after a lapse of time to complete the original project. Without realizing it, he was often careless and inefficient in his work, but was 'busy all the time.' \" (from Andrew Saul, The Pioneering Work of William Kaufman: Arthritis and ADHD, Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine V ol. 18, No. 1, 2003). So in Kaufman's research, he found that Niacinamide had a calming effect on what appeared to be ADHD, suggesting that a nutrient rather than a Ritalin deficiency could be at play. In that same year, 1949, Dr. Fred Klemmer wrote a landmark paper, \"Virus, Pneumonia and Vitamin C\", not an untimely topic in today's Swine Flu media extravaganza. Klemmer detailed how Vitamin C deactivated viruses and his life work included protocols for treatment of Polio, Herpes, Chicken Pox, Hepatitis, Mumps, Mono, all viral based illnesses. But his work went beyond that and he developed Vitamin C protocols for Glaucoma, Sunstroke, Diabetes, Corneal Ulcers, and more, just to give an idea of how varied the therapeutic applications of a single vitamin could be. It perhaps raises skepticism in our one drug-one disease model of health care that a single vitamin could have therapeutic value to so many varied conditions. Yet the truth (not the Official Truth) is that vitamins in our body are used in hundreds if not thousands of chemical reactions, so it makes sense that a deficiency in one or more vitamins would allow for the development of countless number of degenerative conditions. And why then wouldn't it also make sense that supplying the missing vitamins in adequate amounts would allow the body to heal itself? I was fascinated to learn recently that many billions of years ago, humans had the capacity to manufacture Vitamin C in our bodies, but we have lost that ability. Most mammals however, do manufacture it, and in quantities between 2-4 grams per day in unstressed conditions! Yet our \"official\" Minimum Daily Requirement is for 65 mg. Klemmer was using multiples of grams in his treatment protocols. According to research done by Andrew Saul, there have been only 10 alleged deaths over the last 23 years from vitamins, while according to various studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, we have over 100,000 deaths per year from drugs taken as prescribed, meaning this number doesn't include overdoses or drugs involved in other causes of death. Yet modern medicine shuns nutrient therapy in favor of toxins. And this on top of the reality that we live in an increasingly toxic world which makes it harder and harder for our bodies to function normally. One thing I hear periodically from people, is an objection to taking supplements -- \"Can't I get this from food?\" If you're wondering if you really need to take extra nutrition via supplements, ask yourself, \"Do I have all the vitality I want and suffer no compromising conditions?\" If you can answer \"yes\" on pretty much a regular basis, you're probably pretty nutritionally stoked. If not, it's highly likely you have a nutrient and not a drug deficiency. A good diet can go a long way toward correcting that, but in my experience, it's not the whole enchilada. While we're on the subject of eating, here's another really interesting study reported in 1930 by a Swiss doctor, Paul Korchakoff. He investigated white blood cell (immune) activity in people, in response to the food they ate. He found that cooked food causes an immune reaction identifiable in the blood, while raw food does not. And cooked food, if eaten with raw food, with raw food comprising at least 50% of the meal, also does not cause an immune response. Hmm, I'll have a big salad with that enchilada, please. ### \"It's hard not to notice that media stories about nutrition and health are always accompanied by footage of excess body fat draped and jiggling over the waistlines of unsuspecting photo subjects.

Shelved with Drumming music. $15.98 Music Reviews Touch the Earth cd by Joe Reilly Ann Arborite Joe Reilly came out with my favorite new cd this fall, titled Touch the Earth. A fol-low-up to his children's cd, Children of the Earth, this new music is equally forth-right, joyful, and happy in Joe Reilly's sweet, genuine way. Not pretending to be anything he isn't and entirely unpretentious, Touch the Earth is stylistically varied with Joe's authentic voice tying it all together. From folk to mild hip-hop to slightly bluegrass with other wonderful instrumentation and vocals from guest artists, Reilly uses his guitar and lyrics to create connection and awareness among people and of the earth. His mission seems to be to open your heart, to open your mind to the beauty of this planet, to open your consciousness to a greater consciousness. He writes, \"My highest hope is that the music I create will somehow help other people on their path and that it will have some meaning in their lives. I also hope to inspire joy in other people.\" For me, it seems I don't listen to much music these days as it often inspires melancholy and an un-welcome mood shift. I now drive and work mostly in silence. But I readily admit that the day I first played Reilly's demo, I let it repeat all morning and happily allowed its brightness, its silliness, its wisdom, its prayer to lift me, to lighten me. Inspired by his Catholic musical family as well as by other Buddhist teachers and communities, including Thich Nhat Hanh, Joe Reilly sings his path, his journey, and his spiritual inspiration. He honors our interconnection and a deep rever-ence for Mother Earth. As Geri Larkin, author of Plant Seed, Pull Weed, writes, \"...a Jack Johnson bodhisattva offering up the kind of energy that can carry the rest of us back into the land of happy calm.\" The Ann Arbor Observer says, \"Music with wisdom.\" I think this is only the beginning for musician and singer Joe Reilly. And I'm so happy to look forward for more.

This is a lovely, soothing classical cd from viola master John Madison. A longtime member of Jewel Heart Tibetan Buddhist Center, Madison has dedicated this cd to Gelek Rimpoche and intends to help support Jewel Heart Tibetan Learning Center with all of its proceeds. Beginning in fifth grade with violin, Madison is now princi-pal violist of the Michigan Opera Theater and extra player with the Detroit Symphony. He is also Dean of the Sphinx Pre-paratory Music Institute hosted by Wayne State University, a Saturday music program for children ages 11-18. His inspiration includes the wonderful singers Anita Baker, Leontyne Price, and Rene Flemming, and his favorite composers include Bach and Brahms. Namo Gurubyah honors this with two beautiful Bach pieces, plus varied pieces by Mascagni, Faure, and Handel. My favorite, though, is the 16th century German \"Lo How a Rose E're Blooming\".

We're in a workshop with Don Alverto Taxo, a wisdom-keeper from the Andes of Ecuador, with whom I've been studying for many years. We are following his instruction to greet and enter the garden, acknowledging the many beings who live there, and seeking to connect with them through being very present, with the five senses awake. We each consciously enter the magical space. As I walk in the garden, I remember the many times I've heard him say, \u00d2Remember, you are not the body, but that which gives life to the body! These beings have their own presentations, but they all share with you the same spark of Life.\u00d3 All the beings in nature know this, but we humans have forgotten. We think we are special, more important somehow. We've forgotten that we are a part of nature, that we're not separate. And we've forgotten that we are never alone, that we live surrounded by countless beings. Don Alverto teaches that they may have different presentations than we do\u2014of a tree, or a plant, an insect or an animal, the wind, a waterfall, a bonfire, the earth\u2014but they contain the same spark of Life, of Consciousness, that we do. Many of us have lost awareness of these fellow beings, and we don't realize that they are very aware of us, and that they wait for us to recognize them once more. We're oblivious of their constant help, and don't realize how much more help they would eagerly give if we were to grow a relationship of respect and friendship with them. The emotional and mental burdens we carry\u2014 our worry about the future and regret about the past\u2014the beings of nature know how to recycle these energies. They welcome our heavy energies as vibrational raw materials for compost, which in its turn nourishes new life. They love to play with us and take these things from us, and even more so if we consciously ask. Have you ever noticed this happening naturally - how troubles tend to vanish as you take a walk on a sunny day in a garden or woods? Have you ever wondered how it is that this magic, this lightening of your mood, this refreshing of your spirit, occurs? Now imagine if you were to enter that garden or woods - with respect and anticipation, greeting the beings that await you there, as eager to visit them, as you would be to visit a special friend or your lover. Imagine bringing a simple gift from your heart, singing or calling out your greeting, or silently expressing it in your heart, knowing that your friends will be happy to see you, knowing they will gladly take your worries and cares, gifting you with the beneficial ener gies of beauty, fragrance, color, and well-being in return. And imagine yourself open, full of wonder and gratitude at the magic of this exchange. Imagine that you can bring any question you have to these beings, and ask it, and that you can be secure in the knowing that an answer perfectly suited to you will come immediately\u2014or\u00c9in the perfect timing that will allow you to best receive it. We are sitting and sharing at the edge of the garden with Don Alverto. He tells us to again greet and enter the magical garden, this time taking a question with us. \u00d2Ask your question of the wind, or the water or a plant or stone, and see what happens.\u00d3 We each enter the garden, this time to seek the answers to our questions. My question is, \u00d2How can I get along happily with people, with all kinds of people?\u00d3 We've been living together during the workshop, and many others have also joined us to participate. I really enjoy this for the most part, but I am used to more solitude. I address my question to the water of the outdoor pool with whom I've been connecting over the recent days. Immediately I feel inspired to dive into the pool. The cool water is a pleasant shock; I glide under the water and then come up laughing, giggling, suddenly feeling very playful, buoyant, delighted. I experience water's answer to my question\u2014and understand that what I need is to bring that playful, bubbly, flowing spirit into my interactions. I express my appreciation and gratitude to the water by splashing and blowing bubbles! I feel my tendency towards seriousness dissolving. There are a few basic principles which, when practiced, help us to open this magical world of experience. There is a way of approach that makes growing friendship with the beings of nature easier, more flowing. It begins with the awareness that just as I am not my physical body, but that which gives life to my body, so the beings of nature each have their own kinds of bodies, but that which gives life to these bodies are the beings with whom we're connecting. As with any person, a feeling of respect, a looking to share, a willingness to be present and to listen, a lack of pretense\u2014all these serve us in growing intimacy with the elements, with the beings of nature. *** I recently read that cancer, at its root, is a breakdown in communication. The cancer cells separate themselves from the rest of the body, ignoring the constant cellular communication that keeps normal cells healthy and in sync with each other and the body as a whole. Then, with none of the normal checks and balances of the body to restrain them, the cancer cells multiply rapidly , hijacking all the resources they can, oblivious to their impact on the natural functions and wellbeing of the cells around them, or the body as a whole. In a similar way , we humans have cut ourselves off from communicating with nature and the earth. We've even denied that there is anything with which to communicate. We've pretended that our human affairs and comforts are the only things that matter. We've grown, multiplied, taken resources with no awareness or care for the impact on the earth, the environment or even our neighboring humans. Yet we can change direction. And though our minds and technologies certainly have an important role, perhaps it is the heart's wisdom that must lead. It' s my custom when the weather allows, to go outside first thing in the morning. My spirits always lift with the morning breeze, the songs of the bird and the early light. I have my own way of greeting the directions and the elements. One thing that I usually do is to ask for protection for the waters and to be shown if there' s something that I can do to help. More and more I've been getting simple suggestions\u2014from writing a letter, to attending a meeting or keeping a photograph of a body of water on my personal altar. The suggestions seem to come through my heart, and rather than being things I think I should do, they are things that my love of water inspire me to want to do. I've also noticed that they are things I really can do, in balance with the other realities and responsibilities of my life. I've noticed too, that as I take each simple action , my friendship with water becomes more heartfelt, more intimate.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 30 Helen Slomovits \"Remember, you are not the body, but that which gives life to the body! These beings have their own presentations, but they all share with you the same spark of Life.\"These Times of Grea T Transforma Tion We need no longer feel cut off from nature, from the other beings with whom we share this earth\u2014 whether human, plant, animal, element, or stone. We can rediscover within ourselves the desire for connection, and the awareness that we are, in truth, inextricably connected to everything and everyone in our world. Simple practices of connecting can help us. As our ability to communicate from our hearts with the lives around us returns, we can find a new path. We can stop being a cancer on the Earth, and find our way in harmony with Her . We will then naturally make the choices necessary for us to restore balance in our daily lives and in our societies. We will be able to find the solutions and make the changes necessary. We won't have to wait for Earth to speak through catastrophe to regain our connection with Her. *** According to Don Alverto, we live in times of great transformation\u2014more than the mind is capable of comprehending. What is it that can help us navigate these times with enjoyment and relative ease? When Don Alverto recently met with a group of the elders of his tradition, to decide what he would bring to share in May of 2009 with the people of the North, they decided not to speak of coming changes or likely upheavals; instead, they decided that the absolutely most valuable thing would be to share practices for increasing happiness and for learning how to live each moment in connection with the beings of nature\u2014and ourselves. For example, Don Alverto suggests that we make it a practice to bring to mind and re-enter happy memories, and to journey in our imagination to beloved places, experiencing them vividly with our five senses. Another suggested practice is to imagine and then enter the dreams of how we want our life to be, enjoying them fully and vividly in the present moment. I'm lying in the grass of the workshop garden in my favorite spot next to a white blooming peony, a budding rose bush and a fragrant mint plant. I let my mind relax, just holding the intention of connecting with a dream of how I want my life to be. My mind is soothed by a soft breeze and the warm sun. Suddenly, inside myself, I am in my own front yard at home in Michigan. It is the same\u2014and yet different. It is full of magic, or rather, I have a heightened awareness of its magic. I am vibrantly aware, and enchanted with each flower, each plant, each color, each scent. I walk with excitement to greet my many plant, bird, and insect friends there. I enjoy and admire each flower. But I am equally enchanted with the wood chips and a dusty patch of bare ground, and even the plastic plant pots seem alive. I feel alert, content, happy. I need nothing. And as I continue in this experience of being in my own yard, I realize that this is one of my dearest dreams\u2014to be awake, alive, present, having the capacity to enjoy each moment fully, to enjoy whatever is around me. Don Alverto suggests as well that we take every opportunity to connect with the beings of nature around us, and release to them the emotions and ener gies that we no longer want. I'm in Ecuador, about a week into my trip. Somehow, I'm feeling a tension within me that I just can't shake. I'm finding it harder and harder to be present in the moment, and worries about the future are taking more and more inner space. Don Alverto reminds us to ask for help from the elements. So I have that focus the next day as we travel to bathe in the hot mineral springs of a nearby volcano. The hot water from within the mountain fills a swimming pool - deliciously warm, once it has been mixed with cold water. After a while the wind picks up, and then rain pelts us harder and harder. I lift the top part of my body out of the pool to embrace the cold raindrops, the strong wind. I ask earth, air, fire, water to take my worries\u2014savoring being immersed in all four elements at once. The heaviness within me flows out into the water, is blown away by the wind. Gratitude naturally bubbles up in my heart again and again. The dark cloud I was under has moved on. Using these simple practices help us to create a climate of good feeling within ourselves. They enable us to continually maintain this wellbeing. And this inner wellbeing, in turn, makes everything easier. So when the challenges of daily life come, as they always do, and when the huge waves of the transformations of these extraordinary times of opportunity come\u2014these times long awaited by the elders, these times of the fulfillment of so many prophecies\u2014when these waves come, our responses will naturally be adequate, flowing, in harmony\u2014because we've practiced happiness, because we've grown our friendship with the elements of nature and with the beings around us.I am flying home from my time with Don Alverto when we hit some strong turbulence, the kind that leaves your stomach on the plane' s ceiling. Without thinking much about it, I recognize the presence of air and start connecting with the wind, humming and singing a love song to her. I thank her for giving me life; I appreciate her power, and remember her gentleness. I get so engrossed in the expressing, the connecting, that it' s awhile before I notice that the turbulence has passed. Instead of feeling afraid, I know that the air is my friend, and her power and vitality are my own. I am not seeking to control anything\u2014certainly not the great being that is Air. I just recognize an opportunity to connect with a friend, and the connection does take place. What might have been an experience of fear is instead a time of sweet connection. This does not happen without practice, but it is a practice full of happiness, that we can enjoy in every circumstance, in every place, in each moment. Life becomes rich, full, magical. We can move with whatever life brings us in a flowing way. The simple habits of happiness and connection that we have created for ourselves can make all the difference.\u00a9 2009 Helen Slomovits ### (Helen Slomovits can be reached at 734 665-0409.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 31 According to Don Alverto, we live in times of great transformation\u2014more than the mind is capable of comprehending. What is it that can help us navigate these times with enjoyment and relative ease? Drawing byHelen Slomovits Interviewed by Bill Zirinsky (Karen Kerns, 61, is a naturally gifted local healer of considerable reknown, though most of the reknown is sotto voce (in a very soft voice). She is a \"healer's healer\" --- like others we've occasionally interviewed over the years (Bronwen Gates and Merri Walters come easily to mind), she is not widely known by the general public and she probably would not want to be. She is trained in massage therapy, polarity therapy and craniosacral therapy. She is one of the teachers at the Polarity Center of Ann Arbor, and is involved in mentoring and training a new generation of polarity therapists and healers. Raised in Zilwaukee, Karen currently lives in Whitmore Lake, and has an office on the West Side of Ann Arbor. Karen is serious, deep, kind, perhaps brooding, and there is a raccoon-like quality to her appearance. Trying to describe her as a bodyworker and healer, the words that come to my mind are: quietude, natural, purring, heart, depths from the unknown. Karen is also a mother and grandmother, and she talks in this interview not just about her devotion to the healing arts, but also about her family life and her spiritual life. We met at her office, which is filled with personal artifacts and artwork, as well as photos of important people in her life. Her massage table is in the center of her room, and our interview began on that subject.) Bill Zirinsky: You say this massage table's been used for many things. Karen Kerns: Yes. I made it soft enough to take a nap in the afternoon. It's also been used as a construction table, a laundry table, and a playground for hide-and-seek. Bill Zirinsky: Why don't we start off with you talking about the Polarity Center having morphed into a new entity and moving to Ann Arbor. Tell me about that? Karen Kerns: Sure. The Polarity Center was located on Chase Road in Dearborn. John Bodary, founder and instructor, held classes there for about 15 years. Renee Rutz and I were trained by John at this Center. As interest in Polarity increased, John asked Renee and me to help him teach. BZ: My sense was that the Polarity Center for many years was the place in Michigan that was doing training for people interested in Polarity therapy. Is that true? Kerns: As a center, yes. However, there were and are other Polarity instructors in Michigan. Linda Diane Feldt from Ann Arbor and Sheila Cook from Lansing are two of them. John has also sponsored annual seminars featuring other Polarity Therapy instructors from the U.S. and abroad. This gives a different perspective and/or a fresh new aspect to the practice of Polarity Therapy. I will point out here that John trained with Max Heirich. BZ: That's interesting. Of course, many in the holistic community know Max well. (Editor's Note: Max Heirich is a Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan in Sociology, and has been instrumental in fostering the holistic health community in Ann Arbor over the last 35 years.) Is the Polarity Center still going on in Dearborn, or is it finished? Kerns: The building is finished. The Polarity Center, as of 2006, has become a mobile education unit. BZ: Is John Bodary still involved with it? Kerns: Yes, he's an active 80-year old teacher and mentor of Polarity Therapy. BZ: I see. It's moved now essentially to Ann Arbor, and you and Renee have shepherded its move to Ann Arbor? Kerns: Yes, in some sense. Renee and I live and work in Ann Arbor. The mailing address is now Ann Arbor. Now, we hold classes at different locations. We have held classes in Livonia and Ann Arbor. BZ: Can you explain to our readers what polarity therapy is?Kerns: Polarity therapy is an energy system working with the life force of the body which maintains all of our systems - our physical systems, our emotional system, mental system and spiritual/belief system. Polarity works to reestablish and/or maintain the harmony of the whole body. The therapeutic part consists of assisting a person in balancing his/her own systems' energy. Dr. Randolph Stone, DO, DC, ND developed Polarity Therapy incorporating information from Ayurvedic medicine, Chinese medicine, and other elements of Eastern philosophy of health, plus information from various spiritual traditions. He observed re-occurring spinal misalignments in his osteopathic/chiropractic practice. After much study, he found, in ancient writings, the repeated use of the words 'balancing energy' or balancing chi, or qi, and their spiritual implications to health. Dr. Stone realized that the energy of the body needed to be balanced before an osteopathic manipulation would hold. He then put together a collection of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 32 The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Karen Kerns on Healing, Polarity Therapy and Craniosacral Bodywork Karen Kerns \"Polarity works with electromagnetic energy. The electromagnetic energy connects with and helps move the life force along through our body.\"Photo by Linda Lawsonenergy balancing techniques, or protocols, with this accumulated information and incorporated it in his practice. For example, he had techniques for working on the liver, or the circulatory system, or a sprained ankle. He called it Polarity Therapy. There are therapeutic bodywork protocols, dietary guidelines and exercises used, as well. All are used to balance or enhance the energy flow of the body. Presence, intention and active listening are an integral part, too. Polarity Therapy is holistic. Polarity works with electromagnetic energy. The electromagnetic energy connects with and helps move the life force along through our body. This life force flow can be subdued through resistance, injury or trauma, decreasing this life force flow. This hampers optimum function. Fulcrums or balancing points form around these trauma locations, shifting our ideal state of being to a compromised state of being. Patterns of movement, behavior and beliefs can change with this new compromised state. It takes additional energy to hold these altered compromised states. These shifted states are usually subconscious choices to keep us from further perceived harm. Pain causes us to seek out help. Polarity therapy can help identify the fulcrums, liberate the health within them, and bring us back into a balanced state. BZ: Is life force energy quantifiable?Kerns: I'm sure there are people more knowledgeable in this field of measurement, but I can tell you that if you have ever had a 'burden lifted from you' --- that feeling of rejuvenation is a release of energy that used to hold a resistant pattern. This energy then goes toward physical optimum functioning, joy, gratitude and clarity of mind. This life force, I believe, is what maintains everything; that which gives life to everything. As we know from studying anatomy and energy, there is more space between molecules of bone than actual bone tissue. In that space is divine consciousness; it is particular to each one of us - the same yet uniquely ours - to manifest and create on earth. There is no other person on earth like you, nor will there be. BZ: I have been under the impression or misimpression that polarity was, to some degree, the Westernized version of Shiatsu. Is that a misimpression or distortion of that? Kerns: I do not know the theoretical basis of Shiatsu, but yes, pressure is sometimes used in Polarity Therapy. I believe many practices of energy work strive toward the same thing: a free flow of energy, and a focus of harmony and balance in the systems of the body. There are three kinds of therapeutic touch used in Polarity Therapy: Satvic, Rajasic and Tamasic. Tamasic is the most pressure related form, Rajasic is stimulating, and Satvic is soft. When cold/hard/ condensed tissue is treated, often it is with pressure, like Shiatsu. BZ: When someone is training as a polarity therapist, do they need to come to polarity work with an already existing background as either a massage therapist or a body worker, and do they need to know human anatomy and have related knowledge? Kerns: Not initially. We have had students who have never touched a body therapeutically attend our classes. But if they're serious about practicing Polarity professionally, then, yes, knowledge of anatomy is essential. Some anatomy is presented with our training. We are watching the laws that govern the practices of massage and/or polarity, and in some states, massage training is required to practice polarity therapy. Many people come to class to understand energy as their first step in thinking about ways of approaching healing other than medicine; as another way of helping themselves heal. Sometimes they only need level one or two to help them with that. BZ: And you also do cranial sacral work?Kerns: Yes, I do. I've studied both Upledger and Biodynamic Craniosacral work. BZ: Are they distinct from polarity?Kerns: Craniosacral therapy is an energy specialization that incorporates some Polarity energy principles, as do many other energy disciplines. Polarity is like a great big salad bowl that holds special ingredients. Craniosacral Therapy (CS) is a special ingredient in that bowl. Dr. Stone was also a craniosacral therapist. BZ: They are both, in a sense, parts of the ingredients of polarity?Kerns: Yes, they are in a sense, particle and wave. BZ: Say more about this.Kerns: The craniosacral system is a unique fluid respiratory system. This fluid exchange involves cranial fluid. Research has proven that this fluid travels to the ends of the nerves. Craniosacral therapists and others believe that within this fluid is the 'fluid of life'; the essence of the life force. The pumping action of this system involves mainly two bones of the body: the sphenoid and coccyx. However, all the bones of the cranium along with the connective tissue play a major role in the movement of this fluid throughout the whole body. Like Polarity, this system strives for and needs an open receptive system to operate optimally. Where the system is restricted, there is a block or fulcrum inhibiting the free flow. Within the restriction of this flow, is the solution that needs to be brought forth. It's the same or similar philosophy in polarity therapy. So the cranial system is taking polarity principles to a very precise place and focus on a particular system in the body with the intent of freeing the cranial system's resistance. I would definitely not say a polarity practitioner is an automatic, well-attuned cranial sacral therapist. But it certainly helps in CS training to have a polarity background. BZ: So then Cranial Sacral work has a more specific material touch component. When you are taught cranial sacral work, you're being taught about the flow of cerebral spinal fluids. You're being taught about an actual verifiable anatomic system that may not be central to allopathic teachings, but is its own teaching? Kerns: Yes.BZ: If I came with a headache, what would you do for me? Kerns: Certainly, I would make sure we have all the information about your medical history, accidents, and injuries that may have a role in the headaches. If your headache is moderate to severe at the time of your appointment with me, I would start at the feet, to see if I can help draw off pressure from your head. I would then assess the flow of your energy, making sure all the 'negative poles' (areas of your body that receive energies, e.g., lower jaw, pelvis, and feet.) are open. This could also allow energetic pressure to be relieved if present in your head. An assessment of the long-line energies -- energies that help the physiology function properly -- could be next. Then, I would check the cranial sacral system for mobility, motility, freedom of cranial sutures, dura constrictions and fluid flow. BZ: Whereas polarity is more esoteric, or not necessarily? Does it have as much specificity in terms of anatomical manipulations, alignments, and touches as Cranial Sacral work? Kerns: I believe that both systems are esoteric. Depending on the school of thought and a practitioner's sensitivity, both can also be practiced with a light or heavy touch. In osteopathic work or another type of CS work (other than biodynamic CS), both manipulations and esoteric touches can be used. BZ: I see. And some of those techniques and touches and alignments overlap with CS? And some of them are distinct? Kerns: Yes, correct.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 33 \"...A heart issue has a certain palpable feel. An anger issue will have a different palpable feel...As I mentioned earlier, one can learn to palpate different tissue layers. You can sense through your hands, what tissue layer you are working with.\"\"With deep relaxation in the client and proper presence, attention and intention, the life force (that is already within each of us) flows to places where it may not have been allowed to go for whatever reason.\" Continued on page 34BZ: So, over the years, when you've done Craniosacral work with me and when I've had it done by other practitioners, there's a lot of work done in the neck area, and other points around the body that you, as a CS therapist, have a very good understanding of. As a layman, I think of them as similar to acupressure points. They may not be; they may be a distinct mapping, but I think of them as somehow related to acupressure points and meridians. A separate kind of mapping of the body exists within the teaching of polarity, or not as much? Kerns: Polarity recognizes that there are different energy patterns and pathways. Polarity uses different kinds of touch to work with balancing. There are no needles used, just touch. It can be the whole hand or just a finger , depending on the focus of the work. The focus can be an injury, an organ, an energy pathway or a system. There are energy pathways or maps that are used in Polarity that are similar to Acupressure meridians and some that are not. In polarity, some pathways govern the physiology of the body, and some work with the various nervous systems of the body. How the energy of our life force comes into our personal field and is utilized by our body is also addressed in Polarity Therapy. There are very specific states of attention, presence and intention that a practitioner has in cranial sacral therapy and polarity therapy. BZ: Can you explain that - the different kinds of intention that a craniosacral therapist may have versus a polarity therapist? Kerns: Yes. I want to say there is a different focus, but the intention for optimum health is the same. Cranial Sacral work focuses on a dynamic process of Intelligence that manifests within the physical form and extends outward. This Intelligence is an invisible essence that travels in the cerebrospinal fluid. \"It is the divine or universal intention in action,\" (a quote from Franklin Sills). This Intelligence is an inherent ordering force fully aware of the dynamic functions of the body. The potency of that Intelligence generates rhythms within the fluids and tissues of the body. These rhythms are called tides. They ebb and flow like the tides of the ocean. They are palpable throughout the body. This is inherent in everyone's system. So, a Polarity practitioner may focus on the 'long line' energy pattern (as an example), that will reveal which element/chakra needs work, and a Cranial Sacral practitioner will focus on the tides. The Registered Polarity Practitioner students learn to palpate the different tissue layers of the body with attention to density, fluidity, location and texture. Both of these disciplines require a knowledge and experience of the levels of attention and focus. It is very important for both practices to be aware of boundaries and ener gy edges. This awareness and respect initiates cooperation from the client on many levels. Dynamic Stillness -- a deep sense of presence, the root of our being, and the root of creativity, is held in attention in both practices, as well. The tides focused on by a cranial sacral therapist are: A) Fluid tide; B) Mid tide; C) Long tide. Each tide represents levels of the Intelligence and expression in and around the body. With awareness of the space in and around the client, a practitioner can sense the different tides by expanding the spatial awareness sometimes to the horizon. Each tide can be palpated at different distances. A deep sense of aliveness yet relaxation can ensue. A polarity practitioner uses this same distance exercise to sense the optimum space required to reorient to the body's energies. BZ: When you're working with someone and you can help them to settle into that state or that frequency, are you creating healing for that person's system because they're getting to inhabit that state, that frequency?Kerns: With deep relaxation in the client and proper presence, attention and intention, the life force (that is already within each of us) flows to places where it may not have been allowed to go for whatever reason. In polarity, we talk about the nervous system as sympathetic, parasympathetic, social and central nervous systems. The parasympathetic nervous system is the system that settles the system as a whole to a quiet place. In that quiet and relaxed state, our systems run very well. Actually, the parasympathetic system also runs the digestion. When this nervous system is properly operating, the long and mid-tides are able to flow well also. So, if we eat our food in a nervous, very vigilant, body/mind/emotional state, we are not be able to digest our food. The parasympathetic nervous system has been overridden by the sympathetic or \"fight or flight\" nervous system. Polarity Therapy will look at it from the nervous system and balancing state. The Cranial Sacral system will look at it in terms of that state plus getting into these particular tides. It is just a different focus. BZ: So, when you're trying to teach this to a new group of first year students of polarity, how much of what you're teaching is verbal explanation of knowledge, and how much is it actual working with people on the table and letting them experiment? Kerns: It's both. From day one, we begin to teach what we call 'presence' or a state of being in which the practitioner needs to be, in order to be aware of what they're going to be holding in energetic space. Theory and table work are presented and practiced in the first class. When we get into levels 2, 3, and 4, we're teaching and refining that sense and state of awareness and intention, Karen Kerns on Healing What follows are a few selected nuggets about the healing process from the Karen Kerns interview. There is a level of resonance with someone you're working with that begins the healing process. I don't know if anyone can help anyone else unless they can do that. It's part of that presence I mentioned earlier: to somehow resonate with their humanness, in a way that the heart connects with them. Within each person lies the knowledge of how to heal. How do you help a person find it? I was taught that the body is the last part to come around to healing because it is too dense. The mental and emotional bodies are first. I don't know anymore. I think that a belief is as difficult to uncover and change and heal. We seem to wrap our whole selves around a belief and pattern our being. It seems to sustain us. Therein lies the place that needs to be healed the most. From day one, we begin to teach what we call 'presence' or a state of being in which the practitioner needs to be, in order to be aware of what they're going to be holding in energetic space. ...Choice is a very powerful part of healing. Not to be frightened of people's states of being, because as a practitioner, if you're frightened, you'll do your own survival pattern. It's difficult to hear, to listen, to respond or be in a 'present' manner. You will react instead of respond. So, oftentimes, the work that a practitioner has to do for herself is with another therapist. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 34 \"Craniosacral work focuses on a dynamic process of Intelligence that manifests within the physical form and extends outward. This Intelligence is an invisible essence that travels in the cerebrospinal fluid.\"The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Karen Kerns Continued from page 33as well as deepening the understanding of the theory that affects the techniques. The uniqueness and depth of this Polarity teaching also provides mentorship for each student. Each student, at each level, receives a one-on-one session with the presenting teacher. (There are three of us: John Bodary, Renee Rutz and me). Here's the rundown: Level 1: This introduces basic theory and techniques of Polarity Therapy, plus the introduction of presence -- the state of being of a practitioner is most essential to the learning. There are eight 4-hour classes in this level. Levels 2 & 3: These are weekend classes. There are two supervisions/weekends/per student plus more in-depth study of theory, body reading/structural analysis/introduction to diet. Each student is asked to give an assigned 15-20 minute presentation of some aspect of Polarity Therapy. There are four weekends in each level. Level 4: At this level, Modules of Professionalism are taught, documentations of sessions, plus presentations in class and in the community, and refining communication skills. Also, Modules of Treatment Options -- the use of anatomical landmark assessment techniques, sensing the different tissue layers, involution/evolution principles, assessing belief systems, trauma/resourcing assessments. Those are a few of the modules/classes taught. There are 16 weekend sessions: (two of which include a conference involving some aspect of Polarity Therapy). BZ: That gives a flavor of the training levels, Karen. Thanks! To repeat my earlier question, somebody could come into that Level 1 class and maybe not have training of any sort in bodywork? Kerns: Right.BZ: And do you try to screen the classes to select students you sense might become talented healers, or is it your belief that anybody with the proper intent can learn this material? Kerns: Anybody with the proper intent can learn this material. In my own level 3 class, one student used the Polarity Principles to develop videos of educational material, one worked only on horses, and another person took the classes to understand what was happening with her daughter receiving sessions. BZ: How does polarity, as a system working with life force, connect to, or overlap with, Reiki? Kerns: I have studied massage therapy, cranial sacral therapy, polarity and Reiki -- all three levels of Reiki. Reiki feels, to me, more like working with primary energy. There are certain symbols in Reiki similar to some of the diagrams in polarity therapy. It's more of a higher frequency, working with the energies that begin to enter the body/system. An attunement is a brief energetic initiation from Reiki teacher to student. This initiation aligns the student energetically to the primary energy frequencies of the Reiki system of healing. The educational training of Polarity is more in depth; it is anatomically and physiologically more specific. BZ: When did you start teaching polarity?Kerns: I started teaching in 1997.BZ: How did you come to begin teaching it?Kerns: John Bodary asked me ten years ago to consider teaching Polarity . I wasn't ready and felt too shy to do so at that time. He offered me his position of teaching at Irene's Myomassology Institute in Southfield, Michigan. That was my first experience of teaching -- introductory classes. I had studied with Irene Gauthier. I felt very much at home there. I'm still teaching the introductory classes there.BZ: When I first heard about you, before having met you, about 25 years ago, you were described to me as a 'gifted healer'. That wasn't your own self-description. What do you think that means to be a 'gifted healer'? Maybe that's a hard question. Kerns: That's a hard question to answer. Twenty five years ago is a long time. I'm wondering if some of those comments came from my dental hygiene practice. Getting into bodywork came from my experiences as a dental hygienist. My last five years of being a dental hygienist was the chair side and research position at the Ashley Community Dental Center. That experience taught me about fear. People from many countries, who reside or temporarily resided in Ann Arbor, often did not speak English. There was a common theme of fear of 'going to the dentist'. Communication was difficult at times. I used my eyes and a reassuring touch on the shoulder to communicate \"it'll be alright\". A reassuring touch was necessary to help alleviate uncertainty. It was that experience that led me to work with massage. There is a level of resonance with someone you're working with that begins the healing process. I don't know if anyone can help anyone else unless they can do that. It's part of that presence I mentioned earlier: to somehow resonate with their humanness, in a way that the heart connects with them. BZ: For how many years were you working as a dental hygienist?Kerns: 17\u00bd years.BZ: When, in those 17\u00bd years, did you go and get training as a massage therapist? Kerns: During my last five years of practicing dental hygiene at the Community Dental Center. I started massage training in 1981, training with Irene Gauthier. I finished the massage training in 1982. A five year gradual transition from dentistry to massage ensued. BZ: Pretty soon you must have begun doing massage work which was in the somewhat more esoteric realm...If that's not the right way to say it, in the realm of healing; not just in the realm of massage.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 35 Karen Kerns with Grandchildren \"Intuition is innate in everyone. Vigilance can fine-tune it.\" Continued on page 36Kerns: Yes: BZ: What do you think it was in you that was...Kerns: Well, it's a funny story actually. I was very blessed (still am) to have some wonderful friends that I've known now for over 30 years, on whom I practiced my massage techniques. They threatened to bronze my elbows and place them on my tombstone. That was my first hint that maybe there's another way to help release muscle tension, and not just using deep intense pressure. BZ: They were going to bronze your elbows because you were such a natural?Kerns: No, because it was sometimes a bit painful for me to release muscle tension in that way. BZ: It hurt you so much?Kerns: No, it was sometimes a bit painful for them. They'd say, \"Do you have to do that?\" I'd say, \"It's the only way I know how to do this\". I received a Polarity flyer one day in the mail. I just kept looking at it. The whole week I had it on my desk and I'd gravitate toward it. Finally , I said, \"Alright! I'll call\". So, I went for an introductory class and knew it was something that would help answer that question. There'd be another way to work with muscle tension. BZ: You're referring to the question of: why does it have to hurt so much to help someone release that tension? Kerns: Right, and are there other ways of not actually causing physical pain. Also, the understanding of what pain is, came to me: resistance to the ener gy flow, to the electromagnetic flow. With that understanding, you could find other ways of working with it. Your question about gifted healers...is a difficult one to answer for me. The desire to help is certainly a prerequisite. Respect for the circumstance, and for yourself, is important. Within each person lies the knowledge of how to heal. How do you help a person find it? BZ: In the interviews I did with up-and-coming, younger massage therapists and bodyworkers (in the Winter 2009 issue of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal), one of the questions I asked each of them was: \"Do you consider yourself a \"healer\" and what does that mean? If not, why not, and do you aspire to that?\" When people I know talk about your work, people generally regard you, in conversations I've had, as a \"healer\". I want to talk about that in terms of what it is that you're doing that's not just bodywork, not just massage, but it's about healing. Something you just said speaks to that. You said... Kerns: People know within themselves what they need to heal. They may not be conscious of it. You can help them find it. BZ: My sense of you is that you have a gift for sensing layers beneath the conscious level, and that's something you bring into your sessions with people. As you work with people's bodies and with their souls, your work is at a level that is much more than meets the eye. Kerns: Yes. When I am with someone in a therapeutic sense I sometimes get pictures in my head or sensing in my body that mirror what is going on with them. I place that information in a possibility category in my head and come back to being present with them. I may or may not mention this information to them. If I feel prompted to mention it, I do so. I respond to the information with what I know as a practitioner. Intuition is innate in everyone. Vigilance can fine-tune it. I think one can learn, if you want to, different sensations that people have, that emit from them. Different sensations that they will share without necessarily speaking about them. For example, a heart issue has a certain palpable feel. An anger issue will have a different palpable feel. As I mentioned earlier, one can learn to palpate different tissue layers. You can sense through your hands, what tissue layer you are working with. Also, one of the things that is strongly recommended, is that people (students) work on their own issues. To begin to understand what's expected, what can happen to the person you're working with. It is a journey for themselves as well as an introduction to a field of practice. It's very humbling. Students are witnessed going through their own psychological/emotional processes. A witness is very much like an externalization of your own inner soul's work witness. They're witnessed and helped by teachers and classmates. As they come out the other side of that, they understand a little bit more about what happens in healing. It's not necessarily an easy journey. I was taught that the body is the last part to come around to healing because it is too dense. The mental and emotional bodies are first. I don't know anymore. I think that a belief is as difficult to uncover and change and heal. We seem to wrap our whole selves around a belief and pattern our being. It seems to sustain us. Therein lies the place that needs to be healed the most. For example, if I experience something that is so frightening that I change my life, my way of thinking and being, I will contract on all those levels. I will narrow my consciousness, my feelings and my physical body. I will hold on tight to not re-experience that fear again. A particular physical posture results in hip pain. So, it's not your hip that's the problem. It's the belief system that holds there. Survival is paramount. What do people do or feel they need to do to survive? One of the things that helps, that I find in my practice, is to say , \"You know, you don't ever have to give up a survival behavior or posture. But you could have a choice in that posture or another one. You could have a choice. You can always go back to this one.\" So, choice is a very powerful part of healing. Not to be frightened of people' s states of being, because as a practitioner, if you're frightened, you'll do your own survival pattern. It's difficult to hear, to listen, to respond or be in a 'present' manner. You will react instead of respond. So, oftentimes, the work that a practitioner has to do for herself is with another therapist:an energy therapist or psychological therapist: \"How come I reacted in this particular manner?\" It is the practitioner's job, to take care of herself.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 36 Karen Kerns \"There are energy pathways or maps that are used in Polarity that are similar to Acupressure meridians and some that are not.\"The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Karen Kerns Continued from page 35BZ: So just as a good psychologist or psychotherapist might need to clinic about the work they're doing with a client -- to stay conscious of their own reactivity -- a bodywork healer needs to be working on his or her own reactivity so that he or she can be better able to be with a client without being afraid of the client' s issues, or feeling fear in the face of their clients. Kerns: Right. And if you've been through your own work and come out the other side, and you understand many aspects of something that's happened to you, you will wear the resolution in your aura: your external ener gy field. People will come to see you and say, \"You know, I know you know, but I don't know how I know. But I know that you know.\" That's very helpful. You don't have to talk about it; it's just there. You can do polarity with people in conversation. A good listener, a mirror so to speak, will inquire, for example: \"Tell me about your horrible day.\" Then: \"Where do you feel that in your body?\" They'll get into the physical aspect of that, and their sensations in the body, as the discussion of the day unfolds. Bringing consciousness to sensations helps dissipate the intensity of the sensation. If a person is a healer, I believe it's an attitude with commitment to the heart, a commitment to help them find their own divine connection with their problem. Probably the most difficult thing you can do is face your fear; to intend a commitment to face your fear. Whatever that is. The more you do that, the more your life force, your soul, is a part of you and the less energy you are using to keep it at bay. You're looking for more energy availability. Intention can also be in the form of prayer. You can hold someone in prayer - - whatever or whomever that prayer is -- to whatever your God or divine being. You can hold another person in the light of the Divine energy within. I think often about if we can pray for someone, we can also think ill of them and does that do the same thing in the opposite way? Does it hurt whomever we are intending harmful thought to? I assume so. We are responsible for our thoughts as well as what we say and what we do. If someone's really bugging me or I'm having a problem with someone, I try to remember what my spiritual teacher says: a) hesitate before speaking or doing; b) count back from 1,000 so your ego doesn't have control of your mind; c) if that doesn't work, imagine them receiving an award for 'the most compassionate heart'. That's helpful. It changes my imaging. I hurt myself, as well, with ill thoughts of others. BZ: Doing healing work, and being highly sensitive to the energy you're dealing with, have you found it a challenge at times to be protective of your own boundaries, and what you let in? Kerns: Yes. In one way, it says to me how we all struggle in some way. In another way, if it bugs me so much, there must be something in me that I need to work on. If I'm not careful, I'll take it home. It's my reactions that I'm looking for. Reactions have a physiological, mental and emotional quality to them. Again, just being very observant of myself about whether I shut the door or do I slam the door? Do I grab my coat off the rack, or do I take it off the rack? Do I say \"hello\" or do I say \"hi\". I'm observing my own behavior. BZ: You mentioned something about your own spiritual teaching. Do you want to say any more about that? Kerns: I met Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati in 1993 at the Parliament of World Religions. It was the 100 th year celebrating a gathering of spiritual teachers from all over the world. I actually met her on the day my mother unexpectedly died. It was also shortly after I had had surgery that revealed stage I cancer. There was something captivating about Ma. She was very real, very human, very funny and very powerful. I went to Ma's ashram a couple of months later. I was afraid of the cancer and afraid to go on with life. I went with Ma on what she would call the AIDS Walk Rounds, where she would visit people with AIDS and hand out food. She would hug them. She would talk to them and bless them and make them laugh. Members of the ashram went as well. It took 8 hours to visit all these people in clinics and hospitals, in near Sebastian, Florida. After that visit my fear subsided. Seeing people with AIDS helped me realize I could survive. I became very grateful to be alive. Ma Jaya teaches about service. Being of service to others as a way to enlightenment. If I have a client who may be stuck in their process of healing, I might suggest they find one person to help. Take a meal or help someone in some way because it helps create motion. You get off your own cycle of fear in helping someone else. As you do that, your own soul, your own spirit can come into places it's not been allowed, because you're so cycled in fear. In that way, you help yourself and you become a member of others who suffer. It's a very humbling place to be, and in humility, we open up a little more. BZ: Please tell our readers more about her.Kerns: Ma Jaya was born in Brooklyn. She has a Brooklyn accent. Her heritage is Russian/Jewish. She said Christ appeared to her and taught her how to serve. She says if you're kind, you can come to my ashram. Any religion is welcome if it preaches and teaches kindness. BZ: And where does she live now?Kerns: She lives in Sebastian, Florida. Her Ashram is called Kashi Ashram.BZ: Are there other ashrams around the country, or is she mostly in that one place? Kerns: She's mostly in that one place. She does have ashrams in Atlanta and Los Angeles. Live audio and sometimes video darshans have been presented by the ashram. People from all over the world are listening to her at the same time. It's a wonderful way of connecting, if you can't get to the ashram. BZ: Approximately how old is she?Kerns: She is 69.BZ: Does she have a website?Kerns: Yes. www.kashi.org. Jon Ellis is my spiritual advisor here in Ann Arbor. He helps me distinguish between psychological and spiritual issues. It is so helpful to have someone here, locally, with whom I can be in frequent contact. I am learning a lot, and am enjoying this method of spiritual work as well. BZ: I noticed a whole list of programs being offered by the Polarity Center. Who is teaching those? Kerns: John Bodary, Renee Rutz, me. Sometimes students or other members of the Polarity Community teach, as well. I might add here that volunteers from the Polarity community work at Holy Rosary Parish in Detroit, every other Thursday, giving free polarity sessions to Parish members or people who cannot af ford to pay for treatment. John Bodary established this practice twelve years ago. It' s still going strong today. BZ: How is it going since you moved its base of operations to Ann Arbor?Kerns: It's going well. That doesn't necessarily mean that we have a lot of students, but the students that we have are very committed to their own life' s process, as well as helping other people in their own unique way . I'm very proud to be a member of the Polarity community as well as being an instructor/practitioner. BZ: Do you have a family, kids?Kerns: Yes, I have a daughter, Shelly Kerns Benitah. She and her husband, Cyril, and their five children live in West Bloomfield. My youngest daughter, The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 37 \"She came home and said to me: 'Mom, I know that when I'm 34, I'm going to die. I just want you to know'. I asked her how she knew this? She said, 'I just know'. So, here we are.\"\"Probably the most difficult thing you can do is face your fear; to intend a commitment to face your fear. Whatever that is. The more you do that, the more your life force, your soul, is a part of you and the less energy you are using to keep it at bay.

My mother lost two daughters -- my two sisters.Kerns: Oh, my...BZ: It was very hard for her...And very hard for my wife to lose two of our children. Kerns: So sorry, Bill, for your loss. BZ: Thanks.Kerns: Jack was a prophetic kid. She would know in the morning, or the night before, what someone would say in class, or what they would wear . She predicted 9-11. She had dreams for three weeks before it happened. She was upset and agitated with dreams of planes crashing into buildings, feeling helpless to stop it. One day when she was 19, she went out driving in very slippery conditions, and hit a guard rail on an exit ramp. She came home and said to me: \"Mom, I know that when I'm 34, I'm going to die. I just want you to know .\" I asked her how she knew this. She said, \"I just know\". So, here we are. BZ: So, she was 'a sensitive'.Kerns: Oh, yes.BZ: And you are 'a sensitive'.Kerns: Yes, I am. I could have willed Jackie my practice. But she wasn't interested. She worked for the HIV division of Pfizer, as one of six U.S. representatives speaking at clinics on how to manage their medication regimens. BZ: Do you think there was a long line? Do you think your mother, your grandmother, your aunts, also lived with sensitive gifts? Kerns: I don't know honestly. Although my mother would tell me a story of her grandfather. People would come from all over and ask him to help them. He would hold his hand over a wound, especially burns, say 'something' and the wounds would be gone instantly. She'd say: \"Maybe you have some of that, Karen\". BZ: She'd tell you that?Kerns: Yeah.BZ: Maybe you do. And then some.Kerns: Perhaps.BZ: She had that, too?Kerns: Well, you know, when you're a kid and you'd get caught doing something you thought you had perfectly hidden from view, you wonder. If she did, she did not share it. One more thing about my daughter, Jack. I remember her calling me from Chicago where she lived: \"Mom, I'm at a restaurant and I notice this woman that's sitting over at that table. I know if she leaves before 2:00 she'll get hit by a car when she crosses a street. What do I do?!\" I said, \"Well, number one, if you tell her that, she's going to think you're nuts. And number two, what can you live with?\" She said, \"Got it mom!\" Poof, I never heard what the outcome was. I'm assuming she did speak to her.BZ: I'm sorry for your loss, Karen. Kerns: Thank you. I am, too. I am, too. You know about that. I actually have a picture behind Chetana Florida (Karen points to some framed photos on a windowsill) of Juliana (the interviewer's deceased daughter). I keep her in my corner. BZ: There's a lot in that photo of Juliana -- those eyes. And I recognize that photo of Chetana. I first started hearing about Chetana Florida soon after we purchased Crazy Wisdom, in 1989. At that time, we had a young store manager named Debbie Szporluk, who used to go see Chetana, and used to rave about her . Kerns: I was part of the Lighthouse Center for quite a while.I'm very inner directed. Sometimes it's been very difficult to be that way. For instance, I was in California visiting a friend and I was in a restaurant waiting for her to get out of a meeting. I came out of the restaurant and opened the door and something said very loudly to me: \"You will be moving to Ann Arbor within a year\". I was living in Saginaw at the time. I said \"What?!\" There was no one near, and within a year I was here. BZ: Is this a picture of Ma Jaya?Kerns: Yes. If you turn that picture over, that's what she looked like when I met her. She was being interviewed in Chicago at the World Parliament of Religions. BZ: What's that? (pointing to a framed picture on Karen's office wall)Kerns: Oh. It's a Batik of the fire phoenix and seven women. I purchased it at the Women's Music Festival. I was the first person to give massage at the WMF as an art form. BZ: Massages as an art form?Kerns: Yes. I was in a tent with all these artisans. I presented massage not just as a healing form but also as an art form. This picture follows me wherever I go. BZ: It's a wonderful piece! Is that a fire in the background?Kerns: A phoenix fire, yeah. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2010 Page 38 \"It is a journey for themselves as well as an introduction to a field of practice. It's very humbling.\" For more information about Karen Kerns' upcoming Polarity workshops, see the Polarity Center's ad on page 6, or their Listing in the Polarity Section of the Crazy Wisdom Calendar on page 59.\"Bringing consciousness to sensations helps dissipate the intensity of the sensation. \"The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Karen Kerns Continued from page 37 Photo by Linda LawsonBZ: And this painting? Does it have a name? How would you describe it? Is it a woman and two wolves? Kerns: Yes. The saying underneath it is: 'Nothing is so strong as gentleness. Nothing so gentle as real strength'. BZ: It's a great quote.Kerns: I admire people the most who walk their talk. Like Chetana, Dr . Stone, Dr. Roland Becker, Ma Jaya and Forest Shaklee.BZ: I know of all the other ones. Who was the last one?Kerns: Forrest Shaklee developed the Shaklee line of vitamins, gosh, some fifty years ago now. What I like most about him, is he figured out how to cure himself of cancer with food. He then worked with that knowledge to help others. The Shaklee Center is the first building to be totally emissions free. They continue to take care of the Earth's business. Forest Shaklee and Dr. Stone were born in the same era. Part of polarity is also equating certain foods with certain chakras. The earth chakra will resonate with earth foods: potatoes, turnips, beets, carrots. Water chakra will resonate with water foods, like watermelon, cucumbers, melons, foods that grow 'on' the earth, etc. If you become conscious and think about that, it allows you to come outside yourself and feel the earth. We all need to do more of that. To feel what it's like to be out here. To feel what the earth is like. When people are just beginning that journey of consciousness, I sometimes suggest something like a cleaning product to not harm the earth, to begin to be aware about their relationship to this planet that gives them life. That can begin a sacred process of being able to honor life within themselves. BZ: What are you looking forward to in the next year?K: I'm looking forward to a resurgence of passion for, I think, the spiritual aspect of polarity. Dr. Stone wrote a wonderful book called the Mystic Bible . You know how you can read something one time and it means one thing, and you go back and read it again and it's something deeper. He talked about stories of personal travel in the Bible as personal, internal spiritual journeys. Wonderful metaphors! The death of my youngest daughter has really catapulted me into a spiritual dimension. I'd love to see her, to really strongly believe that she's right here somewhere and I can see her. I want to know as best I can, to hold that belief of yes! There is so much more to life. I'd like to be able to see beyond this realm, while I'm still physically alive. BZ: On the day that my 9-year old daughter, Juliana, died, I had a very strong... (She died at home in our arms and it was deeply moving and beautiful)... I had such a strong confirmation intuitively of something I had read in a hospice book, that seemed simple enough, but really spoke to me, it relates to what you just said. On that day, I really did sense, or rather I really did have a knowing, that she had simply gone over the horizon, like a boat off in the distance going over the horizon -- you can see the boat far off into the distance, and then it's beyond the horizon, like the sun setting over the sea. The boat is still there, you just can't see it anymore. The distance from Juliana being in this world, to wherever she was just a few hours later, was not really such a great distance. She was still nearby, but she had moved over the horizon beyond what I could see. On that day, it seemed clear and true. I found that very comforting and it seemed to make complete sense -- even though the mind can't know, it still made complete sense. Kerns: Right. I think my heart knows. Something in me knows, and I believe it's my heart that knows that. I see her in my grandchildren, one in particular. My daughters are/were very different from one another. Shelly is quite an accomplished mother, but she also has a degree in mechanical engineering and a masters in business. She's very, very talented in many, many ways. One common thread was/is their humor.BZ: Anything else you'd like to mention, Karen? Kerns: Yes. First, to say a deep, heartfelt thank you to all the people who supported my daughter, Shelly, and me in many ways after Jackie's death. Second, one of the goals that I had as a practitioner was to be part of a healing team - members of different healing disciplines getting together discussing a case. I'm very fortunate in having Marcia Haarer, who is a psychotherapist, and Christi Bemister, who is a Hands of Light therapist, work with me with clients. It's a wonderful way of getting people to move rapidly through a process and to cover all areas of their being. Each of us has a very special part in all of that. BZ: You meet a client together or individually?Kerns: We meet them individually, initially. BZ: Then you talk about them with each other?Kerns: Yes, with the consent of the client. Each of us has a sense of how the other two work. Having that information, the decision is made as to who will see the client, and when. With our varied strengths and abilities, the client gets a taste of different parts of him or herself. I find that very exciting and it seems to work very well. BZ: You began that recently?Kerns: A couple of years ago. There are times when I go to Marcia Haarer's office and work with her with a client there, hands-on, as she's helping them with therapy or EMDR. It's very helpful. BZ: Sometimes you'll do bodywork while she's doing therapy work?Kerns: Yes.BZ: That's really interesting.Kerns: Yeah, it is. If there's very, very specific primary energy lines that need to be connected or healing, Christi does that. She also has a powerful overview . It's very exciting. I enjoy it very much. BZ: Are you enjoying teaching, too?Kerns: I am! Again, facing my fears is a promise I made to myself, and being in front of people is not easy for me. It's becoming more and more natural and exciting. I'm welcoming that feeling of comfort; that I can offer something for people in that way. BZ: Thank you, Karen.Kerns: Thank you, Bill. ### \"Also, one of the things that is strongly recommended, is that people (students) work on their own issues.

Questions for Jonathan Ellis, Spiritual Director Bill Zirinsky: Jon, you have come back to Ann Arbor, which is a propitious event for those of us who know you. What brought you back here from the warmer climate of northern Florida? Jonathan Ellis: After many busy years in and out of Ann Arbor, I moved to Florida in 2002. I wound up, happily, on a barrier island, living at the edge of a wilderness sanctuary, and I expected never to leave. But after seven years, I felt moved to come back into the world, or at least back into the cold. BZ: What do you do in your role as a Spiritual Director? Jonathan Ellis: Spiritual Director is a traditional term but it doesn' t mean you direct anyone. As a spiritual counselor, I help people sort out their ideas and feelings about the spiritual path of their own choosing. Folks who want to place more attention on their spiritual life can have regular sessions with a spiritual director. I've been doing this full-time for 15 years and I now talk with 60 people or so, usually once a month, but more often in times of challenge or change for them. I'm not affiliated with any organization and I talk with folks from many different walks of life and spiritual backgrounds. In our sessions, they get to step back monthly, look at their life from a spiritual perspective, and focus their intention. This can be rejuvenating. I know I look forward to the insights and support of my own spiritual director when we talk each month about my life. Having such a person along on your spiritual journey is encouraged in many traditions. BZ: What's new in your practice as a spiritual director? Jon Ellis: About half of the people I work with live in southeast Michigan. Many of them now drive to see me since I moved back to Ann Arbor last summer. I've arranged to share a counselor's office here in town where I can meet folks. My spiritual direction practice is pretty full but I will add a new person if I think there is a reason for them to work with me in particular. BZ: Please tell us more about working with clients by phone, clients who are spread out throughout the country. Jon Ellis: This began with counselees I saw in person and then one of us moved. Now I get referrals for spiritual direction from all over . Telephone sessions seem to work well with this kind of counseling, and it's common to have a spiritual director who lives in some other part of the country. But I also enjoy seeing people face to face when that's possible. Folks from elsewhere will sometimes fly in for a weekend so we can talk in person.

BZ: Now that you're back in Ann Arbor, are there some aspects of a Michigan winter which appeal to you, or which you are looking forward to? Jon Ellis: I like walking outside while the snow is coming down. BZ: You have had a long relationship with Crazy Wisdom Bookstore, both as a part-time owner twenty years ago, and as a friend and advisor to the store for many years. Have you any comments about the store, and how it is fulfilling its role in the community, now, as you have been re-introduced to the store after a seven-year absence. Or any comments about what we could be doing but are not doing, or about our deficiencies in serving the regional community of spiritual seekers, which is our stated mission? Jon Ellis: I wouldn't suggest changing a thing. BZ: Anything else you'd like to add, Jon? Jon Ellis: I don't regularly use email so it's best to reach me by phone at 734 761-5155. Afternoons or evenings are best times to call. Some friends also maintain a web site for me: www.jonathanellis.org. BZ: Thank you, Jon. Jon Ellis: Thank you, Bill. BZ: And you have also been involved in training others to become spiritual directors. Tell us about that. Jon Ellis: I have mentored about a dozen people who already had strong counseling experience of some kind and a well developed spirituality of their own. I gave them the basic format of spiritual direction and emphasized how it differs from other kinds of personal counseling. BZ: When you were younger, you held a number of positions, here in Ann Arbor at Canterbury House and the University of Michigan, at the Edgar Cayce Foundation in Virginia Beach, with the Nantahala Outdoor Center in the Smokey Mountains, on the Deepak Chopra Journal, as well as in several national presidential campaigns. I also know that you have often found yourself helping organizations and businesses administratively, because you're so darned capable in that area. Have you given up that ghost for good, or do you still find yourself having to fend off organizations wanting to capture your talents? Jon Ellis: About the closest I come now is with some counselees who have two sessions each month. In our first session, we talk more about their own internal spiritual life. In a second conversation, we focus on their occupation and livelihood, and how they live their spirituality in their work in the world. There I sometimes can't resist making organizational suggestions as well. BZ: What do you love most about your work as a spiritual director?

I am drawn to the movements that allow me, and thus presumably others, to encounter a certain feeling that is the focus of the prayer experience - such as movements that allow our bodies to feel open when we are praying for openness, movements that feel trusting and faith-filled when praying to be more trusting, joyful movements when praying for joy, etc. In a Prayer in Motion retreat I generally teach the participants the movements that embody these feelings to me, but I always encourage them to incorporate their own movements as they feel called. BZ: Prayer in Motion is not necessarily denominational, even though a good deal of your work thus far has been for Christian organizations. Is that correct? Ternes: Prayer in Motion is not denominational although my basis stems from Christianity, since that is what I know and practice. I have had some Jews and Muslims participate in my programs and they have been very moved by them. The more I learn of all the religions, the more I see the similarities. I believe we do all worship the same God; there are just many different forms of doing so. Just as my prayer form may be very different from what many have experienced in traditional religious practices. BZ: And you are also doing programs for other organizations and groups, yes? Ternes: I have done a few programs at the American Business Women's Association regional conferences in Grand Rapids and New Jersey, and at Alcohol Anonymous Retreats. Those programs were very open to include all beliefs since participants came from a wide variety of faiths. BZ: I saw that you have done dance and movement prayer work with people in wheelchairs? Please tell us about that, and what was most meaningful for you about that work. Janene Ternes: Each time I am blessed to be with those who have what some may call physical limitations, I am amazed at how God works through this form of prayer. This summer I presented at a retreat for a group of cognitively and physically challenged people, and remember the brilliant smile of a young lady with cerebral palsy, crippled over in her power wheelchair, only able to raise her head and move one hand. She beamed at me as she held her head high and moved the one part of her body that functioned. She was unable to speak but her eyes spoke volumes to me of her experience of God's love. Another amazing encounter was with an elderly retired priest who had suffered a stroke and was unable to move the left side of his body. As he moved the right side, I noticed tears streaming down that side of his face. He came up to me afterwards to thank me, saying that in all his years of being a priest he had never encountered Christ like he had just then. It's times like these that make all the sacrifices worth it. BZ: And you have done prayer in motion work related to the theme of grief. Please tell us about that.

Janene Ternes: Prayer in Motion is really about helping people open their hearts to God through the use of music and everyday movements. By praying with their whole self -- body, mind and spirit -- people find themselves more focused and emotionally connected in their prayer . Because of this engagement, movement prayer is healing, empowering and inspiring. BZ: Are you drawn to sacred dance movements and rituals from a variety of traditions? Janene Ternes: I don't think of the movements that I use as from a The Crazy Wisdom Calendar will be posted online starting January 1, 2010, at crazywisdom.net.

For times, call Lifeforce Wellness Centre at 434-9835, brendajo@andreabrisson.com.Ternes: Yes, I always loved music and movement. As a child I wanted to take dance lessons but that was not an option for me in my family . I would watch people dancing on television and envision myself there. I was pretty shy as a child but would dance when I thought no one was watching. And in my dreams I was always a beautiful ballerina. BZ: Can you name for us two or three of your favorite CDs that contain sacred and prayerful music? Ternes: That is a difficult question because I love so many songs, they speak to me in so many different ways and the songs change over time. The song which first called me back to God, out of my grief and eventually to this ministry is \"You are Mine\" by David Haas. Through it I first experienced God's love for me as real and personal. The song that really calls to me right now is \"While I'm Waiting\" by John Waller, from the movie Fireproof. It speaks to me of how we often find ourselves waiting on God - when things are not going according to our plan or in our timeframe. This is where most of us spend most of our time and how we spend it really determines our quality of life. I find great hope and comfort in this song. BZ: Janene, anything else you'd like to share with us?Ternes: I am very excited to be doing my first workshop at Crazy Wisdom on February 27 th. The focus of the retreat day will be on forgiveness, something that so many of us struggle with. I will take people through an experiential path of prayer, journaling and movement to help them physically, emotionally and spiritually let go of whatever is holding them. With forgiveness comes true freedom, something I wish for everyone. BZ: Thank you, Janene. ### (Janene T ernes can at 734-429-7754. Her website is: www .prayer-in-motion.com)Janene Ternes: I believe we are called to minister out of our own painful experiences. Part of the redeeming aspect of that hurt is being able to help others through it. Because I suffered such grief in the death of my husband at the age of 45, I really felt God calling me to minister out of that deep grief to others. In my \"Moving through Grief\" sessions I literally walked many who had lost significant loved ones including spouses, children, and others, through the process of remembering their loved ones, acknowledging their losses and letting them go in a physical, tangible way, laying down their hurt and pain. After releasing some of the pain, they were freed to pick up the gifts they had received from these loved ones and allow the healing to continue. BZ: And you also have done programs with groups of children. Children move and dance a lot anyhow. What kind of feedback do you get from children who engage with this work? Ternes: Children are great fun to work with! The little ones are so free with their bodies. They enjoy creating their own prayer and only need to be introduced to the idea and turned loose. As children age, they become more self-conscious and look for more direction. By following the movements I teach them, they are able to physically act out their prayers, taking an abstract concept and making it concrete. I use Christian rock and hip/hop music to bring movement prayer to teens. It is amazing to watch them internalize a concept such as making good choices, as they turn towards the cross when \"good\" choices are made in the words of the song, and away from the cross when \"bad\" choices are made. In very short order they understand the idea that every choice matters, not just the presumably life-changing ones such as college, career or spouse. They get the idea better in a few short minutes of movement prayer than years of being preached at about making good choices. BZ: Have you always loved dance and movement? When you were a child, did you find yourself sometimes dancing in front of the mirror?

Jan. 21 To Raise Happy Kids, Put Your Partnership/Marriage First Keeping a partnership/marriage alive and well is challenging for all in our fast-paced culture. This is particularly true if you have a child or children. When a relationship becomes challenging and partners feel more like roommates, it's easy to focus on the children. It seems like the absolute right thing to do. This Salon will examine how we inadvertently hurt our kids without realizing it and how we hurt our marriages that, in turn, hurt our kids. We will explore why putting your relationship first is the best way to raise emotionally healthy kids. Carole Kirby , LMSW, will facilitate this panel of three parents speaking from their own life experience. Carole has many years experience working with couples and families. Guest speakers include Doug Gross, a Financial Advisor with Raymond James Financial Services in Saline. He and his wife, Sabrina, have been married 27 years and have three daughters. Judy Levy is a civil rights lawyer for the Department of Justice. She has been in a committed relationship with JJ (Janet Johnson) for 25 years. Together, they have three daughters, one 14 years old and twin 12 year olds. Nic Sims is a creative professional and transplanted New Yorker, married to a serial entrepreneur Midwesterner for 15 years. Nic and David are raising a 12-year - old son and 11-year-old daughter. Feb. 18 Ethical Responsibility: What Compels One to Act? We all know when something is unethical. What does it take to move us from observation or outrage to action? What societal and/or religious imperatives guide us to move outside our per-sonal interests? Facilitator Susan Ayer is longtime Editor of Washtenaw Jewish News. Guest speakers include Rabbi Nathan Martin, Assistant Director at the University of Michigan Hillel, a Jewish student center near the U-M campus. He graduated from the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in 2006 and enjoys learning, biking, and dialogue. Reverend Ken Phifer is a longtime peace activist. He served as Senior Minister (now Emeritus) of the First Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Ann Arbor, from 1980-2005. He is a graduate of Harvard College and the University of Chicago Divinity School. Irene Butter has a PhD in economics from Duke University and is professor emerita at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Born in Berlin, she grew up as a Jewish child in Nazi-occupied Europe when her family was deported to two German concentration camps in the early 1940s. She has been involved in peace and justice projects for most of her life. She is co-founder of Zeitouna, a Palestinian and Jewish Women's Dialogue group. Mar . 18 Who (or What) Are You, Really? Most of us think of ourselves as some sort of combination of ego, psyche, personality, character, roles, and image. Is this all we actually are, or is this a fiction? What do the wisdom traditions say about who or what we truly are? Come join us for a conversation, plus experiments and exercises, in discovering our true nature. Facilitator is Sandy Wiener who has served as board chair of Deep Spring Center and of the Rudolph Steiner School. He has led a non-linear life, and has recently been asking the question, 'What really matters?' Guest speakers include Richard Mann, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Studies in Religion at the University of Michigan. His most recent book was a study of the teachings of the founder of Siddha Yoga, Swami Muktananda. His courses have been on psychology and spiritual development, and on consciousness.

What is it? Christy DeBurton: First and foremost, it is a book group where we discuss books that are holistic in nature - whether they're about yoga, spirituality, personal growth, meditation, how the brain works, etc. However, it is a pretty laid-back book group. We are here to expand our minds and open ourselves up to new ideas, but we also have fun: everyone brings a vegetarian hors d'ouevres to share, and we usually end up chatting about our lives as much as we talk about the books. For August's book group, one of my students who lives on a lake hosted, and we had our discussion out in the middle of the lake on her pontoon boat! BZ: How often do you meet, and how long has this Book Group been going on? Christy DeBurton: We had our first meeting in January 2008. We meet every other month. Do you have a set membership, or do different people show up at different meetings? Christy DeBurton: We have a core group of about 6 people who have been coming from the beginning, but it has since grown. Last month we had 12 people. What have you been reading this month? Tell us about it, please. DeBurton: This month we are reading My Stroke of Insight by Jill Bolte Taylor. She is a Harvard brain scientist who, at the age of 37, had a stroke on the left side of her brain. The book is about her recovery, but it's also about how the right and left sides of the brain work and, ultimately , how we can choose to perceive situations from either side of our brain. I've heard from several students who have already finished the book, and we have all found it really fascinating. What book group choice led to the most stimulating conversation?I would have to say A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle. It totally blew us away. There is just so much enlightening, practical information in it. We talked about that book for a long time at the book group and even afterwards.

We can just say, \"Oh, that's my ego. That's not who I really am. I am the pure awareness behind the thoughts.\" We can choose to live in the present moment and not get caught up in thoughts about the past or the future.

And what style of yoga do you practice, and why is that style a good fit for you? I started practicing yoga about 14 years ago. I did my teacher training and started teaching about 11 years ago. I practice a few different styles. I am not one of those students/teachers who strictly adheres to only one style. I believe there are many paths in yoga to achieving a balanced body , mind and spirit, and I encourage my students as well as myself to find the most inspiring and appropriate class/style for any given day. So, if I have a lot of energy and want to really work hard, I love a challenging Vinyasa class. I love Hatha when I need to slow down and relieve stress, or I'm just feeling low-energy. I do Yin yoga for its meditative qualities, and I love Kundalini because I find it very mentally and emotionally healing. What's do you love most about being a yoga teacher? And what do you find most difficult in your work as a yoga teacher? I used to work as a cost analyst in the auto industry before becoming a yoga teacher. I was good at my job, but I felt like it was killing my soul. What I always tell people about why I love teaching yoga is that now, instead of making money for a big corporation, I get to help people lead healthier, happier lives. Most difficult thing about teaching yoga? Hmm...no paid vacations or health insurance! Thanks, Christy! ### (Christy DeBurton teaches yoga classes at her in-home yoga studio, known as The Y oga Room.
