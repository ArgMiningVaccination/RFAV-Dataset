I am a healer & truth seeker, and always look for the root cause. I don't just treat symptoms. Together, You and I will treat the whole body here at Inside-Out Bodyworks. The true meaning of holistic is body mind and spirit. All three must be in balance to achieve optimum health. The services that I offer, I have personally used on my own health journey. My knowlwdge does not just come from schooling & books, but from personal experience. My passion comes from experiencing a lack of assistance & true knowledge of the anatomy & physiology from the westernized medical community. As an empath I have been able to connect with my clients on a deeper level. I honestly feel their frustration with our current \" healthcare system\". As a client, you can expect comprehensive, true, authentic, guidance in your journey for health whatever that may look like to you. We are all individuals in need of different treatments. I am here for you at whatever level you are comfortable with in my holistic approach. Whether it's getting off of your pharmaceuticals, or incorporating a more Holistic approach with pharmaceuticals. I am here to provide you natural health Inside and Out. ~Wendy Being in practice since 2009 has given me amazing relationships with not only my patients, but local health professionals that I respect and love working in collaboration with to give the patients the best care and outcome. It takes a team. It would be my honor to be a part of your team. Sign up to hear from us. We use cookies to analyze website traffic and optimize your website experience.
