Dedication To my dearest mother (Carol), sister (Carline), and friend Donne, This book on ancient Chinese medicine and aromatherapy would not have been possible without your unwavering support and belief in me. From the very beginning, you three have been my biggest cheerleaders, encouraging me to pursue my passion and reminding me of my potential when self-doubt crept in. Mom, thank you for instilling in me a love for nature and all of its healing properties. Your knowledge of herbal remedies and holistic practices has been invaluable to this project. Sis, I am so grateful for your creativity and eye for design. Your input on the layout and illustrations brought this book to life in ways I never could have imagined. Donne, your constant emotional support, and willingness to listen to me process my thoughts and ideas has been so crucial to this journey. You have an innate ability to see and bring out the best in people, and that has been particularly true "}
