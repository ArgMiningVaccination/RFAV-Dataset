Why not just visit the air freshener aisle at the grocery store, you ask?? I used to wonder the same thing... And there was a period of time when I was like a little kid in a candy store when I'd visit the air freshener aisle at the grocery store. I'd rub my hands together in delight as I perused the hundreds of brightly-colored packages begging for me to place them in my cart. The scents always sounded so tantalizing... Island Delight, Fresh Lavender, Boysenberry Splash... I'd excitedly pick a few different options and hurry home to try them out [in my little farmhouse...](https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2015/12/farmhouse-remodel.html) And I was disappointed every time. Why DIY Air Freshener Sprays are Better Than Store-bought: When I used to purchase air freshener sprays at the store, not only did the scents never quite match their descriptions, but they smelled fake and overly perfumey... And they gave me an instant headache. The final straw was when I found out that many commonly available [air fresheners have been shown to contain harmful chemicals.](https://www.nrdc.org/media/2007/070919) At that point, I just decided to just have a boring smelling house forever... Thankfully, I didn't have to suffer for long. Essential oils are my favorite trick for freshening up my home, and [I most commonly use them in a diffuser. ](https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2013/05/10-must-try-essential-oil-recipes-for-your-diffuser.html)However, sometimes I've found I need a blast of freshness FAST and that's when I mix up one of these homemade air freshener recipes which: - Are all-natural and allow you to experience the health benefits of essential oils at the same time. - Don't contain harmful substances like many store-bought sprays. - Are extremely affordable because they use simple ingredients you have in your cabinets. Supplies for Making Homemade Air Fresheners Water I use tap water, but distilled is fine, too. Essential Oils These are the powerhouse in the following recipes. Not only do they allow you to acheive the scents you want, they also help to cleanse the air. I'll give you my favorite scent combinations below, but you can definitely mix and match. [This the brand of essential oils I've used exclusively for 8 years.](https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/how-to-purchase-essential-oils) Alcohol I use a bit of vodka or rubbing alcohol to my sprays because they help the essential oils and water to mix more thoroughly, and helps the homemade air freshener to dry faster. You could omit it if you like, but I really think it results in a better end product. My favorite tip? If you don't keep a lot of alcohol in your home, simply use vanilla extract. It adds extra punch to the recipe, and you can even [make real homemade vanilla extract](https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2011/03/homemade-vanilla-extract.html) yourself. Spray Bottle All of my air freshener recipes will fill an 8oz spray bottle. However, if you want to go gangbusters, don't hesitate to double or triple the recipe. I adore [these continuous sprayers](https://amzn.to/2P9kmHp)\u2014 they are fun to use and produce a fine mist. However, a [simple glass spray bottle](https://amzn.to/38JDNhM) [like this one](https://amzn.to/38JDNhM) works as well and I like to keep them on hand for these recipes as well as my [DIY after-sun spray](https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2013/06/relief-for-lobster-skin-diy-sunburn-spray.html) or [laundry spot remover](https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2013/03/diy-laundry-spot-remover.html)). How to Make Homemade Air Fresheners: 3 Easy Steps: - Gather the materials and ingredients. Use one of the recipes below as a starting point, but don't be afraid to mix-and-match essential oils depending on what you have in your stash. - Combine all of the ingredients. I like to add them right into my sprayer (usually with a funnel to decrease spills) to keep things easy. - Shake well and spray! Since the essential oils tend to float on top of the water, always shake your sprayer bottle before spraying in your home. Natural homemade air freshener sprays won't linger in your home as long as commercial chemical-sprays, but I personally don't mind spraying a bit more often if it means I'm avoiding the toxins. 10 Homemade Air Freshener Recipes 1.

I do. At least sometimes. Because some essential oils have the tendency to break down plastic, if I am going to consume a blend, I always, always keep it in a glass container. However, since I won't be drinking any of these mixes, I don't have a problem sticking them in a plastic spray bottle if I'm running low on my glass spritzers. - For all of my favorite home and homesteading products, check out [my Homestead Mercantile.](https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/shop) - Also listen to the Old Fashioned On Purpose Podcast.
