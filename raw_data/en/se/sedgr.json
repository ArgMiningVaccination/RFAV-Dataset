(2) In accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 851/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 Apr il 2004 establishing a European Centre for disease prevention and control (ECDC) 3, the ECDC provided, at the request of the Commission, a scientific opini on on case definitions aidi ng the Commission and the Member States in the development of intervention strategies in the field of surveillance of and response to communicable diseases. (3) The case definitions already listed in the Annex to Decision 2002/253/EC for HIV/AIDS, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae (invasive disease), and leptospirosis should be updated on the basis of that scientific opinion provided by ECDC. (4) A generic case definition of antimicrobi al resistance, a generic definition of nosocomial infections, a number of specific case definitions of nosocomial infections, and a case definition for tick-borne encephali tis should also be added to the Annex to Decision 2002/253/EC on the basis of that scientific opini on provided by ECDC. 1 OJ L 268, 3.10.1998, p. 1. 2 OJ L 86, 3.4.2002, p. 44. 3 OJ L 142, 30.4.2004, p. 1.

EXPLANATION OF THE SECTIONS USED IN THE DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF CASES Clinical criteria Clinical criteria include common and relevant signs and symptoms of the disease which either individually or in comb ination constitutes a clear or indicative clinical picture of the disease. They give the general outline of the disease an d do not necessarily indicate all the features needed for individual clinical diagnosis. Laboratory criteria Laboratory criteria are a list of laboratory methods that ar e used to confirm a case. Usually only one of the listed te sts will be enough to confirm the case. If a combination of methods is needed to meet the laboratory confirmation, this is specified. The type of specimen to be collected for the laboratory tests is only spec ified when only certain specimen types are considered relevant for the confirmation of a di agnosis. Laboratory crite ria for a probable case are included for some agreed exceptional cases. T hose laboratory criteria consist of a list of laboratory methods which can be used to support the diagnosis of a case but which are not confirmatory. Epidemiological criteria and epidemiological link Epidemiological criteria are deem ed to have been met when an epidemiological link can be established. Epidemiological link, during the incubation period, means one of the six following: - Human to human transmission: the fact that a person has ha d contact with a laboratory confirmed human case in such a way as to have had the opportunity to acquire the infection - Animal to human transmission: the fact that a person has had contact wi th an animal with a laboratory confirmed infection/co lonization in such a way as to have had the opportunity to acquire the infection - Exposure to a common source: the fact that a person has been exposed to the same common source or vehicle of inf ection, as a confirmed human case - Exposure to contaminated food / drinking water: the fact that a person has consumed food or drinking water with a labor atory confirmed contamination or has consumed potentially contaminated products from an animal with a laboratory confirmed infection/colonization - Environmental exposure: the fact that a person has bathed in water or has had contact with a contaminated environmental source th at has been laboratory confirmed - Laboratory exposure: the fact th at a person has worked in a laboratory wher e there is a potential for exposure A person may be considered epidemiologically li nked to a confirmed case if at least one case in the chain of transmission is laboratory confirmed. In case of an outbreak of faeco-oral or EN 5 EN airborne transmitted infections, the chain of transmission does not necessarily need to be established to consider a case epidemiologically linked. Transmission may occur by one or more of the following routes: - Airborne: by projection of aerosol from an inf ected person onto the mucous membranes while coughing, spitting, singing or talking, or when microbial aerosols dispersed into the atmosphere are inhaled by others - Contact: direct contact with an infected person (faecal -oral, respiratory droplets, skin or sexual exposure) or animal (e.g. biting, touching) or indirect c ontact to infected materials or objects (infected fo mites, body fluids, blood) - Vertical: from mother to child, often in utero, or as a result of the incidental exchange of body fluids usually during the perinatal period - Vector transmission: indirect transmission by infected mosqu itoes, mites, flies and other insects which transmit disease to humans through their bites - Food or water: consumption of potentially contaminated food or drinking water. Case classification Cases are classified as \"possible\", \"probabl e\" and \"confirmed\". The incubation periods for diseases are given in the additional information to facilitate the assessment of the epidemiological link. Possible case A possible case means a case classified as possible for reporting purposes. It is usually a case meeting the clinical criteria as described in the case definition without epidemiological or laboratory evidence of the disease in question. The definition of a case as possible has high sensitivity and low specificity. It allows for de tection of most cases but some false positives cases will be included into this category. Probable case A probable case means a case classified as probable for reporting purposes. It is usually a case with clinical criteria and an epidemiological link as described in the case definition. Laboratory tests for probable cases ar e specified only for some diseases. Confirmed case A confirmed case means a case classified as confirmed for report ing purposes. Confirmed cases are laboratory confirmed and may or may not fulfil the clini cal criteria as described in the case definition. The definition of a case as co nfirmed is highly specific and less sensitive; therefore most of the collected cases will be true cases although some will be missed. The clinical criteria of some diseases do not allude to the fact that many acute cases are asymptomatic, (e.g. hepatitis A, B and C, campy lobacteriosis, salmone llosis) although these cases may still be important from a public hea lth perspective on national level. EN 6 EN Confirmed cases fall in one of the three subcate gories listed below. They will be assigned to one of those subcategories during the analysis of data using the variables collected within the context of the case information. Laboratory-confirmed case with clinical criteria The case meets the laboratory criteria for case confirmation and the clinical criteria included in the case definition. Laboratory-confirmed case with unknown clinical criteria The case meets the laboratory criteria for cas e confirmation but there is no information available regarding the clinical criteria (e.g. only laboratory report). Laboratory-confirmed case without clinical criteria The case meets the laboratory cr iteria for case confirmation but doesn't meet the clinical criteria in the case definition or is asymptomatic.
