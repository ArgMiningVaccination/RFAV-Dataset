It might be the final touch that grounds the space or completes the design. Conversely, it might be the foundation of the room: a rug that launches a thousand interior design choices, riffing from its hues for furnishings, art, and accessories. Solid or patterned, traditional to modern, flat kiliim, plush pile, looped, sculpted, tufted, and embroidered... So many choices! But one choice should be top of mind always: is yours an eco-friendly, non-toxic rug? We're so pleased to share with you some brands that pride themselves on their ethics, sustainability, creativity, and design in producing environmentally friendly, non-toxic rugs. An area rug evokes feelings; it adds physical and emotional warmth. But even more important, it affects the air quality inside our homes. We spend so much of our time indoors that [indoor air quality (IAQ)](https://elemental.green/iaq-101-feel-better-about-the-air-youre-breathing/) can impact our health. And pets and children often get up close and personal with your choice of an area rug. Begin with organic [Organic Weave](https://organicweaveshop.com/) addresses this fundamental topic of IAQ: \"When we walk on rugs or sit on furniture, the abrasion causes small particles to enter the air. If there are harmful chemicals in our home furnishings, those chemicals enter the air and create a dust debris. We can inhale, ingest and absorb toxic chemicals.\" Choosing organic materials means non-toxic rugs that you don't have to worry about off-gassing. Organic farming is better for farmers, for animals, and for the broader environment. And finally, where area rugs are handcrafted by artisans, organic manufacturing protects them and their families from exposure to harmful chemicals. So what should you look for when shopping for eco-friendly, non-toxic rugs? It can be confusing. If you think that non-synthetics like cotton qualify, you're only partially right. Much like fruits and vegetables, it depends on how the crop was grown, whether it was treated with pesticides or fungicides, and how it was harvested. If wool is dyed, is it with chemicals or natural products? Viscose, a wood-based material, is a fiber that, like silk, when combined with wool gives luster or sheen. Safe, right? While the source is from nature, the production process can be highly polluting. And the materials may be treated with chemicals before they are spun into yarn or thread. Those chemicals become airborne at the factory and enter waterways surrounding production plants. Shop your values Ultimately, the most important factor in choosing an area rug is sourcing. Brands that are transparent will detail the origin of their product, from farm to spool to weaving to your home A bonus for the majority of earth-friendly, non-toxic rugs is artisanal weaving. Some rugs are loomed in the US. Others have a global reach: India, Nepal, Iran, South America, and Mexico. Often, the makers come from generations of weavers thrilled to carry on family traditions. While some eco-friendly rugs may be immediately available, there often is a lead time of two to six months. The upside to pre-ordering is that some allow customization of colors and sizes, for a truly bespoke product. Social responsibility goes hand in glove with sustainability in the supply chain. That means ethical production. [Fair Trade means](https://elemental.green/understanding-fair-trade-certifications/) no child labor, a living wage, a safe working environment. Some brands are invested in their communities, as well. A word about cost: Organic products often get a bad rap because of assumed higher price tags. In the case of eco-friendly, non-toxic rugs, there's quite a range in price. Compared to non-organic counterparts, many eco-friendly area rugs are surprisingly affordable, available for hundreds of dollars. An average price for a 6 by 9 foot eco-friendly area rug is about $1,500. And even at the higher end, there's no substantial difference. What to look for Here are some materials and disclaimers to look for in eco-friendly and nontoxic rugs: Image courtesy Obakki - Natural raw materials. These include wool, jute, hemp, bamboo, silk, sisal, palm fibers, and organic cotton. - Recycled materials. Using textile waste is not only resourceful but sustainable. For example, some rugs are designed with recycled silk indian saris. Unique [MINNA Remnant Rugs](https://www.minna-goods.com/products/earth-day-rug?variant=39932322545761)follow the lead of other upcycled products manufactured by the brand. - No chemical dyes or dyeing processes. Plants and vegetables provide natural dyes. - Non-toxic materials in backings, foundations, glues, bonding agents, or surface treatments. Synthetic latex and blends can off-gas, releasing hazardous fumes; 100% natural latex will not off-gas - Certifications. It's reassuring to see a label that certifies that a rug is organic, low-VOC, or non-toxic. But that doesn't necessarily mean that if a certification is absent, the rug is not perfectly healthy for your home. Some small companies cannot afford the cost of going through a long certification process. - Therefore, the most important consideration is transparency. Many brands share information about their supply chains on their websites: from the farm that grows and harvests raw materials, to spinning, dyeing, weaving, and finishing. - Durability. This goes without saying, but let's say it anyway. No matter how much you've spent, you want a non-toxic rug that will withstand heavy foot traffic, especially in families with kids and pets. Quality, eco-friendly materials will last for years. - Fair labor. Top eco-friendly brands assure fair wages, no child labor, healthy working conditions, and many offer educational and health benefits to their communities of artisans. Let's shop for eco-friendly and non-toxic rugs [Organic Weave](https://organicweaveshop.com/) Linda Alexanian, loves rugs. She grew up third generation in a family of rug merchants, and it was partly an uncomfortable exposure to manufacturing in India that drew her to the business. When she expressed concern about child labor to her parents, they urged her to do something abut it. So she did. Alexanian became a buyer for the family business and eventually partnered with Organic Weave. The two were founding members of [GoodWeave](https://goodweave.org/), a not-for-profit organization working to eradicate child and forced labor. \"Ethical production is in our DNA,\" she says. \"We're proud to offer rugs created in harmony with nature, sourced from all-natural and organic ingredients, from farm to floor.\" Organic Weave rugs are produced by skilled artisans using traditional weaving methods near the Ganges River in India.

To that end, it donates a generous portion of its income to [Water For People](https://www.waterforpeople.org/), which provides access to fresh water in India and other countries where potable water is desperately needed. \"When I started this company (in 2013) I really wanted it to be eco-friendly,\" says Whit Selke. \"You can't care about the Earth without caring about its people, and you can't care about people without caring for the Earth. These two groups are really one group. We are thrilled to serve them.\" Hook & Loom produces rugs in undyed wool, GOTS certified organic cotton, and Eco Cotton, which is upcycled from recovered textile fibers. \"I had seen the impact dyes had on the environment,\" says Selke. \"I decided that for anything we produced, we would use no chemicals, no dyes, and no latex. We have grown to over 200 styles/colors and stayed true to this commitment.\" Image courtesy Hook & Loom [Merida Studio](https://meridastudio.com/) Owner and CEO Catherine Connolly calls the brand's natural-fiber rugs \"soulful.\" They're also bold. Since she purchased the company in 2014 (she ran it seven years prior), Connolly has strived to make a difference, \"to make something so extraordinary\" in design, and to oversee the master weavers who create the artisanal rugs in Fall River, MA, a historic mill town. \"I think of the rugs as soulful mostly because of the craftsmen,\" she says. \"They leave a slip of themselves in every rug. It's living art. We always joke, 'If you've got love in your hands, you'll have love in the rug.' We're cultivating the practice part, the joyful part.\" Pushing the envelope in color and design is especially expressed with one type of plied yarn, mouline, which incorporates up to 10 different plied yarn combinations, including mohair, linen, and cotton. Brand commitments are to use natural materials that celebrate the earth's natural beauty and are rapidly replenishable, safe for the environment, and healthy for the home.

The one-of-a-kind rugs each feature a unique colorway, \"a remnant of surprise.\" Image courtesy MINNA [CICIL](https://www.cicilhome.com/) Raw wool for CICIL rugs is sourced directly from farmer cooperatives in New York, Vermont, and Pennsylvania. The non-toxic rugs are made by hand in North Carolina, and all the materials are 100% natural, from renewable sources. Processing is minimal, without synthetic dyes or chemical treatments. Wool is already naturally antimicrobial with fire- and stain-resisting properties. So there's no need for additives, CICIL explains. \"Our variety of wool also has an extra-long fiber length, making our rugs super soft and durable.\" The standout element is braiding, according to the website, and we agree that their braided shapes are \"both timeless and surprising.\" Image courtesy CICIL [The Rug Company](https://www.therugcompany.com/us/) Owners Christopher and Suzanne Sharp pride themselves on not cutting corners: \"[We] truly understand the unique heritage and significance of traditional rug artisanship.

Every stage of production is sustainable. From refining to dyeing, hand knotting, finishing, and final washing, no industrial machinery, acids, chemicals, or glue are used. Experimentation and development with Nepalese, Indian, and Tibetan artisans has produced robust fibers. The new collection, An Undyed Mood, reinterprets some of its iconic designs in undyed materials. The rugs are produced in Nepal, where the company has access to local materials like Himalayan wool, cashmere, silk, and aloe. These natural fibers have been used in the region for centuries. Himalayan sheep have thick, dense coats, rich in natural lanolin, and colors range from light gray to nearly black. Shearers divide the wool into a palette of natural shades. A dynamic palette has been developed by the CC-Tapis Atelier in Kathmandu and the CC-Tapis design lab in Milan. Besides being a rich tactile experience, the texture and structure of these non-toxic rugs absorb and reflect light differently, lending sheen and incredible depth.
