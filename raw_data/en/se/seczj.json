I feel compelled to respond to Dr. Hanaway's article on vaccinations from a wholistic and anthroposophical perspective. 1. Vaccinations in no way, shape or form are homeopathic. Homeopathy does not believe in injecting toxic chemicals and metals into the blood stream. In addition, all homeopathics are diluted but vaccinations are not. They are full strength. 2. Anthroposophists (followers of Rudolph Steiner) believe that experiencing childhood diseases as a child is not only normal but also conducive to our good health. Experiencing childhood diseases as an infant or child actually stimulates and builds a normal, healthy immune system that protects us through life. 3. Dr. Hanaway presumes vaccinations work and yet there are no long term studies by anyone showing specifically how and if they work. A wonderful website to explore on this issue is: www.garynull.com. Click on world issues-vaccinations. 4. The World Health Organization, in their latest study, shows American children are among the sickest in all categories of their studies of the fifteen industrial countries and health. The U.S. ranked last or next to last in infant mortality rates per capita, as well as sudden infant death syndrome. We also ranked last or next to last in the number of pediatric allergies, asthma, cancer, diabetes and hyperactivity. We are the only industrialized country to mandate vaccines. 5. Put all the above aside for a moment and consider this. These are the ingredients in vaccinations: a. Live viruses or bacteria b. Animal tissue (medium)--green monkey brains and kidneys, horse blood, chicken ovaries, human diploid tissue (aborted fetus parts). c. Thimerisol--a 47% dilution of methyl mercury (one of the most toxic substances known in chemistry). d. Aluminum oxide and aluminum hydroxide (implicated in Alzheimer's disease). e. Formaldehyde f. Ethylene glycol (antifreeze) g. Erythromiacin and amoxicillin (broad spectrum antibiotics). Ask yourself this question. Do you really want this toxic concoction injected into your child's body, creating possible death or neurological damage? 6. Lastly, there are studies that show some vaccines have been contaminated with animal viruses (i.e. Simian virus 40) which have shown to cause unique cancers in some people. Ask yourself these questions if you are going to vaccinate your child: 1. Why aren't the ingredients listed in any form in a pediatrician's office? 2. Will my child react to any of the materials in a vaccine? 3. What is the future (long term) affect of injecting toxic substances into my child? 4. Will my child die from a reaction to vaccination(s)? Consider all these factors before you vaccinate. Resources: Books 1. The Immunization Resource Guide by Diane Rozario 2. Immunization: Theory vs. Reality by Neil Miller 3. Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? By Neff Miller 4. Vaccination and Immunization: Dangers, Delusions and Alternatives by Leon Chaitow Sincerely, Dr. Patrick Patton, DC Asheville, NC, 828-285-9792 Patrick Hanaway, MD responds: The article \"Vaccinations: Searching for the Middle Ground\" attempts to take a broad view of vaccine theory and practice; a holistic view that includes information both for and against vaccination. I believe that education and informed consent will help parents make the best possible decisions about vaccination. In reviewing Dr. Patton's response to this article, I agree with many of his points and concerns: 1. Vaccinations are not homeopathic, though the initial practice arose from the homeopathic principle that `like cures like'. 2. I believe that childhood diseases serve to stimulate the developing immune system. Increasing numbers of vaccinations may alter this immune response. This belief is a theory (such as Rudolph Steiner's anthroposophy) that someday may be supported by scientific inquiry. These theoretical considerations are of little solace when an epidemic such as poliomyelitis or whooping cough moves through a community leaving numbers of people injured or dead. 3. Dr. Patton asks important questions about the risks of vaccination--these must be considered by any parent who is concerned about safety. Parents must also ask questions regarding the benefits of vaccination. Contrary to the assertion that there are no long-term studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) have authored hundreds of studies validating the benefit of vaccinations across populations at risk. 4. The discussion of risks and benefits should focus on facts, not accusations and should use studies, not assertions. Dr. Patton points to WHO data comparing the health of American children with other industrialized countries--implying that vaccinations are the cause. There is no causal relationship established between infant mortality, SIDS, cancer, and vaccination rates. It is irresponsible to make such assertions. 5. However, there are no population-based studies that evaluate the risk of additional disease (especially auto-immune and neurologic illnesses) when a new vaccine is introduced. This lack of evidence does not constitute safety and is precisely why doctors and concerned parents have raised questions about DTP, OPV, MMR, HepB, RotaVirus, and other vaccines. There is no doubt that these questions have led to safer vaccinations. Vaccinations have helped millions of people across the world. Targeting of vaccinations to populations-at-risk decreases unnecessary side-effects. Research on unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children will give us additional data to better determine the risks and benefits. As we listen to these differing views, we must discern the optimal path for the health of our children. Dr. Patrick Hanaway can be reached at 828-251-2700. | | "}
