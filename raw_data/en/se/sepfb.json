The evidence-based approach to periodontal care emphasizes use of research as the foundation for clinical decision making. This edition has more of the popular \"Focus on Patients\" and \"Patient Case Study\" features that help students apply concepts to actual patient treatment. A new \"Patient Applications\" feature presents critical thinking exercises using simulated patient cases. This edition has approximately 200 new illustrations, including new full-color clinical photographs. A bound-in CD-ROM includes an image bank of full-color photographs. CD-ROM Alert icons in the text direct students to these photographs. - Subject headings - [Periodontics.](https://iucat.iu.edu/iun?q=%22Periodontics%22&search_field=subject_link&search_scope=catalog) [Dental hygienists.](https://iucat.iu.edu/iun?q=%22Dental+hygienists%22&search_field=subject_link&search_scope=catalog) - ISBN - 0781784875 9780781784870 Holdings - Library - South Bend - Schurz Library - Call Number - RK361 .F675 2008 - Location - Stacks - Floor - 5th Floor - [text this call number](/myaccount/login?catalog_id=7693109&request_type=sms&requested_item_id=30000110676172&return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fiucat.iu.edu%2Fiun%2F7693109) - Library - South Bend - Schurz Library - Call Number - RK361 .F675 2008 CD-ROM - Location - South Bend Schurz Lib. - Circulation Desk - CD-ROM's - Floor - 1st Floor, Circulation Desk - [text this call number](/myaccount/login?catalog_id=7693109&request_type=sms&requested_item_id=30000110676180&return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fiucat.iu.edu%2Fiun%2F7693109) - Library - South Bend - Schurz Library - Call Number - RK361 .F675 2008 CD-ROM - Location - South Bend Schurz Lib. - Circulation Desk - CD-ROM's - Floor - 1st Floor, Circulation Desk - "}
