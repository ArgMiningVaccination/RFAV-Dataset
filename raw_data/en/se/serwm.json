Part of the comprehensive assessment work is to formally identify unmet health needs in the community. Community stakeholders helped to prioritize the unmet needs for further implementation strategy development. We are grateful to all the comm unity members who joined us in this important work. During 2015 members of the community were asked to complete a generalizable survey to help identify unmet health needs. Researchers at the Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University anal yzed the survey data. Additional surveys included key stakeholders from Cass and Clay counties and the assessment of American Indian residents. Sanford further analyzed the data, identified unmet needs, and partnered with key community stakeholders to deve lop a list of resources and assets that were available to address each need. A gap analysis and prioritization exercise was also conducted to identify the most significant health needs and to further address these needs through the implementation strategie s that are included in this document. Sanford Fargo has set strategy to address the following community health needs: Depression Hypertension Flu shots The report focuses on community assets as well as community health needs. T he asset map/resource list is included in this document along with the action steps that will be taken to address each identified need. At Sanford Fargo, patient care extends beyond our bricks and mortar. As a not -for-profit organization, ensuring that the benefits of health care reach the broad needs of communities is at the core of who we are. Through our work with communities, we can bring health and healing to the people who live and work across our communities. Together, we can fulfill this mission. Sincerely, Paul Richard President Sanford Medical Center Fargo 3 Sanford South University Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4 Sanford South University Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 Purpose A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital Community Benefit Program that builds on community assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. A community health needs assessment helps the com munity build capacity to support policy, systems, environmental changes and community health improvement. A community health needs assessment also serves to validate progress made toward organizational strategies and provides further evidence for retain ing not-for-profit status. The purpose of this community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and to develop a Community B enefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify and defend not -for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health iss ues from a broad perspective. Study Design and Methodology 1. Generalizable Survey A generalizable survey was conducted of residents in Cass County, North Dakot a and Clay County, Minnesota. The purpose of the generalizable survey of residents in the greater Fargo - Moorhead area (i.e., Cass County, North Dakota and Clay County, Minnesota ) was to learn about the percepti ons of area residents regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. Staff at the North Dakota State University Cent er for Social Research, along with members of the Greater Fargo -Moorhead Community Health Needs Assessment Collaborative, created the survey tool and cover letter. Elements of informed consent were included in the letter ensuring that the NDSU Institutiona l Review Board requirements were met and the protection of human subjects maintained. Obtained through a qualified vendor, t he sample was a stratified random sample to ensure that appropriate proportions from each of the two counties were included. A tota l of 1,500 records with names, addresses, and a few demographic indicators were included in the sample . 5 A total of 39 8 paper surveys were returned for scanning and an additional 3 surveys were completed on-line for a total of 401; the response rate was 27%. It was apparent that elderly and male respondents were overrepresented in the scanned results. Therefore, post -stratification weight s were used to ensure proper representation of the population with respect to age and gender. Respondents who did not e nter a gender and age response were eliminated from the analys is. A total of 3 82 surveys were analyzed , providing a generalizable sample with a confidence level of 95 % and an error rate of plus or minus 5.2 percentage points. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns, with 1 as not at all and 5 meaning a great deal. Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being addresse d by Sanford and community partners. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 2. Non -Generalizable Survey An online non-generalizable survey was conducted on-line through a partnership between the Greater Fa rgo-Moorhead Community Health Collaborative and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and maintained links to the on-line survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collection occurred throughout the month of June 2015 and a total of 51 respondents participat ed in the on-line survey. The purpose of this non -generalizable survey of community leaders in t he greater Fargo - Moorhead area (i.e., Cass County, North Dakota and Clay County, Minnesota) was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. Th is group included community leaders, legislators, and agency leaders representing chronic disease and disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns, with 1 as not at all and 5 meaning a great deal. Needs ranking 3. 5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by Sanford and community partners. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required p rioritization. 3. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the early finding s from the generalizable survey and to discuss the top health issues or health -related issues facing the community. Over 200 individuals were invited to attend from county commissions, city council s, school boards, and agencies representing the chronic disease groups and disparity. There were 53 attendees at the July 2015 community stakeholder meeting and the discussion helped t o determine key priorities for the community. 6 4. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the c ommunity to address the needs. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. The multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation s trategies. 5. Secondary Research 2015 Assessment of American Indian Residents Persons who self -identified as American Indian/Alaska Native were targeted for this study. Survey data was collected in July 2015 during the Fargo -Moorhead \"Honoring Traditions o f Health Wellness Community Health Fair\" at Carl Ben Eielson Middle School in Fargo, North Dakota. There were 96 participants in this study. The secondary data includes community health profiles from the North Dakota Department of Health for Cass County, North Dakota and the Minnesota Department of Health for Clay County Minnesota. The indicators that were reviewed for this assessment include: population data, vital statistics, adult behavioral risk factors, crime and child risk. Additionally, the County H ealth Rankings were included in the findings. Key Findings - Primary Research The key findings are based on the generalizable and the non -generalizable survey data. Key indicators were ranked on a 1 -5 Likert scale, with 5 being the highest concern ranking. Survey results that rank 3.5 or higher are considered to be high ranking concerns for both the generalizable survey and the key stakeholder non -generalizable survey. 1. Economics: Respondents were most concerned about affordable housing and hunger in regards to economics in Cass and Clay County. Homelessness is a moderate concern and was the third highest concern in the area of community economics. 2. Aging: The number one ranking co ncern among respondents overall is the cost of long term care. The availability of memory care and the availability of long term care also rank as top concerns for the aging. 3. Children and Youth: When considering children and youth , bullying ranks highest of the concerns for respondents. The cost of quality child care and the availability of quality infant care are also ranked as high concerns. 4. Safety: The presence of street drugs and alcohol in the community, the presence of drug dealers in the community , crime, child abuse and neglect, domestic violence and sex trafficking are the highest safety concerns of the respondents. 5. Health Care: The health care indicator addressed access to health care and cost concerns. Access to affordable health insurance, access to affordable health care, access to affordable prescription drugs, cost of affordable dental insurance coverage , and the cost of affordable vision insurance coverage are the highest concerns among the respondents. 7 6. Physical Health : Cancer, chronic disease, inactivity and lack of exercise, obesity, poor nutrition and eating habits , and infectious disease such as flu are the highest physical health concerns . 7.

Community stakeholders als o rated chronic disease and mental illness as top priorities. Sanford has determined the 2016 -2019 implementation strategies for the following needs: Hypertension Depression Flu vacci nes Implementation Strategies 1. Priority 1: Hypertension Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and contributes to premature death from heart attack, stroke, diabetes and renal disease. The North Dakota Department of Health reports that 27.7% of the population in Cass County ha s been told by t heir provider that they have hypertension. Sanford has prioritized hypertension as a top priority and has set strategy to standardize nursing protocol for blood pressure checks and rechecks. The goal is to reduce the number of patients with uncontrolled hy pertension. The measureable outcome is the number of patients with blood pressure < 140/90. 2. Priority 2: Depression Depression is a common but serious illness that can interfere with daily life. Many people with a depressive illness never seek treatment. B ut the majority, even those with the most severe depression, can get better with treatment. The North Dakota Department of Health reports that 11.9% of residents in Cass County have reported fair or poor mental health days. County Health Rankings for Clay County indicates that 11% of the residents have fair or poor mental health. Sanford has prioritized depression as a top priority and has set strategy to perform assessments for depression and to improve PHQ -9 scores for patients who are diagnosed with dep ression. The goal is to improve PHQ -9 scores for patients with depression. The measurable outcome is the percentage of patients with major depression or dysthymia and an initial PHQ -9 score greater than nine whose six -month PHQ -9 score is less than five. 10 3. Priority 3: Flu Vaccines The CDC states that Influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. Every flu season is different, and influenza infection can affect people differently. Even healthy people can get very sick from the flu and sprea d it to others. The North Dakota Department of Health reports that 33.5% of adults age 65 and older did not receive a flu vaccine in the past year. Respondents to the CHNA generalizable survey report that 26% of children 18 years and younger did not receiv e a flu vaccine in the past year. Sanford has prioritized flu vaccines as a top priority and has set strategy to increase the number of flu vaccines provided to community members. The goal is to increase the number of flu vaccines provided to community me mbers. The measurable outcomes are the number of flu vaccines given to adults each year and the number of flu vaccines given to the pediatric population each year. 11 Sanford South University Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 12 Table of Contents Page Purpose of the Community Health Needs Assessment 18 Acknowledgements 18 Description of Sanford South University Medical Center 22 Description of the Community Served 23 Study Design and Methodology 24 Limitations of the Study 26 Key Findings 28 Comm unity Health Concerns Personal Health Concerns Demographics Health Needs and Community Resources Identified Prioritization How Sanford is Addressing the Needs 77 2016 -2019 Implementation Strategies 81 2013 Implementation Strategies Impact 85 Community Feedback from 2013 C ommunity Health Needs Assessment 90 Appendix 92 Primary Research Asset Map Key Stakeholder Facilitated Discussion Summary Generalizable Survey Results 13 General Health and Wellness Concerns about the Community Figure 1.

S outh University has 170 licensed beds and provides highly specialized services , including a behavioral health inpatient and partial hospitalization unit , an ea ting disorder inpatient and a partial hospitalization unit, palliative care, orthopedic, eye and other surgery, an inpatient rehabilitation unit and Center for Screening . Sanford is a major teaching hospital in partnership with area universities and the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences to provide clinical training for hundreds of medical students, medical residents, nurses and students in numerous health care and non -health care fields. Sanford also offers many activities and programs to attract high school and younger students to the health care field. Community involvement has played an important role in Sanford Medical Center's mission for over 100 years. Beyond providing medical care, Sanford supports and partners wit h local and national organizations that know and serve the communities across our region, providing health care awareness, education, prevention, fundraising and research for the health care issues that matter most to our communities. Sanford Health is t he largest employer in the Fargo -Moorhead community with a stable and growing workforce of 8,000 full-time employees. One out of every 27 people in Fargo -Moorhead currently works at a Sanford facility. 23 Community Served - Fargo -Moorhead -West Fargo Fargo is a diverse, dynamic, family -oriented community on the eastern border of North Dakota. It is the largest city in North Dakota, accounting for nearly 16 percent of the state population and the county seat of Cass County. Fargo and its twin city of M oorhead, Minn., and adjacent West Fargo, N.D. and Dilworth, Minn., form the core of the metro area, which in 2015 had a population of 225,000. Founded in 1871, Fargo is the economic center of southeastern ND. It is a cultural, retail, health care, educat ional and industrial hub for the region. The Fargo -Moorhead metro area has three universities: North Dakota State University, Concordia College, Minnesota State University Moorhead, and numerous other private and state colleges and technical schools and is home to over 30,000 students. Although the economy of the Fargo area has historically been dependent on agriculture, the city now has a growing economy based on food processing, manufacturing, technology, retail trade, higher education and health care. US News & World Report ranked Fargo as the #1 city for finding a job, Farmers Insurance named it the #3 most secure places to live, and Moving.com named it #5 on its list of best places to live in America. Fargo -Moorhead is home to a growing number of i nnovative technology and biomedical companies, attracted to the community by its educated workforce, low labor costs, favorable tax climate, advanced telecommunications infrastructure and available energy and water supplies. Education and health services account for the largest non -agricultural industries. 24 Study Design and Methodology 1. Generalizable Survey A generalizable survey was conducted of residents in Cass County, North Dakot a and Clay County, Minnesota . The survey instrument was developed in partnership with members of the Greater Fargo -Moorhead Community Health Needs Assessment collaborative, Sioux Falls community collaborative, Bismarck community collaborative, public health leaders from across the enterprise, and researchers at the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University (NDSU). The purpose of the generalizable survey of residents in the greater Fargo - Moorhead area (i.e., Cass County, North Dakota and Clay County, Minnesota ) was to learn about the percepti ons of area residents regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. Staff at the CSR, along with members of the collaborative, created the cover letter. Elements of informed consent were included in the letter ensuring that the NDSU Institutional Review Board requirements were met and the protection of human subjects maintained. The survey instrument was designed as a scannable 8 -page mail survey containing 5 4 questions. The questi ons focused on general community concerns, community health and wellness concerns, personal health, preventive health, and demographic characteristics. 25 Obtained through a qualified vendor, t he sample was a stratified random sample to ensure that appropr iate proportions from each of the two counties were included. A total of 1,500 records with names, addresses, and a few demographic indicators were included in the sample . Residents listed in the sample were first mailed an introductory postcard briefl y explaining the project and notifying them that a survey packet would be arriving in their mail. Survey packets, which contained the cover letter, scannable paper survey , and a pre-paid return envelope, were mailed three days af ter the introductory postca rds. Two percent of the packets were returned as undeliverable. A reminder postcard, containing a link to an on-line version of the survey, was mailed to non -responders approximately 10 days after the initial survey was mailed. A total of 39 8 paper surve ys were returned for scanning and an additional 3 surveys were completed on-line for a total of 401; the response rate was 27 percent. It was apparent that elderly and male respondents were overrepresented in the scanned results. Therefore, post -stratifica tion weight s were used to ensure proper representation of the population with respect to age and gender. Respondents who did not enter a gender and age response were eliminated from the analys is. A total of 3 82 surveys were analyzed , providing a generaliz able sample with a confidence level of 95 percent and an error rate of plus or minus 5.2 percentage points. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns . Needs rankin g 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. Many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by Sanford. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 2. Non -Generalizable Survey A non -generalizable on-line survey was conducted through a partnership between the Greater Fargo - Moorhead Community Health Collaborative and the Center for Social Research (CSR) at North Dakota State University. The CSR developed and maintained links to the on-line survey tool. The website address for the survey instrument was distributed via e -mail to various agencies, at times using a snowball approach . Data collection occurred throughout the month of June 2015 and a total of 51 respondents participat ed in the on-line survey. The purpose of this non -generalizable survey of community leaders in the greater Fargo -Moorhead area (i.e., Cass County, North Dakota and Clay County, Minnesota) was to learn about the perceptions of area community leaders regarding community health, their pe rsonal health, preventive health, and the prevalence of disease. This group included community leaders, legislators, and agency leaders representing chronic disease and disparity. A Likert scale was developed to determine the respondent's highest concerns . Needs ranking 3.5 and above were included in the needs to be addressed and prioritized. As stated in the generalizable survey methodology, many of the identified needs that ranked below 3.5 are being addressed by Sanford. However, 3.5 and above was used as a focus for the purpose of the required prioritization. 3. Community Stakeholder Meeting Community stakeholders were invited to a meeting to review the early finding s from the generalizable survey and to discuss the top health issues or health -related issues facing the community. Over 200 individuals were invited to attend from county commissions, city council s, school boards, and agencies representing the chronic dise ase groups and disparity. There were 53 actual attendees at the July 2015 community stakeholder meeting and the discussion helped to determine key priorities for the community. 26 4. Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the data and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available in the community to address the needs. The Greater Fargo Moorhead Community Health Needs Assessment Collaborative performed the asset mapping and reviewed the findings. The group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what need s remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. The multi -voting methodology was implemented t o determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. 5. Secondary Research 2015 Assessment of American Indian Residents Persons who self -identified as American Indian/Alaska Native were targeted for this study. Survey data was collected in July 2015 during the Fargo -Moorhead \"Honoring Traditions of Health Wellness Community Health Fair\" at Carl Ben Eielson Middle School in Fargo, North Dakota. There were 96 participants in this study. The secondary data includes community health profiles from the North Dakota Department of Health for Cass County, North Dakota and the Minnesota Department of Health for Clay County Minnesota. The indicators that were reviewed for this assessment include: population data, vital stat istics, adult behavioral risk factors, crime and child risk. Additionally, the County Health Rankings were included in the findings. Limitations of the Study The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in Cass County, North Dakota and Clay County, Minnesota. However, when comparing certain demographic characteristics (i.e., age, income, minority status) with the current population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, it was evident that older, white, more highly educated, and higher income earners were overrepresented. Overrepresentation of this nature is typical in health needs assessments. Literature reviews indicate that there are nonresponse rate issues among younger respondents. In particular, response rates to health care and community health needs assessment surveys have often been found to be higher for older respondents. Studies have also shown lower response rates for socially disadvantaged groups (i.e., socially, cultural ly, or financially). A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad based of the community. Invitations were extended to county and community leaders , organizations and agencies representing diverse populations and disparities . A total of 53 at tended the community stakeholder discussion. The findings of the American Indian Resident survey only represent American Indian participants attending the health fair and may not be representative of other American Indians in the Fargo - Moorhead area. A total of 96 American Indian residents participated in the survey. 27 Additional data was reviewed through secondary research. The data for the secondary research was secured from the North Dakota Department of Health and the Minnesota Department of Health. The Internal Revenue Code 501 (r) statute requires that a broad base of key community stakeholders have input into the needs of the community. Those community members specified in the statute include: persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility including those with special expertise in public health; Federal, tribal, regional, state and or local health or other departments or agencies with information relevant to the health needs of the community served; leaders, representatives, or members of medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations. Sanford extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community representatives in the survey process. In some cases there were surveys that w ere submitted without names or without a specified area of expertise or affiliation. We worked closely with public health experts throughout the assessment process. Public comments and response to the community health needs assessment and the implementati ons strategies are welcome on the Sanford website under \"About Sanford\" in the Community Health Needs Assessment section. 28 Key Findings 29 Community Health Concerns Aging Population The greatest area of concern among respondents is for the aging population, including the cost and availability of long term care. The availability of memory care is also a significant concern. Secondary research finds that 10.5 percent of the population in Cass County and 12.4 percent of the population in Clay County are over 65 years of age. Level of concern with statements about the community regarding the AGING POPULATION The North Dakota Long Term Care Association states that a primary reason for the concern about the cost of long term care is because people are not purchasing long term care insurance. Once long term care services are required it may be a surprise to learn the true cost of the service. Resources for family/friends and resources for the elderly to help them stay in their home s are becoming widely available through programs such as the North Dakota State University Extension Office a nd the Sanford Faith Community Nurse Program. American Indian (AI) Survey Responses AI respondents had higher mean scores for level of concern for most issues related to the aging population as compared to generalizable survey respondents ( OA) respondents for most issues, except for long term care. 3.15 3.18 3.23 3.4 3.44 3.51 3.63 4.11 2.84 3.1 3 3.49 3.35 3.26 3.71 4.16 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5Cost of activities for seniors (N=374) (N=50)Availability of resources for grandparents caring for grandchildren (N=372) (N= 50)Availability of activities for seniors (N=375) (N= 51)Availability of resources to help the elderly stay safe in their homes (N=370) (N=51)Availability of resources for family/friends caring for and making decisions for elders (N=375) (N=51)Availability of long term care (N=377) (N=50)Availability of memory care (N=378) (N=51) Non-Generalizable Generalizable 30 Level of concern with statements about the community regarding the AGING POPULATION Health Care Access and Cost Top priorities among residents (generalizable survey) relate to cost issues (i.e., access to affordable health insurance, affordable health care, and affordable prescription drugs), whereas top priorities among community leaders (non-genera lizable survey) relate to service delivery (i.e., timely access to mental health providers, access to substance use providers, and the use of emergency room services for primary health care). Secondary research through the 2015 County Health Rankings finds that 7 % in Cass Cou nty and 6% in Clay County report that they could not see a doctor due to the cost . 3.51 4.11 1 2 4 5Cost of activities for seniors (n: AI=95, OA=374)Availability of activities for seniors (n: AI=92, OA=375)Availability of resources for family/friends caring for and making decisions for elders (n:...Availability of resources for grandparents caring for grandchildren (n: AI=93, OA=372)Availability of resources to help the elderly stay safe in their home (n: AI=93, OA=370)Availability of memory care (1=Not at All; 5=A Great Deal) Overall American Indian 31 Level of concern with statements about the community regarding HEALTH CARE Access to care includes the ability to gain entry into a health system or provider service. Access can include the availability of health care provi ders and a workforce available to address the needs. Limited access can challenge the ability to receive appropriate levels of care and may pave the way to the ut ilization of higher cost entry points into the system through the emergency room. The cost of care may influence the health of individuals. A Dartmouth study finds that North Dakota is considered a high quality state for health care in comparison to other states. North Dakota is also considered to deliver health care at a l ow cost in comparison to other states. 2.11 2.22 2.32 2.37 2.56 2.66 2.66 2.74 2.79 3.27 2.16 2.48 2.76 2.4 2.76 2.8 3.1 2.71 3.82 4 3.12 3.28 3.72 3.27 3.23 3.25 3.43 3.65 3.55 3.67 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5Timely access to bilingual providers and/or translators (N=370) (N=48)Timely access to exercise specialists or personal trainers (N=367) (N=49)Timely access to registered dietitians (N=361) (N=48)Timely access to (N=363) (N=49)Timely access to vision care providers (N=372) (N=48)Distance to health care services (N=376) (N=51)Timely access to prevention programs and services (N=366) (N=50)Availability of transportation (N=377) (N=50)Timely access to dental care providers (N=376) (N=49)Timely access to substance abuse providers (N=369) (N=50)Timely access to mental health providers (N=372) (N=50)Providers not taking new patients (N=375) (N=50)Coordination of care between providers and services (N=372) (N=49)Availability of non-traditional hours (e.g., evenings, weekends) (N=377) (N=50)Use of emergency room services for primary health care (N=373) (N=47)Timely access to physician specialists (N=375) (N=49)Timely access to doctors, physician assistants, or nurse practitioners (N=378) (N=48)Cost of affordable vision insurance (N=377) (N=51)Cost of affordable dental insurance coverage (N=376) (N=51)Access to affordable prescription drugs (N=377) (N=51)Access to affordable health care (N=378) (N=51)Access to affordable health insurance (N=374) (N=51) Non-Generalizable Generalizable 32 American Indian Survey Reponses AI respondents had a higher level of concern than OA respondents for the majority of health care - related issues with the exception of access to affordable health insurance, access to affordable prescription drugs, and access to affordable health care.

Mean (1=Not at All; 5=A Great Deal) Overall American Indian 33 Sanford provides a Community Care Program and financial assistance policy to address assistance to all who qualify for charity care. During fiscal year 201 5 Sanford contributed over $5 8 million for charity care for our patient population that required care without the ability to pay for services . Sanford has financial counselors available at all clinic and medical center facilities to assist patients with applications for assistance and access needs. One example of a community resource that is addressing the access needs of patients is Sanford's My Sanford Nurse Program (formerly called Ask -A-Nurse) . My Sanford Nurse served 324,295 individuals from throughout the footprint and nation during fiscal year 2014 and provided a community benefit of over $1. 8M with more than 45,965 nursing staff hours. There is no fee for this service. Timely access for mental health and behavioral health providers continues to remain a concern across the community. Workforce gaps among mental health and behavioral health providers remain a challenge. Sanford has an aggressive recruiting program and cont inues to recruit these experts to our community. The North Dakota Human Services Behavioral Health Interim Committee is also focused on developing the behavioral health workforce for the state in the areas of adult psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiat ry, and substance abuse providers. Sanford leaders are serving on the stakeholder group with this interim committee , along with other community providers. Physical and Mental Health Both community leaders and residents have moderately high levels of con cern for physical and mental health issues. The top concern among community leaders is depression, whereas the top concerns among residents are cancer and chronic disease. Additional high ranking concerns include Inactivity and lack of exercise, obesity, p oor nutrition, infectious disease , dementia and Alzheimer's disease , stress, and suicide. Community leaders have slightly higher levels of concern than residents about inactivity and lack of exercise, poor nutrition eating habits, and obesity . Depress ion and stress are moderately high mental health concerns among residents. However, community leaders are more concerned than residents about suicide. Secondary research through the 2015 County Health Rankings find that the average number of self - reported mentally unhealthy days reported in the last 30 days is at 2.4 days in Cass County and 2.8 days in Clay County. Cass County residents reporting poor or fair health is at 10 % and Clay County is at 11 %. Cass County residents reporting that they are obese is at 27 %; Clay County is at 30%. Cass County residents who report being physically inactive is at 21 %; 24% of the resident s in Clay County report being p hysically inactive . (See Appendix ) The North Dakota Department of Health reports that 6.2 % of Cass County residents have been told by the ir health provider that they have cancer (excluding skin cancer).

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States for the adult population. Ac cording to the UND School of Medicine and Health Sciences 2015 Biennial Report , digestive system cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in our state, followed by breast cancer. The study finds that the risk of cancer in North Dakota is higher than in the rest of the nation. 3.57 Alzheimer's Disease (n: OA=374)Infectious diseases All; 5=A Great Deal) Overall American Indian 36 Sanford is committed to serving the cancer needs of our community through the Roger Maris Cancer Center and the 13 medical oncologists/hematologists, 5 radiation oncologists, 2 pediatric oncologists/hematologists, 7 palliative car e board certified physicians, 1 oncology clinical psychologist, 1 medical geneticist , 3 genetic counselors, 1 doctor of nursing practice, 2 physician assistants, 2 nurse practitioners, 7 pharmacists, 4 radiation oncology medical physicists, and several hundred nurses. Sanford's Roger Maris Can cer Center holds a number of accreditations including Joint Commission Accreditation, the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer - Silver Commendation, the National Accreditation Program for Breast Cancer through the American College of Surgeons Accredi tation by the American College of Radiology - Radiation Oncol ogy, Edith Sanf ord Breast Health Comprehensive Center recognized as a Certified Quality Breast Center of Excellence through the National Consortium of Breast Centers, Breast Imaging Center of Excellence through the American College of Radiology, Certification by the Qual ity Oncology Practice Initiative through the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the Advanced Care Certification by The Joint Commission for Palliative Care Services . The Sanford Roger Maris Cancer Center desires to detect cancer at earlier stages when there is a better chance for cure. On e example of the Center's focus on early detection is for colorectal screenings. Colorectal cancer screenings can detect precancerous colorectal polys which, if removed, can prevent colorectal cancer and reduce a n individual's colorectal cancer risk by 50 percent. In 2014 at Sanford Roger Maris Cancer Center there were 158 colorectal cancer cases, 74 (47%) of which were more advanced (stage 3 or 4). Treatment results compared favorably with other cancer centers in the region and nationally. North Dakota is at the bottom third of the country for colorectal cancer screenings, which leads to later detection and more advanced colorectal cancer stages. Having one of the familial cancer syndromes increases the likelih ood of developing cancer. The Roger Maris Cancer Center has a familial cancer syndrome clinic, where the team assists in coordinating care and helping individuals with an increased risk of cancer to plan for future screenings, and customizes the patient's treatment plan. Genetic risk assessment is an important component of the care at the Sanford Roger Maris Can cer Center. 37 Concerns about other chronic disease s: The top chronic diseases among respondents and community leaders include hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, asthma and arthritis. Respondents were also concerned about comorbidities such as obesity, poor nutrition and lack of physical activity . The N orth Dakota Department of Health reports that 22.5 % of Cass County resident s have been diagnosed with arthritis and 8.5 % of residents currently have asthma. The state health data also reports that 63.6 % of Cass County residents are overweight or obese. The percentage of Cass County residents who r eport that they have been told by their provider that they have hypertension is 27.7 % and 33.2 % report the same for high cholesterol. Additionally, 22.8 % of Cass County resident s report never having a cholestero l test. (See A ppendix) Whether respondents have any of the following chronic diseases American Indian Survey Reponses Respondents were asked if they have any of the following chronic diseases: hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, high cholesterol, asthma, COPD, congestive heart failure, stroke, Alzheimer's, or cancer. AI respondents were most likely to state they have hypertension or arthritis (16.7%, respectively) (Table 8, Appendix Table 18). None of the AI respondents stated they have cancer or Alzheimer's. AI respondents were much more likely than OA respondents to state they have diabetes (15.6% vs. 6.2%), while OA respondents were more likely than AI respondents to state they have high cholesterol (19.8% vs. 12.5%). 0.1 0.8 0.8 1.3 3.5 5.1 6.2 14.9 15.1 19.8 0 0 0 11.8 3.9 2 2 19.6 9.8 0 5 10 15 20 25Alzheimer'sStrokeCongestive Heart FailureCOPDAsthmaCancerDiabetesArthritisHypertensionHigh cholesterol Non-Genralizable Genralizable 38 Presence of Chronic Diseases Chronic diseases Percent* American Indian (n=96) Overall (n=382) Hypertension 16.7 15.1 Arthritis 16.7 14.9 Diabetes 15.6 6.2 High cholesterol 12.5 19.8 Asthma 10.4 3.5 COPD 2.1 1.3 Congestive heart failure 1.0 0.8 Stroke 1.0 0.8 Alzheimer's 0.0 0.1 Cancer 0.0 5.1 *Percentages do not total 100.0 due to multiple responses. Chronic diseases are among the most common, costly, and preventable of health problems. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about 50% of all adults or over 117 million people have one or more chronic health conditions. One in four adults have two or more chronic health conditions (2012 data). Sanford is actively working to address chronic disease through programs and quality indicators. The optimal vascular care includes 4 crit eria: BP < 140/90, statin use ( as recommended), daily aspirin, and no use of tobacco. Execut ion of these criteria has created positive outcomes for the patients with vascular (including hypercholesterolemia) issues. Cardiovascular disease refers to any disease of the heart or vasc ular system, includi ng heart attack, stroke, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Heart disease and stroke continue to be the leading cause of death and disability across the United States. Concern about cholesterol : The Sanford Heart Center in Fargo provides a comprehensive team of specialists and therapists who use advanced technology and proven treatments that beat national standards in speed and survival and above average outcomes. Medical services specialties offere d in the Fargo market include: Cardiac Electrophysiology Cardiac Rehabilitation Cardiology Cardiovascular Occlusion Thoracic Surgery Trans catheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) 39 Sanford Heart is committed to continuous improvement, through expanding services and treatment options, clinical trials, and technological medica l advancements. Center for Screening Prevention is the best way to ward off heart disease. Sanford has made a great effort to help the community by offering a convenient an d inexpensive heart assessment which includes calcium scoring. The Heart Screen at the Sanford Center for Screening uses advanced tools and diagnostics to uncover critical details about the he alth of your heart. Our screenings include: CT calcium score EKG Non -fasting cholesterol Blood pressure Body Mass Index (BMI) Framingham Score (risk estimate for developing heart disease in the next 10 years) http://www.sanfordhealth.org/fargo/services/heart -vascular -screenings Concerns about hypertension : Hypertension is also known as high blood pressure. Often there are no symptoms wit h this condition which is why it is called the \"silent killer\". The American Hear t Association reports that 1 in three adults, or approximately 80 million people , in the Uni ted States will have high blood pressure. Other than pregnancy, hypertension is the most common reason for adult o ffice visits. Despite the number of resources used to treat hypertension, only about 50 % of hypertensive patients have their BP under control using the definition of less than 140/90. Studies show 35 to 60 % of health care professionals measure BP incorre ctly. Surprisingly, even a small difference in measurement can have a considerable impact on the prevalence of cardiovascular events and life expectancy. Researchers approximate overestimating BP could lead to nearly 30 million Americans receiving inapprop riate treatment each year, unnecessarily exposing them to potential adverse side effects and increased health care costs. On the other hand, measuring BP even 5 mmHg too low will miss as many as 21 million people with hypertension in the U.S. each year. Hypertension is addressed at Sanford through a standardized protocol, frequent blood pressure monitoring, and referral throughout all department. Continued improvement has been realized since the implementation of the standardized protocol. Heart Check Centers at West Acres Mall and Airport As a benefit to the community of Fargo, Sanford Health has placed blood pressure kiosk s in the West Acres Mall and at Hector Airport. The blood pressure kiosks offer a place for members of the community to go to fr eely test their blood pressure. The kiosk at the West Acres Mall now offers additional information regarding blood pressure, weight management, orthopedic services, how to find a doctor and information about heart and stroke warning signs. Should participa nts choose to input an email address, additional health information about Sanford will be sent to them. The kiosk at the mall has historically serviced about 100 people daily. 40 Concerns about asthma : Asthma is addressed through the Sanford respiratory care asthma educators. The quality plan uses the asthma control test and seeks to reduce the percentage of patients with persistent asthma and elevated exacerbations. Additionally the Sanford chronic obstructive pulm onary disease ( COPD) progra m was designated a \"Best Practice\" by the Advisory Board. The COPD program reduced readmission rates from 28% to 7% and care compliance increased from 58% to 93% after new standardized protocol was implemented. Concerns about diabetes : Sanford offers a co mprehensive diabetes education program . Sanford diabetes clinics and centers are dedicated to empowering people with diabetes to feel better and prevent long -term complications. Sanford offer s assessment and personalized education care to give patients and their families the tools they need to manage diabetes while living well. Endocrinologists, certified diabetes nurses and certified diabetes dieticians provide diagnosis, assessment, one -on-one education , and instruction. The chronic disease self -managem ent Better Choices, Better Health Program at Sanford is offered free of charge to com munity members. Better Choices, Better Health is modeled after Stanford University's chronic disease self -management program. The workshops are 2\u00bd hours long and meet weekly for 6 weeks. The program is facilitated by two trained lay leaders and one or both have a chronic condition. Rese arch has found that after participating in the program individuals are better able to manage their symptoms, communicate more easily with their doctors, are less limited by the disease, and generally feel better. Concerns about obesity, poor nutrition and lack of physical activity : Sanford Enterprise chose obesity as an implementation strategy for the 2013 CHNA. Strategies included an annual o besity symposium for providers and monthly education programs for community members. The Sanford obesity symposium was attended by more than 400 registrants during April 2013 and March 2015 . The symposium will be held again during March 2016. The symposium is evidence based . Sanford providers and national experts serve as faculty for the symposium. 41 The YMCA Family Wellness Center in Fargo , in partnership with Sanford Health , offer s many classes each week that address wellness for children and families . The Family Wellness Center has multiple group exercise rooms as well as classrooms for educational events. Children and families have numerous fitness options as well as classes that address health, healthy nutrition and healthy cooking. The Family Wellness Center is a place for the ent ire family with drop -in child care, a kid - friendly pool with water slide, swimming lessons , and an open gym for free play. Sanford Fargo provides numerous services, classes and event s to address obesity. During FY 2014 Sanford dietitians and exercise spe cialists provided leadership for the Schools Alive events at more than a dozen schools. The Sanford Health Fargo Region licensed registered dietitians and exercise physiologists provided expert clinical guidance for the new Family fit Night programs in a rea schools. These programs, scheduled on a monthly basis, provided educational sessions on health, nutrition and physic al fitness, as well as provid ing a time for creative physical activity with children and family members. The local elementary schools were selected in partnership with Sanford, TNT Kids Fitness , and the Boys and Girls Club. Over 2,200 parents and children attended these events in 2014. The adult weight management program \"Honor Your Health\" is a comprehensive wellness program developed by Sanford Health Fargo Region which focuses on evidenced -based nutrition standards, physical activity and behavioral health. This class is offered for adults and provides a basis for young parents as well as all adults to learn about health and wellness. Th is program is a comprehensive approach to healthy lifestyle practices and may facilitate healthy behaviors for families. The Sanford athletic training coverage at high school, college and local sporting events promotes wellness and fitness. During fiscal year 2014 the Fargo athletic trainers contributed over $1,300,000 in community benefit to local sports teams at sporting events. Sanford support s physical activity through sponsorships of numerous active living and sporting events and numerous local sports teams. Camp Fuel is a program for youth focusing on healthy self -esteem and body image and includes curriculum for healthy nutrition and activity. The camp promotes a positive self -image and strives to create an understanding that the body requires \"fuel\" from the foods we eat and burn. Topics covered in this camp include portions, dining out choices, label reading to create knowledge of purchasing options, increasing activity and the importance of an active lifestyle, behaviors that promote a health y lifestyle, positive self -esteem, and body image. This camp is conducted at the Family Wellness Center during the summer months. The Sanford Health fit initiative, http://sanfordfit.org/ a childhood obesity prevent ion initiative, continues to grow and mature as we work to refine the offerings and enable broad replication and meaningful use. Supported by the clinical experts of Sanford Health, fit educates, empowers and motivates families to live a healthy lifestyle through a comprehensive suite of resources for children, parents, teachers and clinicians. fit is the only initiative focusing equally on the four key contributing factors to childhood obesity: Food (nutrition), Move (activity), Mood (behavioral health), and Recharge (sleep). Sanford's fit Initiative has come a long way since its inception in 2010. Through fit we are actively working to promote healthy lifestyles in homes, schools, daycares, our clinical settings, and throughout the community by way of tec hnology, engaging programs, and utilizing key role models in a child's life. The fit website for juniors, kids and teens creates an entertaining and interactive on-line environment where they can play games, watch vide os and take daily challenges. Parents benefit from their own set of resources where they can find tips and tools on becoming 42 healthy role models and raising fit kids. To date, the children's and parent's sites have received more than 7.5 million visitors. Over 700 pieces of content have been added to the sites including videos, slideshows, games, articles, and even fit songs ! In addition to the web, fit is developing meaningful school resources to bring value and fun into the primary education setting. We are doing this by integrating fit points into science and math components to provid e health promotion, an avenue into the classroom without taking valuable time away from those critical subjects. fit4Schools - fit4Schools includes unique fit-based lessons integrated into daily classroom activities . fit4schools.sanfordfit.org is an on -line school resource that incorporates topics into math and science curriculum. To date the program has 14 STEM (integrating science, technology, engineering, and math) unit plans that can be downloaded for classroom use. To date it has: o Reached 50,000 sc hools o 180,000 page views from educators across the country o 12,000 lesson plan downloads, representing 600,000+ students We are also reaching thousands of students through several pilot school programs. o fit4Schools - fit4Schools, which includes unique fit-based lessons integrated into daily classroom activities, is in its final phase of development. It is being piloted in seven elementary schools in the Sanford region. Community o The fit friends, Denny, Abby, Sam, Alex and Marty, along with the fit team, h ave been making a variety of appearances at events across the Sanford footprint! fit has been at over 2 dozen events interacting with more than 15,000 children and parents to spread the word about the fit platform and resources. o Smartphone Apps - Through a series of fun and engaging apps, fit will continue to activate kids at the touch of a fingertip to live a fit and healthy lifestyle related to Mood, Recharge, Food and Move. o MOVE2Draw is a simple and fun way for kids to move and create their own unique drawings. Once a drawing is completed, it can be stored on the MOVE2Draw website. o eMOODicam is a photo application that allows the user to enhance a photo and bring the mood to life and share with others. Looking Forward o fit is continuing to look to the future for ways to continue to make a meaningful impact on children and families both on -line and off -line. Other exciting expansions that are in the works include: Clinical Setting - Resources for the clinical setting to spur actionable and understandable discussions between health care providers and families. Health Coaches - Exploring meaningful ways for health coaches to promote healthy choices with children and adults . Engage Key Role Models - Firefighters and youth sport coaches are role models and have a big influence on children so that's why fit is developing resources for them to teach the principles of fit along with sports fundamentals and other outreach efforts. 43 fitClub 4 Boys - 10-week after school program for boy s, ages 8 -12, to develop knowledge of fit principles and healthy behavior choices. fit Parent/child - Class for parents and children to understand healthy choices and the benefit s of living a healthy lifestyle. Concerns about m ental/behavioral health : A second implementation strategy set by Sanford is to fully integrate behavioral health services or access to behavioral health outreach in all regional clinic sites in the Fargo, Sioux Falls, Bismarck and Bemidji regions. A key implementation strategy for Sanford Health is to fully integrate behavioral health services into all primary care clinics . Sanford One Care is a new approach to addressing behavioral health in primary and specialty care clinics and medical centers. Sanford One Care uses technology to conduct behavioral health screenings in order to identify behavioral health concerns as early as possible. Through deployment of Medical Home with fully integrated behavioral health care services, Sanford is providing patient -centered care co llaborative teams to meet the needs of Sanford patients. Depression is addressed at Sanford through PHQ -9 screening at the primary care office followed by management of the disease through a health care team. During 2015 Sanford hoste d a behavioral health symposium. The symposium was designed to enhance the competence of health care professionals in the identification, treatment and management of behavioral health issues impacting specialty and primary care. Sanford behavioral health experts are serving on the North Dakota Behavioral Health Stakeholders Advisory to the Department of Human Services Legislative Interim Committee to shape policy. The North Dakota Behavioral Health Stakeholders group works to address unmet needs in behavioral health in North Dakota. Using a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) template of the components of a comprehensive system of behavioral health care, the group has identified needs in North Dak ota and is working on solutions to meet those needs. Types of behavior al health services addressed by this group include adult mental health, children's mental health, substance abuse, and workforce development. 44 Safety Respondents have moderately high le vels of concern with respect to safety issues (i.e., presence of street drugs, prescription drugs, and alcohol in the community; crime; presence of drug dealers in the community; domestic violence; child abuse and neglect) . Regarding safety issues overall, residents have higher levels of concern than community leaders. However, the presence of street drugs, prescription drugs, and alcohol in the community is the top safety concern among both residents and community leaders. Crime, the presence of drug deale rs in the community, child abuse and neglect, presence of gang activity, sex trafficking, and domestic violence are other moderately high concerns among residents and community leaders, although at higher levels of concern among residents. Secondary research finds that alcohol -impaired driving deaths ha ve reached 30 % in Cass County and 22% in Clay County .

Sanford supports other services for the homeless population in our area including the Cooper House, the Coalition for Homeless, the Community of Care Task Force, Churches United for the Homeless, and Gourmet Soup Kitchen. Sanford supports the Great Plains Food Bank and the Daily Bread Program . Personal Health Concerns Respondents ' Personal Health Status The study results suggest possible discrepancies between respondents' perceived personal health and their actual health status as determined by objective measures. For example, using the Body Mass Index (BMI) which calculates weight status using an individual's weight and height , the majority of respondents in the metro area are overweight or obese. However, the vast majority of community respondents rate their own healt h as excellent, very good, or good. With good overall health habits in mind, it is important to note that within the past year, three in four respondents visited a doctor or health care provider for a routine physical and the vast majority visited a dentis t or dental clinic. Respondents' rating of their health in general 89.5% of the generalizable respondents rate the ir health as good or better 96% of the key stakeholder% of respondents reported that their health is good or better American Indian Survey Reponses Respondents were asked to rate their health . Nearly 40 % of AI respondents stated their health was \"Fair\" or \"Poor\", compared to 10.5% of OA respondents (Figure 10, Appendix Table 2). OA respondents were more than 2.5 times as likely as AI respondents to state their health was \"Very Good\" or \"Excellent\" (52.5% vs. 19.1%). 0.1 1.4 9.1 37 41.3 11.2 0 2 2 28 52 16 0 10 20 30 40 50 60Don't knowPoorFairGoodVery GoodExcellent Non-Generalizable Generalizable 52 Respondents' rating of their health in general Respondents' weight status based on the Body Mass Index (BMI) scale 69.5 % report a BMI that is overweight or obese in the non -generalizable group 61.3% in the generalizable group American Indian Survey Reponses Respondents were asked to report their current height and weight. Using this information, body mass index (BMI) was calculated for each respondent. More than half (51.8%) of AI respondents were considered to be obese (BMI of 30.0 or greater), while less than one -third (29.6%) of OA respondents were considered to be obese .

Obesity can have adverse effects on health and lead to a reduced life expectancy. Adults with a BMI over 25 are considered overweight and adults with a BMI over 30 are considered obese. According to the CDC, obesity and overweight are the second leading cause of preventabl e deaths, tagging close behind tobacco use. Health conditions related to obesity: Coronary heart disease Type 2 diabetes Cancers ( endometrial, breast, and colon) Hypertension Dyslipidemia Stroke Liver and gallbladder disease Sleep apnea and respiratory p roblems Osteoarthritis Gynecological problems Nationally, more than 30 % of adults, 17 % of youth age 6 - 19 years, and more than 8 % of children 2 to 5 years of age are obese. 1.2 11.8 35.3 51.8 54 Source: Behav ioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, CDC The Midwest had the highest prevalence of obesity (30.7%), followed by the South (30.6%), the Northeast (27.3%), and the West (25.7%).

Community results indicate that within the past year, the majority of respondents had a blood pressure screening, blood sugar screening, cholesterol screening, dental screening, flu shot, pelvic exam (females), breast cancer screening (females), and cervical cancer screenin g (females). However, there are many screenings and tests that a majority of respondents did not receive (i.e., bone density test, cardio screening, glaucoma test, hearing screening, immunizations, STD test, vascular screening, colorectal cancer screening, prostate cancer screening (males), and skin cancer screening in the past year .

Mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat and before i t is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Having regular mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that if you are 50 to 74 years old, be sure to have a screening mammogram every two years. If you are 40 to 49 years old, talk to your doctor about when to start an d how often to get a screening mammogram. o Cervical cancer screening : Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecologic cancer to prevent, with regular screening tests and follow -up. Two screening tests can help prevent c ervical cancer or find it early: The Pap t est (or Pap smear) looks for pre-cancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately. 60 The HPV test looks for the virus that can cause these cell changes (human papillomavirus) (http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/) The Pap test is recommended for all women between the ages of 21 and 65 years old, and can be done in a doctor's off ice or clinic. o Colorectal cancer screening : Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can also find colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best. Regular screening, beginning at age 50, is the key to preventing colorectal cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for colorectal cancer using hig h-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy beginning at age 50 and continuing until age 75. o Prostate cancer screening : The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that men have a chance to make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate cancer. The decision should be made after getting information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening. Men should not be screened unless they have r eceived this information. The discussion about screening should take place at: Age 50 for men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and are expected to live at least 10 more years. Age 45 for men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. This inclu des African Americans and men who have a first -degree relative (father, brother or son) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than age 65). Age 40 for men at even higher risk (those with more than one first -degree relative who had prostat e cancer at an early age). After this discussion, those men who want to be screened should be tested with the prostate -specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be done as a part of screening. If, after this discussion, a man is unable to decide if testing is right for him, the screening decision can be made by the health care provider, who should take into account the patient's general health preferences and values. Assuming no prostate cancer is found as a result of screening, the time between future screenings depends on the results of the PSA blood test: Men who choose to be tested who have a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL may only need to be retested every 2 years. Screening should be done yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher. Because prostate cancer often grows slowly, men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10 -year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit. Overall health status, and not age alone, is important when making decisions about screening. Even after a decision about testing has been made, the discussion about the pros and cons of testing should be repeated as new information abo ut the benefits and risks of testing 61 becomes available. Further discussions are also needed to take into account changes in the patient's health, values and preferences. o Skin cancer screening : The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has conclude d there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against routine screening (total body examination by a doctor) to find skin cancers early. The USPSTF recommends that doctors: Be aware that fair -skinned men and women aged 65 and older, and people with atypical moles or more than 50 moles, are at greater risk for melanoma. Look for skin abnormalities when performing physical examinations for other reasons. Flu Vaccines The Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommen ds that everyone six months and older receive a flu vaccine annually. Findings from the generalizable survey indicate that 37% of respondents did not have a flu shot last year. The Center for Disease Control states that influenza is a serious disease t hat can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. Even healthy people can get sick from the flu and spread it to others. Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection aga inst infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. Sanford Health is addressing flu vaccines in the 2016 implementation strategy. Employees are required to have an annual flu vaccine as a protective measure for our patients as well as our staff. Sanford holds annual flu blitz events to increase the number of community members both pediatric and adult who receive the flu vaccine. Fruit and Vegetable Intake The s tudy r esults suggest that the majority of respondents do not meet vegetable and fruit recommended dietary guidelines. Only 24.1% of respondents in the generalizable group reported having 3 or more servings of vegetables the prior day, and 39.4 % in the non -generalizable group , while only 20.1% of the generalizable group reported having 3 or more servings of fruits the prior day, and 14.3% in the non -generalizable group . According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U .S. Department of Agriculture Dietary guidelines for Americans , it is recommended that individuals consume 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day and 2 to 4 servings of fruit per day depending on age . A diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk for chronic diseases. In addition, because fruits and vegetables have low energy density (i.e., few calories relative to volume), eating them as part of a reduced -calorie diet can be beneficial for weight management. Secondary research provided by the North Dakota Department of Health finds that 84.2 % of residents in Cass County report not getting 5 fruits and vegetabl es each day. (See Appendix) 62 Number of servings of vegetables, fruit, and fruit juice that respondents had yesterday Generalizable survey group Non -generalizable group ( community leaders) American Indian Survey Reponses Respondents were asked the number of servings of vegetables, fruits, and fruit juice they had consumed the previous day. One -fifth (21.1%) of AI respondents stated they had at least three servings of vegetables in the previous day. One -fourth (25.1%) of AI respondents stated they had at least three servings of fruits in the previous day. Responses for AI and OA respondents were comparable for fruits and vegetable intake.

In the generalizable group, 48.3% of respondents engage in moderate activity 3 or more times per week and 21% engage in vigorous activity 3 or more times per week. In the non -generalizable group, 51% engage in moderate activity 3 or more times per week and 20% in vigorous activity 3 or more times per week. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that individuals participate in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week to help sustain and improve health. Number of days in an average week respondents e ngage in MODERATE and VIGOROUS activity Generalizable survey group Non -generalizable group ( community leaders) American Indian Survey Reponses Respondents were asked the number of days the y get at least 30 minutes of moderate or vigorous activity, with moderate activity defined as causing light sweating and small increases in breathing or heart rate and vigorous activity causing heavy sweating and large increases in breathing or heart rate. Nearly one -third (29.2%) of AI respondents stated they participate in moderate activity at least five days a week, with more than one -fifth (12.5%) stating they participate in vigorous activity a minimum of five days a week (Table 2, Appendix Table 5). AI respondents were more likely than OA respondents to participate in either moderate (29.2% vs. 19.5%) or vigorous (12.5% vs. 7.7%) activity most days of the week. 7.7 13.3 32.9 46.2 19.5 28.8 35.2 16.5 0 10 20 30 40 505 or more days3 to 4 days1 to 2 daysNone 14.0 46.0 34.0 18.4 32.7 36.7 12.2 0 10 20 30 40 505 or more days3 to 4 days1 to 2 daysNone MODERATE activity (N=49) VIGOROUS activity (N=50) 64 Number of days in an average week respondents engage in MODERATE or VIGOROUS activity Activity Level Percent of respondents Frequency of Weekly Activity None 1 to 2 days 3 to 4 days 5 or more days AI Overall AI Overall AI Overall AI Overall Moderate Activity 3.1 16.5 39.6 35.2 28.1 28.8 29.2 19.5 Vigorous Activity 18.8 46.2 54.2 32.9 14.6 13.3 12.5 7.7 Moderate activity - n: AI=96, OA=380; Vigorous activity - n: AI=96, OA=377 Tobacco Use Study results indicate that the vast majority of community respondents are not currently tobacco users.

Mental health influences our physical health, how we handle stress , how we make choices, and how we relate to others. Among Fargo -Moorhead respondents , mental health is a moderately high area of concern , particularly depression , dementia and Alzheimer's disease. One in five respondents ha s been told or diagnosed by a doctor or health professional that they have anxiety or stress and a similar proportion ha s been told they have depression. In addition, half of respondents self -report that in the last month, there were days when their mental health was not good . 49.5% of the generalizable respondents reported days in the past month when their mental health was not good. 17.5% reported over 7 days . 58.3% of the non -generalizable respondents reported days in the past month when t heir mental health was not good, and 25% reported having over 7 days in the past month when their health was not good. One in 10 respon dents reported that their mental health was not good for at least half of the days in the last month. Furthermore, when asked specifically about particular mental health issues, one in five respondents reported little interest or pleasure in doing things f or several days or more in the last two weeks and one in six respondents say that for at least several days in the last two weeks they were feeling down, depressed or hopeless. 67 Percentage of respondents who have been told by a doctor or health profes sional that they have a mental health issue, by type of mental health issue Generalizable Group Non -Generalizable Group American Indian Survey Reponses Respondents were asked if they had been told by a doctor or health professional they have any of the following conditions: depression, anxiety/stress, panic attacks, or any other mental health problem.

In the Fargo - Moorhead community , one in five respondents drank alcoholic beverages on at least half of the days in the last month. On days they drank, one in eight respondents drank an average of four or more drinks per day. In regards to binge drinking, one in three respondents report binge drinkin g at least once per month. Specifically, 5 percent say they binge drink 2 to 3 times a week and an additional 3 percent binge drank almost every day in the past month. 33.2% of respondents report drinking at a binge level in the generalizable group and 21 % in the non -generalizable group at least once per month. Secondary research through the 2015 County Health Ranking indicates that 21% of Cass County and 23 % of Clay County residents report binge drinking.

Overall, o ne in six respondents report alcohol use has had harmful effects on them selves or a family member. Other forms of substance abuse include the use of prescription or non -prescription drugs. No respondents in the metro area reported having had a problem with prescription or non -prescriptio n drug abuse. However, respondents say prescription o r non-prescript ion drug abuse has had harmful effects on them selves or a family member. American Indian Survey Reponses Respondents were asked if they had a problem with alcohol use or prescription/non -prescription drug abuse and if so, if they got the help they needed. More than half of AI respondents (51.6%) stated they had a problem with alcohol use, and of these respondents, 56.3% stated they received the help they needed. More than one -fourth of AI respondents (26.4%) stated they had a problem with prescript ion/non -prescription drug abuse, and of these respondents, half stated they received help.

The unemployment rate in Cass County is 1.6% and the unemployment level in Clay County is 3%. 75 Health Needs and Community Resources Identified One of the requirements for a community health needs assessment is to identify the resources that are available in the community to address unmet needs. Asset mapping was conducted by reviewing the primary and secondary research and identifying the unmet needs from the various surveys and data sets. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were availabl e in the community to address the needs. The Greater Fargo Moorhead Community Health Needs As sessment Collaborative participated in the asset mapping and reviewed the research findings. The group conducted an informal gap analysis to determine what need s remained after resources were thoroughly researched. Once gaps were determined the group proceeded to the prioritization process. The multi -voting methodology was implemented to determine what top priorities would be further developed into implementation strategies. The process implemented in this work was based on the McKnight Foundation model - Mapping Community Capacity by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann, Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. The asset map includes identif ied needs from the following : Identified needs from the generalizable survey Identified needs from the non -generalizable survey Concerns expressed by the key stakeholder group Secondary research data Community resources that are available to address the ne ed(s) (See Appendix for the asset map. ) Prioritization The f ollowing needs were brought forward for prioritization: Economics - affordable housing and hunger Aging - cost and availability of long term care and availability of memory care Children and Youth - cost and availability of quality child care a quality infant care, bullying Safety - presence of drug dealers in the community and the presence of street drugs and alcohol in the community Health C are Access - access to affordable health care and a ffordable health insurance Physical Health - cancer, chronic disease, obesity, poor nutrition and inactivity Mental Health - depression, stress, substance use and abuse Preventive Health - flu vaccines Sanford is addressing all of the assessed needs that fall within our scope of work. In some cases the need is one where we do not have the expertise to adequate ly address the need ; however , Sanford leaders will communicate these findings with community leaders and experts who can best focus on a solution to the concern. 76 A document that shares what Sanford is doing to address the need or defends wh y Sanford is not addressing the need can be found in the Appendix. Members of the collaborative determined that flu vaccines are a top unmet need. Commu nity stakeholders also rated chronic disease and mental illness as top priorities. Sanford has determined the 2016 -2019 implementation strategies for the following ne eds: Hypertension Depression Flu vaccines 77 How Sanford is Addressing the Needs Identified Concerns How Sanford South University is Addressing the Needs Economics Availability of affordable housing Homelessness Sanford supports numerous community organizations that provide affordable housing an d solutions to community members in need of housing. Examples of community organizations that are supported include: The Greater Fargo/Moorhead Economic Development Corporation, Habitat for Humanity, The Farg o, Moorhead, West Fargo Chamber of Commerce, and the United Way of Cass and Clay. The Sanford Shelter Faith Community Nurse Program is lo cated at the YMCA and at Churches United for the Homeless. Sanford supports other services for the homeless population in our area including the Cooper House, the Coalition for the Homeless, the Community of Care Task Force, Churches United for the Homeless, and Gourmet Soup Kitchen. Sanford support s the Great Plains Food Bank and the Daily Bread Program. Sanford will als o address these needs by sharing the results of the CNHA with community leaders.

During fiscal year 2014 Sanford contributed o ver $51 million for charity care for our patient population who required care without the ability t o pay for services. Sanford has financial counselors available at all clinic and medical center facilities to assist patients with applications for assi stance and access needs. Sanford will also address this need by sharing the results of the CHN A with community leaders and legislators. Physical Health Cancer Chronic disease Inactivity/lack of exercise Obesity Poor nutrition and eating habits Infectious disease such as flu Sanford has set hypertension and flu vaccines as key implementation strategies for 2016 -2019. Sanford is committed t o serving the cancer needs of our community through the Roger Maris Cancer Center and the 13 medica l oncologists/hematologists. 5 radiation oncologists, 2 pediatric oncologists/hematologists, 7 palliative care board -certified physicians, 1 oncology clinica l psychologist, 1 medical geneticist, 3 genetic counsel ors, 1 doctor of nursing practice, 2 physician assistants, 2 nurse practitioners, 7 pharmacists, 4 radiation oncology medical physicists, and several hundred nurses. Sanford is actively working to add ress chronic disease through programs and quality indicators. The chronic disease self-management program at Sanford (Better Choices, Better Health) is offered free of charge to community members. Better Choices, Better Health is modeled after the Stanfor d University chronic disease self -management program. The workshops are 2 -1/2 hours long and meet weekly for 6 weeks. Sanford Enterprise chose obesity as an implementation strategy for the 2013 CHNA. Strategies included an annual obesity symposium for pro viders and monthly education programs for community members. The Sanford obesity symposium was attended by more than 400 registrants during April 2013 and March 2015. The symposium will be held again during March 2016. The symposium is evidence -based and Sanf ord providers and national experts serve as faculty. 79 Identified Concerns How Sanford South University is Addressing the Needs The Family Wellness Center i n Fargo offers many classes each week that address wellness for children and families in partnership with Sanford Health and the YMCA. The facilities have multiple gr oup exercise rooms as well as classrooms for educational events. Children and families have numerous fitness options as well as classes that address health, health y nutrition and healthy cooking. The Family Wellness Center is a place for the entire family , with drop -in child care, a kid -friendly pool with water slide, swimming lessons, and an open gym for free play. The adult weight management program \"Honor Your Health\" is a comprehensive wellness program developed by Sanford Health Fargo Region which foc uses on evidence -based nutrition standards, physical activity and behavioral health. This class is offered for adults and provides a basis for young parents as well as all adults to learn about health and wellness. This program is a comprehensive approach to healthy lifestyle practices and may facilitate health y behaviors for families. The Sanford Health fit initiative, a childhood obesity prevention initiative, continues to grow and mature as we work to refine the offerings and enable broad replication an d mean ingful use. Supported by the clinical experts of Sanford Health, fit educates, empowers and motivates fam ilies to live a healthy lifestyle through a comprehensive suite of res ources for kids, parents, teachers and clinicians. fit is the only initiative focusing equally on the four key contributing factors to childhood obesity: Food (nutrition), Move (activity), Mood (behavioral health), and Recharge (sleep). Sanford's fit initiative has come a long way since its inception in 2010. Through fit we are actively working to promote health y lifestyles in homes, schools, daycare s, our clinical settings, and throughout the community by way of technology, engaging programs, and utilizing key role models in a child's life. Mental Health Depression Dementia and Alzheimer's Stress Underage drug use and abuse Underage drinking Suicide Drug use and abuse Alcohol use and abuse Sanford has prioritized depression as a key implementation strategy for 2016 -2019. A key implementation strategy during 2013 -2016 for Sanford Health is to fully integrate behavioral health services into all primary care clinics. Sanford One Care is a new approach to addressing behavioral health in primary and specialty care clinics and medical centers . Sanford One Care uses technology to conduct behavioral health screenings in order to identify behavioral health concerns as early as possible. Through deployment of Medical Home with fully integrated behavioral health care services, Sanford is providing patient -centered care c ollaborative teams to meet the needs of Sanford patients. Sanford behavioral health experts are serving on the North Dakota Behavioral Health Stakeholders Advisory to the Department of Human Services Legislative Interim Committee to shape policy. The com mittee is 80 Identified Concerns How Sanford South University is Addressing the Needs addressing substance abuse, workforce, child and adolescent services and adult services. Sanford leaders also serve on the North Dakota Reducing Pharmaceutical Narcotics in Our Communities - Through Education and Awareness\" committee. During 2015 Sanford hosted a behavioral health symposium. The symposium was designed to enhance the competence of health care professionals in the identification, treatment and management of behavioral health issues impacting specialty and primary care. Sanford will also address this need by sharing the results of the CHNA with community leaders and legislators 81 2016 -2019 Implementation Strategies 82 Implementation Strategies Priority 1: Hypertension Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and contributes to premature death from heart attack, stroke, diabetes, and renal disease. The North Dakota Department of Health reports that 27.7% of the population in Cass County has been told by their provider that they have hyper tension. Sanford has prioritized hypertension as a top priority and has set strategy to standardize nursing protocol for blood pressure checks and rechecks.

Priority 2: Depression Depression is a common but serious illness that can interfere with daily life. Many people with a depressive illness never seek treatment. But the majority, even those with the most severe depression, can get better with treatment. The North Dakota Department of Health reports that 11.9% of residents in Cass County have reported fair or poor mental health days. County Health Rankings for Clay County indicate that 11% of the residents have fair or poor mental health. Sanford has prioritized depression as a top priority and has set strategy to perform assessments for depression and to improve PHQ -9 scores for patients who are a diagnosed with depression.

Priority 3: Flu Vaccines The C DC states that influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. Every flu season is different and influenza infection can affect people differently. Even healthy people can get very sick from the flu and spread it t o others. The North Dakota Department of Health reports that 33.5% of adults age 65 and older did not receive a flu vaccine in the past year. Respondents to the CHNA generalizable survey report that 26% of children 18 years and younger did not receive a fl u vaccine in the past year.

These programs, scheduled on a monthly basis, provided educational sessions on health , nutrition and physical fitness, as well as provid ing a time for creative physical activity with children and family members. The local elementary schools were selected in partnership with Sanford, TNT Kids Fitness , and the Boys and Girls Club. Over 2,200 parents and children attended these events in 2014. The adult weight management program \"Honor Your Health\" is a comprehensive wellness program developed by Sanford Health Fargo Region which focuses on evidenced -based nutrition standards, physical acti vity and behavioral health.

In 2016 a new fit initiative will be available for 20,000 classroom teachers . The classroom curriculum has numerous modules that teachers can access and implement in part o r comprehensively. Sanford' s Weight Los s Surgery Program is designated as a national Bariatric Center of Excellence and designation of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program Accredited Centers .

Through Sanford's relationship with the Neuropsychiatric Research Institute , our program is one of only six clinical centers in the United States selected by the Nation al Institutes of Health to participate in a bariatric research study known as LABS - short for Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery. This study brings together experts in weight loss surgery, obesity research, internal medicine and other related fields to analyze the risks and benefits of weight loss surgery and its impact on patients' health and quality of life and to identify which patients would most likely benefit from weight loss surgery. Sanford's Eating Disorders specializes in diagnosing and treating eating disorders in adolescents and adults. Clinical services to treat anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and related forms of disordered eating are available at Sanfor d. Treatment options include outpatient, partial hospital or full inpatient services.

There have been no comments to date aside from a question asked about the service area for this report. A reader wanted to know if a separate report was developed for the Lisbon, North Dakota area. Sinc e there is no hospital in Lisbon , a community health needs assessment was not conducted solely for that community. 92 APPENDIX 93 Primary Research 94 Fargo/Moorhead/Cass/Clay Asset Mapping Identified concern Community resources that are available to address the need Gap?

Knowing what CDC data is - showing difference s between community vs. national states Differen ce between community and s hareholder concerns vs. reality (2 responses) Stats re: feeling healthy but not getting follow -up; not thinking long term; fear of dentist The number of people who think they a re healthy but have health risks Concern regarding healthcare/long term care costs (2 responses) o Affordability still seems to be a big issue - new generation will not have enough o Respondents appear to be uninformed/confused about insurance o Cost and affordability even in sectors that may be considered o Disconnect in affordability Blood pressure status - doctor hasn't suggested Where are community healthcare / Family HealthCare Center? 3% say they binge drink on a daily basis (2 responses) Low reporting on prescription drug misuse and abuse (is an issue in rural areas) (2 responses) o Is low reporting rate due to self -reporting? 92% reported not using tobacco - lower than expected The smo king prevalence Lack of transportation - survey didn't identify this as a priority, esp. in rural areas (2 responses) Mental health for minors not emphasi zed Surprised that mental health did not come up as much this time, but depression was mentioned - did respondents not realize that depression is a mental illness? Homelessness/lack of affordable housing Child care Responses on elder care Reimbursement for parish nurse programs Rapid growth of the communities (mostly the priority population) and how CHNA data could affect funding in the areas needing the most work but isn't representative of the data Everyone was impressed with all of the initiatives and th e work being done through them; didn't know they were happening - how does the general public find out about all of this (2 responses) Based on the results, what do you feel is the biggest need for dedicated work in our community? Affordability seems to be a concern o Affordable care (esp. long term care) - based on results, although high percentage is insured o Long term care cost o Underinsured; uninsured Need more information: oral care, mental health (critical due to less stigma with self -reporting) Cancer screening rates issues statewide (wasn't teased out of survey) 106 New American services / cultural awareness and sensitivity Community -based services need to be emphasized Aging issues in general o Elderly nutrition - case management & prevention; tie to concer n about growing costs of nursing home care o Elder care/long term care o Aging life case management services at LSSND should be publicized more among partners o What are we doing to keep seniors in their homes to avoid the increasing cost of long term care? o No c lear communication plan for aging issues and unsure how to support o Long term care cost o The public can't respond to questions when they don't know about the problem; example: elder abuse - it's happening but people don't know about it. Education is extremely important - example: 51% didn't get a flu shot for \"another reason\" - why? More prevention Too much duplication/inefficiency in ND Not leveraging small size of ND - when we put our minds to it, we can really get things done Blue ribbon commission and state level coordination Legislators need to listen! Healthy initiatives - we are not making an impact on obesity and healthy habits - we need to kick start! Pull all organizations together to think about new ways of doing things Still need mental hea lth support and it interacts with other healthcare issues Binge drinking issue - how do we change the norm? Mental health (3 responses) Chronic disease Affordable housing Active living Obesity Cancer Worksite health Community walkability Physical health issues Does homelessness show anywhere? How can your organization address this need internally? If we work on prevention, th is will impact long term care/healthcare Work with key members on efforts with the City of Fargo Use data and research available Create policies in the workplace Offer a confidential Employee Assistance Program Determine w hat is available collectively - what is working on other organizations? 107 What ideas do you have in ways your role/organization could partner with other community resources to impact this need? SEHS mobile crisis unit home support, safety net including linking to services Better access to care plans for mental health; shared EHR Integrating behavioral health into all departments Being involved in collaboration o Voluntee ring time, working with your organization to offer time off for volunteering (i.e. City allows 1 hr./wk. to volunteer) o Collaboration between mainstream health organizations and community organizations in communicating t he true needs of the population o Learn about other organizations - what is available, costs o Better integration needed between services still siloed - don't feel we are moving together and increasing integration Reduce or reallocate resources (especially unnecessary ones; ex: ambulance calls for non - emergency needs). I asked about the necessity of community paramedics and everyone agreed that services rendered by CHW or CP will definitely reduce cost and also provide the needed services to priority population that has not been met in the past. Advertise or educate more about the assessment overall o Create comprehensive ways of delivering health info to the community. o Collaborate between three major universities and use college students for the work. College students are more willing, they have the time, and they need to be exposed to the realities of life in order to advocate for change through systems or policies. Change methodology of survey o Go door to door to reach more priority populations o Tap into community data through other organizations (may get more info on prioritized populations) o Reduce # of pages of survey (it's burdensome even for the educated population) o Incorporate information from school health survey or find other ways of reaching younger populations Utilize high risk care manage rs How do you plan to communicate the information from today to your organization? Engage with n ursing/dental students to help them understand need for all hands on board publicly to address needs Provide minority Native American viewpoint through NDSU st udy Inform staff about the survey results Focus on the elderly refugee mental health initiative - small numbers, manageable and very successful Discuss these issues/ideas with our organization Most want the needs of the people they serve to be reflective o f the overall data, so finding ways to get involved so that their voices are heard will be a priority Conduct all -staff meetings; communicate with other members of our organization Look at it as for a higher income concern Share true information with the d ifferent businesses that they contact with 108 OTHER Comments about the survey tool/how the survey was done/how to make it better The survey is a good starting point; impro ve the survey with a deeper dive How do we get a better representation over the next three years (use incentives to get better response rate , i.e. $10 to take the survey - funding: Essentia, Sanford, DMF?) Inconclusive results to the general population . How favorable the data is to these communities when the reality of these communities is far from what is presented Pattern of respondents from stakeholders and residents (explains the similarities in priorities) Was there a question that ask ed about social connectedness? Comments about who took the survey o Higher income self -reporting tool ma y not reflect reality o 99% of respondents are insured which means lots of people were missed o Limitations of the study (ethnicity, income, education, age). A lot of our discussion was focused on limitations because organizations at my table represented popul ations that weren't included. o Lack of focus on students, Native Americans, other races, all ages o There was discussion related to who answered the survey - higher income, higher educated, older o Low percentage of rental income individuals represented (93% o wn their own homes) o Concerns about the y ounger population being excluded Miscellaneous comments (didn't fit into the categories) Could do some really good research Talked about community paramedic opportunities Community awareness is very important Great to have local data to work with 109 Generalizable Survey Results General Health and Wellness Concerns about the Community Using a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 being \"not at all\" and 5 being \"a great deal,\" respondents were asked to rate their level of concern with various statements regarding ECONOMICS, TRANSPORTATION, the ENVIRONMENT, CHILDREN AND YOUTH, the AGING POPULATION, SAFETY, HEALTH CARE, PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALT H, and SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE.

Substance Use and ............................... 21 VI. ....... 53 169 Executive Summary Introduction The purpose of this survey was to obtain information related to perceptions of American Indian residents of Fargo, North Dakota and Moorhead, Minnesota regarding community health, their personal health, preventive health, and disease prevalence. The American Indian population was under - represented in previous health needs assessments conducted in the Fargo -Moorhead area (2013 and 2015). The current health needs assessment sought to obtain perceptions related to health needs specific to the American Indian population. The purpose of a health needs assessment is to promote health equity and access to health care and health coverage. Health needs assessments lacking accurate data from disparate populations makes community planning effo rts applicable only to the larger community. Primary Data Collection Methods Instrument Development Researchers utilized the survey tool originally created for the 2015 Greater Fargo -Moorhead Community Health Needs Assessment of Residents. Sampling and P rocedure Survey data was collected in July 2015 during the Fargo -Moorhead \"Honoring Traditions of Health Wellness Community Health Fair\" at Carl Ben Eielson Middle School in Fargo, North Dakota. Persons who self -identified as American Indian/Alaska Native were targeted for this study and respondents received a $10 incentive for survey completion. Surveys were completed in paper format and survey data were entered manually into an Excel spreadsheet. Data Analysis All data were analyzed using SPSS versi on 23.0. Limitations These findings only represent American Indian participants attending a health fair in Fargo, North Dakota and may not be representative of other American Indians in the Fargo -Moorhead area. 170 Survey Results It should be noted that within the survey results and appendix tables, specific abbreviations are used. American Indian is abbreviated to AI, and Overall, indicating the results from the 2015 Greater Fargo - Moorhead Community Health Needs Assessment, is abbreviated OA. In addit ion to being discussed as stand -alone results, the AI results will also be compared to the OA results. I. Level of Concern with Specific Issues On a scale from one to five with one being \"not at all\" and five being\" a great deal\", respondents were asked to rate their level of concern with specific statements related to larger community issues including: economics, transportation, the environment, children and youth, the aging population, safety, health care, physical and mental health, and substance use and abuse.
