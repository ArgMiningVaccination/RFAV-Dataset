Building physician practices.Supporting Mitochondria Through Nutrition Joseph Pizzorno, ND, delivered an inspiring presentation titled \"Mitochondria: the Foundation of Health\" at the 2014 Annual Restorative Medicine Conference. He summarized his lecture with a message that is vital to any clinician when treating a patient: \"Protecting and optimizing mitochondria is probably the most effective anti-aging strategy. \" Mitochondria are the cell's powerhouse, producing ATP from energy provided by food to power bodily functions. These energy-producers rely on key nutrients to maintain the body's relentless demand for ATP . Many of these nutrients are provided in Metabolic Nutrition, the high quality, super-bioavailable multivitamin, including:www.restorative.com 800-420-5801 VT 05602 fax: 800-621-1878 The statements on this page have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Thyroid complaints include fatigue, weight gain and depression, even despite normal hormone protocols. In this talk, Dr. Friedman will review published research regarding nutritional deficiencies and excesses which can contribute to hypothyroidism as well as treatment considerations and lifestyle measures. This class offers evidence-based suggestions that doctors can consider when treating symptomatic thyroid patients with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's disease. Goals and Objectives: Review thyroid autoimmune disease, Hashimoto's disease, and Graves' disease. Identify foods and nutritional interventions for autoimmune conditions based on published research. Recognize the many environmental influences on peripheral thyroid function such as Iodine, heavy metals, soy, and rosma-rinic acid that can alter thyroid function. 10:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. Sub Laboratory Hypothyroidism 2 CME/CE Denis Wilson, MD Recent research has demonstrated that much more regulation of the thyroid system occurs in the periphery than previously thought. The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is responsible for maintaining an appropriate level of thyroid hormones that the cells can use to provide for normal metabolism. Just as vital, recent research has uncovered thyroid signaling pathways that regulate the thyroid system on a cellular level. The ubiquitin proteasome system controls the level of deiodinase enzyme, thereby determining T4 to T3 conversion. All this crucial intracellular activity is not measured by thyroid blood tests. This might explain why some people have low body temperatures and symptoms of low thyroid function that may warrant the empirical use of T3. Goals and Objectives: Describe the physiology of thyroid hormone pathways and body temperature Name 3 intracellular signaling pathways that direct the conver - sion of T4 to T3 Understand the wide range of medical conditions that can be Presentation Descriptions22affected by body temperature and T3 Understand the intracellular physiology of thyroid hormones Explain when and why or why not T3 might be desirable as an empirical treatment Understand the risks of T3 and the concerns of the American Thyroid Association regarding the use of T3 2:00-3:00 and 4:45-5:45 p.m. The Brain and Wellbeing: Addressing Inflammation with Neuorendocrine Corrections 2 CME/CE (including 1 Pharmacology CE)Erin Lommen, ND Neurological fitness is an area that is rapidly evolving. Inflammation is recognized as the underlying basis of a vast number of conditions and diseases. The neurological impact is profound. The integral relationship between the HPA axis (adrenal) and inflammation is direct. Utilizing markers which assess the allostatic load on the system and brings treatment recommendations into focus is invaluable for the integrative medicine practitioner. Learn about accurate assessment of these inflammatory and neuroendocrine markers which will define treatment and prevention. Understand which hormones are neuroprotective (Estradiol, Progesterone etc.), and which ones can have a negative impact on brain health and aging (stress hormones; glucocorticoids). Learn about the most common neurodegenerative diseases in light of neurotransmitter levels, hormone levels and HPA axis dysfunction. Discover how to optimize and physiologically balance of all of these parameters. Obtain treatment plans which you can use Monday morning. Goals and Objectives: Review neuro-endocrine connections and the role in cognitive decline. Evidence based review of appropriate labs to evaluate neuro - endocrine status. Examine neurotransmitter levels in relation to neurodegenera-tive diseases. Evidence based review of natural hormone treatments to delay cognitive decline. 3:00-4:00 p.m. Dosing of Triiodothyronine T3 non-CME/ 1 CE Denis Wilson, MD A simple protocol for the empirical use of T3 in patients with low body temperatures and normal thyroid blood tests will be presented. Crucial principles of dosing and management that are specific to T3 therapy be discussed and will focus on maximizing the benefit while minimizing the risk of T3 therapy. Doctors will learn how cycling patients on and off T3 can often reset the body temperature so that the temperature and symptoms often remained improved off medicine. This \"resetting phenomenon\" is a hallmark of T3 therapy for Wilson's Syndrome. Transitioning patients from T4-containing medicine to T3 will also be discussed.Goals and Objectives: Understand the importance of keeping T3 levels steady. Describe an evidence based, simple protocol for administering T3. Recognize, prevent, and manage side effects of T3 therapy. Describe \"Compensation time\" and how the body normally reacts to T3. Describe the relevance of sustained-release T3 as compared to instant-release T3. Describe the use of T4 as a stabilizing agent/antidote for T3.

Goals and Objectives: Overview of the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis. Assess underlying causes. Review pharmacological protocols for MS patients. Evaluate research on the efficacy, safety and dosing of natural therapies, including botanical medicines, nutrients, and life - style adjustments such as exercise and diet for supporting MS patients. 2:30 - 5:45 p.m. (with breaks) Mitochondrial Dysfunction as the Root Cause of Hormonal Imbalance and Chronic Disease 3 CME/CEChristine Salter, MD, DC In this presentation, Dr. Salter will investigate if mitochondrial dysfunction is the common denominator in chronic disease and hormone imbalance. She will establish that the health of the microbiome is intimately connected with mitochondrial function. She will also review the science which implicates that the main cause of mitochondrial dysfunction is cumulative toxin exposure from chemicals in personal care products, pharmaceutical drugs, pesticides, herbicides, mycotoxins, dental toxins, tobacco, heavy metals and excessive UV light exposure. This results in excessive oxidative stress, which then becomes a vicious cycle resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and death (mitophagy). The key to restoring health to individuals with chronic disease is to identify predisposing factors causing mitochondrial dysfunction, identify and if possible, eliminate the source of toxin exposure, and increase the number (biogenesis) and function of mitochondria. Goals and Objectives: Define Mitochondrial Dysfunction (MD). Review Glycolysis, Kreb's cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC). Review the Cell Danger Response (CDR) in the context of MD. Outline the multiple causes of MD based on a review of published literature. Review evidence-based lifestyle factors that impact mitochondrial function. Review the impact of the microbiome on mitochondrial function based on research. Review mitochondrial dysfunction as a cause of Alzheimer's disease, dementia and cancer. Track 2 10:00- 11:00 AM Mood, Fatigue, Insomnia: A New Model of Diagno - sis and Treatment 1 CME/CEDecker Weiss, ND Are we at the endpoint of potential success for pharmacological interventions for mood, insomnia, and fatigue issues? Should we be alarmed at the rate that children under 17 years of age are now routinely being prescribed benzodiazepines and antidepressants? In the old model of diagnostics, practitioners would run non-specific, non-individualized labs, and prescribe treatments almost blindly. But recently, a more simplified approach became available, with clear recovery algorithms. In this presentation, Dr. Weiss will present an evidence-based, integrative model for diagnosing mood, fatigue and insomnia problems. He will offer providers aggressive, non-toxic, and research-based treatment options that will result in a lifelong sustainable recovery for their patients. The attendee will be able to rapidly and effectively apply this new model to their clinical settings. Goals and Objectives: Identify the reasons for the increase in prescription benzodiazepines and antidepressants for younger patients. Review the new evidence-based model for appropriately diagnosing mood, fatigue and sleep disorders. Present research on customizing lifestyle and natural treatment strategies. 11:30 a.m.- 12:30 p.m. Prevention and Treatment of the Aging Brain 1 CME/CE Andrew W. Campbell, M.D This presentation begins with an overview of the brain and its function. A discussion of the aging population follows, continued 24with a review of dementia, its various forms, and impact on health. Environmental factors contributing to neurotoxicity are presented, as well as other important factors. How to assess patients age 65 and older, and what appropriate testing to order are reviewed. What measures are needed to prevent the brain from aging and what can be done to reverse cognitive decline are discussed with studies from the medical literature with emphasis on the use of probiotics for both prevention and treatment. Goals and Objectives: Review of the known pathophysiology of cognitive decline. Present evidence based review of environmental toxins which are implicated in the process of cognitive decline and address practical solutions. Review appropriate cognitive assessments for older patients. Examine the connection between GI microbial environment and cognitive status based on published literature. 2:00- 3:00 PM The Role of the Human the number one cause of mortality worldwide. This condition is caused by eating and a failure of the microbiome to protect its host from this response. You simply cannot completely correct any chronic condition without addressing Metabolic Endotoxemia. You are more bacteria than you are human with 10 trillion human cells outnumbered by over 100 trillion bacteria cells in and on your body. An often-overlooked role of the microbiome is to prevent Metabolic Endotoxemia and the inflammatory devastation that follows. This lecture will illustrate the danger of having post-Metabolic Endotoxemia and address why this condition is being called the number one cause of mortality worldwide, as it sets up the body for virtually every chronic disease. 3:00- 4:00 p.m. Neuroinflammation in Autism and its Resemblance to Adult Neurodegenerative Disease Progression Non-CME/ 1 CEDebby Hamilton, MD The rates of autism have increased over the years where 1 in 68 children in the US are diagnosed with this disease (CDC, 2016). Autism has a psychiatric diagnosis based on specific behavioral symptoms. Evidence is showing that the manifestations of autism arise from chronic systemic and neuroinflammation. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain and the word causes fear for practitioners, yet we have more children being diagnosed with autism with neuroinflammation in their brain. Understanding this connection is critical for us to be able to diagnose and treat children with autism. The pathology of neuroinflammation in chronic degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's is similar to the pathology in those children studied with autism. If we have children with degenerative neurological disease, we have serious issues as these children grow into adulthood. Goals and Objectives: 1. Understand the underlying neuropathology of autism. 2. Understand that autism has both systemic and neuroinflammation. 3. Discuss how neuroinflammation in autism correlates with symptoms. 4. Discuss the similarity of neuropathology between autism and adult neurodegenerative diseases and the implication of this information. 4:45- 5:45 p.m. Hormones, Organic Acids and Genetics: Clinical Synergy for Integrative Medicine Non-CME/ 1 CEMark Newman Laboratory testing is an important tool in integrative medicine. Hormones and their metabolites have long been a staple of practicing integrative medicine. Organic acids and genetic testing have recently emerged as important tools to also be considered, especially in complex cases. These types of lab tests are useful when considered independently, but are more powerful when considered in context of each other and the clinical picture. For many cases, having more comprehensive testing makes proper diagnosis more probable. This lecture will discuss the integration of hormone, organic acid and genetic tests, specifically as they relate to estrogen metabolism and cancer prevention. Goals and Objectives: Understand hormone pathways. Use organic acids and genetic testing tools. Integrate testing and assessment to balance hormones and prevent cancer. Saturday October 7, 2017 Track 1 8:30-10:30 AM Depression Biotypes and Advanced Nutrient Therapy 2 CME/CE William Walsh, PhD Depression is an umbrella term used to describe a collection of disorders with quite different symptoms, traits, and neurotransmission abnormalities. Evaluation of 2,800 patients diagnosed with clinical depression has resulted in a database of approximately 300,000 blood and urine chemistry levels and 200,000 medical history factors. Five major depression biotypes representing about 95% of our patient population were identified. Each biotype presented with a similar cluster of depressive characteristics, biochemical imbalances, nutritional deficiencies or symptoms. 25The nutrient imbalances that dominate mental disorders will be described based on a thorough review of published research as they relate to each biotype. Specific nutrient protocols will be summarized for the major imbalances and biotypes. Goals and Objectives: Review the collection of data which identifies and segregates 5 categories of depressive disorders Evaluate the published research on nutritional deficiencies related to depression. Examine the safety and efficacy of nutrients for rectifying neurotransmitter imbalances based on a research review. Saturday 11:00 a.m.- 12:00 p.m. and Sunday 8:00-10:00 a.m. Identifying the Role of Neuroimmunomodulation in Clinical Conditions 3 hours total-, 3 CME/ CE total Heather Zwickey, PhD Neuroimmunomodulation is a rapidly expanding area of research, investigating the way in which the nervous system interacts with the immune system via neural, hormonal, and paracrine actions. This presentation will review the most up-to-date research which establishes these connections and explores which systems initiate and which are responders. Dr. Zwickey will review biological responses to emotions such as chronic stress. This presentation will review evidence based models of the role of the GI microbiota and how inflammation plays a role. Goals and Objectives: Predict neurological and cognitive symptoms based on immunological profiles. Present a review on how the brain, immune system and hormones are interconnected. Identify the impact of neuroimmunomodulation on chronic immune responses and the clinical sequelae. Examine research on how nutrients affect microflora, and indirectly influence the brain and nervous system. Summarize evidence-based review of how the immune response to food impacts the brain. 1:30- 2:30 p.m. Lion' s Mane for Treating Cognitive Decline 1 CME/CE Kevin Spelman, PhD Dr. Spelman will review Hericium erinaceus, also known as lion's mane because of its physical features, demonstrates its unique potential to modify the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Based on current research, lion's mane appears to have synaptoblastic properties, which emerging theories consider to be a key action for inhibiting AD pathogenesis. The basic sciences and clinical research demonstrate lion's mane activity is multifaceted and addresses many of the neurodegenerative processes which ultimately contribute to AD progression. It is shown to enhance cognitive function and the central cholinergic system through promoting nerve growth factor and hippocampal neurogenesis, potentially contributing to improved memory. It has positive influences on preventing impairments induced by amyloid beta (A), as well as attenuation of cerebral A plaque burden. Its antioxidant activities suppress intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, through upregulation of protective molecular such as HSP70, heme oxygenase-1, thioredoxin and lipoxin A4, potentially minimizing the consequences of neurodegeneration. Goals and Objectives: Provide an evidence-based review of Hericium erinaceus research. Identify bioactive compounds in lion's mane. Assess potential clinical application for Hericium erinaceus for halting or preventing cognitive decline based on synaptoblastic actions. 2:30- 3:30 p.m. Botanical Medicines for Regulating Thyroid Function 1 CME/CEKevin Spelman, PhD This session will present current research on botanical medicines aimed at regulating thyroid function. Agents that improve hypothyroid function by increasing iodine uptake and synthesize thyroid hormones will be reviewed, along with agents known to block excessive stimulation of the thyroid in cases of excessive TSH production, or thyroid auto-antibodies. Nutritional and botanical evidence based protocols for a variety of common thyroid conditions seen in clinical practice will be shared. Lastly, synergism between the adrenal and the thyroid gland, and the \"cross talk\" between all the endocrine organs will be addressed as an important aspect of treating thyroid diseases. Goals and Objectives: Review of thyroid physiology. Review of hormone pathways. Review botanical medicine for thyroid activity. 4:15- 5:15 p.m. The Retina: A Sensitive Barometer of Health and Nutrition 1 CME/ 1 CEShalesh Kaushal, MD, PhD The neurosensory retina is a thin diaphanous structure, no thicker than tissue paper attached to the inner wall of the back of the eye. It is the photographic film of the eye and is a laminated integrated circuit that subserves all aspects of visual perception including high resolution central acuity, motion detection, edge identification, contrast sensitivity, color identification and peripheral vision. It has 26at least nine identifiable structural layers with at least 15 different cell types that carry out important metabolic functions. The maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of this highly organized tissue demands significant biological energy. The retina is the most metabolically active tissue in the body per unit weight and the eye has the largest blood supply per unit weight in the human body. Thus, it serves as an excellent organ system to discuss and demonstrate energy metabolism, homeostasis, nutritional modulation and endogeneous stem cell activity of disease states as well as canonical pathogenetic events (e.g. inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, immune dysregulation) that lie central to so many chronic diseases. A review of the research will provide evidence for the above listed activities. Goals and Objectives: Review anatomy and physiology of the retina. Name two instruments for assessing retinal structure and function. Describe the biochemical similarities between Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and other chronic diseases. Evidence based review of the highest concentration of omega three fatty acids and cholesterol. Track 2 1:30- 2:30 p.m. A Comprehensive, Integrative Approach to Neurodegenerative 1 CETodd Born, ND, CNS Neurodegenerative disorder (ND) is an umbrella term for a range of conditions which primarily affect the neurons in the human brain, but can also affect the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. NDs are thought to be incurable and debilitating conditions that result in progressive degeneration and/or death of nerve cells. Dr. Born will discuss how a thorough integrative approach can often slow down the progression of neuronal degeneration, as well as strengthen the central and peripheral nervous systems, decrease oxidative stress and optimize mitochondrial function. Goals and Objectives: Understand risk factors for and hastening of ND. Optimize strategies for interventions. Examine urine and blood testing that may improve patient outcomes. Evidence-based diet, nutritional and botanical treatments that may improve patient outcomes.2:30- 3:30 p.m. The Psycho-Neuro-Endocrine-Immunology System (PNEI) of Postpartum Mood Disorder 1 CME/CENancy Lins, ND It is estimated that close to one million American women suffer from postpartum depression annually. Many suffer in silence, feeling guilty and isolated because of their negative emotions and the social pressure making them feel like they \"should\" be happy. Women who seek care from conventional medicine are generally given anti-depressant medications and birth control pills. This approach may alleviate symptoms temporarily, however it masks the symptoms without finding and removing the cause. Shockingly, many women never feel the same after childbirth, even 10-20 years later! This presentation offers a natural, practical and safe program written and researched by a board certified and licensed naturopathic physician. Goals and Objectives: Contrast postpartum mood disorder with depression based on review of research. Identify those at risk for Postpartum Mood Disorder (PPMD). Examine research on natural treatments, including natural hormones, nutrition and herbs, to alleviate PPMD. Review evidence for lifestyle factors beneficial to PPMD 4:15- 5:15 p.m. Mitochondrial Testing: The Key to Preventing and Reversing Neurological and Cardiovascular Disorders? 1CME/CE Decker Weiss, ND Practitioners have been waiting to get to the diagnosis and treatment of core genetic and genomic issues since the beginning of lab diagnostics. Methylation technologies were a great start, but it quickly became clear that more advanced testing was necessary. From that evolved new evidence-based testing methods for mitochondrial function and genetic analysis. In this seminar, Dr. Weiss will present new mitochondrial DNA testing options and will analyze how they can be applied to treating patients with neurologic and cardiovascular disease. The ability to correct overall mitochondrial dysfunction may serve to improve recovery rates for conditions like Parkinson's, ALS, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. At the end of the seminar, practitioners will be able to incorporate appropriate mitochondrial testing into their practices. Goals and Objectives: Review the research supporting mitochondrial DNA testing. Overview of the role of mitochondria in the progression of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease. Evidence-based applications for mitochondrial testing.27Sunday October 8, 2017 8:00- 10:00 a.m. Identifying the Role of Neuroimmunomodulation in Clinical Conditions 3 hours total, 3 CME/ CE totalHeather Zwickey, PhD See details for Saturday at 11:00 a.m. -12:00 p.m. 10:30-11:30 a.m.Using Body Intelligence to Treat Chronic Disease 1CME/CE Rachel Carlton Abrams, MD, ABIHM What might it feel like for you and your patients to live a life your body loves? \"We are born to be bodywise\u2014able to listen to the messages of our body, both simple and deeply intuitive, to navigate our health and our life, \" says Dr. Abrams.

During this talk, Dr. Abrams will draw from published research about mind-body therapies proven to support general wellness. She will use multiple case histories to teach you and your patients how to be bodywise. We'll learn how to listen to symptoms as our body's communication to us, as clues that lead us to our particular path to healing. Goals and Objectives: 1. Identify lifestyle choices that are commonly misunderstood. 2. Review evidence-based mind-body techniques which enhance overall wellness. 3. Learn specific skills to teach patients to better identify messages sent by their body. 4. Review case studies of successful lifestyle protocols which are based on published research. 11:30 a.m.- 12:30 p.m. Curcumin Bioavailability and rhizome of turmeric (Curcuma longa) has gained wide favor for its anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and immune-modulatory actions. Early studies showing poor bioavailability of oral curcumin have prompted the development of a variety of strategies aimed at increasing bioavailability in humans. The myriad of actions attributed to curcumin can be understood from a biological standpoint, with specific actions attributable to curcumin's direct binding to metal ions, enzymes, signaling cascade components, and cell surface receptors. Goals and Objectives: Present the developing methodologies aimed at increasing curcumin/turmeric bioavailability, and discuss the metabolism of curcumin in the body and its effect on tissue localization. Review published clinical research on the effect of curcumin/turmeric on inflammatory and neurobiological disorders, with a discussion of how the form given may influence the results. Present the known mechanisms of action of curcumin/turmeric on specific biological pathways and disease states, as a means of understanding its varied effects within the human body.
