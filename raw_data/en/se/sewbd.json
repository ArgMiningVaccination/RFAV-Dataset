It does not apply to cellular 4 therapies, gene therapies and tissue - engineered products. The methodological principles 5 (e.g., st udy design, dose selection and species selection) outlined in this guideline can also 6 apply to pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of serious and life threatening diseases, 7 such as advanced malignancies (i.e., see ICH S9 (3) ). This guide line should be read in 8 conjunction with ICH M3(R2) (1) , ICH S6(R1) (2) and ICH S9 (3) regarding whether and 9 when non - clinical reproductive toxicity studies are warranted. 10 11 2 INTRODUCTION & GENER AL PRINCIPLES 12 The purpose of this guide line is to provide key considerations for developing a testing 13 strategy to identify hazard and characterize reproductive risk for human pharmaceuticals. 14 The guidance inform s on the use of existing data and identifies potential study designs to 15 supplement available data to identify, assess, and convey risk. General concepts and 16 recommendations are provided that should be considered when interpreting study data and 17 making an assessment of reproductive risk in support of clinical development and marketing 18 app roval . 19 To assess a human pharmaceutical's effects on reproduction and development, the 20 information should generally include exposure of adult animal s and the impact on all stages 21 of development from conception to sexual maturity. No guide line can provide s ufficient 22 information to cover all possible cases , and flexibility in testing strategy is warranted . 23 Regardless of the pharmaceutical modality (see Glossary) , key factors to consider when 24 developing an overall integrated testing strategy include: 25 T he anticipated pharmaceutical use in the target population ( especially in relation to 26 reproduct ive potential and severity of disease ) ; 27 T he form ulation of the pharmaceutical and route(s) of administration intended for 28 humans ; 29 T he use of any existing data o n toxicity, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and 30 similarity to other compounds in structure or activity ; 31 S election of specific studies, test species/test system and dose levels . 32 33 These concepts are discussed in more detail throughout the guid eline , whi ch define s a 34 thoughtful approach for developing a testing strategy . This guid eline recommends the use of 35 information about the pharmaceutical and the patient population in order to perform only 36 those studies essential to evaluate the stages (see below) for which there is insufficient 37 knowledge to inform about the risk to reproduction and development. 38 2 As appropriate, observations through one complete life cycle ( i.e. , from conception in one 39 generation through conceptio n in the following generation ) perm it detection of immediate 40 and latent adverse effects . For the purposes of this guidance, gestation day 0 (GD 0; see 41 Glossary) is when positive evidence of mating is detected. The following stages of 42 reproduction are generally assessed: 43 A) Premating to conception (adult male and female reproductive functions, development 44 and maturation of gametes, mating behavior, fertilization). 45 B) Conception to implantation (adult female reproductive functions, preimplantation 46 development, implantation). 47 C) Implantatio n to closure of the hard palate (adult female reproductive functions, 48 embryonic development, major organ formation). 49 D) Closure of the hard palate to the end of pregnancy (adult female reproductive 50 functions, fetal development and growth, organ development and growth). 51 E) Birth to weaning (adult female reproductive functions, neonate adaptation to 52 extrauterine life, pre - weaning development and growth). 53 F) Weaning to sexual maturity ( post - weaning development and growth, adaptation to 54 independent life, attain ment of full sexual function). 55 The stages covered in individual studies are left to the discretion of the Sponsor , although 56 the timing of studies within the pharmaceutical development process is dependent on study 57 populations and phase of pharmaceutical de velopment ( see ICH M3(R2) (1), ICH S6(R1) 58 (2) and ICH S9 (3) ). 59 Th is guid elin e also provides considerations for interpreting all available nonclinical 60 information as part of the risk characterization . 61 3 S TRATEGIES FOR REPRODUCTIVE TOX ICITY ASSESSMENT 62 3.1 Considerations/ P rinciples 63 The initial step is to determine if reproductive toxicity testing for each of the various 64 reproductive stages is warranted and, if so, what are the most appropriate studies to conduct. 65 The considerations should include : a) the tar get patient population and duration of dosing , b) 66 the known pharmacology of the compound, c) the known toxicity of the compound, d) any 67 existing knowledge of the impact of the target (s) on reproductive risk (e.g., human and/or 68 animal genetics, or class eff ects), and e) data from in vitro and non - mammalian assays 69 (alternative assays, see Glossary) that could be relied upon to identify hazard and/or risk (see 70 Section 3.3.2 ). Approaches for qualifying and use of alternative assays in assessing 71 reproductive ri sk are discussed below (Sections 3.3 .2 and 9 .5) . Generally, most alternative 72 assays being developed address endpoints related to E mbryo - F etal D evelopment (EFD) and 73 are thus discussed in section 3.3.2. However, as new assays are developed for other 74 repro ductive endpoints, they can be similarly deployed with appropriate qualification. 75 3 The experimental strategy to generate the data should consider minimizing the use of 76 animals. Alternative assays and/or in vivo studies with fewer animals can be used to identify 77 hazards in a tiered manner. Reductions in animal use can also be achieved by deferring 78 definitive EFD studies (see Section 9.4.3.3 ) until later in pharmaceutical development (see 79 below ). Alternative ass ays can replace definitive assays in some circumstances where as in 80 others they can be used to defer traditional assays until later in development (see Section 81 3.3 ). An important component of the overall strategy is the timing for the additional 82 informati on to support ongoing clinical development (e.g., developmental toxicity (see 83 Glossary) data to support dosing women of childbearing potential). 84 85 Reproductive and developmental studies should in general be conducted according to G ood 86 L aboratory Practice (GLP) as they will contribute to risk assessment. However, if a human 87 development al or reproductive risk is defined during the conduct of a relevant non - GLP 88 study , repetition of the study to confirm the finding(s) under GLP conditions is not 89 warranted . P E mbryo F EFD ; see Glossary ) studies should be 90 conducted under high - quality scientific standards with data collection records readily 91 available or under GLP conditions. It is recognized that GLP compliance is not expected for 92 some stud y types , or aspects of some studies, employing specialized test systems or methods , 93 such as disease models or surrogate molecules (see Glossary) , or literature . However, high 94 quality scientific standards should be applied , with data collection records readily available. 95 Areas of non - compliance should be identified and their significance evaluated relative to the 96 overall safety assessment. 97 98 3.1.1 Target P atient P opulation/ T herapeutic I ndication C onsiderations 99 The patient populat ion or therapeutic indication can influence the extent of reproductive 100 toxicity testing. For example: 101 If the female patient population is post - menopausal there is no utility in evaluating 102 any of the reproduction stages ; 103 A pharmaceutical for use in an el derly male does not warrant conduct of studies to 104 evaluate stages E and F ; 105 If the disease indicates that reproductive toxicity will have minimal impact on the 106 usage of the pharmaceutical in the target population, studies evaluating only stages C 107 and D can be warranted ; 108 Short - term therapies under highly controlled settings . 109 3.1.2 Pharmacology C onsiderations 110 Before testing, it should be determined if the pharmacologic effects are incompatible with 111 fertility, normal EFD , or measurement of endpoints of the study being considered (e.g., a 112 general anesthetic and measurement of mating behavior). This assessment could be based 113 on data with other pharmaceuticals with similar pharmacology on the pathways affected, or 114 4 on knowledge of effects in humans with related genet ic diseases. Based on these 115 considerations, sometimes no testing for a particular reproductive endpoint can be 116 warranted. In contrast, testing for only off - target effects can be warranted if the expected 117 pharmacologic effects on reproductive endpoints are non - adverse . Examples include 118 patients with a condition that mimics the target pharmacology who have normal 119 reproductive capability and healthy offspring ; or when other pharmaceuticals have similar 120 pharmacology or pathways affected but have no demonstrate d reproductive risk. 121 3.1.3 Toxicity C onsiderations 122 Repeat - dose toxicity studies with sexually mature animals can provide important 123 information on toxicity to reproductive organs. The existing toxicology data for the 124 compound should always be considered, taking i nto account the dose levels, toxicokinetic 125 profile , and dosing duration. For example, the evaluation of fertility effects for a 126 pharmaceutical that damages testicular tissue might warrant modifications to the standard 127 fertility study, if such a study would be appropriate. 128 Sometimes, toxicity in animals precludes attaining a systemic exposure relevant to the 129 human exposure under conditions of use and this should be addressed . 130 3.1.4 Timing C onsiderations 131 General guidance on the timing for conduct of reproductive toxicity studies covering Stages 132 A - F relative to clinical studies is described in the ICH M3(R2) and ICH S9 guid eline s (1 ,3 ) . 133 The timing for when to conduct specific reproductive toxicity assessments should take into 134 consideration the points discussed above. Based on these factors, it can sometimes be 135 appropriate to consider altering timing of the assessment of specific reproductive stages. For 136 example, if there is an equivocal observation from a preliminary study and other compounds 137 in the class are wi thout risk, then consider ation should be given to accelerating the definitive 138 studies. In contrast, there can be circumstances for deferring studies. For example, when 139 other studies have revealed a risk and appropriate precautions in clinical trials have been 140 taken, the conduct of definitive studies evaluating the relevant reproductive stages can be 141 deferred to later in development than is recommended in ICH M3(R2) (1) . When conducting 142 enhanced P re - and P ost N atal D evelopment ( ePPND ) studies ( NHP ) 143 see ICH S6(R 1 ) (2) for timing. 144 Additional options that include study deferral are discussed in Section 3.3.3 . 145 3.1.5 Other C onsiderations for R eproductive T oxicity S tudies 146 For some species and compounds, it can be more appropriate to test multiple reproductive 147 stages in a single study (e.g., monoclonal antibodies in NHPs ; see ICH S6 ( R 1) (2) ). 148 Consideration can also be given to evaluation of reproductive toxicity endpoints as a 149 component of another study type (e.g., male fertility as part of a repeat - dose toxicity study, 150 see Section 3. 2 ). 151 5 When designing a pre - and post - natal development ( PPND ) or ePPND study, thought should 152 be given to the value for juvenile animal endpoints for supporting the safety of pediatric use 153 (see Section 9.4.2 .1 ). 154 Alternative assays are described as part of an integrated testing strategy for assessing 155 embryo - fetal developmental endpoints as described in the examples below (see Section 156 3.3. 2.1 ). 157 158 3.2 Strategy to A ddress F ertility and Early Embryonic Development 159 The aim of the fer tility study is to test for disturbances resulting from treatment from before 160 mating of males and/ or females through mating and implantation. This comprises evaluation 161 of S tages A and B of the reproductive process (see S ections 6 and 9 .4 ). 162 Fertility studi es are generally only performed in rodents or rabbits. Mating evaluations are 163 not generally feasible in non - rodents such as dogs and NHPs. For example if NHPs are the 164 only pharmacologically relevant species (as for many monoclonal antibodies , see ICH 165 S6(R1) (2) ) , fertility evaluations can be based on the results of the repeat - dose toxicity 166 studies (e.g., histopathological examinations). 167 Histopathology of the reproductive organs from the repeat - dose toxicity studies is a sensitive 168 method of detecting t he majority of effects on male and female fertility, provided animals are 169 sexually mature . 170 Dogs and minipigs used in long - term repeat - dose studies should have , in general, sexually 171 mature d by the end of the study. I f NHPs are to be used to assess effects on fertility, there 172 should be a sufficient number of sexually mature animals at study termination . 173 If repeat - dose toxicity studies are used to assess effects on fertility , a comprehensive 174 histopathological examination of the reproductive organs from both male and female animals 175 should be performed (Note 1) . 176 When there is cause for concern based on mode of action or data from previous studies, 177 additional examinations can be included in repeat - dose toxicity studies, e.g. , sperm 178 collection, or monitoring o f the estrous or menstrual cycle. Studies of two to four weeks 179 treatment duration can be expected to provide an initial evaluation of effects on the 180 reproductive organs. This information will later be supplemented with similar evaluations in 181 the subchroni c and chronic toxicity studies. 182 A dedicated fertility study includes a mating phase and serves to detect effects that cannot be 183 assessed by histopathology of the reproductive organs. However, i f the drug has clinically 184 relevant adverse effects on male or f emale reproductive organs in the repeat - dose toxicity 185 studies, a routine fertility study in the affected sex will be of limited value and not warranted . 186 Likewise, a fertility study is not warranted for pharmaceuticals that will not be used in 187 subjects of r eproductive age. Generally, the repeat ed - dose toxicity study results can be used 188 to design the fertility study without the need for further dose ranging studies. 189 6 If no adverse effects on fertility are anticipated, male and female rodents can be evaluated in 190 the same fertility study. However, if effects on fertility are identified, the affected sex should 191 then be determined. In addition, if it cannot be determined whether effects are reversible 192 based on the pathophysiological evaluation, then reversibility of induced effects should be 193 evaluated. These determinations can have an important impact on risk assessment. 194 195 3.3 Strategies to A ddress Embryo Fetal Development (E FD) 196 The aim of the EFD studies is to detect adverse effects on the pregnant female and 197 development of the embryo and fetus consequent to exposure of the female during the period 198 of major organogenesis (Stage C). EFD studies include full evaluation of fetal development 199 and survival. For most non - highly targeted pharmaceuticals (e.g., small molecules) , effects 200 on EFD are typically evaluated in two species (i.e., rodent and non - rodent). There are cases 201 where testin g for effects on EFD in a single species can suffice. General strategies to address 202 EFD studies are shown in Figure 3 - 1. 203 3.3.1 Routine Approach for Addressing EFD Risk 204 In situations where the use of rodent or rabbit species is appropriate, at least one of the test 205 species should exhibit the desired pharmacodynamic (PD) response ( Section 4 ). If the 206 pharmaceutical is not pharmacodynamically active in any routinely used species (Section 207 9 .3) , genetically modified (GM) animals or use of a surrogate molecule can be considered . 208 If it is a highly - targeted pharmaceutical these data can be sufficient. If the pharmaceutical is 209 non - highly targeted, it can be appropriate to also administer it to a rodent or a rabbit to test 210 for off - target effects. 211 However, under some circumsta nces other approaches can be used to defer (Table 3 - 1) or 212 replace ( Section 9 .5 .5 ) definitive studies . Alternatively, t he re can be adequate information 213 to communicate risk without conducting additional studies. E vidence suggesting a n adverse 214 effect of the intended pharmacological mechanism on EFD (e.g., mechanism of action, 215 phenotypic data from genetically modif ied animals, class effects) can be sufficient to 216 communicate risk . 217 Non - routine animal model s or a surrogate molecule can be considered in place of NHPs for 218 either small molecules or biotechnology - derived products, if appropriate scientific 219 justification indicates that results will inform the assessment of reproductive risk (Section 220 4.3). 221 In certain justified cases, testing for effects on embryo - fetal development in a single species 222 can suffice. One example is for highly targeted pharmaceutical s (e.g., for biotechnology - 223 derived products, see ICH S6(R1)) when there is only one relevant species that can be used 224 in reproductive te sting (2). Another circumstance is for non - highly targeted pharmaceuticals 225 when it can be shown that a single species is a relevant model for the human, based on 226 pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and metabolite profiles, as well as toxicology data . If 227 the result is clearly positive ( teratoge nic and/or embryofetal lethal ; TEFL ; see Glossary ) 228 under relevant exposure , testing in a second species is not warranted. 229 7 When there are no pharmacologically relevant species (e.g., the pharmacological target only 230 e xists in humans), EFD studies in two species can still be warranted to detect off - target 231 effects or secondary pharmacology as appropriate based on the therapeutic modality and the 232 indication . 233 For biotechnology - derived products, when no relevant species ca n be identified because the 234 biopharmaceutical agent does not interact with the orthologous target in any species relevant 235 to reproductive toxicity testing, use of surrogate molecules or transgenic models can be 236 considered, as described in detail in ICH S6(R1) (2 ). If there are no relevant species, 237 genetically modified animals, or surrogate, in vivo reproductive toxicity testing is not 238 meaningful; however, the approach used should be justified. 239 For other therapeutic modalities that lack orthologous targe t engagement in useful 240 reproductive toxicology species and also have anticipated off - target effects , use of surrogate 241 molecules or transgenic models can be considered . 242 Several scenarios of use for integrated testing strategies are described in Annex 9 . 5 . 5. 243 244 8 Figure 3 - 1: General Strategy to Address EFD 245 246 3.3.2 Optional Approaches for Addressing EFD Risk 247 3.3.2.1 Use of Alternative Assays 248 Use of alternative in vitro , ex vivo, and non - mammalian in vivo assays (alternative assays) 249 can reduce animal use while preserving the ability to detect relevant reproductive risks. The 250 use of qualified (N ote 2 ) alternative assays can be an appropriate approach in lieu of the 251 routine approach discussed above. Use of q ualified alternative assays is appropriate for risk 252 assessment under certain circumstances where they are interpreted in conjunction with in 253 vivo reproductive testing. Although they are not a replacement for all in vivo reproductive 254 testing, they can reduce in vivo mammalian animal studies and/or animal usage (Section 255 3.3.2.1 ). Several scenarios of use for integrated testing strategies are described in Annex 256 9 .5.5. Furthermore, while a study in a second species could b e conducted under the routine 257 approach, the use of an alternative assay could be more informative in some circumstances, 258 taking into consideration route of administration, exposure, and mechanism of action. 259 9 The circumstances justifying the incorporation of alternative assays in an integrated testing 260 strategy for assessing EFD risk will be dependent upon a number of factors. These could 261 include the severity of the disease, the characteristics of the patient population, or the 262 limitations of some traditiona l test systems for specific therapeutic targets . The 263 pharmacological or biological plausibility for developmental toxicity is a key consideration. 264 265 This guideline does not recommend specific assays, but basic principles are included to assist 266 in assay q ualification for potential regulatory use ( Section 9 .5.2). 267 For appropriate use of alternative assays it is important to know the reliability and 268 predictivity for in vivo reproductive outcomes. The Annex provides information on various 269 reference compounds t hat can be used to assess alternative methods for embryo - fetal 270 development/deaths (Note 3) . It is possible that a suite of assays/assessments will show 271 improved predictivity. 272 273 Where applicable, testing strategies can take into consideration data from qual ified 274 alternative assays in combination with one or more in vivo mammalian EFD studies. Any 275 alternative assay integrated into a testing strategy should be qualified for its in tended context 276 of use (Section 9 .5). When alternative assays are used to contrib ute to the risk assessment 277 they should generally be conducted according to GLP, particularly when the assay results do 278 not identify a hazard. Contexts of use (see Glossary) could include, but are not limited to: 279 a. Being part of an integrated testing strateg y for assessing embryo - fetal developmental 280 endpoints as described in the scenarios in Section 9.5.5 ; 281 b. Deferral of definitive studies as discussed in Section 3.3.3 ; 282 c. Complete replacement of one species when used in conjunction with an enhanced 283 pEFD study in one species (see Scenarios in Section 9.5.5 ) ; 284 d. There is evidence (e.g., a mechanism of action affecting fundamental pathways in 285 developmental biology, phenotypic data from genetically modified animals, class 286 effects) suggesting an adverse effect on EFD , or contributing to the weight of 287 evidence when animal data are equivocal ; 288 e. Toxicity (on - target related and/or off - target) in a routine animal species precludes 289 attaining a systemic exposure relevant to the human exposure under conditions of use , 290 but higher exp osures can be attained in an alternative assay ; 291 f. Low systemic exposure (e.g., no embryo - fetal exposure) in humans such as following 292 ophthalmic administration. 293 The information from the alternative qualified test systems should be used with all available 294 in vivo nonclinical and human data as part of an integrated risk assessment approach (see 295 Principles of Risk assessment; Section 7). 296 10 3.3.2.2 In vitro and Non - mammalian Exposure Information 297 As stated in section 7 of this guideline , for the purposes of risk assessment , it is important to 298 consider exposure in the interpretation of non - clinical studies assessing reproductive toxicity. 299 This also applies to assays conducted using in vitro or non - mammalian systems. The 300 pharmacokinetic parameter used is dependent upon how the assay was qualified in relation to 301 the in vivo concentrations at which the EFD observations were made, considering any 302 normalization factors used in the assay qualifica tion. For example, the maximum 303 concentration tested without an adverse effect in the in vitro system can be compared to the 304 C max in humans for the determination of potential human risk, applying the normalization 305 factor used in the assay qualification. 306 307 3.3.3 Potential Approaches to Defer in vivo Testing as Part of an Integrated Testing 308 Strategy 309 Table 3 - 1 illustrates approaches to support inclusion of W omen O f C hild - B earing P otential 310 (WOCBP) in clinical studies while deferring conduct of definitive assays. This applies to 311 circumstances where 2 definitive EFD studies are warranted for the pharmaceutical. 312 313 One such approach is the use of an enhanced pEFD study for one of the species. In this case, 314 the pEFD study (see ICH M3(R2)) should be conducted in accordance w ith GLP regulations, 315 the number of pregnant animals should be increased from 6 to 8 per group, and include 316 fetal skeletal examinations. 317 318 Table 3 - 1.

Since manifestations of eff ects induced during this period can be delayed, 323 development of the offspring is monitored through sexual maturity (i.e., S tages C to F). The 324 usual species used for PPND is the rat; however, other species can be used as appropriate 325 with modifications of th e endpoints assessed. 326 In most cases, a preliminary PPND study is optional because the appropriate information is 327 generally available from prior studies to design the definitive study. However, a preliminary 328 PPND study with termination of the pups before or at weaning can be used to select dose 329 levels or inform study design and to provide pup exposure data. 330 For pharmaceuticals that can only be tested in the NHP, the ePPND study can provide a 331 limited assessment of post - natal effects, but it is not feasible to follow the offspring through 332 maturity. For the timing of the ePPND study see ICH S6 (R1) (2) . 333 3.5 Toxicokinetics (TK) 334 TK investigations are generally expected and the use of the data is discussed throughout this 335 document. General concepts regarding TK data c ollection are discussed in ICH S3A. 336 Determination of the pharmaceutical's concentration in the fetus can be of interest to 337 facilitate interpretation of discordant or equivocal evidence of developmental hazard. 338 However, determination of placental transfer is generally not warranted because of limited 339 ability to translate data to human fetal exposures. 340 341 Many pharmaceuticals are excreted in milk, although lactational excretion data in animals are 342 of uncertain value for human risk assessment. Therefore, measur ement of drug 343 concentrations in the milk of animals is generally not warranted. However, determination of 344 a pharmaceutical 's concentrations in the offspring can support interpretation of findings 345 observed during the pre - weaning period. 346 4 TEST SYSTEM SELECTION 347 4.1 Routine T est S pecies 348 When a study is warranted, a mammalian species should be used. For the primary species, it 349 is generally desirable to use the same species and strain as in other toxicity studies to avoid 350 additional studies to characterize pha rmacokinetics and metabolism, and/or for dose - range 351 finding. The species used should be well - characterized with respect to health, fertility, 352 fecundity, and background rates of malformation and embryo - fetal death. Generally, within 353 and between reproductive studies animals should be of comparable age, weight and parity at 354 the start . The easiest way to fulfil these factors is to use animals that are young, sexually 355 mature adults at the time of the start of dosing with the females being virgin , with the 356 12 excep tion of NHP where proven mothers can be an advantage for ePPND studies . 357 The species chosen for testing should be relevant and justified based on their advantages and 358 disadvantages (see T able 9 - 1 in S ection 9 .3 ). If the species selected differs considerably from 359 the human in regard to the considerations below, the impact should be considered when 360 interpreting the reproductive toxicity data (see Principles of Risk Assessment , S ection 7 ). 361 Assessing all of the reprodu ctive endpoints or parameters of interest in a single test species, 362 however, is not always possible. 363 Additional points to consider in selection of a species relate to the interaction of the 364 pharmaceutical with the species including: 365 a. The pharmacokinetic a nd metabolite profile (including adequate exposure to major 366 human metabolites, as discussed in ICH M3 ( R2 ) (1) ) ; 367 b. Whether the species expresses the pharmacologic target (e.g., is an endogenous or 368 exogenous target) and whether the pharmaceutical has adequate affinity for the target 369 in the species selected ; 370 c. Whether the functional pharmacological activity of the pharmaceutical is exhibited in 371 the test species. 372 For highly targeted molecules, selection of a pharmacologically relevant species is 373 particularly impor tant as described in more detail in ICH S6(R1) (2). 374 4.1.1 Rat as the P rimary S pecies for R eproductive T oxicity T esting 375 The rat is the most often used rodent species for reasons of practicality, general knowledge 376 of pharmacology in this species, the extensive toxicology data usually available for 377 interpretation of nonclinical observations from development of the pharmaceuti cal , and the 378 large amount of historical background data. Thus, in many cases based on how species are 379 selected for general toxicity studies, the rat is generally appropriate for reproductive toxicity 380 testing. 381 4.1.2 Rabbit as the S econdary S pecies for EFD studie s 382 For assessment of EFD only, a second mammalian non - rodent species is often warranted, 383 although there are exceptions ( e.g., vaccines, therapeutic antibodies , etc., see Sections 4.1.3 384 and 4. 2, respectively ). T he rabbit has proven to be useful in identifying human teratogens 385 that have not been detected in rodents; and the rabbit is routinely used as the non - rodent 386 species based on the extensive historical background data, availability of animals, and 387 practicality. 388 4.1.3 Species S election for P reventative and Therapeutic V accines 389 The animal species selected for testing of vaccines (with or without adjuvants) should 390 demonstrate an immune response to the vaccine. Typically, rabbits, rats, and mice are used. 391 Nonhuman primates should be used only if no other relevant animal species is available, 392 even though quantitative and qualitative differences can exist in the responses (e.g. , in 393 13 humoral and cellular endpoints). It is usually sufficient to conduct developmental toxicity 394 studies using only one animal model . 395 Rabbits are the most common species used for vaccine developmental toxicity studies, but 396 other species are also appropriate. In primates (as in humans), the transfer of maternal 397 antibodies across the placenta is limited, but generally increases over the course of gestation. 398 In other species routinely used in reproductive testing the time course of transfer differs. 399 The type of developmental toxicity study conducted and the choice of the animal model 400 should be justified based on the immune response obser ved and the ability to administer an 401 appropriate dose. 402 When there is a lack of an appropriate animal model (including NHP), a developmental 403 toxicity study in rabbits, rats, or mice can still provide important information regarding 404 potential embryo/fetal t oxic effects of the vaccine components/formulation and safety of the 405 product during pregnan cy . 406 4.2 Non - routine Test Species 407 There are cases where it can be appropriate to use strategies other than those involved using 408 the routine species discussed above. A commonly encountered example is where the rabbit is 409 unsuitable for EFD testing. In situations like this, one can consider alternative species or 410 approac hes that can inform the risk assessment. 411 Many other species have been used to evaluate the effects of pharmaceuticals on the various 412 reproductive stages. The suitability of alternative species will depend on the reproductive 413 endpoints to be assessed ( see Table 9 - 1 in Section 9.3 ). 414 NHPs can also be used for evaluating reproductive toxicity, especially for biotechnology - 415 derived products, as described in ICH S6(R1) (2) . NHPs should be considered if they are the 416 only pharmacologically relevant species, provid ed that it is not already clear that the 417 pharmacology of the pharmaceutical is incompatible with normal development or 418 maintenance of pregnancy. There are additional factors that further limit the utility of 419 studies in NHPs for reproductive risk assessmen t (see Annex 9.3 and ICH S6(R1)). An 420 alternative animal model can be considered in place of NHPs for either small molecules or 421 biotechnology - derived products by using a surrogate molecule that elicits the appropriate 422 pharmacologic activity in the animal mo del , or data from genetically modified animals. The 423 results of the studies can inform the assessment of reproductive risk (see Section s 4.3 and 7 ) . 424 For biotechnology - derived products, when no relevant species can be identified because the 425 biopharmaceutical agent does not interact with the orthologous target in any species relevant 426 to reproductive toxicity testing, use of surrogate molecules or genetic ally modified models 427 can be considered, as described in ICH S6(R1) (2) and Section 4.3.2. For some therapeutic 428 modalities that lack orthologous target engagement in useful reproductive toxicology species 429 and also have anticipated off - target effects, the te sting strategy should address both of these 430 situations. 431 14 In lieu of, or in addition to, the use of an in vivo mammalian study for assessment of 432 reproductive toxicity, alternative approaches that can be considered include assessment of 433 pharmacologic or mechanistic information, non - mammalian in vivo studies, or in vitro 434 assays that predict reproductive toxicity ( se e Principles of Risk assessment S ection 7 ). 435 4.3 Other T est S ystems 436 4.3.1 Use of D isease M odels 437 Disease animal models are not routinely used in reproductive toxicity testing; however, there 438 are some cases where they can be informative. Studies in disease models can be of value in 439 cases where the data obtained from healthy animals could be misleading or otherwise not 440 apply to the disease conditions in the clinical setting. Examples of situations where a 441 reproductive toxicity study in a disease model could contribute i nformation to the risk 442 assessment include studies with pharmaceuticals that are replacement therapies , when the 443 target is only present in disease state, or when the pharmacologic activity of the test article 444 could yield confounding results in healthy anima ls (e.g., causes hypoglycemia or 445 hypotension). 446 Recognizing that no animal model perfectly replicates human disease, there are several 447 factors to be considered in choosing to study toxicity to reproduction in a disease animal 448 model. The model should be pha rmacologically relevant and appropriate for the reproductive 449 endpoints being assessed. The pathophysiology of the disease course in the model should be 450 characterized. Some differences from the human pathophysiology would not preclude its use 451 provided that these are unlikely to confound data interpretation. Animal to animal variability 452 should be characterized and appropriate within the context of the study. Reference data for 453 the study endpoints should be available or should be generated during the study to aid data 454 interpretation. 455 Although disease animal models can be used in definitive reproductive toxicity studies, they 456 are more likely to be used as suppl ementary approaches to understand the relevance of 457 adverse reproductive effects of the pharmaceutical in normal animals. The use of disease 458 animal models and the design of the study for reproductive toxicity testing should be 459 justified. 460 461 4.3.2 Use of G eneticall y M odified M odels and Use of Surrogate Molecules 462 For both genetically modified models and for surrogate molecules the effect of the intended 463 pharmacology on reproduction is being investigated and thus informs the assessment of risk. 464 For example, if the ph armacology is linked to adverse effect s on reproduction , it can 465 reasonably be concluded that the adverse effects would be experienced in some proportion of 466 pregnant women receiving the pharmaceutical. However, the actual proportion of individuals 467 affected (incidence) cannot be determined from animal studies, even if the actual 468 pharmaceutical and a pharmacologically relevant species are used. 469 15 Genetically modified models can be used to create disease mod els or to characterize the 470 on - target and off - target effects of a pharmaceutical on reproductive toxicity parameters. 471 Such models can inform on whether the pharmacology of the target is closely linked to 472 adverse effects on reproduction and development. Whe n these models are used and 473 off - target effects are anticipated based on therapeutic modality , the clinical candidate should 474 be evaluated with this model to assess both on - and off - target effects. 475 When the clinical candidate does not have adequate activi ty against the target receptor in the 476 routine test species, surrogate molecules can be used for any modality to assess potential 477 adverse effects on reproductive toxicity. Using surrogate molecules is analogous to 478 identifying class - effects from structurally diverse molecules with similar pharmacology . 479 The overall approach is comparable to using a surrogate antibody that is pharmacologically 480 active in the species being tested rather than using the humanized antibody that is 481 pharmacologically active only in t he NHP. 482 I f there are no adverse effects on reproduction associated with the target pharmacology, 483 evaluation of off - target reproductive toxicity using the clinical candidate is warranted. 484 485 5 DOSE LEVEL SELECTION, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND S CHEDULE 486 As part of the dose selection process, route of administration and schedule are important 487 components in the design of reproductive toxicity studies. T he dose selection should 488 optimize exposure relative to humans considering route, schedule, and pharmacokineti cs 489 profile, to the extent that is practical . 490 The choice of dose levels, schedule and route of administration should be based on all 491 available information (e.g., pharmacology, repeated - dose toxicity, pharmaco - /toxicokinetics, 492 and D ose R ange F inding studies ) and a rationale should be provided . Guidance on the 493 principles of dose selection is given in ICH M3 (R2) Q&A ( 1 ) and ICH S6 (R1) (2) , and all 494 available data should be used . Dose levels should be selected to investigate dose - response 495 relationships for the primary endpoints of the study. Using doses similar to those used in the 496 repeat dose toxicity studies of comparable duration permits interpretation of potential effects 497 on reproductive and/or developmental endpoints within the context of general systemic 498 toxicity and enables integration of data. When sufficient information on tolerability and 499 pharmaco - /toxicokinetics in the test system is not available, appropriately design ed 500 exploratory studies are advisable. 501 Dosing schedules used in the toxicity studies influence the exposure profile which can be 502 important in the risk assessment. Usually mimicking the clinical schedule is sufficient, but is 503 not always warranted. A more fre quent (e.g., twice a day ) or a less frequent schedule can be 504 appropriate to provide an exposure profile more relevant to the clinical exposure. When a 505 more frequent schedule is contemplated , pragmatic factors (e.g., study logistics, stress on 506 animals) should be considered. 507 16 In general the route of administration should be similar to the clinical route, provided the 508 relevant human reproductive risk can be assessed. In circumstances where systemic exposure 509 cannot be achieved or only small multiples of the clinical systemic exposure are achieved in 510 the absence of maternal toxicity, a different route of administration should be considered. 511 Use of a route of administration other than the clinical route should be justified in the context 512 of the general toxicolo gy program. When multiple routes of administration are being 513 evaluated in humans, a single route in the test species can be adequate provided sufficient 514 systemic exposure is achieved compared to that of the clinical routes. 515 It is not always warranted to use pregnant animals for dose selection, even if the reproductive 516 study assesses pregnant animals. However, when exposure - based endpoints are used as the 517 basis for selection of the dose levels ( Section 5.1.3 ), it can be importa nt to have T K from 518 pregnant animals. If the T K is derived from non - pregnant animals for dose selection, then the 519 achievement of the T K endpoint should be confirmed in pregnant animals. 520 5.1 Dose S election C ommon to all P harmaceuticals, I ncluding B iotechnology - 521 derived P harmaceuticals 522 There are a number of dose selection endpoints that can be used for reproductive toxicity 523 studies. All the endpoints discussed in this section are considered equally appropriate in 524 terms of study design. The high dose in the definitive study should be one that is predicted to 525 produce the anticipated change in the endpoint as described below in Sections 5 .1.1 to 5.1.6 . 526 The selected high dose should be based on the observations made in appropriately designed 527 studies, incl uding the effects observed at higher dose levels in other studies (e.g., repeat - dose, 528 TK , p EFD). 529 Justification for high dose selection using other endpoints than specified below, can be made 530 on a case - by - case basis. 531 5.1.1 Toxicity - based E ndpoints 532 This endpoint is based on the prediction of minimal toxicity in the parental animals at the 533 high dose. Minimal toxicity is defined as having an adverse effect on the parental animals 534 without having an anticipated direct effect on the reproductive outcome. Factors limiti ng the 535 high dose determined from previously conducted studies could include: 536 Alterations in body weight (gain or absolute; either reductions or increases ). Minor, 537 transient changes in body weight gain or in body weight are not considered dose 538 limiting . When assessing weight change effects, the entire dosing duration of the 539 study should be considered and the absolute change that is appropriate is dependent 540 on the parameter being measured, the species, strain, and the window of development 541 being evaluated. 542 Specific target organ toxicity (e.g., ovarian, uterine) or clinical pathology 543 perturbations (e.g., changes in glucose) that would interfere with the study endpoints 544 within the duration of the planned reproductive or developmental toxicity study . 545 Exaggera ted pharmacological responses (e.g., excessive sedation or hypoglycemia ) 546 17 T oxicological ystemic Ex posure E ndpoint 549 High dose selection based on saturation of systemic exposure measured by systemic 550 availability of pharmaceutical - related substances can be appropriate (see ICH M3(R2) (1) ) . 551 There is, however, little value in increasing the administered dose if it does not result in 552 increased plasma concentration. For the purposes of this guid eline , saturation of exposure is 553 defined as substantial increases in dose that result in minimal increases in total exposure 554 (e.g., a doubling of the dose resulting in only a n approximate 20% increase in exposure ) . 555 5.1.3 Exposure - based E ndpoint 556 It can be appropriate to select doses based on exposure margins above the exposure at the 557 maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) . For pharmaceuticals having primary and 558 secondary pharmacology (or off - target effects) in the test species (e.g., small molecules), a 559 systemic exposure representing a large multiple of the human AUC (area under the exposure 560 curve) or C max can be an approp riate endpoint for high - dose selection. This dose selection 561 approach can be applied when there are qualitatively similar metabolite profiles between 562 humans and the test species. The rationale for the metric used should be provided. Doses 563 anticipated to pro vide an exposure > 25 fold of the clinical systemic exposure at the MRHD 564 are generally considered appropriate as the maximum dose for reproductive toxicity studies 565 ( Note 4 ). Usually this is based on the parent moiety if it is the pharmacologically active 566 a gent. There are other cases (e.g., prodrugs, pharmacologically active metabolites) for which 567 the S ponsor should provide a justification for the moieties included in the exposure multiple 568 calculations. 569 When evaluating a pharmaceutical against a human endoge nous target using an exposure - 570 based endpoint, it is recommended to choose at least one species with pharmacodynamic 571 activity. For studies using a surrogate molecule a dose should be used that has adequate 572 pharmacodynamic activity in the test species. In a ddition to testing the surrogate, if the 573 clinical candidate is anticipated to have secondary pharmacology or off - target effects, the 574 clinical candidate should also be tested at doses anticipated to provide an exposure > 25 - fold 575 at the MRHD in the routine s pecies. 576 Alternatively , instead of using a surrogate, for clinical candidates that have some 577 demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity in the test species only at exposures > 25 - fold, 578 doses that achieve pharmacodynamic activity in the routine test species can be used. 579 However, it should be noted that irrelevant off - target effects are likely to be observed. 580 If n on e of the routine test species are pharmacodynamically relevant, but the target is 581 endogenous and the clinical candidate is anticipated to have off - target effects, an alternative 582 endpoint rather than the exposure - based endpoints should be considered (e.g., limit dose, 583 maximum feasible dose, toxicity - based endpoints). 584 18 When there is no human endogenous target (e.g., viral target), a > 25 - fold exposure multiple 585 of the MRHD is sufficient for high dose selection. 586 5.1.3.1 Considerations for Total vs. Fraction Unbound Pharmaceutical Exposure 587 The choice for the use of total vs. frac tion unbound pharmaceutical exposures should be 588 justified. The total exposure can be used as the default, unless the fraction unbound results in 589 a lower exposure margin than that of the total; in this case the lower exposure multiple 590 should be used for the comparison of animal vs. human exposures. Alternatively, the fraction 591 unbound pharmaceutical exposure can be used regardless of whether it generates a lower or 592 greater exposure multiple than that of the total exposure provided the following applies: 593 The fraction s unbound can be calculated accurately from the total pharmaceutical 594 exposure , is reproducible at the effective concentrations in humans and at the 595 toxicological concentration s in animals , and the fraction s unbound are statistically 596 significantly different . 597 598 Two examples of how this calculation might impact the exposure multiples are provided 599 below. 600 25 fold exposure multiple not met: If the total exposure is 25 \u00b5M - hr in animals and 1 601 \u00b5M - hr in humans and unbound protein fraction is 5% and the unbo und fraction in 602 animals is 1% , then the margin would be 5. 603 25 fold exposure multiple exceeded: If the exposure is 10 \u00b5M - hr in animals and 5 604 \u00b5M - hr in humans and unbound protein fraction is 1% in human and 20% in animals, 605 then the unbound ratio would be 40 r ather than the apparent ratio of 2 based on total. 606 5.1.3.2 Exposure - based A pproach for H ighly T argeted T herapeutics 607 Highly therapies (e.g. , monoclonal antibodies , therapeutic proteins ) are those that 608 exhibit no or minimal off - target effect. For these therapeutics that exhibit pharmacodynamic 609 effects in the test species, high dose selection can be accomplished by either identifying a 610 dose which provides the maximum intended pharmacological effect in the preclinical species 611 or a dose which prov ides an approximately 10 - fold exposure multiple over the maximum 612 exposure to be achieved in the clinic, whichever one is higher (ICH S6(R1) ) (2) . Corrections 613 for large differences in target binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological activity between 614 the nonclinical species and humans should be considered in dose selection such that a higher 615 dose can be appropriate to elicit pharmacodynamic effects, if not limited by toxicity or 616 feasibility. If the routine species do not exhibit pharmacological activity and a surrogate 617 molecule is used, a dose of the surrogate that is 10 - fold that which elicits the intended 618 pharmacological activity in the test species can be appropriate. 619 19 5.1.4 Maximum F easible D ose (MFD) E ndpoint 620 Use of the MFD should maximize exposure in the test species, rather than maximize the 621 administered dose (see also ICH M3 (R2) ( 1) ). 622 The MFD can be used for high dose selection when the physico - chemical properties of the 623 test substance (or f ormulation) associated with the route / frequency of administration and the 624 anatomical / physiological attributes of the test species limit the amount of test substance that 625 can be administered. 626 5.1.5 Limit D ose E ndpoint 627 A limit dose of 1 g/kg/day can be applied wh en other dose selection factors have not been 628 achieved with lower dose levels (see also ICH M3 (R2) (1) for other considerations). 629 5.1.6 Selection o f L ower D ose L evels 630 It is generally desirable to establish a \"no observed adverse effect level\" for developmental 631 and reproductive toxicity. Having selected the high dose, lower doses should be selected 632 taking into account exposure, pharmacology, and toxicity, such that there is separation in 633 anticipated outcomes between groups. Any dose level that yield s a sub - therapeutic exposure 634 is not generally informative to risk assessment, unless it is the highest dose that can be 635 achieved without toxicity in the parental animals. For some of the variables in reproductive 636 toxicity studies the ability to discrimina te between background and treatment effects can be 637 difficult and the presence or absence of a dose - related trend can be informative. The low dose 638 should generally provide a low multiple (e.g., 1 to 5 - fold) of the human exposure MRHD. 639 The exposure at the m id dose should be intermediate between the exposures at the low and 640 the high doses; however, dose spacing that results in less than 3 - fold increase in exposure is 641 not generally recommended. 642 5.2 Dose S election and Study Designs for Vaccines 643 This guideline covers vaccines (adjuvanted or not) used in both preventative and therapeutic 644 indications against infectious diseases. The principles outlined can be applicable to the 645 nonclinical testing of vaccines for other indications as well (e.g., canc er). The types of 646 studies depend on the target population for the vaccine and the relevant reproductive risk. 647 Generally, reproductive studies are not warranted for vaccines being developed for neonates, 648 pre - pubertal children, or geriatric populations. 649 For reproductive toxicity studies of vaccines it is typically sufficient to assess a single dose 650 level capable of inducing an immune response in the animal model ( Section 4.1 .3 ). This 651 single dose level should be the maximum human dose without correcting for b odyweight 652 (i.e., 1 human dose = 1 animal dose). If it is not feasible to administer the maximum human 653 dose to the animal because of a limitation in total volume that can be administered or because 654 of dose - limiting toxicity (e.g., local, systemic), a dose t hat exceeds the human dose on a 655 mg/kg basis can be used. To use a reduced dose, justification as to why a full human dose 656 cannot be used in an animal model should be provided. 657 20 The vaccination regimen should maximize maternal antibody titers and /or immune response 658 throughout the embryonic, fetal, and early postnatal periods. Timing and number of doses 659 will depend on the onset and duration of the immune response of the particular vaccine . 660 When developing vaccines to be given during pregnancy , the sponsor sh ould justify the 661 specific study design based upon its intended use ( e.g. , protecting the mother during 662 pregnancy or protecting the child early postnatally ) . 663 D aily dosing regimen s can overexposure to the vaccine constituents . E pisodic dosing 664 of pregnant animals rather than daily dosing is recommended . Also , episodic dosing better 665 approximates the proposed clinical immunization schedule for most preventive and 666 therapeutic vaccines for infectious disease indications. Considering t he short gestational 667 period of routine animal species, it is generally recommended to administer a priming dose(s) 668 to the animals several days or weeks prior to mating in order to elicit peak immune response 669 during the critical phases of pregnancy (i.e., t he period of organogenesis). The dosing 670 regimen can be modified according to the intended vaccination schedule in humans. 671 At least one dose should be administered during early organogenesis to evaluate potential 672 direct embryotoxic effects of the components of the vaccine formulation and to maintain a 673 high antibody response throughout the remainder of gestation. If EFD toxicity is observed, 674 this can be further assessed using subgroups of animals that are dosed at certain time points. 675 In cases where a vaccin e includes a novel, active constitutive ingredient (including novel 676 adjuvants) consideration of additional testing strategies similar to those for non - vaccine 677 products can be appropriate. 678 It is recommended that the route of administration be similar to t he clinical route of 679 administration. 680 6 DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF IN VIVO MAMMALIAN STUDIES 681 The testing strategy to evaluate the potential reproductive risk of a pharmaceutical can 682 include one or more in vivo studies. Although three separate study designs have been 683 employed for the development of the majority of pharmaceuticals, various c ombinations of 684 these study designs can be conducted to reduce animal use. All available pharmacological, 685 kinetic, and toxicological da ta for the pharmaceutical should be considered in determining 686 which study design(s) should be used . Study details for fertility, EFD , and PPND studies, and 687 combinations thereof, can be found in Annex 9 .4 . Different approaches are listed below . 688 6.1 Three separate studies to assess all stages (A \u0000 F) 689 Fertility and E arly E mbryo D evelopment (FEED) 690 o If effects on fertility are suspected, based on mode of action or on the results of 691 repeat dose studies, it can be advisable to dose males and females in separate a rms 692 or separate studies comprising mating with untreated animals of the opposite sex. 693 Embryo - F etal D evelopment (EFD) 694 21 Pre - and P ost N atal D evelopment, including maternal function (PPND) 695 6.2 Single study design 696 A combination of fertility, gestation, a nd postnatal S tages A \u0000 F) . 697 698 A single study design in rodents might be appropriate when reproductive toxicity is not 699 expected . If such a study provides clearly negative results at appropriately selected dos e s, no 700 further reproduction studies in that species are warranted. In this study, all newborns and 701 pups, including stillbirths and culled pups, should be examined for morphological 702 abnormalities. If reproductive and developmental toxicity is observed, thes e toxicity risks 703 should be assessed in detail. 704 6.3 Two study design 705 Combination of FEED and EFD ( S tages A D) + C F ) studies . 706 This combination of the FEED and EFD, i n addition to the PPND study provide s all 707 the information obtained from conducting separate FEED and EFD and PPND 708 studies, but uses fewer animals. 709 Combination of EFD (S tages C D) + FEED and PPND (S tages A C + D F) 710 studies . 711 This combination study design does not include an assessment of external, soft 712 tissues , or skeletal morphology. It is most useful when no treatment - related TEFL 713 effects were observed in the EFD study. The fertility and PPND combined study 714 together with an EFD study, provide all the desired information for all stages of 715 development, but uses fewer animals than the three study design. 716 717 6.4 Combination design of repeat - dose and fertility studies 718 In cases w here no effects on male or female fertility are expected, or where extending the 719 dosing period is appropriate due to observation of reproductive organ toxicity in long term 720 repeated dose toxicity study, a c ombination design of repeat - dose and fertility studies can be 721 considered. If effects on fertility are suspected, based on mode of action or on the results of 722 repeat dose studies, it can be advisable to dose males and females in separate studies 723 comprising mating with untreated animals of the opposite sex. 724 725 After a defined dosing period within the longer term repeat - dose toxicity study (e.g., 13 - or 726 26 - week repeat - dose study), males from the repeat dose study can be cohabited with sexually 727 mature females from a separate study arm (untreated sexually mature females or where the 728 f emale are treated for at least two weeks prior to mating ). This combination study can reduce 729 the number of animal s used; however, the number of male animals in the repeat - dose study 730 should be approximately 16 per group . Female animals and their fetuses will be examined 731 for endpoints described in the procedures of the fertility study ( Annex Section 9 .4. 1 ). 732 22 The male dose duration period which precedes the period of cohabitation should be 733 determined based on the design principles of the fertility study described in S ection s 3.2 and 734 9 .4. 1 . The dosed males used for this assessment can come from any repeat - dose s tudy 735 (e.g. , 4 - , 13 - , or 26 - week study ) provided the dose duration is sufficient for the project aims, 736 the males are sexually mature, and the number of males available for cohabitation is 737 sufficient to assess effects on male fertility and implant survival. The group size selected to 738 assess male fertility should be justified base d on species / strain characteristics . This 739 combination study can reduce the number of dosed males which can be particularly useful 740 with technically challenging exposure routes. It i s also particularly useful where evaluation 741 of the long term effects on male reproductive performance is desired. 742 It is possible to assess both male and female fertility simultaneously using males from the 743 repeat - dose toxicity study by cohabiting the mal es with sexually mature females from a 744 separate study arm that have been treated with drug for at least two weeks. The females and 745 fetuses are assessed as described for the fertility study ( Section 9 .4.1 ). However, to detect 746 drug effects on the oestrus cyc le, group size should be at least 16 unless justification for 747 smaller group sizes can be provided. 748 749 6.5 Evaluation of Data 750 6.5.1 Data H andling/ D ata P resentation/ S tatistics for in vivo S tudies 751 The key to good reporting is the tabulation of individual values in a clear concise manner to 752 account for all animals that are being assessed. Because the data are derived from offspring 753 that are often not directly treated, clear and concise tabulation tha t permits any individual 754 animal from initiation to termination to be followed should be presented. This will enable 755 assessment of the contribution that the individual has made to any group summary values. 756 Group summa ry values should be presented with signi ficant figures that avoid false precision 757 and that reflect the distribution of the variable. 758 For the presentation of data on structural changes (e.g., fetal abnormalities) the primary 759 listing (tabulation) should clearly identify the litters containing abn ormal fetuses, identify the 760 affected fetuses in the litter and report all the changes observed in the affected fetus. 761 Secondary listings by type of change can be derived from this, as appropriate. 762 Graphical presentations that depict mean values for data co llected on multiple days (e.g., 763 mean body weights) are useful in visu alizing a large amount of data. Annex or tabulations of 764 individual values such as bodyweight, food consumption , and litter values , should be 765 concise . W hile the presentation of absolute va lues should be the default, calculated values 766 such as bodyweight gain or litter survival indices can provide further support. Where data 767 from non - pregnant animals have been excluded from summary tables, this should be clearly 768 indicated. 769 23 Presentation of f etal abnormality findings should utilize terminology that is consistent and 770 easily understood. 771 Interpretation of study data should rely primarily on comparison with the concurrent control 772 group. Historical control/reference data are most useful when an interpretation of the data 773 relies on the knowledge of variability within the larger control population and specifically 774 among control groups in previous studies. For example, when trying to understand relevance 775 of malformations , historical control data are useful in interpreting the significance of rare 776 events. The individual laboratory\u00b4s recent historical control database, if available, is 777 preferred over data compilations from other laboratories. Ideally, the historical data sho uld 778 reflect data from contemporary studies (e.g., from years immediately preceding or following 779 the study conduct, if available) as genetic drift can be an issue. 780 Comparison of study data to the historical mean and standard deviation or range is often 781 pe rformed. It can be important to take into consideration the frequency of the occurrence of 782 an event. If so, then the frequency should be presented. 783 6.5.2 Statistics 784 Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies usually show a distribution of response that 785 do es not follow a normal distribution, but can vary from any continuous to any discrete 786 distribution. As a result, this should info rm the statistical method used. When employing 787 inferential statistics (determination of statistical significance) the basic unit of comparison 788 should be used. The experimental unit is a concept that is oftentimes misinterpreted but 789 refers to the units that have been randomized and treated. Therefore, cesarean and fetal data 790 should be calculated for the litter as the unit of measure ; study result inferen ces are made 791 back to the mother , not to fetuses . This is because the pregnant females have been allocated 792 to different dose groups (not the fetuses or neonates) and the development of individual 793 offspring in a given litter is not indep endent. The responses of individual offspring in a given 794 litter are expected to be more alike than responses of offspring from different litters. 795 Similarly, for fertility studies the mating pair should be used as the basic unit of comparison. 796 In most case s, inferential statistics (\"significance tests\") will evaluate the relationship 797 between a response and treatment factor. The key outputs from a statistical model are then 798 the p - values and confidence intervals for assessing treatment effects - typically pai rwise 799 comparisons back to vehicle and/or a trend test across all the groups. T he output of such 800 significance tests should only be used as a support for the interpretation of results. Any 801 biologically meaningful difference in treated animals compared with c oncurrent controls 802 should be discussed. S tatistical significance alone does not always constitute a positive 803 signal nor does lack of statistical significance constitute a lack of effect; historical controls, 804 biological plausibility , and reproducibility sho uld be considered in this context. Use of 805 statistical significance alone for drawing inferences when dealing with studies with small 806 group sizes (e.g., NHP) should be approached with caution. 807 24 7 PRINC I PLES OF RISK ASSESSMENT 808 All available data on the pharmaceutical and any related compounds (e.g., surrogates or class 809 alerts), as well as information on human genetics, transgenic animals and the role of the 810 target in reproduction should be considered in this assessment. The amount of information 811 availabl e can depend on the stage of pharmaceutical development, the nature of the 812 pharmaceutical and its intended use. The (projected) human exposure, comparative kinetics 813 between species and plausible mechanism of reproductive toxicity, if available, should be 814 c onsidered. 815 Therapeutic benefit considerations can influence the appropriate level of human risk. For 816 instance, a higher degree of risk could be appropriate for a pharmaceutical intended to treat a 817 life - threatening disease for which all existing therapies h ave known adverse effects on 818 reproduction than for a life - style pharmaceutical. Human data (e.g., known effects of human 819 genetic variations, clinical trial experience) can greatly influence the overall assessment of 820 human risk of reproductive or developmen tal toxicity. Definitive human data will supersede 821 nonclinical data. 822 Any limitations ( e.g., test system relevance, achieved exposure), uncertainties and data gaps 823 in the available nonclinical reproductive toxicity data package should be addressed and their 824 impact assessed. 825 Risk assessment should generate conclusions relevant for risk communication and 826 management for the intended patient population. 827 7.1 Risk A ssessment for R eproductive and D evelopmental T oxicities 828 For human pharmaceuticals, an assessment should be conducted to identify potential risks on 829 human reproduction throughout pharmaceutical development. 830 Endpoints reflecting the full range of potential reproductive and developmental effects as 831 described in Section 2 should be addressed, if not otherwise justified. 832 Not all observations from nonclinical studies are considered to be adverse. An identified 833 effect of the pharmaceutical can also be considered as non - adverse if it is an adaptive change 834 (e.g., enzyme inducti on) which does not impact on reproductive or developmental function. 835 Adverse nonclinical effects should be evaluated to estimate the likelihood of increased 836 reproductive or developmental risk for humans under the proposed conditions of use of the 837 pharmace utical . An analysis considering various factors that can increase or decrease the 838 level of concern is recommended. Such factors include animal - human exposure ratio, level of 839 maternal toxicity, dose - response relationship, type of observed effect(s), cross - s pecies 840 concordance , or similarity between pharmacologic and toxicologic al mechanisms. For 841 example, concern for a reproductive or developmental risk would be increased in the event of 842 a finding observed under any of the following conditions: low relative ex posure in animals, 843 cross - species concordance, absence of maternal toxicity, or similarity between 844 pharmacologic and reproductive/developmental toxicologic al mechanisms. Conversely, 845 25 concern can be decreased by high relative exposure in animals, absence of c ross - species 846 concordance, excessive maternal toxicity or species - specific mechanisms. 847 When assessing effects on embryo - fetal development, one particular difficulty arises when 848 fetal toxicity is observed at dose levels that were also toxic for the mother. It cannot be 849 assumed that developmental toxicity was secondary to maternal toxicity unless such a 850 relationship can be demonstrated either de novo or from published precedence . One way of 851 doing this is to assess the degree of concordance between the severit y of toxicity seen in the 852 individual dams and the effects on their litters. 853 Also, the consistency between studies can provide further evidence of an adverse effect of 854 the pharmaceutical (e.g., increased fetal lethality seen in a rodent EFD study consistent with 855 decreased live litter sizes in the PPND study). It is important to con sider the exposure at 856 which specific effects were seen across studies and species. Knowledge of the mechanism of 857 reproductive or developmental effects identified in animal studies can help to explain 858 differences in response between species and provide info rmation on the human relevance of 859 the effect (e.g., rodent - specific effects of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors on 860 cardiovascular fetal development). 861 In general, TEFL are considered to be the critical endpoints in assessing prenatal 862 developmental toxic ity. In contrast , reversible or minor manifestations of developmental 863 toxicity (e.g., changes in fetal weight, skeletal variations) by themselves are of minimal 864 concern from a risk assessment perspective. However, an increased incidence of variations 865 can i nfluence the interpretation of an equivocal increase in related malformations. The extent 866 of concern will be influenced by other factors (e.g., exposure multiple at which the findings 867 occurred, cross - species concordance). 868 As in the case of developmental t oxicity , reversible or minor manifestations of reproductive 869 toxicity (e.g., a transient inhibition of spermatogenesis) by themselves are of minimal 870 concern from a risk assessment perspective . 871 Comparison of pharmaceutical exposure at the No Observable Adverse Effect Level 872 (NOAEL) in the test species to that at the MRHD is a critical determination. This comparison 873 should be based on the most relevant metric (e.g., AUC, C max , C min , b ody surface area - 874 adjusted dose). In general, there is incre ased concern for reproductive or developmental 875 toxicity in humans when effects a re seen in a relevant animal species and exposure at the 876 NOAEL i s < 10 - fold the human exposure at the MR H D. When exposure at the NOAEL is > 877 10 - fold the human exposure at the MR HD, the concern is reduced. W hen the exposure in 878 animals at the NOAEL is > 25 - fold the exposure at the MR H D , there is minimal concern for 879 the clinical use of the pharmaceutical (Note 4 ) . If a significant difference in relative 880 exposures is observed between multiple test species, the appropriateness of the metric (e.g., 881 AUC, C max ) being used for the interspecies exposure comparisons should be reassessed. 882 When an alternative metric fails to reduce the disparity between species, the assessment of 883 risk should b e based on the most sensitive species. When applicable, the relative exposure 884 ratio should consider both the parent compound and its metabolites. 885 26 Generally, the results from definitive in vivo studies with adequate exposures compared to 886 the exposure at th e MRHD carry more weight than those from alternative assays or 887 preliminary studies. Also, the exposure data obtained from in vivo studies can be used to 888 determine whether a positive signal identified in an alternative assay presents a risk at the 889 MRHD unde r the clinical conditions of use of the pharmaceutical. 890 7.2 Risk A ssessment for L actation 891 Generally, evaluation s of a pharmaceutical's effects on lactation and its presence in milk in 892 animal studies have little relevance for human risk assessment. Pharmaceut icals can alter the 893 process of lactation in the nursing mother. While the outcome of the PPND (or ePPND) study 894 can inform the risk assessment and can inform as to whether there was extensive systemic 895 exposure in the suckling infant , information on the quantity of the pharmaceutical in milk 896 and production of milk is best derived from human experience , given that the composition of 897 milk varies significantly between rodents and humans. The risk for direct adverse effects on 898 the nursing infant depends on th e concentration s of the pharmaceutical and its metabolites in 899 the milk, their absorption, and the age of the infant. Premature infants and neonates have a 900 different capacity to absorb, metabolize and excrete pharmaceuticals compared to older 901 infants. 902 903 8 END NOTES 904 Note 1 : In particular, the testes and epididymides should be sampled and processed using 905 methods which preserve the tissue architecture and permits visualization of the spermatic 906 cycles. A detailed qualitative microscopic evaluation with awareness of the spermatogenic 907 cycle is sufficient to detect effects on spermatogenesis. A quantitative analysis of spermatic 908 stages (i.e., staging) is not generally recommended but can be useful to further characterize 909 any identified effects. In females, a detailed q ualitative microscopic examination of the and vagina 911 (rodents) should be conducted with special attention given to the qualitative assessment of 912 primordial and primar y follicles. 913 Note 2 : Qualified alternative assays within the context of this guideline can only be applied 914 under certain specific circumstances and have not been subject to formal validation. The EU 915 requires the use of non - animal approaches as soon as they are validated and accepted for 916 regulatory purposes (Directive 2010/63/EU, sector legislation and related guidance). 917 However, this EU directive does not apply to alternative assays qualified according to this 918 guideline. 919 Note 3 : The ICH R eference C ompou nd List in Annex 9.5.4 is not complete and as such we 920 are soliciting data for additional reference compounds (positive and negative) for potential 921 inclusion in to the list , including relevant information as discussed below . These compounds 922 can be either pha rmaceuticals or non - pharmaceuticals and should be commercially available. 923 Data to be submitted should include: 924 27 Name, structure of the compound, suggested compound category, and CAS identifier 925 (if available) ; 926 The specific TEFL observed in nonclinical test species ; 927 Exposures (C max and AUC) at the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level ( LOAEL ) if 928 applicable and the NOAEL ; 929 References/s ources for the specific data provided (will be made publicly available , if it 930 is not already ) : 931 See examples in Table 9 - 7 in Annex 9.5.4 for the type of data being requested, as 932 exemplified by four positive compounds (carbamazepine, fluconazole, 5 - fluorouracil, and 933 topiramate) and one negative compound (saxagliptin) . Data should be summarized using a 934 similar format as that shown in those examples. 935 This is not a request for data for the compounds listed in the Table 9 - 6 in Annex 9.5.4 , nor is 936 this a request for examples of assays that could be used. 937 Note 4 : An analysis of 20 known human teratogens showed that if malformations were 938 observed , exposure at the LOAEL in at least one species was < 25 - fold the exposure at the 939 MRHD. This indicates that using a > 25 - fold exposure ratio for high dose selection in the 940 d evelopment toxicity studies would have been sufficient to detect the teratogenic hazard for 941 all these therapeutics. The analysis also showed that for all human teratogens that were 942 detected in animal species the exposure at the NOAEL in at least one specie s was < 10 - fold 943 the exposure at the MRHD. 944 In addition, a survey was conducted on EFD toxicity studies by the IQ DruSafe Leadership 945 Group. This survey identified 163 and 152 definitive rat and rabbit EFD studies, 946 respectively, that achieved 15 - fold animal to human parent drug exposure ratios (using 947 human exposure at the intended therapeutic dose) in the absence of confounding (i.e., dose - 948 limiting) maternal toxicity. An analysis showed that: 949 Of the 163 rat studies, 51 (31%) achieved exposures 25 - fold hu man and only 6 (3.7% 950 of total cases) of these had TEFL findings. For all 6 rat cases , the LOAEL was 951 50 - fold human exposure, one of which was predicted to be positive based on its 952 mechanism of action. 953 Of 152 rabbit EFD studies, 35 (23%) achieved exposu res 25 - fold human exposure 954 and only 2 (1.3%) of these had TEFL findings. For the 2 rabbit cases , the LOAEL was 955 50 - fold human exposure. 956 These data show that dosing animals to achieve exposures 25 - fold human exposures when 957 there is no maternal toxicity (that would otherwise limit the high dose), only infrequently 958 detects a TEFL. In all these cases, TEFL findings were not observed until exposures 959 exceeded 50 - fold and findings at such high exposures are not believed to be relevant to 960 human risk assessmen t. In the absence of confounding (i.e., dose - limiting maternal toxicity), 961 28 the selection of a high dose for EFD and PPND studies that represents a > 25 - fold exposure 962 ratio to human plasma exposure of total parent compound at the intended maximal 963 therapeuti c dose is therefore considered pragmatic and sufficient for detecting outcomes 964 relevant for human risk assessment. 965 9 GLOSSARY 966 Alternative assay(s): In - vitro, ex - vivo or non - mammalian in - vivo assay(s) intended to 967 evaluate a developmental endpoint (i.e., teratogenicity or embryo/fetal lethality; see TEFL). 968 Applicability domain : This describes the types of substances in terms of their physical 969 properties or specific types of substances for which the assay is appropriate.

Numbers g roup sizes can be adjusted when 1077 there is e vidence either from the pharmacological action of the compound or from existing 1078 studies that the dosages used are expected to elicit an effect at a high frequency and therefore 1079 fewer animals are warranted to confirm the presence of an effect. The number of animals can 1080 differ according to the variable (endpoint) being considered, its prevalence in control 1081 populations (rare or categorical events) or dispersion around the central tendency (continuous 1082 or semi - continuous variables). 1083 For all but the rarest events (such as malformations, abortions, total litter loss), evaluation of 1084 16 to 20 litters for rodents and rabbits tends to provide a degree of consistency among 1085 35 studies. Below 16 litters per evaluation, between study results becom e inconsistent, and 1086 above 20 to 24 litters per group , consistency and precision is not greatly enhanced. These 1087 numbers relate litters available for evaluation. If groups are subdivided for different 1088 evaluations the number of animals starting the study shou ld be adjusted accordingly . 1089 Similarly, in studies with 2 breeding generations, 16 to 20 litters sh ould be available for the 1090 final evaluation of the litters of the F1 generation. To permit for natural attrition , starting 1091 group size of the F0 generation of at least 20 is recommended . 1092 1093 Provided below are representative study designs that could be utilize d . However, parameters, 1094 timings, and assessments can be readily modified and still meet the study goals. Expert 1095 judgment should be used for adapting these fra mework designs for individual laboratories 1096 and purposes. 1097 11.2.1 Fertility and Early Embryonic Development (FEED) S tudy 1098 A fertility assessment in rodents is generally recommended (see Sections 3.2 and 4.1). The 1099 aim of the FEED study is to test for toxic effects/disturbances resulting from treatment from 1100 before mating (males/females) through mating and implantation. This comprises evaluation 1101 of stages A and B of the reproductive process (see Section 2). For fe males, this should detect 1102 effects on the estrous cycle, tubal transport, implantation, and development of 1103 preimplantation stages of the embryo. For males, it will permit detection of functional effects 1104 (e.g., epididymal sperm maturation) that cannot be det ected by histological examinations of 1105 the male reproductive organs. The fertility study is designed to assess the maturation of 1106 gametes, mating behavior, fertility, preimplantation stages of the embryo, and implantation. 1107 A combined male/female FEED study is commonly used (See Table 9 - 2 ) , but separate male 1108 only or female only options are possible by substituting the appropriate number of untreated 1109 males or females in the study designs and should be considered case - by - case . 1110 36 Table 9 - 2 : FEED Study Design : Rats, combined male and female study 1111 1112 1113 a: Available data (e.g., histopathology, weight of reproductive organs, in some cases hormone assays and genotoxicity data ) 1114 from toxicity studies should be used to justify dosing duration, especially for detecting effects on spermatogenesis . 1115 Provided no effects have been found in repeated dose toxicity studies of at least 2 weeks duration that preclude this, a 1116 premating treatment interval of 2 week s for females and 2 weeks for males can be used. Treatment of males should 1117 continue throughout confirmation of mating, although termination following confirmation of female fertility can be 1118 valuable. Treatment of females should continue through at least i mplantation. This will permit evaluation of functional 1119 effects on fertility that cannot be detected by histopathological examination in repeated dose toxicity studies and effects 1120 on mating behaviour. If data from other studies show there are effects on wei ght or histology of reproductive organs in 1121 males or females, then a more comprehensive study should be considered. 1122 b: Most rats will mate within the first 5 days of cohabitation (i.e., at the first available estrus), but in some cases femal es can 1123 become pseudopregnant. Leaving the female with the male for up to 3 weeks permits these females to restart estr o us 1124 cycles and become pregnant. 1125 c : It can be of value to delay sacrifice of the males until the outcome of mating is known. In the event of an ef fect on 1126 fertility , males could be mated with untreated females to ascertain any potential male mediation of the effect . The males 1127 can also be used for evaluation of toxicity to the male reproductive system if dosing is continued beyond mating and 1128 euthanasi a delayed (e.g., histopathology, sperm analysis (see footnote d) . 1129 d : Sperm analysis (e.g., sperm counts, motility , and/or morphology ) can be used as an optional method to confirm findings 1130 by other methods and to characterize effects further. 1131 e : T ermination of females between days 13 - 15 of pregnancy in general is adequate to assess effects on fertility or 1132 reproductive function ( e.g., to differentiate between implantation and resorption sites ) . 1133 Parameter Male and Female Typical Group size 20 + 20 Number of dose groups 4 Administration period a M: 2 weeks prior to cohabitation through at least confirmation of mating F: 2 weeks prior to cohabitation through implantation (GD6) Mating ratio 1 male:1 female Mating period b 2 weeks Estrous cycle evaluation Daily, commencing 2 weeks before cohabitation and until confirmation of mating Clinical observations/mortality At least once daily Body weight At least twice weekly Food consumption At least once weekly (except during mating) Male euthanasia c Perform macroscopic examination and preserve macroscopic findings, testes and epididymides for possible microscopic examination Sperm analysis d Optional Mated female euthanasia e Perform macroscopic examination and cesarean section; preserve macroscopic findings, ovaries and uteri for possible microscopic examination Scheduled cesarean section: uterine implantation data Corpora lutea counts, number of implantation sites, live and dead embryos 37 11.2.2 Pre - and Postnatal Developmental (PPND) toxicity study 1134 A PPND study in rodents is generally warranted (see Sections 3.4 and 4.1). The aim of the 1135 PPND is to detect adverse effects on the pregnant/lactating female and on development of 1136 the conceptus and the offspring following exposure of the female from implan tation through 1137 weaning. Since manifestations of effect s induced during this period can be delayed, 1138 observations should be continued through sexual maturity (i.e., stages C through F of the 1139 reproductive process, see Section 2). The PPND toxicity study is de signed to assess 1140 enhanced toxicity relative to that in non - pregnant females, pre - and postnatal death of 1141 offspring, altered growth and development, and functional deficits in offspring, including 1142 maturation (puberty) , reproductive capacity at maturity , sen sory functions, motor activity , 1143 and l earning and memory. 1144 1145 The females are permitted to deliver and rear their offspring to weaning at which time at least 1146 one male and one female offspring per litter should be selected for rearing to adulthood and 1147 mating to assess reproductive competence (see Table 9 - 3 ). 1148 Table 9 - 3 : PPND Toxicity Study Design: Rats 1149 Parameter Typical Group size a Approximately 20 females Number of dose groups 4 Administration period From implantation ( 6 /7) Females Clinical observations/mortality At least once daily Body weight At least twice weekly Food consumption At least once weekly at least until delivery Parturition observations GD 21 until complete Necropsy PND 21 At necropsy, preserve and retain tissues with macroscopic findings and corresponding control tissues for possible histological evaluation F1 Pre - weaning Clinical observations/mortality Daily from PND 0 Litter size, live and dead Daily from PND 0 Body weights and sex PND 1, 4, 7, 14, and 21 Optional S tandardization of litter size PND 4, to 4 or 5 pups per sex Physical development and reflex ontogeny b Depending on landmark 1150 F1 Post - weaning Selection for post - weaning evaluation and group size c PND 21, at least 1 male and 1 female/litter where possible to achieve 20 animals per group/sex Clinical observations/mortality Daily Body weight Weekly Optional Food consumption Weekly M aturation (puberty) d Females: vaginal opening, from PND 30 until complete Males: preputial separation, from Day 40 until complete 38 Other functional tests e According to standard procedures Reproductive performance At least 10 weeks old, paired for mating (1M:1F) within the same group (not siblings) Terminal procedures of males and females P reserve organs with macroscopic findings for possible histological evaluation ; keep corresponding org ans of sufficient controls for comparison Cesarean section : uterine implantation data, corpora lutea counts, number of implantation sites, live and dead embryos a: In studies with 2 breeding generations, 16 - 20 litters should be available for the final evaluation of the litters of the F1 1151 generation. To permit for natural wastage, the starting group size of the F0 generation should be approximately 20. 1152 b: The best indi cator of physical development is bodyweight. Achievement of preweaning landmarks of development such 1153 as eye opening and pinna unfolding as well as others is highly correlated with pup bodyweight. Reflexes, surface 1154 righting, auditory startle, air righting, and response to light are also dependent on physical development. Therefore, 1155 attention should be paid to differences in these parameters when observed in the absence of effects on bodyweight. 1156 c: One animal per sex per litter are retained to conduct beha vioral and other functional tests, and to assess reproductive 1157 function. There can be circumstances where more animals per litter can be retained for independent functional 1158 assessments. 1159 d: B odyweight should be recorded at the time of attainment to determ ine whether any differences from control are specific 1160 or related to general growth. 1161 e: Investigators are encouraged to adopt methods that would assess sensory functions, motor activity, and learning and 1162 memory. Learning and memory should be evaluated in a complex learning task. Assessments of locomotor activity and 1163 startle reflex with prepulse inhibition (if conducted) should be evaluated over a sufficient period of time to demonstrate 1164 habituation. 1165 1166 11.2.2.1 Optional Modification of to Assess Juvenile Toxicity 1167 Endpoints 1168 In certain cases when a juvenile animal study is warranted, a PPND study can be modified to 1169 add juvenile toxicity endpoints to potentially reduce animal use and address a specific issue 1170 of concern ( 1 ) . T he following should be co nsidered to support this approach : 1171 Determine the period of exposure appropriate to support the pediatric use . 1172 Demonstrate adequate exposure in the pups via the milk and/or consider direct dosing 1173 of pups for the period of developmental interest (TK sampling of the F1 generation 1174 using culled animals during the early post - partum period or study animals shortly 1175 before weaning can provide exposure data and can avoid pre - weaning dosing). 1176 Endpoints included in this modified PPND study should be based on the principles 1177 appropriate for juvenile animal study designs supporting pediatric uses and are not discussed 1178 in this (S5) guidance. 1179 1180 11.2.2.2 Enhanced Pre in 1181 NHP 1182 The ePPND toxicity study ( Table 9 - 4 ) is a study in NHP that combines the endpoints from 1183 both the EFD and PPND studies in which dosing is extended throughout the gestation period 1184 to parturition (i.e., GD20 to parturition) . See ICH S6(R1) for information on timing and 1185 additional parameters to be evaluated . 1186 39 Table 9 - 4 : ePPND Toxicity Study Design: for cynomolgus monkey a 1187 Parameter Group size b Generally 16 presumed pregnant Number of dose groups At least one treatment group plus a control group Administration period Initiates upon detection of pregnancy (approximately GD 20) to parturition F0 Females Clinical observations/mortality At least once daily Body weight At least weekly Parturition observations Document day of completion Ultrasound evaluations Only to track pregnancy status Necropsy and tissue evaluation Only as warranted F1 Clinical observations/mortality Daily from PND 0 Body weights Weekly Morphometry/Physical development After PND 0 and at regular intervals Mother - infant interaction Minimally in early postnatal period to confirm nursing; as appropriate thereafter External evaluation After PND 0 and at regular intervals Skeletal evaluation Month 1 and/or later Visceral evaluation At necropsy Necropsy Variable timing , depends on aim of the evaluations P reserve and retain tissues for possible histological evaluation 1188 a: If an NHP other than the cynomolgus monkey is used, the study design should be adapted accordingly and a rationale 1189 provided. 1190 b : Group sizes in ePPND studies should yield a sufficient number of infants (6 - 8 per group at postnatal day 7) in order to 1191 assess postnatal development and provide the opportunity for specialist evaluation if warranted (e.g., immune system). Most 1192 ePPND studie s accrue pregnant animals over several months. See ICH S6(R1) regarding accrual of animals. 1193 11.2.3 Embryo - Fetal Developmental (EFD) T oxicity S tudy 1194 The aim of the EFD toxicity study is to detect adverse effects on the pregnant female and 1195 development of the embryo and fetus consequent to exposure of the female from 1196 implantation to closure of the hard palate ( Table 9 - 5 ). This comprises evaluation of stages C 1197 through D of the reproductive process (see Section 2). The embryo - fetal developmental 1198 toxicity study is designed to assess enhanced maternal toxicity relative to that in non - 1199 pregnant females, embryo - fetal death, altered growth, and structural changes. 1200 1201 11.2.3.1 Dose Range Finding ( DRF ) Study 1202 DRF studies in mated females are most often used to select appropriate dose levels , or dose 1203 schedules, for the definitive EFD studies but tolerability and TK data from existing repeat - 1204 dose toxicity can be sufficient for this purpose . 1205 40 11.2.3.2 pE FD Study 1206 The preliminary embryo - fetal developmental toxicity study ( Table 9 - 5 ) is similar in design 1207 to the definitive embryo - fetal developmental toxicity study. A typical pEFD study design 1208 includes dosing over the period of organogenesis, has adequate dose levels, evaluates a 1209 minimum of 6 pregnant females per group, and includes assessments of fetal survival and 1210 weight , as well as external and soft tissue examinations (see ICH M3(R2) ). 1211 11.2.3.3 Definitive E oxicity S tudy 1212 The females are cesarean sectioned near term and includes assessments of fetal survival and 1213 weight, as well as external, soft tissue and skeletal examinations ( Table 9 - 5 ). The timing 1214 given in Table 9 - 5 is for rat and rabbit. For other species appropriate t iming should be used. 1215 Table 9 - 5 : Embryo - Fetal Developmental Toxicity Study Design s for Rat and Rabbit 1216 EFD Parameter Rat Rabbit pEFD a GLP Status Yes Yes No Minimum number of litters 16 16 6 ( pregnant animal ) g Number of dose groups 4 4 4 Administration period b GD6 - 17 GD 7 - 19 Species appropriate Antemortem endpoints Clinical observations/mortality At least once daily At least once daily At least once daily Body weight c At least twice weekly At least twice weekly At least twice weekly Food consumption At least once weekly At least once weekly At least once weekly Toxicokinetics Yes Yes Optional Postmortem endpoints Cesarean section d /29 Species appropriate Macroscopic examination \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 Uterine weight Optional Optional Optional Corpora lutea Optional Optional Optional Implant sites \u0000 \u0000 Fetal external evaluations e,f Yes Yes Yes Fetal soft tissue evaluations e,f Yes Yes Yes Fetal skeletal evaluations e,f Yes Yes No 1217 a: In an enhanced pEFD study the number of pregnant animals should be increased from 6 to 8 per group, include fetal 1218 skeletal examinations, and it should be conducted in accordance with GLP regulations. 1219 b: Females are dosed with the test substance from implantation to closure of the hard palate (i.e., stage C of the reproductive 1220 process, see Section 2). 1221 c : Daily weighing of pregnant females during treatment can provide useful information. 1222 d: Cesarean sections should be conducted approximately one day prior to parturition. Preserve organs with macroscopic 1223 findings for possible histological evaluation; keep corresponding organs of sufficient controls for comparison. 1224 41 e : All fetuses should be examined for viability and abnormalities. To permit subsequent assessment of the relationship 1225 between observations made by different techniques fetuses should be individually identified. It is critical to be able to 1226 relate all findings by different examination techniques (i.e., body weight, external inspect ion, soft tissue and/or skeletal 1227 examinations) to a single specimen in order to detect patterns of abnormalities . 1228 f : It is preferable to examine all fetuses for both soft tissue and skeletal alterations, if permitted by the methods employed 1229 (e.g. fresh dissection or \u00b5CT, MRI, etc.). When using techniques precluding evaluation of both soft tissue and skeletal 1230 changes in the same fetus, 50% of fetuses from each litter should be allocated to each examination. The inter nal soft 1231 tissues of the head should be examined in at least 50% of the fetuses. 1232 1233 g : Minimum number of litters equals the number of pregnant animals per group, not the number of litters for pEFD studies. 1234 (FEFD) 1236 The aim of the combined FEFD study is to test for toxic effects/disturbances resulting from 1237 treatment from before mating (males/females) through mating, implantation and until the 1238 end of organogenesis. This comprises evaluation of stages A to C of the reproductive 1239 process (see Section 2). 1240 A combined male/female FEFD is commonly used, but a separate female only option is 1241 possible where male fertility is assessed in a separate study such as a repeat dose study of 1242 suitable duration. The study would then use untreated males for mating purposes only . For 1243 specific study design and observational parameters see Sections 9.4.1 and 9.4.3 (FEED and 1244 EFD). 1245 11.2.4.2 Fertility and PPND (FPPND) 1246 The aim of the combined Fertility and Pre - and Postnatal Development study (FPPND) study 1247 is to test for toxic effects/disturbances resulting from treatment from before mating 1248 (males/females) and to detect adverse effects on the pregnant/lactating female and on 1249 development of the conceptus and the offspring following exposure of t he female from 1250 implantation through weaning. Since manifestations of effect s induced during this period 1251 can be delayed, observations should be continued through sexual maturity . This comprises 1252 evaluation of stages A to F of the reproductive process (see Se ction 2). The pre - and 1253 postnatal developmental toxicity study is designed to assess enhanced toxicity relative to 1254 that in non - pregnant females, pre - and postnatal death of offspring, altered growth and 1255 development, and functional deficits in offspring, inc luding behavior, maturation (puberty) 1256 and reproductive capacity at maturity . 1257 The study design features should encompass those of the individual studies in terms of the 1258 number of animals used and the parameters assessed. For specific study design and 1259 observ ational parameters see Sections 9.4.1 and 9.4.2 , respectively ). 1260 A combined male/female FPPND can be used, but a separate female only option is possible 1261 where male fertility is assessed in a separate study such as a repeat dose study of sui table 1262 duration. The study would then use untreated males for mating purposes only. 1263 1264 42 11.3 Q ualification of Alternative Test S ystems for R egulatory A cceptance 1265 A framework and testing scheme to facilitate the qualification of alternative assays , 1266 including a list of test compounds (ICH Reference Compound List), is provided in this 1267 section. The ICH Reference Compound List provides information on embryo - fetal toxicity 1268 for various reference compounds, organize d by overarching categories. This list is generated 1269 r ecognizing that the context of use will inform on acceptability of particular alternative 1270 assessments. Performance factors for assay acceptance are also outlined. The ICH Reference 1271 Compound List is intended to be periodically updated. 1272 The applicability do main (see Glossary) together with the intended regulatory context of use 1273 influences the factors for assay qualification and the rigor for achieving regulatory 1274 acceptance. 1275 11.3.1 Selection Factors for the ICH Reference Compound List 1276 The ICH Reference Compound List aims to cover reference compounds known for their 1277 TEFL effects in animals or humans, even if the mode of action is uncertain. 1278 Availability of data showing clear TEFL effects in rats and/or rabbits in the absence of 1279 maternal toxi city represents an essential inclusion criterion for the selected positive 1280 compounds. This includes, when available, the multiples comparing human exposure to 1281 animal exposures where effects were seen. 1282 Availability of pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic data in the test species is an important 1283 criterion for the selection of reference compounds. Thus, all compounds used should have 1284 non - clinical exposure data (C max and/or AUC) under the approximate conditions tested 1285 yielding either negative or positive results in the in vivo studies for the species being 1286 predicted. While pharmaceuticals are preferred, other chemicals can be considered. The 1287 ICH Reference Compound Li st does not currently include biotechnology - derived 1288 pharmaceuticals. The list favors compounds with direct effects on the fetus; however, a few 1289 are known to depend on cytochrome P450 metabolic activation to cause TEFL. Cytotoxic 1290 and/or genotoxic compounds are included to a limited extent because they are expected to 1291 induce TEFL through their intrinsic property of preferentially damaging rapidly dividing 1292 cells. 1293 The performance of alternative assay(s) to detect species - specific differences can be 1294 evaluated b y testing reference compounds known to cause TEFL in a single species ; 1295 however, the number of such compounds available in the public domain is limited. 1296 C ompounds not causing TEFL (negative compound s ) are also included in the ICH 1297 Reference Compound List to permit assessment of assay specificity. These compounds can 1298 be negative at all in vivo doses tested, or can be positive (TEFL observed) at higher 1299 doses/exposures, provided the alternative assay predicts the transition from negative to 1300 positive. Th e alter native assay should predict a negative result at some extrapolated multiple 1301 under the conditions for which the in vivo study yielded a negative result (no TEFL ). 1302 43 Further, the ICH Reference Compound List includes compounds from different 1303 chemical/pharmaco logic classes with overlap with both negative and positive compounds to 1304 enable adequate coverage of the alternative assay for pharmaceuticals and diverse chemical 1305 structures and mode of action. 1306 It is not critical for assay qualification purposes that the e xposures achieved in animals that 1307 resulted in negative or positive TEFL outcome exceed the human exposures. This is in 1308 contrast to application of assay results for risk extrapolation where preferably the highest 1309 doses/exposures tested are at or above MRHD. 1310 Finally, the commercial availability of the selected compounds of appropriate quality was 1311 considered in the generation of the list. 1312 11.3.2 Performance F actors 1313 To be appropriate for regulatory use, the alternative assay(s) should be characterized using 1314 the ICH Reference Compound List . The list is not exhaustive and the recommendations 1315 provided are based on available information and pragmatic considerations . At least 45 1316 compounds in total should be tested. Other compounds can substitute for the non - core 1317 compounds , but their use should be justified according to the inclusion factors mentioned 1318 above. 1319 The compounds are distributed into multiple classes, covering a wide range of biological and 1320 chemical activities. All classes should be tested ( at least 2 or 3 compound s from each class). 1321 An approximate 2:1 ratio of positive to negative compounds should be tested because it is 1322 important to identify positive compounds, but this ratio also ensures selectivity with the 1323 limited number of compounds available . For safety asses sment purposes, and for some 1324 contexts of use, the false negative rate can be more important than the false positive rate. 1325 The sensitivity to detect a positive signal in an assay (s) , should be at least 80%, with 1326 evidence of selectivity (i.e. , differentiati ng between true positives and true negatives). 1327 The e valuation should identify the applicability domain and any limitations of the assay (s) , 1328 and include assessments of accuracy, and reproducibility over time. Inter - laboratory 1329 reproducibility and transferability should be established if a particular assay is to be used in 1330 more than one laboratory. 1331 Individual assays or combinations of assays can be used to predict TEFL . The performance 1332 characteristics of each individu al assay as well as the performance of the combined battery , if 1333 used, should be specified. Various statistical methods are available for determining which 1334 combination of assessments will give the best predictivity. 1335 11.3.3 Assay Qualification Information to be Pr ovided to Health Authorit ies 1336 To enable evaluation of an alternative assay(s) for use in risk assessment for regulatory 1337 purposes , the following information should be provided . 1338 44 A detailed description should be presented concerning what the predictive model is, what 1339 species (e.g., rat, rabbit, and/or human outcomes) it is trying to predict, and what 1340 reproductive endpoint it assesses. The predictive model can consist of a single assay or a 1341 battery of assays used together to predict the endpoint of interest (e. g., TEFL) in the 1342 respective species such as rat. If a battery of assays is used, each should be fully described. 1343 The specific endpoint(s) used (e.g., gene signature, morphology) should be described and 1344 how the assessment is made, including how the endpoint s were selected and the specific 1345 factors for positive and negative determinations, should be discussed. 1346 1347 The details of the algorithm employed for determining positive and negative outcomes from 1348 assay observations should also be presented. The predictive model should correlate 1349 concentrations tested in the alternative assay(s) to the in vivo exposure that results in an 1350 adverse outcome in the species being predicted. For example, concentrations associated with 1351 positive effects on the endpoint should take into consideration in vivo exposure such as C max 1352 or AUC. This permits the model to be used for exposure - based risk assessment. The 1353 pharmacokinetic parameter used including any normalization factors employed to correlate 1354 with in vivo results should be presented (Section 3.5.3). 1355 1356 The compound list used to qualify the assay performance should be presented. 1357 Documentation should include a clear identification of the compound list used as the 1358 Training Set (see Glossary) to develop the assay, and the compound list used as the Test Set 1359 ( see Glossary) to evaluate the assay's performance. The assay Training Set can include 1360 compounds of the sponsor's choice not on the ICH Reference Compound L ist. Additional 1361 compounds not in the ICH Reference Compound list can be used as part of the Training Set 1362 or the Test set, but not both. No more than 15% compounds from the ICH Reference 1363 Compound List can be used for the Training Set . This permits an adequate number of 1364 compounds from the ICH Reference Compound L ist to be used as part of the Test Set for 1365 qu alification purposes. Reserving 85% of compounds from the ICH Reference Compound 1366 List for the Test Set permits a sufficiently robust evaluation of the assay's predictivity. 1367 1368 The performance of the Training and Test sets should be evaluated separately an d together 1369 and the results of each analysis presented. The performance summary should list the 1370 sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. If more than 1371 one assay is used, the performance of each assay should be provi ded separately in addition to 1372 the integrated assessment used for the predictive model. In the case of integration of more 1373 than one assay in the model, a clear description should be presented of how the integration of 1374 the individual assays is conducted to a rrive at the integrated predictive model. 1375 1376 As part of the assay qualification and predictive model use, the category of compounds the 1377 assay can and cannot predict (e.g., a component of the applicability domain) should be 1378 defined from the following list of categories included in the ICH Compound Reference List 1379 (see Glossary) thers . Additionally, human teratogens not detected in vivo by rat and/or rabbit should 1383 45 also be evaluated to understand if the assay can detect them, even if the assay(s) intended use 1384 is to predict rat or rabbit outcomes. These results should be presented separately and the 1385 sponsor should justify whether or not an d if so, how, to include these results in their 1386 predictivity assessment . 1387 1388 Demonstration of assay reproducibility should be assessed and can be accomplished by 1389 inclusion of at least one positive control and one negative control in either each assay run or 1390 i nterspersed over time between test compound runs. The sponsor should justify their 1391 approach to inclusion of positive and negative controls. The approach used to demonstrate 1392 assay reproducibility should be described in the information provided. Additionally , several 1393 of the compounds from the ICH Reference Compound List should be periodically reassessed 1394 and the data provided along with compounds being evaluated for therapeutic development. 1395 The source of reagents, biologic materials, and compounds tested sho uld be provided. 1396 Likewise, the source/reference of all in vivo exposure data used for compounds in the 1397 qualification data set should also be presented, except for those compounds in the ICH 1398 Reference Compound List since that would be the source (reference) information. Assays 1399 should be developed with the understanding there is an expectation that regulatory studies 1400 should generally be conducted in compliance with GLP . 1401 1402 The sponsor of the alternative assay should state whether the assay qualification has bee n 1403 previously submitted to any health authority in support of reproductive toxicity assessments 1404 and, if so, to which one(s). 1405 1406 11.3.4 ICH Reference Compound List 1407 The ICH Reference Compound List ( Table 9 - 6 ) is not intended to cover tailored approaches 1408 studying sp ecific pharmaceutical targets or chemistry of structurally related analogs. For 1409 particular pharmaceuticals and context s of use, justification for use of particular 1410 assays/assessments should be given (e.g., the Sponsor has in vivo information on other 1411 pharmaceuticals in the class). Table 9 - 7 provides examples of data records for including 1412 compounds in the ICH Reference Compound List for qualifying alternative assays. 1413 Table 9 - 6.

The use of a particular scenario needs to be justified. 1450 In circumstances oth er than those described in 9 . 5. 5. 1 and 9 . 5 . 5. 2 below a nd elsewhere in 1451 this guid eline where use of alternative assays is proposed, positive results in alternative 1452 assays can also reduce mammalian in vivo testing. In contrast, negative results in alternative 1453 assays in most of these other circumstances would not be anticipated to reduce in vivo 1454 testing. See Figure 9 - 1. 1455 Figure 9 - 1: Summary of Available Test Options 1456 1457 56 11.3.5.1 Scenarios applicable when there are at least 2 relevant mammalian species 1458 (crf. Species selection) 1459 This section describes optional integrated testing strategies that can be used to detect adverse 1460 effects on embryo - fetal development. The use of a particular testing strategy should be 1461 justified. 1462 a) Scen ario 1: Pharmaceuticals for late - life onset diseases ( Figure 9 - 2 ) 1463 1. When a qualified alternative assay predicts TEFL in one species (e.g., rat) or is 1464 equivocal, an EFD assessment ( e.g . pEFD ) in another species (e.g., 1465 rabbit) should be conducted to evaluate the multi - species risk and assess the finding 1466 in vivo . 1467 a. If TEFL is observed in the in vivo study (e.g., rabbit), the pharmaceutical will be 1468 considered to induce TEFL in multiple species ba sed on the alternative assay and 1469 in vivo results . 1470 b. If no TEFL is detected in the in vivo study, a definitive EFD should be conducted 1471 in the species corresponding to the alternative assay to further assess the TEFL 1472 potential in vivo . If TEFL is observed in this definitive in vivo EFD study, the 1473 pharmaceutical will be considered positive in animal studies based on the 1474 positive alternative assay and in vivo for the same species. No further EFD 1475 studies are warranted, as a hazard has been identified and the risk assessment can 1476 be made based on the totality of the information. If no TEFL is observed in both 1477 in vivo EFD studies , the results from the alternative assay represent a false 1478 positive and the pharmaceutical will be considered not likely to induce TEFL , 1479 provided adequate exposure was achieved in the in vivo testing (e.g., exposures 1480 in vivo exceed the human exposure). 1481 2. When an alternative assay predicts a negative outcome (i.e., no TEFL ) in one species 1482 (e.g., rat), a n EFD study in another species (e.g., rabbit) should be conducted to 1483 determine if the pharmaceutical is positive for TEFL in vivo . 1484 a. If a TEFL outcome is observed in the second species EFD study , the 1485 pharmaceutical will be considered positive in animals. Further EFD studies 1486 would be warranted only if they would significantly alter the risk assessment 1487 (e.g., positive only at high multiples of the clinical exposure and thus another 1488 species could indicate a relevant risk at low exposures). 1489 b. If no TEFL is detected in the second species definitive EF D study , the 1490 pharmaceutical will be considered not likely to induce TEFL in animal studies 1491 ( in vitro and in vivo ) and no further EFD studies would be warranted. 1492 For the scenarios above where a rat EFD study is not conducted, an additional opportunity to 1493 confirm in vitro positive outcomes is presented in either rat fertility or pre - and postnatal 1494 57 development studies where exposure in vivo can further inform on developmental 1495 reproductive risk. 1496 Figure 9 - 2: Scenario 1 Showing the Integrated Testing Strategies for EFD for 1497 Pharmaceuticals for Late - life Onset Diseases 1498 1499 1500 b) Scenario 2: Pharmaceuticals for severely debilitating or life - threatening disease (s) 1501 ( Figure 9 - 3 ) 1502 Considering the risk /benefit for pharmaceuticals for severely debilitating or life threatening 1503 conditions compared to less severe chronic disease , the use of qualified alternative assay(s) 1504 contributes to and can be sufficient to assess relevant risk. 1505 1. When a qualified alternative assay predicts TEFL in a species (e.g., rat) or is 1506 equivocal ( or if a class effect has been identified ) additional testing is not warranted 1507 (Flow Chart 2) unless the result is suspected to represent a false positive. 1508 a. If the Sponsor wants to demonstrate that results represent a false positive, 1509 definitive EFD studies should be conducted in two species to confirm absence of 1510 TEFL in vivo . 1511 58 i. If no TEFL is observed in both species in vivo , results from the alternative 1512 in vitro assay represent a false positive and the pharmaceutical will be 1513 considered negative in vivo and this information will be used in the risk 1514 assessment. 1515 ii. If one or more of these in vivo studies has positive TEFL outcome, the 1516 pharmaceutical will be considered positive in vivo and this will be factored 1517 into the risk assessment. 1518 2. If the alternative assay predicts a negative outcome (i.e., no TEFL ), an EFD study in 1519 the other species (e.g., rabbit) should be conducted to determine if the pharmaceutical 1520 is positive in vivo . 1521 a. If a TEFL outcome is observed in the second species EFD study, the 1522 pharmaceuti cal will be considered positive in animals. Further EFD studies 1523 would be warranted only if they would significantly alter the risk assessment 1524 (e.g., positive only at high multiples of the clinical exposure and thus another 1525 species could indicate a relevant risk at low exposures). 1526 b. If no TEFL is observed in the second species definitive EFD study, the 1527 pharmaceutical will be considered negative in animals and no further EFD 1528 studies would be warranted . 1529 1530 59 Figure 9 - 3: S cenario 2 Showing the Integrated Testing Strategies for EFD for 1531 Pharmaceuticals for Severely Debilitating or Life Threatening Diseases 1532 1533 1534 11.3.5.2 Scenarios applicable in case there is no or only 1 relevant mammalian 1535 species (crf. Species selection) 1536 a) Scenario 3: Non - highl y Targeted p harmaceuticals that are pharmacolo - gically active 1537 in only one or no species 1538 If there is evidence (e.g., mechanism of action, phenotypic data from genetically modified 1539 animals, class effects) that there will be an adverse effect on pregnancy ou tcome, these data 1540 can provide adequate information to communicate risk to reproduction and nonclinical in 1541 vivo studies are not warranted. Similar approaches are discussed in other guidelines (ICH 1542 S6 (R1) (2) and ICH S9 (3) ). 1543 1544 If the evidence is lacking, inconclusive or negative for TEFL effects, an EFD study in a 1545 single species should be conducted. If that study is positive for TEFL , an EFD study in a 1546 second species is not warranted provided the observations occurred at relevant margins of 1547 exposure and in terpretation is not "}
