To achieve good health one must have a happy and healthy gut. A gut detox is a great method of achieving this. In Traditional Chinese Medicine your gut consists of your stomach, spleen, liver, gall bladder, and the small and large intestines. Your gut is where you absorb nutrients, create energy and remove waste, making it the most important system for your health. It is where 70% of your immune system resides. Problems with your gut will result in your body having less nutrients, reduced energy and higher vulnerability to illness and disease. If you experience: Then your gut is telling you it needs help. This help can come in the form of a gut detox. The How of the Gut The gut is a powerhouse of activity but it can get overwhelmed. The most common reason for this is a build-up of toxins in the body. In Chinese medicine toxins fall under the category of phlegm. Toxins surround us every day: they are in the food we eat, the air we breathe, the products we use. The amount of ingested by us on a daily basis is so high that it exceeds what our body can handle. Toxins overwhelm our gut and slow down our digestion, allowing for bad bacteria to ferment. Our systems then absorb these bacteria which causes an immune reaction. This can include inflammation, flu or infection-like symptoms and indigestion. As the conditions get more chronic so do the symptoms you experience. Gut Detox - The Solution To help the gut return to full health we recommend a detox. This is a way of bringing the body back into balance so that it can naturally heal itself. In Chinese medicine a detox will rid the body of phlegm, freeing the gut so that it may begin filtering at a normal rate. This will result in more energy within the body, equipping it to fight and protect itself.

Chinese Medicine Tips to Improve Digestion: - Eat in balance. This means eating regular meals each day. Do not eat too much (bingeing) or too little (skipping meals). It also means eating enough of each macronutrient, especially complex carbohydrates (vegetables and legumes) and proteins. This prevents your gut from getting sluggish. - Eat mindfully. Chew your food slowly and focus on eating your food without distractions. Try to avoid eating while watching television, using your phone or even reading a book. By doing this and eating slower you will make digestion easier. - Minimise cold foods and drinks. Avoid eating too many foods raw and limiting the amounts of dairy you have. Also do not drink cold drinks while eating as this disrupts the digestion process. "}
