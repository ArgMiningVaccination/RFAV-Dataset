The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 4 By Rev. Marie Duquette I am writing this on the one-year anniversary of the first case of Covid-19 being diagnosed in Michigan. It is also the one-year anniversary of my mother's memorial service. It was held here in Ann Arbor, at the church where I serve as a pastor. Her service was live cast on Facebook, a first for our little congregation. Family and friends tuned in from Hawaii, California, South Dakota, Arizona, Texas, Ohio, Maryland, and Florida. It was the first time in my 18 years as a pastor that I fully understood the value of live casting worship, an experience I and many of my colleagues have often considered too personal and intimate...too sacred maybe...for livestreaming on social media. It seemed so...televangelistic. Just before Covid-19 hit, I read the book, The Weight of Ink (Rachel Kadish), a historical fiction set in the plague in London in the 1600s. I was fascinated reading how people had survived. It makes me wonder how writers will describe this era in historical novels yet to be written. So, I decided to reflect on the little things we might remember about this time beyond the bone-chilling fear, and mind-numbing grief. For me, last year was the first time both of my brothers had been in any of the four churches I've served while I was leading worship; it was the first time the three of us had been together in 19 years, the last time being at my father's funeral in California. It was the first time I wore a hat in church. It was the first time my congregation met my extended family and the first time my older brother, Gerry, a magnificent guitarist, played in public as everyone gathered. It was the first time I heard Led Zeppelin ( The Rain Song and Tangerine), and House of the Rising Sun, as a prelude for a Memorial Service in a church. The very next day was a Sunday of unanticipated and completely unplanned lasts. That next day would be the last service we had inside the walls of the church before Covid-19 sent us all home for more than a year. It was the last time I saw people I loved without fabric masking our expressions. The last time I lead worship with real confidence. The last time we hugged one another, we for whom expressions of support such as touch were a regular part of our communion. It was the last time we would sing together, When the Saints Go Marching In with tambourines and clapping, which feels prophetic today. It was the last time we shared a meal; the last time we ate inside at a restaurant. These firsts and lasts have acted as mile markers as we moved through an avalanche of new. New fear, new masks, new rising numbers of those afflicted and those who have died. Bottles of hand sanitizer, like individual rocks in an avalanche, on every counter, at every entrance, in every purse and car. The roar of the disaster was heard as more and more schools were closed, graduations were cancelled, weddings were postponed, and news anchor's voices became increasingly grave and worried. For every person who died, an average of nine people began to grieve\u2014 profoundly. We felt the weight of that grief like deep, wet, snow weighing us down. At first, we moved in shock, much the same way one moves through the first days after burying a loved one. But by the time spring was in full bloom, many of us were highly invested in developing new ways to navigate through the dynamite blasts that marked the months of 2020. We perfected Zoom gatherings, online shopping, and curbside pick-ups. Fine restaurants pivoted to offer both groceries and carry-out family meals brought to your car. We congratulated ourselves for having resilience at the first birthday car parade and first video tributes to healthcare workers that made us both cry and hit replay. We tipped everyone, everywhere, as well as we possibly could. We wept when local shops closed. For many, it was a year of discovering a depth of gratitude that, before the pandemic, we never realized was missing. We began to thank random truckers we met while pumping gas, every grocery store worker, every bus driver, and every doctor even when we only met them on a screen. We put signs of encouragement on our lawns, wore buttons of support, and masks emblazoned with: We Healthc are Workers. As our anxiety increased, we developed a collective need to do something, anything, to make us feel like we had some control. We cleaned every closet. We created individual work areas for every family member who worked at home. We Weathering an Avalanche www.victoriaschon.comCreating a sacred space of high frequency sound and vibration to support the innate and divine ability of the body, mind and heart to self-heal. It was the first time...that I fully understood the value of live casting worship, an experience I and many of my colleagues have often considered too personal and intimate...too sacred maybe...for livestreaming on social media. It seemed so...televangelistic. The very next day was a Sunday of unanticipated and completely unplanned lasts. Reflections On This Pandemic YearThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 5 developed pods that included a few people who did not live with us, confessing, in hushed voices, that we heard it was okay. We sent care packages to neighbors. We bought ice cream as often as we bought bread. We got our paperwork in order. I was in an actual avalanche once. While skiing at Sundance in Utah, four of us made a game of trying to get the last lift to the top of the mountain. When we got off the last lift, we looked back and realized we were not last, as we had thought. A lift of ski patrol workers had jumped on behind us. They skied up to us quietly and said, \"We are at risk of avalanche. We need you to follow us down. Try to stay in our tracks. Don't stop if you can help it. Don't yell if you fall. We'll get there together.\" I have never skied so well or so quietly in my life.For the next several days, we were confined to the A-frame log chalet in the mountains where we listened to explosives that were judiciously placed and ignited so as to control the direction of the avalanches. We drank daquiris and dared one another to jump from the hot tub into the snow outside. It was a fine distraction from the fear that lay above us. Today, I listened to my mother's memorial service for the first time; available now because we live-streamed it then. In the welcoming remarks, I heard some words I had written, \"We often grieve alone, but healing frequently happens in community. We all carry losses of many kinds. Today we grieve with Carole's family and together we grieve our own cumulative losses. We are in this together. Standing with one another in this time of loss, may we all be healed.\" I had no idea when I wrote that, that it would be prescriptive for how we would make it through the avalanche of lasts. And now, it is gradually becoming time for us to all come out of the cabin. To join those who have been strategically setting the dynamite. To see the folks at our favorite coffee shop. To wipe off white boards in classrooms and greet students as they arrive. To find one another again. If the pattern remains, the thing that follows so many firsts and lasts, seems to be the \"new.\" My hope is that our new ways will be ones that incorporate all we have learned about ourselves, our relationships, and our ability to remain resilient and think creatively. Because people who have survived an avalanche together have a bond that can hold for a lifetime. And oh, how we might make life better, not despite\u2014but precisely because of\u2014all we went through and continue to go through together. And honestly, I don't think I've ever seen people rise and be transformed as much as I have this past year. It reminds me of the verse a bishop from Montana who had seen his share of inexplicable suffering used to say with great reverence: \"It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\" These firsts and lasts have acted as mile markers as we moved through an avalanche of new. New fear, new masks, new rising numbers of those afflicted and those who have died. . For many, it was a year of discovering a depth of gratitude that, before the pandemic, we never realized was missing. If the pattern remains, the thing that follows so many firsts and lasts, seems to be the \"new.\" Rev. Marie Duquette is the pastor at King of Kings Lutheran Church.

Marni Schmid https://marnischmid.com The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 6 By Laurel Hogge There is a reason we feel more peaceful when we spend time connecting with our pets or hiking in the forest. Nature is in perpetual energetic flow and does not manipulate energy the way people do. Humans continually try to divert, filter, suppress, create, and extinguish energy. Because of this, when we are immersed in the flow of nature, our body's energetic response is to line up with that frequency. We let go of a little of that human tendency to control energy. It's relaxing , and when we are relaxed, we are open to receive communication from our own intuition as well as Source (the name I will use in reference to God, Universe, Deity, Divinity ). We could all use some extra help to answer the questions that are dearest to us. Whether or not our questions are complex and life changing, Source is eager to guide us toward balance so we can move more confidently on our authentic and joyful path. I find that once I open the conversation, and invite Source to share messages with me, I feel an urge to get outside. Then I listen and pay attention to what is happening all around me from the ground to the sky and everywhere in between. I began receiving messages from nature without knowing it was happening. For many years I took the same hiking routes hundreds of times without any notable nature signs. It was when I reached out specifically to ask for guidance that my outings took on a magical tone. Serendipitous discoveries became gifts with meanings that were directly given to my soul. Perhaps you can relate to some of my experiences. At first, I came across feathers. I soon had a collection of assorted colors and sizes from many different species. And then it became common to stop in my tracks to find an animal pausing long enough for me to look into her eyes. Foxes, coyotes, wild turkeys, and deer seemed to be everywhere. With the frequency of these encounters, I became curious. I began searching online, and in books, to find out why this was happening, and I learned to apply symbolism and meaning to my wilderness encounters. I learned that many spiritual traditions practice communicating with the supernatural through the natural. Some of them are ancient, and over time these traditions have created their own symbolism and language associated with this practice. It fascinates me that many Native American traditions refer to working with nature as a way of healing through \"medicine\" that brings us into inner balance\u2014in other words, into harmony with nature. For example, when one is visited by crows in life, in dreams, or in meditation, \"crow medicine\" is being applied. Cherokee tradition teaches that Crow medicine \"gives us the ability to make decisions, open ourselves to change, and experience magic in the world around us.\" After learning this, I stopped viewing this common bird through its popular assignment as an ominous, dark pest. I now see a bright reminder that spiritual magic is everywhere. There are hundreds of elements in nature that have symbolic healing power. In other words, a coyote is not simply a wild dog. It carries with it information\u2014depending on where it is seen, whether it is calling out or silent, and whether it is playing, hiding, hunting, eating, or being watchful. In the Navajo tradition, Coyote is a symbol of mischief and playfulness. Seeing one is usually a reminder to take life less seriously. I have taken this as the message I needed many times. However, there was a time I needed a different message. I was at an important crossroads in life when I needed to transition from homemaker for a family of six to a full-time career that would bring financial independence. Seeing a coyote crouched at the edge of my neighbor's field and focused on the flock of Canada geese in front of it, I was encouraged to trust Source that I would find what I needed. The message was that it was a time to be less carefree and to focus on survival. Even when I was discouraged by job application rejections, Source reassured me that I have useful skills. I just might have to be patient as I prepared for the right moment to pounce. Just remember, when searching out the meaning of a nature message you received, that the interpretation for nature messages varies depending on the author of the website or book. Don't despair! This creates an added opportunity to personalize your experience with nature messages. For example, when blue jays began showing up for me in a dramatic way, I did a quick search for its spirit meaning. I was overwhelmed to find there were multiple variations on its meaning. Once I spent time considering its importance for me personally, I then assigned the meaning that resonated most for me in that moment. Blue jay became a symbol of coming into my own strength and sharing wisdom with others. I was in yoga teacher training, learning about the chakra system, when I realized the blue jay's turquoise plumes coincide with the color of the throat chakra. So, it is no coincidence that when I most needed encouragement to be seen and heard as a confident teacher, Source would Conversations with NatureConversations with Nature As you begin to examine the symbolism behind your own nature discoveries, you will find that Source has a message intended just for you.

That's the fun part because it means we get to be curious and creative. We can use existing techniques or develop our own. It's really not important how the information comes through. It's about using your beautiful intuitive guide to connect with Source through nature. As you begin to examine the symbolism behind your own nature discoveries, you will find that Source has a message intended just for you. There is no need to be overly anxious. Just be aware. Open your heart and surrender to the magic of discovering what is guiding you and what it is trying to tell you. Invite your spirit guides to communicate through nature messages; then, go about your day in a spirit of trust that what is needed will come at the moment you need it. And remember to thank Source and nature, because gratitude opens us up even more to receive a continual and flowing dialogue. Suggestions for communicating with and through nature: Meditate to open your heart and mind Ask to be guided through nature Be in nature as often as possible Learn traditional symbolism Explore your own symbolism and write it down Take note of nature in dreams as well as in waking life send a blue jay message. A bright blue streak would fly across my path just in time to remind me not to be afraid to be seen. Or I could hear their unmistakable call loud and clear and it was a reminder to me that I needed to speak up and speak clearly. If you want to connect to Source through nature, try looking at it as a type of meditation. Similar to being in the flow of nature, meditation helps us surrender to energetic flow. Both are also a dialogue in the sense that we can ask questions and speak our needs to Source, and with gratitude and openness we can anticipate that an answer will come to us. Like meditation, it takes practice to develop and fine tune The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 7 When searching out the meaning of a nature message you received, that the interpretation for nature messages varies depending on the author of the website or book.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 8 What do you get when a poet and a chiropractor set out to explore and revitalize the physical body from a spiritual perspective? Poet Elizabeth Alberda and I created the work and workshops called Spiritual Anatomy. Our journey took us from the inner workings of the body's organs and tissue to the mystical and mythical writings and imaginings of teachers and scholars. At its heart, spiritual anatomy became a practice\u2014a study of the human body as a reflection of the soul. We visualized the soul telling its story through the physical body, using tools like meditation, writing, movement, and sound to evoke and express that which was within. Each month we focused on the unique aspects of a certain body part which allowed us to call forth that which needed healing and that which provided strength. As beings composed of a Spiritual Anatomy, we embody balance, homeostasis, wholeness, and health. Our brain holds the vision of our whole, unblemished health. Science shows that after amputation a \"phantom limb\" remains. Recovering yourself through Spiritual Anatomy allows you to envision your perfection as a dance, a poem, a song, or a dream. How do we recapture this innocent acceptance of our wholeness, our holiness? Harnessing the power within through physical, energetic, creative, intellectual, and meditative exercises, Elizabeth and I set out with a group of intrepid explorers. As the chiropractor, I built the scaffold of body parts and processes by giving names and teaching functions. Elizabeth blew soul wind into the forms with words and spirit practices. We relied heavily on myth, folk wisdom, spiritual teachers, and practices from our own investigation and trainings for the groundwork. Each month, as a different system of the body was unveiled, we let Spirit guide us and our group toward the achievement of greater joy in our lives. I invite you now to allow yourself to expand the \"Health within You\" with one small exercise. Consider that health is the entity within, and we are all born with a large, all-encompassing amount of it. Within us is a life force so powerful, so intelligent thatit commands our heart to beat, our lungs to expand and contract, our hormones to rise and fall, our digestive system to extract exactly what it is needed\u2014and this happens moment to moment all the years of our lives. Prepare for this experience by being seated in a comfortable position with pen and paper handy for recording words, images, or messages you may receive from within. If you wish, you could record your voice describing this process and then play it while meditating. Or you could have a trusted companion read the words to you and you signal when to pause. The meditation: The intention of this meditation can be whatever you designate. However, consider this an opportunity to Re-member parts of your anatomy that may be lost, or neglected, or just have something to say to you! Close your eyes and visualize yourself walking a path through the woods. Know that you are safe and protected by the spirit that moves through all things. Feel the warm breeze, smell the leaves and the undergrowth, hear the water flow in the brook by the side of the path. Up ahead the path crosses over the brook on a small wooden bridge. As you walk across you come to a large oak door. You step forward and open the door. In front of you now is an open meadow with wildflowers, soft grass, and singing birds. In the center of the meadow is a round table with several chairs. You take a seat at the table facing the open doorway you just passed through. With silent intent, you ask your spirit guide, your ancient one, to sit on your left side. Thank them for coming when they arrive. Now ask that your inner creative, playful, joyful child come and sit on your right side. Thank them for coming. Now announce your intention for being here today. (Ours was to ask for all our body parts still in need of healing or of communicating in some way to come to the table with us). Say, \"I have undertaken a journey of merging flesh and spirit into an integrated whole through the process of spiritual anatomy. I now ask that any body parts that have information or wish to be present for this integration to come and participate or observe. I invite you to enter one at a time through the open door and be with us at the table.\" Focus your attention now on the doorway with an open heart, open mind, and sense of play. Who has arrived? (I once had my intestines slither in!) Thank the body part for joining you and say, \"I'm open and eager to hear what you have to say, to know what you may need, and to receive any information you can share to help us on our journey toward wholeness. If you are willing to communicate with words, sounds, pictures, or even just feelings, please feel free to do so. If you just wish to be present as witness, join us.\" You may wish to take time to write down what each body part transmits before moving to the next part of the exercise. Say, \"Now from the intricate richness of the left and right halves of our brain, from the masculine and the feminine, from our playful, creative self, and our spiritual, mystical, ancient self, we offer these possibilities\" to let the body part know that the three selves gathered here would like to offer possibilities for healing, wholeness, and reintegration. Ask if this would be acceptable and if so continue. Allow the ideas to flow as a beam of light, color, and sound to the body part who has arrived. Do this for as many body parts as wish to join the gathering. When a sense of completion for this day arrives, thank all the body parts for their participation. Stand and offer each a loving embrace before closing. Go back through the door, down the path, and back into the present moment. The energy wave generated by this exercise may manifest in many ways. Your dreams could be rich and vivid. You may find yourself drawn to some particular music or movement. You may rediscover yoga, writing, or a forgotten art form from your past. Or perhaps you have unearthed fodder for talk therapy or sharing with a friend. Whatever arrives, may it ignite with you a cohesion of your body and your soul, what we like to call your Spiritual Anatomy.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 9 The Transformative Power of Raqs Sharqi The Transformative Power of Raqs Sharqi - - Belly Dancing with Sheila MayBelly Dancing with Sheila May Continued on next pagedancers and practice movements alone in my room. Something about the music, the cos-tumes, and the energy of the movements attracted me. When I moved to Ann Arbor I found out about Sheila May's local belly dance classes and decided to make my dream of being a belly dancer come to fruition. I walked into the dance room to find women of all different ages and body types wearing hip scarves and laughing with each other, while Arabic music played in the background. We stood separately in our own spaces but danced as a group, each staring down our own reflection as we watched our bodies move to the music. As I began my belly dance journey, I experienced for myself why those belly dancers always looked so strong. The dance not only physically changed my body, but it changed the way I felt about myself. Belly dancing was not just an enjoyable way to move, but also a path to becoming more in touch with myself. Each time I struggled to learn a move-ment, the reward of finally nailing it was a lasting achievement. Even when just walking around the grocery store, shifting my weight as I leaned in to look at a product, I could feel the effects of all the dancing on my body. The abdomen- and hip-focused movements of the dance (the ones that cultures have used throughout centuries to aid in childbirth) made me appreciate the way I was built and the power in my movements. The physical strength, sense of achievement, and overall love for my body made me feel like the strongest version of myself, and I fell in love with belly dance even more. Western society praises the use of our minds more than our bodies. With so much emphasis on using the internet, we are able to sit down at a desk for hours and use only our minds to complete tasks or learn new information. But, in doing this we lose touch with our physical body, which is what happened to me. Belly dance serves as an outlet for me to build a mind-body connection, in which my thoughts and feelings can physically manifest into fluid movements that represent myself. Recently, I sat down with my dance teacher, Sheila May, to discuss her thoughts on why belly dance has the power to transform a person's relationship with her body. May, who started dancing at age 20, believes that it's never too late to start dancing. She says that belly dance is an avenue to accessing your natural bodily movements. \"Belly dance, if you boil it down, just equates to moving your body in its natural form. The amazing thing is that I see a lot of people, especially as we've progressed Raqs Sharqi, or in Westernized terms, \"belly dance,\" is a classical style of Egyptian dance utilizing complex movements of the torso, arms, and hips. It is widely known as a playful and sensual dance that celebrates the feminine form. Belly dance move-ments have been inspired by a long history of dances ranging from within Egypt to other cultures across Eurasia. Records of the dance are scarce. However, it is clear that certain postures and move- ments from the current style of Egyptian Raqs Sharqi derive from the dances of traveling nomadic people that eventually landed in Egypt. These traveling people made their living dancing as entertainers, and in each place they settled they as-similated to the culture and adapted new dance techniques to add to their own. Legends within the belly dance commu- nity allude to the dance's originally being a birthing ritual. Many of the movements associated with belly dance, such as pelvic movements and abdominal undulations, are physically intuitive across cultures, due to their natural stimulation of the abdo-men and uterus. Ancient cultures across the world used these movements in fertil-ity rites, and thus was born the legend of belly dance's originating as a birthing ritual. Yet, all genders and body types can reap the health benefits, which include core strengthening and toning of the arms and legs. Ever since I was young, I have had a fasci- nation with belly dancers. I lived in a small community in which a troupe of danc-ers would perform at local events. Every time I saw them perform I was captivated by their simultaneous sensuality and strength. On my own, I would look up videos of belly The Transformative Power of Raqs Sharqi The Transformative Power of Raqs Sharqi -- Belly Dancing with Sheila MayBelly Dancing with Sheila May Sheila, who started dancing at age 20, Sheila, who started dancing at age 20, believes that it's never too late to start dancing.believes that it's never too late to start dancing. ...all genders and body types can reap the health benefits, which include core strengthening and toning of the arms and legs.By Georgia Gintowt Photography by Edda Pacifico The dance not only physically changed my body, but it changed the way I felt about myself.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 10movement in a really long time, but just believe and have faith and let it happen. I think that whether any-body belly dances ever again after my classes, if they walk away just feeling a little bit more comfortable in their own skin and confident with the movement that their body does \u2014no matter what shape, no matter what age - then that's a win.\" Due to pandemic restrictions, Sheila May holds livestreaming virtual belly dance classes via Zoom on Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings. For more informa-tion about Sheila May and her classes, visit www.leilahdances.com.through life, forget how to move our body parts in their natural way. And so, there's something about what we get told \u2014'have good posture, sit up straight, don't let your belly hang out.' We learn to contract everything and not move and then we forget how to actually move. So for me, belly dance is a real awaken-ing of the mechanics of your muscles, and your joints, and your skeletal struc-ture, and being com-fortable with breaking down the barriers that our culture tells us.\" Many tradi- tional Western dances involve two partners moving across the floor in a controlled manner. May loves belly dance because you're not dependent on anyone else; it's all about moving within your own space. She strongly believes that everyone should try belly dance at least once, even if they never do it again. She said, \"I think when people feel in-timidated about taking a dance class or a belly dance class, it's because we all have this vision in our head of what dance is. Dance is moving around a room, executing steps, traveling around the space. Belly dance is so contained to just your own body and your own space that it's really different...\" When we discussed dance as a healing art form, something I've personally experi- enced, May stressed that dancing is a great way to learn to feel comfortable in your own skin while in the presence of others doing the same. She commented, \"To be vulnerable while in a room with people of different sizes and different ages can be scary, but if you can let that happen, it's such a huge relief. And to have it drilled into you that no matter what you do, it's okay. You can be vulnerable. No one's going to hurt you. Just be you.\" Awakening dormant movements through belly dance and learning to feel comfort- able dancing next to others made me feel confident, accomplished, and comfortable in my own skin. The movements felt natural, yet were still challenging to reawaken. Anyone who belly dances (or dances at all) knows about the art form's transforma-tive quality. May believes that more people should experience the self love that comes from dance, and she stressed, \"How you move your body is how you move your body. It might feel a little bit difficult at first because we haven't accessed that The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 11 It is widely known as a playful and sensual dance that It is widely known as a playful and sensual dance that celebrates the feminine form.celebrates the feminine form.

Erin Berger and the Bookend Candle Co. \"I have always loved reading, collecting books, and visiting libraries. There's nothing like immersing yourself in a good book,\" said Erin Berger, the woman behind Ypsilanti-based Bookend Candle Co. You and me both, friend! Originally from Garden City, Berger attended grad school at Eastern Michigan University, where she \"grew to love Ypsilanti, especially the (surprisingly affordable) old houses.\" The year following completing her master's degree in historic preservation, she bought her home in the Historic District. As for starting her own home-based candle business, she said, \"I remember attending DIYpsi in the summer of 2017 and thinking about how amazing the artists were and what in the world could I create to take part in the event. Later that year, I decided to start what would become Bookend Candle Co.\" Berger is a self-taught candlemaker. \"I learned through trial and error and many nights spent in deep dives on candle-making forums,\" she said. \"But the best part is that for every candle that doesn't make the cut, I still get to burn it myself.\" Deciding on a name was difficult, she said, \"until [she] looked around at [her] collection of candles interspersed throughout the shelves and stacks of books\" of her home. \"Most were functioning as impromptu bookends. And that was it; Bookend Candle Co. had a name.\" Her candles are 100% soy made without dyes or phthalates. \"I do my best to offer the highest quality product in terms of performance, safety, and sustainability,\" Berger explained. \"I have asthma myself and don't want to be breathing in harmful chemicals. I would never sell a product that is not up to my own standards, so I use as natural components as possible and buy from vendors I trust. Our tagline is 'realistically scented and ethically made,' and I take that to heart.\" Some of the scents in the Signature Collection are Breathe Easy (scent notes: camphor, eucalyptus, and mint), Rare Book Room (scent notes: cedarwood, leather, and vanilla), and Mountainside Cabin (scent notes: balsam, cedar, and wood-burning fireplace). There is also a Spring and Summer Collection with names like Spring Meadow, Kitchen Garden, and Seaside Cottage. If you are in a situation where you can't burn candles, there are also wax melts and reed diffusers. All of these names evoke in me a sense of comfort and relaxation. Berger shared that one thing that inspires her business is \"being able to provide people with a sense of comfort and happiness through scent.\" She went on to say, \"My goal is to transport you to a different place or time. Hearing one of my candles reminds someone of time spent as a child with a grandparent no longer with them makes it all worth it.\" For more information and a list of shops that carry Bookend Candle Co. products, visit www.bookendcandleco.com.

Lyanna Bennett and Mystic Creations Lyanna Bennett has moved around a lot in her life, but she is putting down roots in Ann Arbor. She told me, \"I fell in love with Ann Arbor after spending a lot of time here in my early 20s and finally decided to settle in one place.\" And her specialties certainly fit right in with our community. \"I first discovered mysticism when I was 12 years old,\" she shared with me. \"I was fascinated by the supernatural nature of it. Spells and potions and magickal beings were what drew me in, but it brought me to the concept of natural healing, herbalism, and spiritual guidance, which is what led me toward the path I am on today ... offering services to the community reading tarot, runes, and tea leaves, as well as offering advice on alternative healing methods.\" Bennett is mostly self-taught, but, she said, \"I did go to college to learn more about plants and the human body in order to know more about how natural medicine works.\" The drive to help people is what inspires her. \"I have always been drawn to serve others,\" she said. \"I was a home health aid for many years, I have Berger shared that one thing that inspires her business is \"being able to provide people with a sense of comfort and happiness through scent.\"Drew Hill and The Drewbie's Zoo \"I am all about fun,\" said Ann Arbor native Drew Hill. \"I try to find a little fun and whimsy in everything I do, and since starting Drewbie's Zoo, my goal has been to share that with others.\" Hill attended Pioneer High School then studied Costume Design at the University of Michigan. \"Since graduating college,\" he said, \"I've lived in Chicago and Los Angeles, but Ann Arbor keeps calling me back. It's such an amazing city to live in, and it's great to be close to my family.\" It was Hill's grandmother who taught him how to knit when he was ten years old. \"I became obsessed!\" he said. \"I knit on and off all the way through middle school and high school. When I was in my last year at Pioneer, I started a small club for knitting and yarn crafts, and it was at this time that I first picked up a crochet hook. I taught myself from a book and was amazed at the artistic freedom that crochet offers.\" When a good friend from high school and his wife were expecting their first child, Hill first tried his hand at amigurumi, the Japanese art of knitting or crocheting small stuffed animals and other anthropomorphic creatures, which make up the bulk of Drewbie's Zoo. Where did the name Drewbie's Zoo come from? \"It wasn't until I opened an Etsy shop that I realized I would need some sort of business name, which was surprisingly difficult,\" Hill said. \"I wanted it to have something to do with animals and to be a little whimsical. I toyed around with a lot of different ideas, but I settled on Drewbie's Zoo because it was the most fun to say out loud!\" Looking through Hill's Instagram, there is no denying his talent or the cuteness of his clever creations. Said Hill, \"Sometimes you just need something cute or punny or beautiful to make you smile, and providing that for others definitely makes me smile!\" Some of my personal favorites are the adorable little dragons, smiling tea cups and coffee mugs, the cast of the Lion King, and Luna from Sailor Moon (I grew up in the 90s). But, they all make me smile! And how inspiring for a young person to have a plush Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Rosie the Riveter? If you have an idea in mind, but don't see it in the shop, worry not because Hill takes special orders. He explained, \"One of the best parts about running a small business is that I can provide something completely unique, whether it's your favorite animal, character, or even a replica of your pet!\" For more information, visit drewbieszoo.etsy.com or instagram.com/ drewbieszoo.

This is not a view one might associate with the current times, but in a world where human connection feels lost, comes a Youtube video series that aims to fuel a new kind of connectedness. Nadim Azzam is many things: creator, producer, marketer, promoter, and host of Whip Jams, to name a few. But before that, or perhaps beyond that, Azzam is a musician. Azzam began performing music in high school, and today, is very involved in the Ann Arbor music scene. He collaborates with the Blind Pig, works with the Ann Arbor Northside Community Church, and is a songwriter for the Neutral Zone off Washington. But on Wednesdays, he'll roll up in his black Honda Civic, ready to pick up the latest and greatest talent of Ann Arbor/Ypsi. Azzam provides the whip. The artist provides the jam. And they're off, buzzing around the city, shooting the breeze while Azzam and crew collect live audio from whomever is accompanying him in his whip that day. \"Whip Jams is a curation across the music genre. It's all about spotlighting music and musicians in the area and giving them a platform to reach their current audiences with a little more detail,\" said Azzam. \"Just being able to bring awareness to our community of all the artists that are here in Ann Arbor/Ypsi, especially when we can't go see live shows and everything, is what Whip Jams is all about.\" The episodes in the first season of Whip Jams , out now, are bite-sized video interviews, all less than ten minutes in length. Short by design, to keep ever-lessening viewer attention spans sharp, but deep in content, so that anyone watching will take away some unknown facts and tidbits about the local music scene, Whip Jams is not quite like anything that has come before. Debuting in December of 2020, Whip Jams shot all of its episodes before the pandemic hit. While Covid-19 has put a stall on production, Azzam is working toward airing new episodes over the summer. Season one features interviews of Ann Arbor musicians Ki5, Mirror Monster, and Dani Darling; Flint's D. Vaughn the Illest; and Detroit-native Pariis Noel. Watching the show, one cannot help but compare Whip Jams to Carpool Karaoke, but Azzam insists they are far from similar. \"With Carpool Karaoke, it's sort of a late-night attraction, more for someone who is looking for comedy. They set it up almost as a gag bit, and it's really a circuit opportunity for artists who are already established. It's part of the press run up to put out an album.The truth is, the idea of Whip Jams developed before I knew what Carpool Karaoke was,\" said Azzam. \"I think it definitely existed by then, but we didn't know about it until we were well into production. But to me, the primary difference is that Whip Jams is really about music discovery. We want to spotlight artists who aren't already at the caliber of getting onto the late night shows. We want to provide them the opportunity to grow their audience.\" Azzam said the inception of the show came about in 2018, when he and a friend would drive around, bouncing the new music they were creating off one another. Since Azzam knew all about working in a creative, competitive field, and how important it was for musicians to get their music out there on as many outlets as possible, he wanted to craft a music interview experience that felt unique. To Azzam, this kind of informal setting of interviewing in a car felt like the most organic, honest way to get people to connect to new sounds. \"Especially for my generation, growing up as an American kid in the Midwest, so much of my social interactions came from me sitting in the car and having life talks with friends, or writing music. We thought the idea of keeping the show in an informal setting would allow for some of that natural conversation to progress, in a way that maybe a formal sitting in an interview doesn't accomplish. But it's also fun because, driving around, it keeps artists on their toes.\" Dani Darling, the central artist showcased in episode five, the finale of Whip Jams season one, agreed that interviewing in a car took away a lot of the traditional interview pressures and also made the interview more creative. \"When you're doing an interview, there's a lot that you're thinking about. The pressure's on, the cameras are rolling, you've got a lot of things running around in your mind. But here, the first thing I noticed was that no one's staring at you while you're trying to answer a question. I think that just makes it feel more natural and more casual,\" said Darling.

And we were local! I feel like that was one of my favorite parts of all the episodes\u2014seeing where people were getting picked up around town. I feel like it really gave insight into who they were. I'm really into theater stuff outside of music, so I thought it was fitting to get picked up at the Michigan Theater, for instance.\" Darling, whose soulful lo-fi musical style draws from deep black opera and reggae roots, thinks that Whip Jams is \"one of a kind.\" A bold video series with an interview style all its own, Darling believes that what Azzam and team have created is one of those shows that \"delves deeper into the artists' psyche,'' to create a product that viewers will be able to relate to their own lives. \"This show allows you to see different kinds of artists in different stages of artistry. You've got really seasoned pros like Pariis Noel, and you have music artists turned electronic fiends who are still figuring out their particular sound,\" Darling said. \"Everyone's just doing their thing and being individual and that's what's amazing about music, and that's what's amazing about humans. And that's why I think it's a cool concept to explore differences between people,\" said Darling. \"I think that people can relate to that, you know? Hearing people's stories in a setting like this, you get to uncover things that resonate with you in that artist. For people to be that open and honest about who they are and what they've gone through to get to this point, only inspires the same in other people.\" Azzam said that his interview style aims to dig a little deeper into what fuels artists to create. \"Obviously, we start by talking about the general stuff. We have to give the audience some simple background as to who this artist is. But then, I wanted to gather some fun facts and some interesting stuff. I care about going deep, I want to know about why this person makes music and who they are, what inspires them and how they got there,\" said Azzam. \"As a young artist myself, I'm always watching interviews with people I look up to, trying to glean some insight. Even just hearing the process of how an artist chooses their name and their thought process behind that, or what were the biggest Whip Jams is a curation across the music genre.

That's what I strive to pursue with Whip Jams . I'm really intent on featuring artists that make you feel something deeper than the surface level.\" Azzam stresses the importance of his creative team, who helped him get Whip Jams off the ground. \"We work with an amazing, talented crew. We have local videographers come in with all these tiny cameras, making sure we get the perfect shots while driving around. Elliott Sabbagh, our sound guy, captures the audio that you are hearing live, from the car. That's not something we dub over later. And that's a testament to the amazing people we have, who are all part of this production,\" said Azzam. \"It's really crazy. I'm really grateful and proud of the team that we have, that's to me, the most impressive thing about the whole experience. These really high-level professionals coming together to work on this scrappy little start-up project,\" Azzam said.

Said Azzam, \"if it's just the singer and let's say they have a beat, you know, like a rapper does. You can play the instrumental in the car and they can sing and rap over it. But, if you have, you know, like Ki5 uses a looper. Then, we're like okay.... we have to get one of those adapters to run power in the car so you can plug it in. We're running the laptop in the backseat, recording everything live, so it's a unique challenge. I think the next level, our next greatest challenge, is to record a live band, and figuring out all the logistics behind an idea like that.\" Check out the first season of Whip Jams on their Youtube channel, @WhipJams.For behind the scenes and more, check out @WhipJams across all social media platforms.

See article on page 28 Gateway Farm Photos by Joni StrickfadenThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 23 New Offerings by Established Businesses and Practitioners Ann Arbor Yoga teacher Christy DeBurton of The Yoga Room is now offering private Yoga sessions for Highly Sensitive People (HSPs). She explained that about 20% of the population can be considered highly sensitive, meaning they have a personality trait called Sensory Processing Sensitivity. This means they essentially have sensitive nervous systems, picking up on more things in their environment than others. \"HSPs tend to be deeply spiritual, creative, and caring,\" she said, \"but we can also get easily overstimulated and overwhelmed, and we need a lot more down-time than most people.\" She explained that self-care is a necessity for HSPs to help regulate their nervous systems, and that Yoga can be a great tool for self-care. She started offering these sessions during the pandemic over Zoom, but as the weather warms this spring and summer, she will be offering them in person in her beautiful backyard Yoga area. She said that HSPs often feel best in peaceful, quiet surroundings, alone, and/or in nature. Sessions are catered to the individual, are 30 to 75 minutes long depending on the client's fitness level, schedule, and budget, and DeBurton designs a personalized self-care routine for each person that might include yoga, meditation, and breath-work. She also offers some free resources for HSPs on her website. \"I am committed to using my own HSP 'superpowers' to help fellow sensitive souls thrive,\" she said. Of her own journey, DeBurton said she had known she was highly sensitive for some time, but a five-year period of her life with an abundance of stressful events had her looking to ramp up her self-care and find out more about HSP . She found an HSP therapist who advised her that she needed two hours of downtime daily. This surprised her, but she came to understand, as another HSP acquaintance told her \"an HSP doing nothing is an HSP doing something.\" HSPs need unstructured time, she said, to \"do whatever the heck we want,\" allowing them to \"recharge their batteries,\" and be \"low key and mellow.\" She explained that self-compassion is very important, and that a lot of HSPs find validation and comfort in the fact that 20% of the population shares this trait. She said that the most important part of this endeavor for her is to help HSPs feel supported, validated, and not alone.

The Yoga Room is located at 889 Honey Creek Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. After 25 years in business, Ann Arbor's Head to Toe Therapies closed at the end of 2020. Owners Rachel Egherman and Judy Ramsey are continuing their respective practices in new locations. Ramsey is now a full-time shamanic practitioner and animal communicator, offering interspecies counseling, teaching online classes in both areas, and addressing the spiritual aspects of healing for both animals and people. She said that while the Covid-19 pandemic played a role in closing, both she and Egherman had been \"going in a more spiritual direction\" for some time anyway. Recovery from Covid-19 shutdowns was difficult, said Ramsey, and the pair felt it was a good opportunity for each of them to pursue their other work in a bigger way. Ramsey has been practicing animal communication for 15 years, and shamanic work for people and animals for eight. She had been offering these services at the clinic, but with quarantine she started working more and more online. In addition to shamanic counseling and healing, she teaches shamanic practice with what she calls a \"very practical, grounded approach.\" One issue she specializes in is PTSD, which affects many people who have experienced trauma. She explained that one technique to help with this is called soul retrieval: a calling back of the part of the soul that leaves when trauma happens. Currently Ramsey works mostly remotely with people and animals, but this spring she will be working with some people in person, in an Amish \"tiny house\" she has installed in the orchard on the farm where she lives. She will also be able to work with people in their homes, as needed, as the pandemic eases. She said mos t of her animal work is done remotely since \"it's easier to access an animal's spirit,\" while people tend to have \"lots of layers of protection and doubt\" built up. Ramsey believes that with the world in its current state, with rampant fear and anxiety in so many people, shamanic practice can be a big help. It helps people \"move forward, bring out their own light, their own joy, and change the world with that; at least their corner of it.\" She called it a \"very optimistic practice,\" and emphasized that it is not in contrast to Christianity or any other religion. In fact, she said, it can only enhance one's connection to God / Spirit / Source and faith. Ramsey and Egherman will continue to collaborate on some projects and are planning to lead a retreat together in the fall. Judy Ramsey's website is JudyRamsey.net. She can be reached at ramsey.judy003@ yahoo.com. Rachel Egherman is now a full-time consultant and teacher of Heart Math to help people find their resilience and joy in life. Heart Math is a tool that has been around since the 1980s, she explained. It is an evidence-based \"toolbox of techniques for self-regulation\" including simple breathing techniques. She described it as \"a way of accessing our heart's wisdom in regulating the body.\" She started learning about Heart Math, she said, during the leadup to the 2016 election. She had been providing massage and bodywork for over 20 years, but she was seeing the worst pain, anxiety, and stress she had ever seen in her clients. She wanted to offer something more than bodywork to help people. \"You can do it anywhere,\" she said, even the grocery store. The techniques are simple but have a big effect. Egherman offers a weekly Zoom call at 12:30pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays on Heart Math, open to anyone. She asks for a $10 per week or $35 per month contribution, though she will not turn anyone away due to not being able to afford it. She started this in April and said she has a \"hardcore group of regulars\" along with occasional visitors and new people. She also provides private and group coaching, teaching via phone, skype, or whatever medium is convenient for the client. She offers \"heart centered therapy,\" which she said uses the body to \"track where emotions are and use that to heal.\" She considers herself a \"self-care junkie\" and is self-taught in a variety of additional modalities, intuitively choosing skills that may help any given individual. Her goal is to find what is going to work for a person and have it also be something she/he can easily adopt into one's routine. She doesn't want people to be dependent on her, but to learn how to help themselves. She said she loves working in collaboration with doctors and other practitioners as a part of a clients' healing team. Egherman does offer a free consultation to anyone who is considering working with her. More information on Heart Math can be found at heartmath.org. Rachel Egherman's website is at CelebratedHeart.com. She can be reached at 734.834.3223 or through her website. Touchstone Cohousing, located on the west side of Ann Arbor, recently added four new buildings, containing 12 new homes, to its community. Resident Mary Gillis explained that availability of homes in the cohousing community is rare, because once people move in, they tend to stay. Touchstone, she said, is built around \"intentional community.\" The complex has a playground, community gardens, and a common house containing a mailroom, laundry, kids' playroom, professional kitchen and dining room where the community can gather and share meals. Parking is located on the perimeter so that \"streets\" among the houses and shared areas are safe for pedestrians, pets, and children playing. During the pandemic, Gillis said, though they have had to cease meals and get-togethers inside the common house, they have stayed connected with bonfires, outdoor potlucks, zoom happy hour and games, and informal street fairs. Families with young children, retirees, and \"everyone in between\" live at Touchstone, which is one of three adjacent cohousing communities, and one of only 165 in the United States. Each resident contributes to the community in some way, whether by shoveling snow or mowing grass, cooking common meals, cleaning common areas, making repairs, helping with recycling and composting, serving on committees, even accounting, or event planning. Explained Gillis: \"Living in a close-knit community has been associated with greater resilience to hardship and illness, wider access to resources and support, and increased happiness.\" She was drawn here after living in Scio Township on acreage Continued on page 25The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 24 End-of-Life & CatsWellness Examinations Illness ExaminationsVaccination Guidance & Administration NOW OFFERING TELEMEDICINE/VIRTUAL APPOINTMENTS FOR BOTH HOLISTIC AND HOSPICE/PALLIATIVE CARE FOR CURRENT AND NEW PATIENTS!

Entering a new phase of her life as her children had grown up, she was looking for \"something different,\" and has been thrilled with the atmosphere at Touchstone, where she feels she can both benefit from and contribute to the community. She described it as \"very supportive of families,\" and also a \"great place to age in place.\" When she moved in, she said, the first event she attended was a potluck barbeque, and there she immediately made new friends and was invited to tea and to a book club. \"People living here are people-oriented and very willing to make friends,\" she said. At the time of this writing, about six homes remain for sale. Anyone interested in buying them can arrange a tour by contacting Robin Kahler at (734) 274-9110 or tours@ touchstonecohousing.org. Touchstone's website is at touchstonecohousing.org. The Community Connections Portal (CCP) is an online community gathering place launching this spring. It is a place for individuals and organizations to connect with one another to provide support in situations of crisis and change in a \"values-based, community-oriented way,\" explained organizer Callan Loo. He said he hopes that the CCP will \"revolutionize the way that people and organizations find help in times of major life changes and offer support when they're in a position to do something good for others.\" The portal is being designed and run by an all-volunteer team from the local area, and several from around the country and world. The intention is for the portal to focus first on the southeast Michigan and northern Ohio areas, where Loo and his team are currently the most connected. As it grows, Loo said he wants to expand first to \"liberal, progressive communities\" first, and eventually nationwide. He called it the \"un-Facebook,\" and wants it to \"redefine what civility means on social media.\" Each member and organization would sign a code of conduct on agreed-upon rules in order to be able to post. There will be different levels of privacy for members. So, for example, an individual experiencing addiction and homelessness might post that they are looking for support, but their name and contact information might be hidden except from organizations that are able to offer resources and assistance. The platform will be partly social media, and partly a way for organizations to find people who need their help, and for individuals to find help from those who can provide it. The Life Transition Zone part of the platform will have a number of categories where people can seek to receive or offer help. Topics like abuse and domestic violence, health crises, addiction, starting a new business, job or career changes, grieving, marriage, divorce, and other major life transitions are included. People can swap stories of their own experiences to support one another, and information about practical help can be shared. Loo said as much as possible he wants the portal to support \"real, authentic communications\" without the risk of nastiness that so often occurs on mainstream social media like bulling, shaming, doxing, etc. He said that he hopes everyone in the Ann Arbor area who is going through any kind of life change, or supports others with life changes, will become a member. More information is online at theintentionallivingcollective.org. Callan Loo can be reached by email at contact@the-ilc.org or by phone at 734.660.8622. On April 8, 2019, someone broke into the 19th century house that contained Grey Fox Floral, Tecumseh Coins, and Michigan Wares. They stole items from the coin shop and proceeded to burn the building to the ground, destroying everything inside. The crime remains unsolved. Grey Fox Floral had been in business in Tecumseh for 48 years. Owner, Jan Fox, said that the insurance company wanted her and her husband Gary to settle and not rebuild. They talked about it and decided they loved their businesses and were not ready to retire. They fought for the money they needed to rebuild and won. Rebuilding, of course, was not without delays. The businesses were temporarily moved to the old Eagles Club building which was conveniently across the street, though it was much smaller and didn't have much light inside. It took until October 2019 to demolish and clear out the ruined building. It was delayed because asbestos was found in some of the old windows, necessitating costly remediation. They were finally able to reopen in the new space in January of 2020, only to have to close due to the pandemic in March. The owners again adapted, offering curbside pickup and delivery only until it was deemed safe to reopen to in-person customers. Now, business is picking up again. Fox said that Grey Fox Floral took a major hit during the pandemic closures because much of their business came from weddings, funerals, and church occasions like Easter, none of which were happening, for the most part. The new building is bright and spacious, and laid out exactly as the owners wanted it. Fox said it's a shopping destination because visitors can shop at all three stores. Tecumseh coins grew out of Gray Fox's passion for collecting coins and he offers ancient through current dated coins, investment coins, and also buys and appraises coins. Michigan Wares houses items from 29 Michigan artists and includes items such as soaps, jewelry, walking sticks, pottery, blankets, d\u00e9cor, original local art, prints, cards and more. Fox said that even though the arson was devastating, in some ways the new building is even better, with a full basement instead of a Michigan cellar, a better layout, and central air conditioning, all of which make it easier and more pleasant to work in. The final step is finishing the 2 upper-level apartments, which Fox said would be ready to rent out in the spring. Grey Fox Floral, Tecumseh Coins and Michigan Wares are located at 116 South Evans Street, Tecumseh, MI 49286. More information is online at greyfoxfloral.com and michiganwares.com. The shops can be reached by phone at 517.423.3735. Local meditation coach and teacher Mridu Pasrija has offered classes and private coaching for some time, but in the wake of all the changes the pandemic has wrought she believes it is more important and helpful than ever for people to learn and practice meditation. She said she has definitely seen an uptick of people who are seeking help with their mental health using this tool. She said that everything in people's lives has been affected, like a rippling-out effect. School closures affect children and parents, working remotely or having to work in-person with new risks, finances are suffering for many people, and keeping one's health and family safe seems harder than ever. This affects people's perception of everything in their lives, and people are depressed, stressed, and anxious. Pasrija explained that meditation and mindfulness are tools that can help people feel more empowered to take care of their mental health, not just at this high-stress time, but throughout one's life to cope with change, as change is constant. To anyone thinking about learning to meditate, she said, benefits include helping with sleep, reducing stress, anxiety and overwhelm, and helping find balance and calm in a busy day. \"Dealing with people can throw you off mentally and emotionally,\" she said, and meditation and mindfulness can help people \"connect more to yourself and to self-love, and to lead happier more joyful lives.\" It doesn't have to be a big undertaking, for people who are worried that learning this new skill will be too much when they are already struggling with all they need to do. She breaks things down into \"bite-sized pieces,\" and said people can start with just a minute or two a day to focus on their breath. Mridu Pasrija's website is liveliferadiantly.com and has information about her classes and one-on-one coaching. She can be reached by email at mpasrija@liveliferadiantly.com or by phone at 248.470.5610.

The books are designed to \"help you receive guidance from your Divine Mind,\" she said. The four books are Discovery, Affirmations, Health, and Balance. Like most oracle card guidebooks, they list a meaning for each card one might draw in any kind of reading, but they are designed to be used with a standard deck of poker cards. Levin also recently published an online, on- demand class on the Udemy platform called \"Intuition Training, Manifesting, and the Body-Soul Bridge.\" The class covers: how to meditate, how to connect to one's intuition, and receive messages from one's \"Divine Mind,\" how to perform healings, and how to manifest one's desires through thought transformation. Levin has been teaching people how to connect to their intuition for over 20 years and offers individual and group coaching in-person and virtually. On June 6, she will offer a free one-hour online training to \"Strengthen Your Intuition\" at 12:00 p.m. She will lead a meditation and demonstrate how to use her oracle card guidebooks. More information on Monica Levin's books, classes, and coaching, including registration information for her course and training event, are at MonicaLevin.com. She can be reached by phone at 248.656.2505 or by email at monica@nonverbalscience.com. Adrian author Dori Durbin published her second children's book, Little Cat Feels Left Out , on March 2nd. It is a picture book for ages four through eight and continues with the characters of her first book, Little Cat Needs Space. In the book, Little Cat realizes that her best friend, Dog, has another friend and that maybe she is not Dog's best friend. This leads her to question herself and to ultimately learn how to deal with her friend having other friends. The struggle is common and relatable to children and Durbin hopes that the book will end up in the hands of teachers and social workers as well as children in order to help kids feel they are not alone in their experiences of figuring out friendship. Durbin herself has a master's degree in social work. Durbin wrote and illustrated the book. She described herself as semi-self-taught and said that she began realizing her dream to create children's books after taking an online course called Make Art That Sells taught by Lila Rogers. Durbin teaches youth art and participates occasionally in arts shows. She is also a certified personal trainer and fitness instructor. More information about Dori Durbin and her books is online at doridurbin.com. She can be reached via email at hello@doridurbin.com. In addition to everything else 2020 was, it was also the year that three members of the Harvey family in Ann Arbor became published authors. Husband and wife Bryon and Jennifer Harvey published their book, Operation: Thriving Marriage with Westbow Press in November. Their daughter, 15-year-old Brenda Harvey, published her debut young adult novel The Conspiracy in December. Bryon and Jennifer had been working on their book for about three years. Bryon is an ordained minister who has been working in churches for over 20 years, as well as a 1 st Sergeant in the Michigan Air National Guard, a role he said is \"100% about taking care of people.\" Jennifer is an attorney who practices and teaches in several areas of law and said that a big part of what she does involves helping people manage conflict. Both have worked with couples in marriage and pre-marriage counseling through the church. Bryon explained that they tended to see themes in marital conflict and wanted to write this book to help couples navigate them. One theme they write about is the concept of \"team marriage.\" Usually, said Bryon, when couples argue, they focus on being right or winning the argument. Being a team means that either both partners win, or both lose. This shift in thinking can help spouses look at a problem as a team against a problem rather than warring individuals. Another concept is what the Harveys call \"un-expectations,\" what they define as \"unmet, unvoiced, on unreasonable expectations.\" Successful couples need to be able to manage and talk about these \"un-expectations\" and convert them into clear and communicated expectations. Jennifer said that one chapter discusses gender roles. She emphasized that while many people think that the Bible insists on specific, \"traditional\" gender roles, the book of Ephesians basically says, \"Whatever role you're in, do it well, look out for your spouse and look out for your family.\" Whether those roles are conventional or unconventional, whatever works for the family is good as long as everyone is communicating, open to change, and doing whatever they can to \"honor God and move the family forward.\" During the publication process, Bryon was deployed on a six-month assignment in the Middle East, so Jennifer was at home managing their two children's schooling through pandemic changes, dealing with her own job, and working with the publisher. They were able to video chat every day, she said, and Bryon said that he was signing the book for colleagues as they ordered them online and their copies arrived before his did. Bryon returned home in January. Brenda has been writing as a hobby since the second grade. When the pandemic hit, she found she suddenly had more time on her hands, and she wanted to use it to create books for young adults that she would want to read. She said that most young adult books available are intensely focused on \"over-the-top\" violence and / or romance, and she felt authors focus on these themes because they believe that is what sells. Brenda contends that given options teens are just as varied in their tastes as adults. The Conspiracy is the first of a trilogy. It centers around Iris, a young woman who is kidnapped by the Order of Olympus, but then learns this group is actually fighting against another group, the Aesop Alliance, that is actively working to destroy the world. Iris, Jennifer said, is a strong, decisive woman who knows what she wants. She is a martial artist and trains warriors. Brenda earned her black belt in Tang Soo Do in early 2020 and this influence, said Jennifer, is clear in her writing. The Conspiracy is published through Amazon Kindle Direct and can be purchased as an e-book or a print copy. The second book in the trilogy will come out in late May. Operation: Thriving Marriage can be purchased wherever books are sold. The Harvey family can be reached via email at Bryon.d.harvey@gmail.com. New Classes Spiritual healer and teacher Eve Wilson is enrolling students for her next Healing & Ascension Certification Course, which will be the first she has offered in two years. She said she is \"really excited because each time I teach this, I get to update everything to where we are at in the ascension process on earth and how to teach things at the new level. In essence, it is always a new class.\" The course is approved by the United Church of the Master (UMC), an organization that offers certification and legal protection to spiritual healers. It is recognized throughout the United States and will soon be recognized in Canada. Currently, said Wilson, the class is about half full. She is seeking to fill it with eight to ten students in total and will start and schedule the class to begin when it is full, working with students to determine a convenient meeting time for all. It meets every other week for 14 months. Wilson has two class assistants, so each student gets a lot of individual attention, she said. Wilson has been teaching versions of this class since 1986 and has certified many healers in that time. She said she has developed a good process of intuitively determining who is meant to do this work and will make a quality healer.

Mary Emmett, who has owned Plymouth Orchards and Cider Mill since 1977, purchased the former driving range with a vision to create a community-oriented, organic farm. The land had sat unused for about four years, which made the process of USDA organic recognition straightforward since the rule is that pesticides cannot have been used on the land in at least three years. The farm offers a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) program, online orders, an honor system farm stand (purchase vegetables anytime day or night on the honor system), farmers markets, events, classes, and workshops. It partners with a variety of organizations including St. Joseph Health System, Grow Eastern Market, and others to get fresh organic produce to as many people in the community as possible. Zoe Arvantis, the farm's \"Community, Commerce & Culture Ambassador,\" said that it focuses on \"nutrient-dense, ecologically regenerative, diversified vegetable and permaculture farm[ing].\" It operates year-round using season-extending hoop houses, though classes and workshops are concentrated in April through October. One of the first events of the season will be the plant sale on May 8 th, in collaboration with other nearby farms, featuring garden transplants, native plants, spring flower bouquets, and more. On May 15 th the farm will offer a container gardening workshop, created with \"city dwellers, apartment renters, and low-maintenance gardeners in mind.\" Containers, soil, seedlings, and seeds are included with the class to get participants started. More classes and workshops on organic gardening, composting, permaculture design, and other topics will be scheduled throughout the season. Said Arvantis, \"We are on a mission to supply our community, and surrounding communities, with the highest quality, most nutrient dense produce we can offer.\" Some of her favorites include the farm's many varieties of tomatoes, and its hardy greens, kale and lettuce. She noted that though Michigan does not support the full New Practitioners and Businessesgrowing season of ginger, the farm is able to offer \"fresh, vibrant, young ginger.\" Produce orders are available through the end of December, she said. \"As a farmer, wintertime is a very introspective and reflective time for planning crops, buying seeds, and [for Gateway] to work on having robust offerings for the community for workshops and other events.\" She emphasized that \"we're really working to make this a community space. That has always been part of the vision, to make it an educational space. It is a farm, and we want to provide people with quality food, but we also want to help people learn how to get in touch with their environment and learn skills.\" Gateway Farm is located at 10540 Joy Road, Plymouth, MI 48198.

Transformational Intuitive Guide, Coach, and Energy Healer, Noel Kemeny, is now practicing out of her Plymouth office as well as virtually. Noel holds a Master's degree in Counseling Psychology. She explained that transitioning to a Coach, Guide, and Energy Healer allows her to engage with her clients in a more holistic process that involves a deep dive into the soul coupled with energy healing techniques. The heart of her work lies in working with each client to excavate and unpack all that they are not (limiting belie fs, core wounds, self -sabotage, self-betrayal) and then reconnecting them to their soul's authentic truth, gifts, and joy. She specializes in guiding her clients toward the discovery of their soul's medicine \u2014what she describes as their soul's wisdom and divine blueprint. She is a Reiki Master and explained that combining coaching with energy work is a very powerful way to help people integrate healing into all of their layers\u2014the mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual. Noel explained that this process is not for the faint of heart, and that her ideal clients are those who are committed to the deep inner work that is required. She states that \"The beautiful byproducts of this journey are stepping into alignment with your highest potential and creating a fulfilling life that you love as the next greatest version of yourself.\" She works with her clients to cultivate radical self-love, acceptance, and empowerment as well as teaching them how to go inward to their heart space and trust their intuition. She offers energy healing as part of the coaching process or as a stand alone service. She is an intuitive empath and often receives guidance from Spirit to help guide her clients. She said that \"sometimes loved ones who have passed come through to offer their love and support.\" Noel offers a free 30 minute consult to those who are interested in working with her. You can learn more about her and her offerings at noelkemeny.com and she can be reached at noelkemeny@yahoo.com. LC: How does acupuncture work? How does it help with pain or fertility issues? CE: Acupuncture takes people from [a state of] fight or flight to rest and digest. Often people find themselves stuck in a chronic [heightened] immune, allergic, or other hyper-alert state. People aren't satisfied with just dulling that and gaining weight or feeling groggy. For day to day, there's a gentler way to work with the nervous system. I see people's lives transformed. LC: Are there contraindications? CE: Herbs are one thing I'm extremely careful with. So many people are medicated for everything. I need to be careful with dosing and interactions. There are ways of stimulating the body with gentle heat or acupressure if someone is more sensitive. In other words, there are ways to treat the body using the principles of Chinese medicine using the meridians [without the herbs]. LC: How did you get into this line of work? What makes you love it? CE: I came to acupuncture as a patient. As a teenager I sustained a number of fairly serious injuries\u2014neck, back pain, migraines on a daily basis. My family doctor told me to toughen up because life was painful, and it would get worse. My best friend said, \"talk to my mom, who is studying acupuncture and Chinese medicine.\" LC: What do you wish people knew about acupuncture? CE: That you can combine acupuncture with other treatments to help before and after surgery, for example, or combine IVF hormones with acupuncture for better outcomes. LC: Are there situations where you alter the treatment? CE: Every treatment is customized for the patient. Cancer patients going through chemo are exhausted and fragile. I change how many needles I use, and how long they stay in the body. [A cancer patient's time with the needles] will be shorter than for a marathon runner. LC: How do you diagnose patients to determine what kind of treatment they need? CE: Observation is key. I use a pulse diagnosis: 18 primary positions and additional measurements taken at the left wrist (nine positions) and right wrist (nine positions). I'm feeling for specific things in the body. Also, we use the tongue for diagnosis: the shape, color, texture, cracks or coating. It sounds kind of silly, but with masks this year, I have patients take a tongue selfie with their phone and send it to me. I listen to people's voice intensity and watch how bright their eyes are. Some people's eyes are missing something versus someone whose eyes are shining. People with the same complaint can be three constitutionally different people. LC: What goes into determining the ideal number of sessions? CE: That depends on what people's goals are. For an acute injury: one to two visits. A chronic issue: 3-10 visits plus more for other issues. I'm not treating knee pain, for example. I'm looking at the person with issues that have manifested as knee pain. This sets acupuncture apart from allopathic medicine. Acupuncture is like changing the oil in your car. You don't do it once: it's about maintaining balance. That's what I wish people knew. People will sometimes say I tried acupuncture once and it didn't work. It's not a one-time fix and everything's done. People come in for one thing and end up as lifers, though that might be a repeat visit some years later, and not every week. LC: What can people do along with acupuncture to improve outcomes? CE: Diet and lifestyle changes. If people come in with pain but don't make other changes, the results aren't as long lasting. LC: Are there conditions you treat that might surprise people? CE: I treat almost anything health and wellness related: stress and anxiety as well as orthopedic pain and reproductive issues. That's part of what I love about the medicine. It's remarkable how supportive it can be. It also works with all ages. I'm not seeing as many seniors this year because of the pandemic, and that makes me sad. I check people's temperature before they come into my office . We have air filters and have been vigilant about cleaning, but people are understandably concerned. Still, this medicine is ideally suited to this time because it supports the immune system. LC: How can someone know if a particular acupuncturist is right for them? CE: It's important to contact a licensed, board-certified practitioner, because some people are [only] partially trained. Have a conversation with them about your goals, because not everybody treats every condition. You want a rapport and someone on the same team with you to treat your needs.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 29 Acupuncture. It's one of the least understood of the alternative medicine modalities, partly because many people are nervous of needles, and partly because Chinese medicine is a complex art. But, many people who try acupuncture swear by it. For this edition of Healers of Ann Arbor, I wondered if we could get to the bottom of what acupuncture is best for\u2014more specifically than, you know, everything, which is what people who love acupuncture will tell you. Dr. Cynthia Esseichick is a well-respected acupuncturist and Chinese medicine practitioner in Ann Arbor, who graciously allowed me to ask questions from a place of ignorance. As many alternative modalities as I've tried for chronic pain issues over the years, acupuncture was never on the list. I'm not sure why, other than no one ever could answer my questions ahead of time that I was able to ask Dr. Esseichick. I hope this saves you some time and trouble if you've been considering acupuncture for a health complaint. I wish you swift healing and peace. Laura Cowan: Okay so first up, what about the needles? Many people avoid acupuncture because of a fear of needles. Dr. Cynthia Esseichick: People often are intimidated by acupuncture, because they think \"needles\" and their only association is with large hypodermic needles. Acupuncture is super relaxing. Most patients fall asleep or feel super zoned out during treatment. You could fit 15 acupuncture needles in a hypodermic needle. Laura Cowan: Really! I think that might make a lot of people feel more comfortable about trying acupuncture.Dr. Cynthia Esseichick: Yes. Acupuncture needles are hair fine. We don't needle into veins or nerves. Laura Cowan: What is acupuncture best used for? Dr. Cynthia Esseichick: Acupuncture is ideally used as preventative medicine. It can be part of self-care to maintain health and wellness. Life being what it is, people get sick, injured, or experience stressful periods of time. Acupuncture is a wonderful support if you are stressed. It can be used pre- and post-surgery. It's supportive and palliative if you're given a serious diagnosis. Acupuncture can also be extraordinarily helpful for inflammation, because needles are inserted where large numbers of nerve bundles can tap in. The primary response is to calm the nervous system. LC: For what complaints do people most often come to your office? CE: Pain is one of the main things that draws people to acupuncture. Through receiving acupuncture, taking Chinese herbs, and trying cupping, people's pain can go away, and they have a new lease on life. Orthopedic issues are [also a ] common [complaint] I see, and also fertility challenges. Healers of Ann Arbor Acupuncture with Dr. Cynthia Esseichick By Laura K. Cowan You can try a new type of massage or read a chiropractor's online reviews, but how do you really know when a healing modality is right for you? Columnist Laura K. Cowan goes in depth with local healers to give you a behind-the-scenes look at what they really do to help people relax and heal. Many people who try acupuncture swear by it. Acupuncture needles are hair fine. Acupuncture takes people from [a state of] fight or flight to rest and digest.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 30 By Laurel Hogge This column is a look at a brave soul who took a leap of faith to open her own business. This is a business owner following her dreams and thriving despite the odds\u2014and Covid. Claire Broderick waited with the world, trying to grasp the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even though she wanted so badly for 2020 to be the year she would manifest her dream of opening a retail shop filled with her collection of what she calls \"uniquities,\" there was reason to pause. In the meantime, she kept dreaming, researching, and collecting. Adding a taxidermy octopus here, reaching out to a bone jeweler there. She knew how important it was to persist and keep planning. As a professional hair stylist for 14 years, Broderick built a solid clientele in a trendy Ann Arbor salon. She told me how much she loved it there, but added, \"I've always wanted to have a business local to Ypsilanti and Depot Town especially because it has been my neighborhood for over 14 years.\" If any community was willing to embrace a business called This That & the ODDer Things (emphasis on the ODD), it would be Depot Town.So, when I asked if there had been any lucky breaks that may have only happened because of Covid, she explained that a space in Depot Town opened up when Michigan closed down. The previous owner likely had to make the difficult decision to lock the doors when everyone was ordered to stay home. The space remained empty for months before Broderick took a look inside. What she saw was the perfect fit for her salon/store concept. Her creative wheels started turning and she could see the transformation\u2014the wood floors, the fresh paint, the new sign on the window\u2014that would house her vision. She could even imagine a bookshelf in the back of the store that would secretly lead to her salon. It was perfect. Broderick made the decision to move forward. She signed the lease and used her down time to renovate and set up the shop so it would be ready when people started venturing out more. To answer my question she adds, \"So in some respects the whole thing is lucky because of Covid. I don't know if it was the best time, but it was the right time for me to pull my pieces together and make the dream happen once and for all.\" As Michigan eased up restrictions on businesses, Covid loomed. We were also just beginning to realize the collective impact the pandemic was having on mental and emotional health. Having recently lost a number of close friends, family, and beloved pets, Broderick knew the importance of staying connected and keeping spirits up. Now that her shop and salon were in place, she needed to solve the issue of safety. One dear friend lost his life to the Covid virus, so she felt a particular responsibility to keep her customers safe. Broderick also felt it was important that people could relax and feel comfortable in the refuge she created for them. Her creativity again kicked in as she went about addressing the need for air circulation. She decided to convert her back patio into a place for outdoor professional hair care. By adding an enclosure with good air circulation, she could heat it to a cozy temperature in the winter. This, along with keeping masks on, made Broderick and her hair clients more comfortable. She adds that this temporary fix will likely be a permanent feature and that \"This was the best Covid related win, because I'm thrilled to work outside, and my people love it!\" Although she found a work-around for the salon, traffic in the retail side of her store was slow to pick up. Broderick found that \"with the deep winter season and Covid putting restaurants down for the count, we did not have a wildly successful holiday season. That was not a full surprise, but definitely one, nonetheless. Retail is supposed to make a huge percentage of sales during the holiday season.\" Broderick's passion for embracing the unconventional has led her to create a shop that entertains and charms those who wander through it.In the meantime, she kept dreaming, researching, and collecting. Adding a taxidermy octopus here, reaching out to a bone jeweler there. She knew how important it was to persist and keep planning.

The life experiences that broke her down were the same ones that make her a resilient and determined business owner. And she is encouraged by the immediate support of the Ypsilanti community, saying that \"On a positive note, the most unexpected thing was how welcoming and well received my store was. I am so grateful to all of those who connect with my store. The art, the humor, and the fun in there are all an extension of my home, my friends, and my demented mind. It's an extension of myself and I am so thrilled to have the support I have been shown ten-fold with its opening.\" When asked about her demographic, she responds \"I feel my main demographic is women from teens into their 60's. The store attracts people with an alternative style. They're lovers of the dark and macabre, but with a sense of humor about it. A lot of dudes love the store also and find it to be a great place for gifts.\" Not only is it a great place for gifts. It's a great place for exploring items you're not likely to see anywhere else. Broderick's passion for embracing the unconventional has led her to create a shop that entertains and charms those who wander through it. Her approach is to \"work all angles to find wonderful gifts and fun items for people to enjoy. I have a focus on emotional and practical use and aim to excite.\" It is exciting to shop at This That & the ODDer Things. Between interview questions I inspected the jarring expression on the stuffed chimpanzee in the front window, rifled through the top-selling assorted socks that are held in a genuine, made in Michigan, iron witch cauldron, and admired the jewelry display. I notice an aesthetically arranged group of vintage apothecary glasses next to a human skull named \"Lucy,\" and wonder to myself how on earth Broderick came to find not one, but two human skulls to include in her collection. I decided maybe I don't want to know. One thing I did learn is that Broderick has likeminded connections throughout the world who share her enthusiasm for the bizarre. Collaboration and a natural ability to find what she needs seem to be key. Every item has a back story and a human connection, and every display is well thought out to perfectly curate the eye candy that makes up this store. Lessons in Singing & Meditation Heal & Release obstructive patterns through the power of your own voice & embodied meditation meditation techniques Free online guided meditation and chanting sessions Private life coaching meditation meditation sessions I asked what keeps her going even with so many challenges. Her answer is no surprise. She tells me, \"It's just what I do. I am creative and motivated. I don't always do the hard work just for myself. I often will join forces and help build others around me. I want to make sure I can pay my employees, give support to my community, and share with the artists. I also have a way of life for myself I personally want to achieve.\" And as the world opens again to travel, Broderick will achieve her goal of traveling far and wide to add to her already diverse collection. She hopes that as people begin to get out more, they will discover that This That & the ODDer Things is a safe place to temporarily ease their worries about the pandemic and life in general. I noticed for myself that reality and time sort of disappeared when I was with Broderick, peeking into her eclectic inner world on display around me. And she has her demographic pegged, because I found the perfect gifts for my daughter's upcoming 15th birthday along with a beautiful cluster of crystals for myself. I was grateful to have something to bring the unique energy of this shop and its owner along with me.Setbacks are something Broderick knows how to deal with by now. The life experiences that broke her down were the same ones that make her a resilient and determined business owner. Reality and time sort of disappeared when I was with Broderick, peeking into her eclectic inner world on display around me.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 32 By Angela Madaras I first met Stefanie Stauffer, Manager for the Ann Arbor Farmers Market, while picking up food at Argus Farm Stop. I had seen her at local food events, but this was our first \"hello.\" I asked her if she was interested in talking about the virus and how the market has handled the challenges. Luckily, she agreed. We later had a Zoom meeting and began carving out slices of topics the public seemed curious to know. Both of us have similar backgrounds. We run small farms as well as have a vested interest in serving all people in our area with healthy, reasonably-priced food grown and produced in our own communities. Her smile and positive attitude eased my mind on the current state of affairs with the market and its vendors. The Ann Arbor Farmers Market shifted into a twice-a-week destination to purchase local food, plants, and arts and crafts. I have been a market enthusiast for many years starting in the mid-eighties when I began shopping and cooking for myself, friends, and family. Saturday morning rituals included a walk to the market with baskets and bags that I would fill with the freshest ingredients for a week of produce-packed indulgences. I feel very lucky to have the many local markets in our area from which to support our local food, plant, and art economy. I was concerned last spring that the markets would not be able to open with a pandemic in tow. The following interview eased my worries and helped me understand how it worked in 2020 and is continuing to thrive in 2021 and hopefully, well beyond. Angela Madaras: Stefanie how did you and your team, including Parks and Recreation and the market vendors, create a Covid-safe environment for the Ann Arbor Farmers Market in 2020? Stefanie Stauffer: We instituted changes like installing hand washing sinks, converting walkways into one-way traffic, closing our bathrooms to the public and putting up portable toilets instead, offering curbside pick-up for pre-orders, and creating a walk-up window for people to purchase credit card and SNAP/EBT tokens. We also instituted a mask mandate for vendors and customers and added more staff to help guide people through the new safety protocols. Angela Madaras: How long was the market closed? Did you have to open back up in stages? Stefanie Stauffer: The market was closed from when the Governor's order first came down in March until May nineteenth or so. We re-opened first as curbside only and re-opened for on-site shopping the end of May. Although we are an essential food service, we closed to be able to formulate a plan to re-open and stay open safely. It had a negative impact on some of our vendors that have early spring items like plants for sale, but we reimbursed vendors for their stall fees during the time we were closed to lessen the [financial] impact. Angela Madaras: I know you just started your job as market manager in June 2020. Were you in training or involved in some of the earlier conversations which started mid-March? It might help to explain what you were doing prior to running the market. Stefanie Stauffer: During the hiring process, I was involved somewhat in brainstorming strategies for re-opening. As part of the process, I had to give a presentation about what I would do to help re-open safely and remain open. I am also a vegetable farmer, so prior to the pandemic I had been navigating selling our products at the new online Ypsilanti Farmers Markets, as well as at Argus Farm Stop in Ann Arbor. I have over twelve years of experience in our local food system as a grower, producer, educator, advocate, consultant, activist, and mentor. I have been a vendor at the Ypsilanti Farmers Markets for ten years and for over three years I managed Tilian Farm Development Center, an incubator for beginning farmers that was located in Ann Arbor Township. I am a former member of the Greenbelt Advisory Commission, former board member of the Ypsilanti Food Co-op, and a current board member for Growing Hope. In 2013, I completed my PhD in Sociology at UCSB on the topic of local food movements in Michigan and California. Since 2015, I have taught the Sociology of Race and Ethnic Relations at Washtenaw Community College, with an emphasis on food sovereignty and environmental justice movements. I also have spoken widely on topics such as food justice, land preservation, zoning, land access, value-added food production, season extension technology, heirloom vegetable varieties, and seed saving. In 2014, I attended Slow Food's Terra Madre convergence in Torino, Italy as a delegate representing Michigan family farmers and producers. As an Italian-American with deep ancestral roots in farming, markets, and restaurants, that event was a special type of homecoming that strengthened my commitment to heirloom varieties and expanding access to culturally-appropriate food. Angela Madaras: Did you lose vendors due to Covid, in the sense they felt nervous? Did any vendors get Covid? If so did it affect the market? Did any staffers or volunteers get Covid? Stefanie Stauffer: We did not lose any vendors, although we had a few that Local Food, Safety Precautions, and Friendly Faces: How the Ann Arbor Farmers Market Survived (and Continues to Thrive) During the Year of Covid The Ann Arbor Farmers Market has shifted into a twice a week destination to purchase local food, plants, and arts and crafts. Although we are an essential food service, we closed to be able to formulate a plan to re-open and stay open safely. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 33 delayed their start due to concerns about the virus. No market staff got the virus, and we did not take on any volunteers this season due to our desire to reduce the amount of people our staff came into contact with. We had five instances of vendors or their staff being exposed to or testing positive for Covid. Three of those instances happened after the vendor had been at market last so there was no possibility for community spread, although those vendors did quarantine, or were already done for the season. The two others quarantined immediately and did not return to market until they received negative tests. We have been very fortunate to not be disrupted by the virus much other than the initial shutdown. Angela Madaras: I was very impressed with the sanitation stalls with running water, soap, hand sanitizers, gloves, and masks available for those who came without. Were you the only market with these tools or did others use the same tactics? Stefanie Stauffer: Those sinks were designed and built by the Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation department. The Michigan Farmers Market Association recommended that markets install hand sanitizing stations as part of their Covid safety plan, but they did not specify the type. Angela Madaras: Explain how the Parks and Recreation department help operate your market and do they cover other area markets? If not, who is responsible for the operation of all Washtenaw county farmers markets? Explain this system to our readers. Do you and the other managers meet regularly and share ideas? Do vendors have a say in the matters? Stefanie Stauffer: The Ann Arbor Farmers Market is a City of Ann Arbor park and I am an employee of the Parks and Recreation Department. We are the only market that the City of Ann Arbor operates. Each market in Washtenaw County is different. Some are run by non-profits, some are run by businesses, some are run by municipalities, and some are run by the vendors supported by community members. We try to meet regularly with other market managers from around the county. I can't speak to what the other markets offer, but our market has a Public Market Advisory Commission that meets monthly and is made up of vendor representatives and community members and all our meetings are open to the public. Angela Madaras: What has been the feedback from shoppers, vendors, and community members? Stefanie Stauffer: We have had overwhelmingly positive feedback from vendors, shoppers, and community members who continue to thank us for being open during the pandemic and that we remain open. Angela Madaras: What is your vision for the spring and summer farmers market? How many vendors do you see selling? Will they offer online sales and will you offer some type of no-contact pick up for those who are at risk? Is there a delivery option for home-bound folks? Stefanie Stauffer: We have 120 vendors on our full roster, and we anticipate having our usual number of vendors throughout the season. That means 75- 80 vendors per market on Saturday in the high season and 40-50 vendors per market on a Wednesday in the high season. Our winter market was strong with 25-30 vendors each Saturday. We also plan on continuing the curbside pick-up for pre-orders option for those requiring a no contact shopping experience. The market itself does not have the ability for delivery, but there may be some farms that can when people place their orders with them directly. Additionally, many of our vendors sell at Argus Farm Stop as well, and they are offering delivery options. Angela Madaras: Will the food truck nights make a comeback? And will there be a couple warm-prepared food items available from vendors? Will there be seating areas? Stefanie Stauffer: We hope to resume our Food Truck rallies this year, but it is too early at this point to make that decision. We currently have a few vendors offering warm-prepared foods, and have food trucks join us sometimes on regular market days. It is too early to make a decision about designated seating areas in the market, but there are picnic tables adjacent to our market. Angela Madaras: I know you do not have a crystal ball...but if you did, what would the Saturday and Wednesday markets look like if Covid seems somewhat under control? Stefanie Stauffer: For the foreseeable future, we are moving forward with our distancing and other safety measures in place. Angela Madaras: What are your personal goals for the market this spring and summer and into 2022? Stefanie Stauffer: My immediate goal is to keep the market open for a safe, outdoor shopping experience. My short-term goal is to expand the array of product offerings at market, including more plant-based items. My long-term goal is to recruit more farmers of color, women farmers, queer farmers, and farmers from other historically marginalized communities so our market can better reflect our broader community. It is also important to me to support as many black-owned businesses as possible. Well that about sums it up. No fears about finding the growers, makers, and talented hard-working folks who line the walkways of the market every week. You have the online ordering and pick up options if you find that best. Many farms offer online ordering with no contact pick up on market days. Some of them have delivery options as well. Either way, the Ann Arbor Farmers Market is open and waiting for you to partake! Market hours May through December are Saturday and Wednesday from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Winter market hours, January through April are Saturday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Visit a2gov.org/market for more information.We have had overwhelmingly positive feedback from vendors, shoppers, and community members who continue to thank us for being open during the pandemic and that we remain open. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 34 By Crysta Coburn Photography by Rachel Everheart Drip House Coffee Co. I think we can all agree that 2020 was a tough year to launch a new business, especially one in food service with limited indoor seating. But if my visit to Ann Arbor's new coffee shop Drip House is any indication, it is still possible to flourish. It was a chilly, albeit sunny, afternoon in January when my husband and I dropped by for a warm beverage and a snack. Drip House is located in the sweet spot between Michigan Stadium and Pioneer High School, conveniently on the way to several local destinations. With indoor seating still verboten for another couple of weeks, we had to take our food to-go or sit in the outdoor seating area, equipped with an open-sided tent and heat lamps. Because it wasn't crowded (yet), we chose to stick around and picked a table on the edge of the tent in the warm sunshine. There was a couple at a nearby table on their respective laptops, a typical coffee house activity in the before times. Yes, we were outside and all wearing masks, but I took this as a sign that some sense of normalcy was returning to Ann Arbor. In adition to fresh coffee, Drip House serves organic smoothies and tea. Neither my husband nor I actually bought a coffee! (Though it smelled amazing.) I opted for a delicious matcha latte, and he ordered the signature Military Drip, which consisted of matcha (powdered green tea), espresso, vanilla syrup, cocoa powder, and milk. I was honestly surprised that such a combination was indeed tasty. Bravo, Drip House! You clearly know your stuff. As for food, there are a number of vegan and gluten free options in addition to the conventional pastries you often find in cafes. I ordered gluten free avocado toast with lox. (The default bread is sourdough.) It was actually more food than I was expecting; two slices of bread rather than the single slice that I am used to from other establishments. And they did not skimp on the avocado or the lox! This was such a satisfying, healthy little meal. My husband enjoyed his chocolate croissant, too. Drip House also serves both sweet and savory crepes. I'm not currently working downtown, but I can absolutely see myself one day, in the future when more businesses have reopened, stopping by Drip House for some avocado toast and a latte on my way into town. I often make use of the park-and-ride across the street, and I imagine this being a perfect morning. I suspect Drip House will be popular with the kids at Pioneer, too, as well as football game attendees when they return. Drip House Coffee Co. is located at 1336 South Main Street in Ann Arbor. They are open Monday through Friday 6:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information, visit driphousecoffee.com or call (734) 800-4135. Bellflower restaurant Bellflower Restaurant opened in downtown Ypsilanti at the end of August in 2020. I learned of it from friends who took advantage of the patio dining to celebrate their wedding anniversary. When indoor dining was closed during Michigan's pause to curb pandemic numbers, and the weather turned chilly, Bellflower quickly innovated by offering complete dinners-to-go, an all-day sandwich menu, a wide selection of bottles of wine, and kits for you to make cocktails at home called cocktails-to-go. They also collaborated with nearby Go! Ice Cream to create a special dessert, Sticky Molasses Pudding with Tiger Tail ice cream. For Mardis Gras, they offered a New Orleans-themed feast-to-go (with or without wine) which included an entire King Cake (complete with \"baby\") for dessert. Tragically, I was not able to partake because the King Cake was not gluten free, and my husband is not a fan of seafood, so no crawfish etouffe\u00e9 or Hot Deviled Crab Dip for me. Instead, we took advantage of the sandwich menu. Since I did not see a gluten-free alternative to the house-made milk bread, I contacted Bellflower to see if I had options. I was told that any sandwich can be made as a rice Great TastesGreat Tastes inloCalfooD Drip House is located in the sweet spot between Michigan Stadium and Pioneer High School, conveniently on the way to several local destinations. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 35 bowl instead, however, many of the sandwiches do involve breaded ingredients, and the same fryer is used for both breaded and non-breaded items. The chicken boudin (a kind of sausage) was suggested as my best option as it spends the least amount of time in the fryer. I was very happy with this choice. The boudin was not spicy, as one might expect from a Louisiana sausage, but rather slightly sweet and packed with flavor. I think it was the best sausage I have ever eaten. The bath in the fryer gave it a lovely crispness that a grill alone cannot accomplish. The slices were arrayed in a circle around a bed of rice topped with shredded lettuce, thinly cut onion, pickle slices, and a few cuts of tomato. The flavors all went well together, as they would have on a sandwich, and I was left pleasantly full. Alongside the rice bowl was a bag of Great Lakes Parmesan Ranch potato chips and a glass of Malbec wine. My husband enjoyed his Fried Pork Collar Sandwich, noting that it was surprisingly tender. He wasn't so sure about the chocolate chunk rye cookie that he ordered for dessert, however, describing it as someone making a cookie out of pumpernickel bread. It was \"more scone than cookie\" in texture, which he admitted wasn't terrible, it just wasn't what he expected from a cookie. So, if you are a pumpernickel fan, you may not want to skip this unique dessert item. As of this writing, Bellflower plans to reopen table service in early March with a new spring menu. Bellflower is located at 209 Pearl Street in Ypsilanti. For more information, including current open hours, visit bellflowerypsi.com or call (734) 896-0599.

(The Jagged Fork is a small Michigan-based group of restaurants with four other Metro Detroit locations. Ann Arbor is the most recent.) I am delighted that they have weathered the storm. Not only is there an array of mouthwatering classic breakfast items like pancakes, French toast, and waffles, but each one has a gluten free option! I was able to enjoy delicious gluten-free pancakes with berry compote and cream cheese frosting on top. There are also sweet and savory crepes, five varieties of Eggs Benedict, endless combinations of omelets, skillets, and more. For lunch, you can choose between several different burgers, sandwiches, and salads. The sides are varied and include healthier options, such as fruit or avocado, and indulgent choices, like six different varieties of fries. (Those Animal Fries sound awfully familiar to this former California resident....) Jagged Fork serves Lavazza coffee, which is an old Italian brand at which my husband (a bit of a coffee snob) normally turns up his nose. But, he very much enjoyed the cappuccino he ordered from Jagged Fork, often exclaiming in befuddlement that he couldn't believe how good it was. I was also pleased with my caramel latte that paired excellently with pancakes. Because I am a big fan of corned beef hash, I also ordered it as a side just to try. It is a meat-heavy hash with a lot of good flavor. I ended up having it for lunch the next day with eggs because I wanted something to absorb some of that pungency. At the time we ordered, Jagged Fork was only offering delivery and pick-up, including curbside, which we found very convenient as we live outside of the delivery area. I had some tasks to do in downtown Ann Arbor, so we ordered ahead of time for a noon pick-up, and while I was finishing up my errand, my husband grabbed our food. He was surprised how quickly they brought it out after he called the number to let them know he was there. In the before times, when my mother would come to visit from West Michigan, we often went out for brunch together. After finishing eating with my husband, I wasted no time in telling my mother about this new place that she had to try. I look forward to safely dining out again and continuing this brunching tradition with my mom. In the meantime, I would definitely take advantage of Jagged Fork's curbside pickup again, and I've already spread the word to my friends. The Jagged Fork is located at 414 South Main Street in Ann Arbor. They are open Monday through Sunday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. For more information, visit www.thejaggedfork.com or email info@thejaggedfork.com. After finishing eating with my husband, I wasted no time in telling my mother about this new place that she had to try. The boudin was not spicy, as one might expect from a Louisiana sausage, but rather slightly sweet and packed with flavor. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 36 By Angela Madaras In the beginning of 2020, the world came to a crushing halt. With supply chains broken and store shelves empty, pandemic-fearing locals wanted to stock up on seeds to grow their own food in case they would be unable to import or truck food into our area. By chance, our area went into isolation mode in mid-March 2020, right when farms start planting seedlings in nurseries, the ground, and in hoop houses. All living organisms start from seed, whether a thought, inspiration, or a physical seed created from a plant to grow a new plant. The seed is where my interest starts for this interview with Ann Arbor Seed Company owner-farmer Eric Kampe. I have been buying their seeds for some years because I appreciated the open-pollinated, heirloom, and climate-appropriate vegetable varieties sold in local stores and online. The seeds come in clear plastic re-sealable bags, instead of paper envelopes, so one can see the amount, size, and quality of the product. What were once three businesses, Ann Arbor Seed Company, Green Things Farm, and the Land Loom, is now one: Green Things Farm Collective. They came together in 2020, as their website explains, \"to expand production, share the management of running a diverse farm business, and develop a model of sustainable, cooperative, and responsible farming.\" Small-scale regenerative farming is a business unlike any other in its bias toward diversity of product, consideration of ecological systems, personal touch, and community capital over efficiency, scalability, and profit at any cost. As a whole truly greater than the sum of its parts, Green Things Farm Collective and the community it serves stand to benefit greatly from the forty plus years of diverse farming experience among the Collective's working members, and the innovation and inspired vision only possible when a group of passionate farmers come together to share in the joys and challenges of their calling. Eric Kampe is one of the five farmers who operate individual agriculture businesses together as The Green Things Farm Collective on 100 acres of aged farmland. The soil is challenged as old school style large-scale farming practices over time leached the organic matter, leaving hard clay that does not hold water or nutrients. Because the Collective wanted to run a responsible, organic, and no till farm, they had to put their minds and bodies to work to find ways to feed the soil naturally, while at the same time producing healthy food and ornamentals from which seeds could be saved. The necessity was clear, but the way to make it happen was unclear. It took a year of hard work to get their business ready for online ordering (which most farmers were not doing until Covid-19) and increase CSA memberships, retail sales, and market sales. Kampe was already selling seeds online and in local retail shops. Thanks to his past work as a computer engineer that part was easy, but not as joy filled. However, these talents placed him at an advantage to most other small agriculture businesses. Kampe began his seed company in 2012 and joined his farmer friends in the collective known as Green Things Farm Collective in 2020. Kampe's main interest is soil health and saving the highest quality open-pollinated, organic seeds. He ensures the best quality seeds are saved for their farm and for the seed business sales. This is great for seed buyers who want to grow their own garden and save their own seeds. A home gardener can eventually save enough of their own seeds to become almost self sufficient in the garden arena. In the event one just wants to buy fresh produce, flowers, and beef from the collective, a share to fit their individual family needs with a variety of shares, prices, and amounts can be purchased, or they can purchase at the Ann Arbor Farmers Market and other retail venues in Ann Arbor like Argus and Agricole. The pre-paid CSA shares are picked up by the customers with no contact, making it as safe as possible. They follow all safety protocols and rules to protect the plants and people. I wanted to pick Kampe's brain because I had read and heard such great things about the farmers and this rare farm business model (rare for our area, but actually ancient and practiced all over the world). Angela Madaras: Eric what brought you back to Michigan and farming-seed saving after working as a computer engineer? Eric Kampe: I came from an outdoor loving family where I enjoyed completing daily tasks and working the soil with my hands and hand tools. There is satisfaction in eating a plant I started from a seed that we saved from the past year's crops. Angela Madaras: How did you connect with your other four partners? And why did you decide to combine efforts to purchase 100 acres to farm, especially considering the land would take many years to regenerate? Please explain how each business supports the other. Eric Kampe: I started by volunteering, and eventually working for, an organic farm in Colorado called Abbondanza, which is Italian for abundance. It was there I learned all about seed saving, which caught my heart. My wife Meredith Kahn, and I moved back \"home\" to Michigan and began our farm on a three quarter an acre rented plot with the goal of saving seeds in 2012. The act of farming is a full time, seven days a week, ten to fifteen hour a day, year-round job which could be simplified by sharing the tasks with others of the same mindset. So, a group of five of us met through farming events, beer meetings, and sharing meals. From there we decided to co-farm 100 acres with each of us focused on our best skills while supporting the whole. Angela Madaras: Explain your particular way or style of seed saving. Eric Kampe: All our plants are open pollinated, which means they are pollinated by wind, insects, and birds. We raise our own seeds from the plants we grow to sell as food or for ornamentals. Each year we hone-in on the best of each crop. We grow a small selection of mostly heirloom plants and sell enough varieties of seeds for Necessity Grows Innovative Necessity Grows Innovative Farming In Our Own BackyardFarming In Our Own Backyard All living organisms start from seed, whether a thought, inspiration, or a physical seed created from a plant to grow a new plant.

Enriching the soil with manure, compost, and mineral amendments allows us to create healthier soil, plants, animals, and seeds. Angela Madaras: The seed business began for you in 2012, then turned into the collective endeavor in 2020. Did you experience any up sides in your business with Covid-19 now that local food has become more popular due to fear of imports, and a stronger desire for many Arborites to support local food businesses? Has this shown up in higher sales? Eric Kampe: There are no upsides to Covid-19's destruction and loss of human lives, but it did push us to grow more, and our sales did hit an all time high in 2020. Our CSA memberships grew to 100 fall CSA members and market sales, smaller share sales, and boutique style on site farm sales. Angela Madaras: What is your plan for future growth or expansion? Or are you happy where things are currently? Eric Kampe: We want to grow our business, reach more locals, and improve our current collective. We are expanding vegetable fields. We can only grow as fast as we are able to feed and improve the soil. This takes a lot of work and time. We are mindful of how we treat our soil, as that is the base of all our activities in farming. We want to leave this place better than we found it. Ann Arbor Seeds and Green Things Farm Collective are laying groundwork for our community and contributing to the growth of our local food system in positive ways. If you are interested in growing food for your family, I encourage you to purchase seeds soon, as seed sales are higher than they have been. I love that our food centric, land-loving group of citizens are trying to clean up the planet and our own bodies, minds, and spirits, one seed and one person at a time.

By Peggy Alaniz Spring and summer happen to be my two favorite seasons. I enjoy spending time playing in the dirt. My herb and flower gardens are my happy places and I have been known to spend hours out in my garden rearranging plants to a better location and even mowing the lawn. Unfortunately, too much time in the sun results in a nice sunburn. I know of nothing more miserable in the summer than being burnt to a crisp. While sipping a nice, iced glass of sun tea doesn't help you cool down the sting, the wet tea bags will. Tea is not just for drinking. After brewing your sun tea, save those tea bags and use them on your sunburn. If you are into the loose-leaf tea (which is really the best) you can also make a cooling bath. Black, Green, and Chamomile tea are the most beneficial in helping to reduce the sting and inflammation. Green and black teas contain antioxidants, and their benefits go beyond drinking and digestion. The tea can be used topically to help reduce the inflammation of a burn. The antioxidants will help to support the natural healing process. Chamomile tea not only has a calming effect on the body when you ingest it but will help to calm the inflammation of a nasty burn. However, if you have an allergy to pollen, I wouldn't suggest using it since it can actually aggravate your already inflamed skin. In order to treat the burn, you can use your tea of choice and make a small bowl of tea. Once cooled, wet a washcloth with the tea then place it upon the affected area. You can also take a bath in the tea, but keep in mind that most tubs are porce-lain or fiberglass\u2014both are porous materials and, like your teeth, can stain easily. I also suggest using the tea bags that you made the tea bath with as a cold com- press upon the burnt area. Once the tea bags have been used allow them to cool. You can even place them in a bowl in the fridge, just remember to leave some of the water in the bag so that they stay moist. Some tea bags are compostable. If they are not, you can always cut them open and use the tea from inside. Loose leaf tea drinkers will be a step ahead because you just need to empty the infuser. So, what can you use all those loose tea leaves for? Remember the garden I mentioned at the beginning of the article? Guess what I fertilize it with? Since spring and summer tend to be iced tea season, here are my recommenda- tions for my fellow tea drinkers. First, hibiscus tea infused with a fruit flavor makes terrific, sweet tea. I am not a fan of sugar in my tea unless it happens to be hibiscus tea. The tart flavor of hibiscus pairs well with a sweetener such as sugar or honey. I would even go as far as suggesting that you use it to make ice cubes and add them to a glass of regular iced tea or lemonade. It will add a bit of summer flavor to your favorite drink. Second, make a simple syrup infusing it with hibiscus tea and then pair it with a tart fruit flavor like raspberry. To make a simple syrup use equal parts water and sugar. For a nice alternative to canned soda, take a quarter cup of the simple syrup, some of those tea ice cubes, a little bit of lime juice (about half of a fresh squeezed one) and some sparkling water. Good luck staying cool this summer and remember your tea is good for more than just a refreshing beverage! Peggy A.

For decades, it has been our family practice to pause and open our windows when we turn onto the dirt road that leads into the Friends Lake Cooperative Community. This is partly to inhale the smell of the pine trees near the entrance, and partly to feel the spirit of the place, and the immediate sense of refuge and relaxation it brings us. As we drive slowly down the lane, we pass the meadow on our right. The open field features a huge tree near one end, a fitting focal point for a ceremony or ritual. Just past that, the Michigan Friends Center appears on our left. We continue on, past the campground, down the winding slope, until we end up in the parking lot, at the end of the road. From here, we get out and walk between modest cabins, add our names to the sign-in sheet, and head into the open area bordered by a brick pizza oven, firepit, play structure, sauna, and a lakeside log cabin with boating equipment. Picnic tables dot the grassy area, and the children's beach, boats, and dock edge the lakeshore. If it's summer, we leave our things on a picnic table and head over to the adult swim area. Some of us swim the length of the lake and sun lazily on one of two rafts afterward. Others poke around in the shallows, riding \"noodles\" and bobbing with the water's movement. Ahhhhh! Friends Lake! We breathe deeply, and feel muscles relax and tension seep away. If kids are with us, some of us linger with them at the children's beach area. This small, shallow area has a sandbox on shore, and endlessly fascinating fish come right up to the children-it's hard to know which group stares harder at the other! Later, we eat what we brought and chat with other visitors to the lake, and when we head homeward again, it is with lighter hearts and spirits, and the sense of being refreshed and rejuvenated. Friends Lak e is actually the shorthand name for Friends Lake Cooperative Community (FLCC), set on the shore of Long Lake, a little northwest of Chelsea but still in Washtenaw County, and adjacent to Waterloo State Recreation Area land. Members feel very fortunate to have access to this natural resource and space without having to drive several hours \"up north.\" As its website explains, \"Friends Lake Cooperative Community is owned and operated cooperatively by its members. The name reflects its origin when a group of Quaker families bought 70 acres in 1961. Two years later they started this cooperative community, emphasizing simplicity, ecology, and caring. It was created for persons of every faith and color, a serene setting for harmony with nature where the joy of life is celebrated and where decision-making reflects a search for spirit-led action.\"Friends Lake Cooperative Community A Nature-Based and Spiritual Sanctuary By Ann Rosegrant Alvarez For decades, it has been our family practice to pause and open our windows when we turn onto the dirt road that leads into the Friends Lake Cooperative Community. This small, shallow area has a sandbox on shore, and endlessly fascinating fish come right up to the children-it's hard to know which group stares harder at the other! Photo by Susan AyerPhoto by Davy RothbartPhoto by Barbara BrodskyThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 39 The original Articles of Inc orporation, filed in March of 1963, were signed by eight people important in the Ann Arbor community and beyond: Robert Blood, Elise and Kenneth Boulding, Johan Eliot, Herman Eldon Hamm, Meeks, Peter Wenck, and Claudia Winder. Longtime Ann Arborites will recognize many of these names. Johan Eliot, for example, was medical director of Planned Parenthood in Ann Arbor, and a physician at the Ann Arbor Free People's Clinic. Like other founders, both Bouldings were devoted members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and both were prominent peace activists. In fact, Elise Boulding is sometimes referred to as the \"Matriarch of Peace and Conflict Studies.\" The Bouldings secured the property by making the initial purchase, with plans in place for repayment from the community. The plan included capitalization from the lease of cabin sites and homesites on the property; several cabins are still scattered along an interior road, owned and maintained by committed FLCC members. In the mid-80s, FLCC officially became a \"cooperative,\" a structure and language that aptly reflect the ways members interact with one another and FLCC. Mor e than 50 years after its beginning, FLCC retains the same values, with an emphasis on natural simplicity and community. Formerly leased homesites that dot the perimeter of the property are now owned by the homeowners, who have been stalwart stewards of FLCC over the years, and the now more than 70 contiguous acres encompass great biodiversity, including lakeshore, meadow, marsh, and forested areas. While the lake and the water are the main draw for many members, others are drawn to the camping, and there are plenty of options for those who focus on forest bathing. Unlik e a membership at a typical summer lake or swim club, the FLCC membership term includes access to the lake and land over the entire year and during all seasons\u2014a huge asset during these constrained pandemic times. In 2020, new and returning members combined added up to more than a 50% increase in membership numbers. This is likely due in large part to people's need for a place to be away from home, out in nature, and with clear Covid-related protocols, and no large crowds. Man y members view FLCC as an idyllic haven. Cassie Cammann, a longtime member and Friend, succinctly sums of the value of FLCC as, \"The opportunity to be in nature, in water, and in community.\" It is not for everyone, though. FLCC has no paid staff, and each member is expected to contribute four hours of labor to the community per year, or to pay in lieu of that work. Members participate on committees, do physical work to maintain and improve the property and facilities, plan programs, and staff the board. Decision-making is grounded in the Quaker approach of finding the \"sense of the meeting.\" Unlike at local public beaches, there is no large sandy beach for sunning, and the swimmer or wader is met with typical lake flora and fauna, including water lilies, fish, and turtles. There is no running water on the property except at the Michigan Friends Center, and buildings, including a few very basic outhouses, are the epitome of \"rustic.\" There is no smoking, no alcohol in community areas, and no loud music (or Zoom meetings!). While dogs are welcome at FLCC, leashes are required or encouraged, depending on time and place. The property has been designated a wildlife preserve, and there is no sport fishing, and no fishing at all from shore or docks. Children are encouraged to observe and learn about fishes, snails, turtles, birds, caterpillars, fireflies, and any other living creatures\u2014but not to handle or collect them. The focus is on maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect, within which everyone can enjoy peace and natural beauty. For some people, this all conjures up images of a heavenly retreat. The original vision of FLCC founding members included a lodge where people could meet for worship, recreation, or educational programs. This part of the vision was actualized when the Michigan Friends Center (MFC) was built near the entrance on FLCC land, following a 1992 agreement between FLCC and Green Pastures Quarterly Meeting. While MFC and FLCC are separate entities, they maintain a close and reciprocal relationship. MFC members and programs make use of FLCC land and facilities, and FLCC members attend programs at MFC, where many FLCC meetings\u2014including board meetings\u2014are also held. Their boards are separate, but many people have served on both, and have strong ties to each organization. The beautiful and peaceful space at MFC, enhanced by its natural setting, is used for conferences, retreats, meetings, and other gatherings. Past programs at FLCC and/or MFC have included potlucks and fire circles at the beach, mindfulness walks, discussion of poetry of nature and spirit, singalongs with local folksinger duo Gemini, and winter gatherings with sledding and skating on the frozen lake. During the las t Bird Walk and Count led by Juliet Berger, Natural Area Preservation Ornithologist and President of the Washtenaw Audubon Society, in June 2019, Berger and the group identified 45 species of birds in two hours including the Hooded Warbler, a State of Michigan Listed Species of Special Concern. Birds listed last year include Acadian Flycatcher, Wood Thrush, Barred Owl, Bald Eagle, Scarlet Tanager, and a pair of Pileated Woodpeckers! Early and late in the day, the lovely and strange calls of weirdly prehistoric-looking Sandhill Cranes float over the lake. Long time members Pam and Phil Hoffer are Friends who have enjoyed the beauty and peace of Friends Lake for decades with their daughters, and now their grandchildren. Hoffer shares the following: I grew up allowed to wander alone for hours in a vast wood in Dover, Massachusetts. It was a huge blessing. When I first came to Friends Lake, I saw a similar wood for our kids to feel safe in, to wander in, to know, to climb the same kind of white pines I did. And with swimming, to boot! Joining was a no-brainer. We have been members since 1979... sharing grunt work on property as well as committee work on membership, [and] organizational work as President and Secretary. Special pleasures: walking in these woods in all seasons, having learned to swim distances unafraid, and now the joy of grandkids having learned the forest paths so well they know where they are in every part. And still my favorite: shared grunt labor with others who love this place. I do think the shared sweat on work projects makes for the glue that binds us together and gets us through [difficult] ...times... Hoffer adds a quote from Albert Schweitzer that she feels captures the spirit of Friends Lake: \"By having a reverence for life, we enter into a spiritual relationship with the world. By practicing a reverence for life, we become good, deep, and alive.\" While there are definite commonalities and areas of overlap, different people have varied perceptions of FLCC, and different ways of expressing what most resonates with them. Richard Tucker, currently the Clerk of the Michigan Friends Center, Friends Lake Cooperative Community is owned and operated cooperatively by its members.

In our interview, Tucker focused on opportunities for environmental education. He described an extensive report done for a U-M Master's project on how a voluntary community manages its resources, which had two major dimensions: a detailed biological study of the resources, and consideration of how FLCC manages them. Tucker shared that what he most values about FLCC is the opportunity to experience \"collective solidarity and ways to relax together in a natural setting with great variety and fascinating history, where we can engage with the issues of environment and climate that challenge us.\" Tucker also referenced the contribution of Amanda Klain, a seasonal botanist for MNFI (Michigan Natural Features Inventory). Klain has worked professionally with the flora of Michigan since 2006 and did a plant inventory of FLCC during 2016-2018. She identified 253 species of trees, shrubs, vines, forbs (herbaceous plants), ferns, past FLCC boundaries. Barbara Brodsky is well-known to readers of the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal. Founder of Deep Spring Center, she is an author and meditation teacher who channels the sprit Aaron. She and her husband, Hal, have been members at FLCC since 1969, and their three children\u2014Mike, Davy, and Peter\u2014grew up spending summers at the lake, first camping, and later in their cabin. Interviewed for this article, Brodsky painted a beautiful word picture of the peaceful energy at the lake, and of sitting on the dock watching sunrise and sunset. She emphasized two central aspects of FLCC: the duality of the opportunities for both solitude and community, and the value of the four-season availability. \"I love the summer there, but the other seasons are also really beautiful and worth cherishing... [including] the exquisite beauty ... in the spring, when the first things are shooting up out of the ground, and the wildflowers are beginning to show, before the woods close in.\" Newcomers to FLCC are as enthusiastic as longtimers. Jake Osburn and his partner, Billy Kelley, who joined just last summer, say, \"We love it out there!\" Kelley is a postdoctoral student in chemical engineering at U-M, and Osburn directs the ProStart program for the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association Educational Foundation, teaching culinary and hospitality arts to students in high school and correction facilities.

They love biking to the lake to escape to nature, thankful that they \"stumbled upon this hidden gem,\" and have enjoyed feeling welcomed into the community, after \"craving that connectivity\" to nature and people. Osburn emphasizes that they really appreciated \"meeting like-minded people, where they could keep their distance and feel safe.\" Another ne wcomer is local activist and photographer Susie Ayer. Editor and publisher of the Washtenaw Jewish News for 27 years until her retirement, Ayer is no stranger to community process. Her three children graduated from Community High, and she is a founding member of Touchstone Cohousing. Part of what she appreciates most about FLCC is that \"Less than 30 minutes from home I can be at this amazing nature area with a beautiful lake to swim and boat in, and be able to hike, and be with other people who also enjoy that kind of beauty.\" She enjoys the multigenerational interaction, and the fact that facilities are cared for by the community, so that she \"doesn't have to be the one taking care of everything and can also give back to the community in a meaningful way that makes other people's lives easier in some ways.\" Ayer has found a natural home at FLCC, where she is a welcoming and anchoring presence on shore, on rafts, and in meetings. Friends Lak e Cooperative Community welcomes as members all who will support its principles and guidelines and contribute positively to the community. Most members now are not Quakers, although Quaker values are still critical to the FLCC perspective on land and community. Most current members live in the Chelsea or Ann Arbor areas, and range in age from newborns to those in their 90s. FLCC hopes that more people will be spirit-led to seek out this accessible beauty and peace, and to participate in this long-lasting and committed community. FLCC is open to members only, and you will need to make arrangements to visit as a prospective member. Interested?

K. Rosina Newton As the sun mov es higher in the sky, warming our bones and our soil, we might find ourselves more frequently drawn outside. We venture into our personal landscapes just outside the door, onto the trails of our neighborhood park, or even Nichols Arboretum, looking for more signs of life emerging from the earth. What is our personal connection with this green world outside? Some of us have started a spring vegetable garden, some of us hike or play regularly in the wild, and some of us might not know anything about plants\u2014we just know what looks beautiful to us or how good we feel after spending time outdoors. Having a yard\u2014our little corner of Earth\u2014is a great opportunity. What we do here reflects our creativity, as well as our understanding of nature. Our home's landscape is a microcosm of the huge subject we call the environment. Our choices here can have surprising effects on our own health and on our greater environment as well. Soon after graduating from Texas A&M University, with a horticulture degree under my belt, I mentioned to a fellow agriculture graduate that I wanted to use organic fertilizers. My friend said, \"That plant can't tell the difference between a nitrogen molecule that comes from an organic fertilizer and a nitrogen molecule that comes from a synthetic!\" At the time I didn't know enough to have a comeback; my alma mater didn't teach organic horticulture back then. Now, after 30 years \"in the field\" in Texas, New York, and now Michigan, I've learned there is so much more than meets the eye when we are talking about plants. John Muir wrote in My First Summer in the Sierra, \"When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.\" We know that \"life is all connected,\" but what does that truly mean? To try and answer that, let's start at the beginning: all of life on earth depends on plants. Plants are called producers because they can take the sun's light energy and\u2014through the miracle of photosynthesis\u2014turn it into food for themselves. Every living thing on earth depends on this primary food energy from plants. Remember the food web that we learned about in school? The plant is breakfast for a caterpillar; a bird eats the caterpillar; and a fox eats the bird. There is also a soil food web happening under our feet, too. In Teaming with Microbes, authors Jeff Lowenfels and Wayne Lewis say, \"A mere teaspoon of good garden soil ... contains a billion invisible bacteria, several yards of equally invisible fungal hyphae, several thousand protozoa, and a few dozen nematodes.\" In the wild\u2014whether in the Amazon rain forest or a temperate forest in Michigan\u2014a healthy ecosystem has its own sustainable system of fertility, pest, and disease control and maintenance. Leaves fall, animals and microbes defecate, and plants and animals die. The microorganisms living throughout the soil consume these ingredients in the process of decomposition, turning them into available fertility for the plants. The final product of decomposition is what we call organic matter. This, mixed with the broken-down native bedrock, is the recipe for soil. In other words, there is no need for a human being to go into the wild jungles with a bag of fertilizer and bug spray to maintain the plants. In native ecosystems around the world, there are connections between plants and microbial life that perform all the functions necessary to keep the vegetation going and to keep pests in check. Only in recent decades has science really begun to discover the true extent of these complex plant-microbe relationships. Some of these discoveries about plant-microbe relationships seem to be straight out of a science fiction story. In his 2015 book The Hidden Life of Trees, Peter Wohlleben echoes what Lowenfels says, \"There are more life forms in a handful of forest soil than there are people on the planet.\" H e goes on to say that if caterpillars begin eating the leaves of one tree in a healthy forest, the tree can respond several ways. It will pump distasteful and harmful tannins out to the leaves. It also releases a compound into the air that attracts predators to eat the caterpillars. Not only that, he reports that trees \"also warn each other using chemical signals sent through the fungal networks around their root tips. ... Surprisingly, news bulletins are sent via the roots not only by means of chemical compounds but also by means of electrical impulses that travel at the speed of a third of an inch per second. ... Once the latest news has been broadcast, all oaks in the area promptly pump tannins through their veins.\" Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi\u2014this is the name for the type of fungus that has this specific beneficial connection with plants. Eighty percent of all plants on earth are connected to AM fungi! In addition to helping trees communicate, they assist with everyday maintenance of plants. By penetrating inside the plant roots, these fungi are able to deliver more nutrients, minerals, and moisture than the plant can get for itself. In the most prevalent symbiotic relationship on earth, these fungi supply the materials plants need, and in return the plant gives the fungi sugars it produced through photosynthesis. Life Force: Discov ering Invisible Allies Outside Y our Door There is a soil food web happening under our feet, too. Microbes in our gut are \"involv ed in many other important processes besides just the act of digestion\u2014including your metabolism, body weight, and immune regulation, as well as your br ain functions and mood.\" \u2014Rachel Kanaan, cofounder of Unity Vibr ation Kombucha The Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 42The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 43 Right here in Ann Arbor, there are studies being done that are shedding more light on these incredible connections. On a chilly evening in February, I sat down at Black Diesel Coffee with Professor Mark Hunter to talk about the invisible world of plant-microbe connections. He is the Earl E. Werner Distinguished University Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan. In the late 1980s he worked with the original \"talking tree guy\" Professor Jack Schultz at Penn State who did some of the earliest studies on plant-to-plant communication. Professor Hunter has been at U-M for 14 years. He and his graduate students are revealing some magnificent discoveries. Professor Hunter says this \"trading partnership\" between plants and AM fungi is 460 million years old. \" Everything a plant does, whether it's communicating with other plants, communicating with insects, pollinators ... is influenced by mycorrhizal fungi.\" In a series of studies, he and two of his students, Nate Haan and Rachel Vannette, discovered that wildflower plantings across Ann Arbor failed wherever there was a lack of AM fungi. It is remarkable enough to notice that plants are able to better succeed when they are placed in a soil rich with their fungal allies. But the influence of these fungi goes even further. Professor Hunter and his student, Leiling Tao, discovered that when Monarch butterflies sipped on the nectar of milkweed plants that were grown in soil lacking AM fungi, they were more susceptible to a parasitic disease. If Monarchs were given milkweed grown in fungal-rich soil to dine on, they were more resistant. These discoveries are truly astonishing! Thinking about the implications of this in relation to our own health: are our vegetables and fruits grown in soil that is rich with AM fungi? I talked with David Saturn Klingenberger, the founder and Chief Fermenting Officer of The Brinery in Ann Arbor. He expressed it very clearly. \"There is a direct correlation between the microbes in the soil and the microbes in our gut . We are not separate from the soil\u2014we have coevolved with it. A healthy soil is directly related to a healthy human body.\" Let's explore this even further. There is a community of microbes living inside and outside our bodies that is analogous to the plant-soil-microbe system. In fact, we are more bacteria than we are human! Yes, the cells of bacteria, archaea, protozoans, and fungi living on and in our healthy human body outnumber our human cells. We have been learning only in the last decade or so how completely dependent we are on our human microbe allies. This is perhaps why our ancestors included fermented foods and beverages in their diet, and why authentic sauerkraut, kimchi, and kombucha have become so popular. Fermented foods are nature's probiotics and eating them helps to restore and maintain a healthy balance of beneficial microbes in our bodies. I asked Rachel Kanaan about this. She is cofounder and co-brewer, with her husband Tarek, of Unity Vibration Kombucha in Ypsilanti. She says these microbes in our gut are \"involved in many other important processes besides just the act of digestion\u2014including your metabolism, body weight, and immune regulation, as well as your brain functions and mood.\" We are learning that being \"too clean\"\u2014using antibacterial personal soaps and household cleaners, for example\u2014is not good for us. It is comparable to taking antibiotics too frequently or unnecessarily. We simply need to preserve and increase the beneficial microbes of our bodies in order to stay healthy. So, besides eating more fermented foods, how do we take all this information home, so that we can benefit from the microbial life that coevolved with us? I spoke to a number of local organic farmers, who were all very aware of the rich benefits of a living soil and were eager to share their methods with us. They have much in common, but one major choice is to avoid the synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and especially fungicides that would destroy the microbial life on plants and in soil. Richard Andres of Tantr\u00e9 Farm in Chelsea said, \" We make a concerted effort to keep as much root in the ground as possible, because it's where the fungi live.\" At home, when our vegetable gardening season is over, that means we can simply cut off the top of the dead plants rather than pulling them up or tilling.\" Ben Kasmenn, the Farm Manager at Gateway Farm in Plymouth reinforced this principle. \" First and foremost, we limit the amount of tillage we do in order to preserve the soil structure and integrity. We also rely on cover crops and compost to help feed the microbes and provide proper airflow, waterflow, and nutrient cycling. There are many other more specific techniques, all geared to preserving and growing a diverse, thriving, soil community. The microbes in the soil are the cornerstone to all life on this planet. Plants want to grow, and with a functioning microbiome in the soil they will grow without our help.\" Hannah Rose Weber, Farmer/Partner at Green Things Farm in Ann Arbor added, \"Enabling and encouraging the microbial life in our soil by moving toward more no-till practices that do not disturb soil life is one very impactful thing we can do to help microbes help us. A more diverse soil biome means that no one pest or disease can easily take over and infect our crops, allowing us to spend more time growing and harvesting food and less time reacting to problems. Feeding the soil by planting cover crops and amending with compost is our way of preventing issues before they happen.\" Richard Andres at Tantr\u00e9 also shared that they keep 75% of the farm in pasture, along with native woods and wetlands. Professor Hunter said that \"By far the best way to get native fungi into your soil is to grow native plants\" and to amend the soil by adding compost. Compost and other organic matter, such as a natural, undyed mulch, can be added on top of the soil without tilling. These materials not only add native fungi and other microbes, but they provide food and protection for the microbes, enlivening our soil.\" And how does this help our greater environment? First of all, whenever we plant natives we are restoring habitat for native pollinators, birds, and other beneficial creatures. Not only that, Dr. Elaine Ingham, world-renowned soil scientist and microbiologist shared the following recently with Sustainable Living Guide. As those fungi grow, they lay down massive amounts of carbon on the insides of the fungal tubes that they leave behind. And so when we get that fungal biomass growing in your soil, the way your healthy plants require, we can sequester up to\u2014so far, we're seeing\u201411 tons of carbon sequestered per acre per year. And that's just when we're measuring the biology in the top three or four feet of the soil. W ell, remember that that's not as far down as roots go. Roots will go down 15, 20, 30, 100, 150 feet. And so, we can be sequestering carbon all the way down. We could take all that elevated CO2 in the atmosphere and within just a few years, we could put it all back into the soil from whence it came. Now, as we move into spring and summer in Michigan, as life returns to our favorite places in nature, we realize we are seeing only part of this amazing story. Countless invisible colleagues living on plants and in the soil, along with beneficial insects and other allies, are protecting and promoting growth in plants wherever we go. When we are managing our vegetable gardens, lawns, or shrubs at home, we know our most productive choices will be to protect and contribute to this living system as best as we can, so our little corner of Earth can be solving some of the world's most pressing environmental problems. As stewards, we are teaming up with the life around us, supporting our community, and enjoying its bounty.

In the distant past or much more recently, we asked, what did you do, what inspired you, did it change you, inside or outside, big or little? Did you attend a new class, take an adventurous trip, go skydiving, stretch beyond a long entrenched boundary, start a new relationship or end an old one, take a leap, retire, join the Peace Corps, go on a night trek in the wilderness, or just do something way out of your ordinary? I have left my comfort zone many times. In my career in the non-profit world, I've worked in the arts presenting arena, at a world-class symphony, on a long-distance hiking trail, at an Irish dance school, and now a nature center merged with a children's science museum. Fairly widely diverging subjects, I know, and in different parts of the country. However, the time I keep coming back to is when I worked at the University Musical Society here in Ann Arbor in education, just out of school with a music performance degree, and spent my free time getting my \"sea legs\" as a fairly new hiker and camper. I loved the outdoors and was learning to explore and become comfortable as an outdoors person. I t ook a risk and signed up with the American Hiking Society to help build trails in the Gila National Forest in New Mexico. I'd never been to New Mexico, never built a trail, and didn't know anyone on the trip. I definitely had friends and family who didn't understand and thought I was a little crazy, and others who thought it was fantastic. The trip was amazing. I was pushed physically beyond my comfort zone, swinging a Pulaski and pick Mattock, working with total strangers with a crosscut saw, and seeing a part of our country that was new to me. We dug and used pit toilets in the ground, made communal dinners, and in a matter of days created community deep in the Gila wilderness. One da y we hiked, and I saw my first herd of elk and heard them bugle. I had no idea the incredible diversity of wildlife, plant life, and terrain that I would see. We climbed up a fire lookout tower and talked about the management of the land, and how we impact that land in both positive and negative ways.The experience transformed me in direct and indirect ways for certain. I felt more confident taking risks; it led me to move out of Ann Arbor to Chicago to see what it felt like to live in a big city and spread my wings. I felt more confident, after meeting my future husband, to up and move to the mountains of Colorado with him without either of us having jobs and trusting that it would work out. Over and over, I have taken risks, big and small, and knew I was strong enough to handle it if it didn't work out -which it hasn't, always. This e xperience also solidified my love for the outdoors. When I first met my husband, we went camping over Thanksgiving in the Ozarks after knowing each other for only two months. We quickly took to backpacking together, and now that we have children, we enjoy taking them camping and exploring. This love for the outdoors connected me to an amazing group of people in Colorado as we worked to build the Continental Divide Trail (a passionate group still working on this goal, to complete the trail: c ontinentaldividetrail.org), and brought me to the amazing place I work today, the Leslie Science & Nature Center. I honestly don't know if I would have made my way to LSNC, if I hadn't made this life-long journey. It started when I was little and visited Ricketts Glen State Park with my grandmother and family, built as I started camping and hiking, and then became a critical part of me as I stepped out of my comfort zone and onto the trail with a Pulaski in hand.susan westHoff: finDing a new level of Co Mfort outDoors i took a risk an D signe D up wit H t H e aM eri C an Hiking s o C iety to H elp B uil D trails in t H e g ila n ational f orest in n ew Mexi C o. we Dug an D useD pit toilets in t H e groun D , M a D e C o MM unal D inners, an D in a M atter of D ays C reate D C o MM unity D eep in t H e g ila wil D erness. i HaD no iDea tHe inCreDiBle D iversity of wil D life, plant life, an D terrain t H at i woul D see. Susan Westhoff is the Executive Director of the Leslie Science and Nature Center and the Chief Operating Officer of the Ann Arbor Hands On Museum.This life is an opportunity. Comfort zones can be traps that thwart our hearts' longings. Seeking truth has led me through a degree in Philosophy and Comparative Religion, but it had increasingly become unbearable to academically study the ineffable Divine. I began the long journey of deconstructing the \"intellect's monarchy,\" by breathing correctly, and listening to Bitches Brew on scratchy vinyl. I had been long haunted by a strong aversion toward the pseudo-comfort of complacency. Humans, and our society of status quos, appeared to be like an odd Twilight Zone episode. So, I took a one-way ticket to India, leaving everything behind, with no plan other than to understand. I had a r ecommendation letter in hand to join a monastery, but it turns out a \"holy life\" fantasy can be a \"drugs-sex-rock-n-roll\" parallel pursuit, just harder work without all the laughs, and a private passing of gas rather than public. Despit e myself, I somehow snuck into the presence of wise teachers, and along with a variety of retreats and esoteric practices, like shoveling manure in 115 degrees, my lofty conceptions of being spiritual were shown to be nothing more than an old, empty beer can in the ditch. The ten-cent refund not being worth the energy it would take to retrieve it. La ter, I found myself in a refugee camp in Islamabad, near death, being cared for by Iraqi, Iranian, Kurdish, and Egyptian refugees. When an exuberant retired lounge singer on a dark and quiet village street asked me for my wisdom and truth, all I could honestly muster up was, \"I'm alive, and it's now.\" Reference points, delusions, ideas of being and identity had been dissolved down to basically nothing. This was quite discombobulating. There was no peer pressure\u2014no one to care or not to care, but there was no clarity about which was right either. I ate a lot of chywanprash (a cooked mixture of sugar, honey, ghee, gooseberry jam, sesame oil, berries and various herbs and spices prepared per instructions suggested in Ayurvedic texts) and had no important thoughts while wandering and observing. Later, another one-way train ticket dumped me into the Sonoran desert, and I wound up disappearing down a rattlesnake hole into an experimental eco-village/intentional community for a decade. It was extremely rigorous and demanded discomfort, devoting my life to be of service full-time, without one day off in a year. It was a real boot-camp grind of suffering and striving to be someone important. There were regular seven-course home-cooked meals in the nonsense-sauce inherent in living intimately with 100 people. Fortunately, three jewels burned a hole in my pocket, as if it was the inner compass of an guiding albatross. The experience of living in this eco- village unfolded as a most valuable training in the reality and non-reality of our human condition. How much BS can a person put up with, and still come out of it stronger? As s trange as it may seem, it's actually a blessing to forget who we are for periods of time. Otherwise, the persona competition may take all the oxygen and we solidify as opposed to fluidify. Thr ough dreams I recognized that the clamoring for comfort is a normal tendency in this abnormal realm, that obtaining golden coins is for video game avatars not a natural woman; that true relaxation wasn't a station on the corner, but a result of dropping false pressures and accepting reality as it is; that the pursuit of healing oneself is a rabbit dragging a carrot-stick sniffing a tortoise butt; that the endless search for one's own perfect zone is just that. Getting nice and settled in while Vesuvius blows is a Type One Error in Permaculture. Every time I catch myself getting too comfortable, a shudder occurs and down the check list I go: is it catnip\u2014am i a cat? Is it a chocolate-mocha cookie laced with apathy? Am I the grand marshal of my own velvet parade of a new-age relativity porno? Fool me once, I'll be fooled again\u2014I'm a fool, haha ho! If it's true that beings are processes not nouns, then learning to write in poetic code is a good skill to have; if it is possible to regroove our neural networks, then is not one a funky hipster if they're getting down to the same old dusty tunes? And when your blind date whispers across the table their middle name is \"D\u00e9tournement\" and winks, don't think about it or pontificate about Dead Time... just be courageous.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 46 We are in our homes, and our yards (yay Spring!), more than ever. What can we do in and around our homes to be healthier and care for our environment more? There's a lot of easy things that can make a big difference. Let's start with our indoor air. Inside The air inside our homes tends to be 2\u00bd times more polluted than the air immediately outside, according to the U.S. EPA. As homes have become more energy efficient (a good thing!), they also have less air exchange (not so good for healthy indoor air). Less fresh air comes in through the cracks and less polluted indoor air seeps out. The easiest thing we can do is open windows. Other things to consider... Disinfecting vs. Cleaning Healthy households don't need to disinfect every surface. Simple cleaning will do. The Covid-19 virus breaks down easily with soap due to its fatty cell wall. If you need to disinfect due to an exposed or immune-compromised person in the home, avoid disinfectants with \"quats\" or quaternary ammonium compounds. The California Department of Public Health has specified avoiding products that contain quats in schools due to their asthma-causing effects. For disinfecting at home, use 70% isopropyl alcohol or 3% hydrogen peroxide or look for products with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, such as: Pur ell Multi Surface Disinfectant L ysol Hydrogen Peroxide Multi-Purpose Cleaner LeadTest for lead at home. Fewer children are getting tested for lead since the pandemic, and yet, children are spending more time at home, where they may be exposed. Lead can be in household dust if a house was built before 1978. Test painted surfaces for lead with lead test strips, such as 3M Lead Check, available at hardware stores. Window and door frames and staircases get more wear and are more likely to have old paint exposed. Cleaning these areas with a wet cloth or wet mop minimizes lead exposure through household dust. For more on preventing lead exposures in the home visit ecocenter.org/ending-childhood-lead-poisoning. Air filters While our windows are closed, the air inside our homes circulates through the filter of the HVAC system or the furnace. Setting the fan to the \"on\" position on the thermostat will keep the fan running even if the heat or air conditioning is not on, thus keeping the air circulating, according to the U.S. CDC. The agency also suggests using pleated furnace filters and changing them every three months. A clean, effective filter means cleaner air in the house. The CDC suggests considering a portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaner if you don't have an HVAC system or just want extra filtration. Select a HEPA cleaner with a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) that is the same or greater than the square footage of the room. \"The larger the CADR,\" says the CDC, \"the faster it will clean the air.\" Additionally, exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathroom keep air flowing and may be useful if guests visit during the pandemic. Home Projects In the past year many of us have started home improvement projects. Remember to follow U.S. EPA best practices to keep your indoor air healthy during renovations. Among other suggestions, they advise misting surfaces with water before sanding or scraping to prevent dust and also using plastic sheets or tarps to cover surfaces and closing off work areas to contain dust. Good ventilation (fans and open windows!) is also key to keeping work zones safe. Dryer Sheets Household clothes dryers vent to the outside. You may not smell the perfumed dryer sheets in your own home, but the chemicals in dryer sheets are released into neighbors' yards and can pollute outdoor air. A 2011 study found more than 25 volatile organic compounds emitted from dryer vents, seven of which are classified as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and two as carcinogenic HAPs. If a dryer is not properly vented to the outside of the home, that chemical-laden exhaust will pollute your indoor air. Be a good neighbor and forego dryer sheets. Instead, you can cut static cling by adding wool dryer balls or a cloth with vinegar on it (Learn how to make your own dryer balls in Issue #73 of the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal in our Handcrafting Column). Or pull out and line dry clothes made of certain materials that cause static electricity, such as polyester, nylon, or rayon. Better yet, save energy and line dry all your loads. The washer and dryer use 13% of the household's energy, third in line behind heating and cooling (47%) and the water heater (14%) according to Connect4Climate. Line drying clothes is a good excuse to be outside and enjoy the warmer weather. Of course, clothes can be line dried in the house as well. Outside In our yards, the best and easiest way to keep our family healthy and protect the planet is to avoid pesticides. Pesticides are linked to a wide array of negative health effects, including neurotoxic effects, reproductive harm, and cancer. Children and pets are most vulnerable since they are closer to the ground (and even roll on the ground), have frequent hand (paw) to mouth activity, are smaller in size, and\u2014for children\u2014have developing immune systems. Avoiding synthetic pesticides may require rethinking what defines a beautiful lawn and garden. Are dandelions the scourge of the lawn or could they be considered lovely little flowers? These bits of yellow dotting our lawns are, in fact, a most welcome site to pollinators (and children!) who have endured the barren, winter months. Dandelions offer hungry bees their first source of nectar each spring, sustaining our pollinators until the abundance of the season blooms in full. (And have you ever met a more joyous small child than one picking dandelion flowers, making dandelion chains, or blowing their white fluffy seeds?) Anyone with a yard can contribute to helping monarchs, bees, and other pollinators. Embrace pollen and nectar-rich flowers like dandelions, clover, goldenrod, and aster that volunteer in your yard, and don't poison your visitor with lawn and garden pesticides. Avoiding pesticides will create a healthy place for children and pets to play as well. Tips for a beautiful lawn: 1. Fertilize naturally with compost, organic fertilizer, and even mulched lawn clippings. Synthetic fertilizers kill beneficial organisms in the soil and make plants more vulnerable to disease and pests. 2. Treat grubs naturally with beneficial nematodes or milky spore; not Merit \u00ae or other products that contain neonicotinoids. Neonicotinoids are a class of pesticides particularly lethal to bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects. May, June, September, and October are the best times to apply grub treatments. 3. Avoid weed and feed products\u2014they are pesticides! Most contain 2,4-D, a dangerous herbicide linked to cancer in humans and canine lymphoma. Corn gluten meal is a natural weed and feed. It feeds the soil with nitrogen and prevents seed germination. Other tips: mow high (raise blade to 3+ inches), overseed bare patches in lawn with grass seed (don't use in combination with corn gluten meal), and aerate the soil in spring and fall. 4. Plant native perennials, shrubs, and trees to attract pollinators, and beneficial pest-eating insects and birds. One local source for native plants is The Native Plant Nursery at the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market. Melissa Cooper Sargent is an Environmental Health Advocate and works at the Ecology Center.

Its informal motto is \"solidarity, not charity,\" and Susan says she didn't really completely understand that concept until she had been participating for months. Now she financially supports two families who otherwise would be homeless. \"I'm not just giving people money to help them\u2014I'm learning from them and growing. I've always considered myself an activist, but after doing this a while, I've learned way more about structural inequality and poverty. I knew there was poverty in Washtenaw County\u2014I read the reports. But that's very abstract compared to reading real people's stories on Facebook. Now I really understand how privileged I am.\" At one point it dawned on Susan that she was essentially profiting off the pandemic while others were experiencing extreme stress from illness, lost jobs, and strained relationships. \"I am lucky to be part of a family that has a pension and a stock portfolio that is worth way more than it was a year ago,\" said Susan. \"I have a job that I can easily do from home, and my husband and I share childcare, which saves us a lot of money. I no longer have to commute to Detroit, which saves on gas and wear and tear on the car. And I received the same stimulus check that everyone else did, and the same childcare benefit. At one point I calculated that I saved about eight or nine thousand dollars since last spring, so it's not really a sacrifice for me to pass on that savings to others who really need it.\" One of the central concepts of the movement is that we can't wait for our elected officials to change society\u2014we have to make the changes ourselves, and we have to start now. We also have to transform ourselves and the way we see ourselves to do that. The false storyline that all poor people bring their troubles on themselves through their actions is one of the first things that has to go. As one woman posted on the site: \"My daughters don't deserve this, but I've been doing the best I can.\" If you go to the site, you'll find many examples of how the concepts of \"giving\" and \"receiving\" are really two sides of the same coin. The following notice appeared on the site in late February: \"Where can a local restaurant donate 60qts (sic.) of butternut squash soup ASAP? It was made on Thursday and should be consumed soon.\" (The soup had a taker within minutes.) Obviously in a community where more and more people are falling into poverty every day, it would feel awful to let sixty quarts of delicious soup to go to waste. So, the gift of the soup benefits the \"giver\" as much as the \"receiver.\" The practice of \"mutual aid\" is not new\u2014it has a long history going back hundreds of years, usually organized by churches. What is new is that, through a modern technology like FB, communication and connection is made possible between people who in the past have been separated by race, class, and ethnicity. It may even come to pass that, when we look back at this moment in our collective history, we'll discover that our society met the challenges of the pandemic and was able to transform itself due in large part to the power of people just telling their life stories to others who felt honored to be entrusted with them. By Madeline Strong Diehl It's likely that most Americans will remember the year 2020 as one of the worst in their lifetimes. But if we take a step back, we might find that the year also brought many inspiring reminders of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome adversity and lend comfort to strangers. Italy was the first European country to suffer from a major outbreak of Covid-19 last spring, and we were stirred by images of Italians in lockdown singing to each other from their balconies. Closer to home, people in Ann Arbor and around Washtenaw County (as well as in many other places) created \"porch pantries\" stocked with food and supplies for strangers to take. Neighbors often helped to replenish the \"pantries,\" so they were rarely empty. That was just one of the most visible ways people were helping strangers in our community without expecting or wanting anything in return. Last March, a low-profile, loosely organized group of people started the Washtenaw County Mutual Aid + Resources Facebook page, which enables members to post their needs so that other members can help by donating money and/or other resources.The group does not advertise itself, so it only gained traction by word-of-mouth. Now it is gaining critical mass\u2014it currently has about six thousand members, and sometimes dozens more join every week. Proponents of the mutual aid movement want people to commit to long-lasting social change, so people aren't allowed to join and post on the site unless and until they pass a mini quiz that demonstrates they have a basic understanding of mutual aid. (An article is posted on the page for background.) \"I only found out about it because several friends started talking about it last spring,\" said a woman who asked that I not use her real name. (For purposes of this article, I will call her Susan.) Susan's involvement started simply by dropping off diapers and wipes on a porch for a stranger who had requested them on the FB site. She also put twenty dollars in an envelope with a note that said: \"You can do this!!!\" When the woman let people on FB know that her needs had been met, she also tagged Susan and said: \"You'll never know how much your note meant to me!\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 47 But if we take a step BaCk, we MigHt finD tHat t H e year also B roug H t M any inspiring re M in D ers of t H e C apa C ity of t H e H u M an spirit to over C o M e a D versity an D len D C o M fort to strangers. p roponents of t H e M utual ai D M ove M ent want people to C o MM it to long-lasting so C ial CH ange. o ne of t H e C entral C on C epts of t H e M ove M ent is t H at we C an't wait for our ele C te D offi C ials to CH ange so C iety \u2014we H ave to M ake t H e CH anges ourselves, an D we H ave to start now.Mutual aiD in w as H tenaw County Can t H e p an D e M i C Have a s ilver l ining?

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 49 Parenting is challenging. Being a parent during a pandemic is even more difficult. How can we help our children cope with the disappointments that come their way while dealing with our own? Over the last year, Covid shutdowns have canceled many activities that our children enjoy\u2014birthday parties, school, soccer games\u2014even visits with grandma and grandpa. Some older children have missed milestone moments like getting a driving license, going to prom, or attending a graduation ceremony. Losing these precious times, as well as contact with friends, teachers, and other special people, has been hard on us as adults, but even more devastating to our children. How can we help our children respond to these many cancellations? As parents, the last thing we want is to see our children disappointed. We strive to make their lives as happy and carefree as possible. It's easy to feel sorry for our children when they go through particularly difficult times and it's tempting to help them avoid disappointment at all costs. We may find that our children's unpleasant emotions make us feel uncomfortable, too. Sometimes these feelings may even be \"triggering\" for us. However, brushing-off or ignoring our children's disappointments causes us to miss valuable opportunities to teach them how to process their emotions and build self-regulation. It also keeps our kids from learning that disappointment is a part of life. If we can stay in the moment with our children and be available to them, we can help them build their resiliency for the next disappointment. Disappointment is a part of life, and with a few simple steps, we can help prepare our children for life's ups and downs. Here are a few suggestions to get you started: 1. Give your child time to calm down. Allow your child time to calm himself or herself. Coloring, connecting with his or her senses, or using some deep breathing techniques will help your child get to a relaxed state. See if your child likes one of these exercises:Belly Breathing (Young Children) - Have the child lay on their back on the bed or the floor. Place a stuffed animal on their belly. Inhale and exhale slowly, with deep breaths. Have them watch the \"stuffie\" on their belly rise and fall with their breath. Square Breathing (School-age Children) - Have the child inhale and count to four. As they count, point, and trace the top of a square in the air with their index finger. Have them hold their breath while counting to four and trace one side of the square. Then exhale and count to four while tracing the bottom of the square. Finally, have them hold their breath and trace the last side of the square while counting to four. Continue tracing the square with four-count inhales, holds, and exhales. Deep Breaths (Pre-Teen/Teenagers) - Have your child take a deep breath in, and release it fully. Repeat two more times. On the last exhale, have them release their breath fully and make a sound\u2014a sigh, yell, roar, or whatever makes them feel better. 5-4-3-2-1 (Any Age) - Talk your child through this activity until he or she can do it independently. Say, \"Name five things you can see.\" Wait for your child to name five objects he or she can see in his or her current location. Next say, \"Name four things you can hear.\" Wait for her or his response. Say, \"Name three things you can touch.\" This can be the physical things your child touches where they are sitting or lying\u2014 blanket, chair, pillow\u2014or what touches your child\u2014the sun or a breeze. Next say, \"Name two things you can smell.\" And finally say, \"Name one thing you can taste.\" The last two parts of this exercise may be difficult to do and you may choose to stop the count after number three. 2. Help your child identify his or her feelings. When both you and your child are calm, ask your child to describe how she/he is feeling. He or she may be feeling several things at once and need to hear from you that all of these feelings are normal and okay. Younger children may have trouble naming emotions and may prefer telling what color they are feeling. You may also want to have a mirror nearby and a poster of faces showing different emotions to support children that have trouble identifying their emotions. 3. Empathize with your child. Listen to your child and give them your full attention. Take time to grieve with your disappointed child. Tell your child about times that you were disappointed and how those experiences made you feel. Sharing these times allows your child to see that disappointment is a normal part of life. It also validates your child's feelings of sadness and makes it more likely that he or she will reach out again to trust others for support when feeling sad and vulnerable. If we can fight the instinct to jump in to try to fix the situation for our children or distract them to avoid uncomfortable feelings, our children will have the opportunity to process their sadness and also learn a valuable lesson in the process\u2014that they can go through hard things and survive. One of the best gifts we can give our children is allowing them to experience unpleasant emotions, empathizing with them, and supporting them to move through those feelings. This is how we help them to become emotionally healthy and resilient adults. Anne Ward has taught in Ann Arbor Public Schools for nearly twenty years and has three grown children of her own.

By Anne WardThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 50 It was 11:46 p.m. on July 31, 2020 and I had just made the biggest decision of my life. I had deferred my admission to University of Michigan's School of Music. The decision process took less than 24 hours. Little did I know how much it would truly affect my future. F or the past eight years, music has been my life. As I progressed through high school, I began feeling pressured to say yes to opportunities because I felt like I needed to\u2014for college applications, for my future career as a professional musician, and even as someone that couldn't let my teachers (who had invested so much into my musical development) down. This pressure came from what I call the \"Ann Arbor Excellence Phenomenon\" (A2EP) - a force that values external accomplishments more than happiness and well-being. The A2EP is that devious little voice whispering, \"If you're not the best at something, you're a failure. If you're not pursuing your talents with the intent of becoming a professional, you're wasting your time. If you aren't attending the best school you could possibly attend, you won't get a good job. If you don't get into the University of Michigan, you're not smart enough.\" This voice sows doubt, disappointment, and despair as it travels from one student to the next. It furtively comes out of the mouths of competitive peers, well-intentioned and well-educated but nosey parents, and from the ubiquitous presence of the University and all things \"Michigan.\" It is virtually inescapable. When junior year rolled around, I fell victim to the A2EP . So did my friends. My mental health spiraled in tandem with my peers'. It was a constant battle between sleep, homework, and extracurriculars\u2014sleep losing heroically. The worst part? It's not just the juniors and seniors in high school suffering from A2EP . It's sophomores, freshmen, and even middle schoolers that are struggling. Society's traditional education system can be ruthless as it singles out potential and latches on until burn out (or worse) results. Specialization has become synonymous with success. All of that pressure is creating a generation of kids more anxious and depressed than ever before. By my senior year, the wave of academic and musical enthusiasm had fizzled out and I was essentially running on fumes. I felt like I embodied the epitome of \"burn-out.\" Yet, college applications and auditions never allowed me to relax. My mental health suffered. My physical injuries got worse. My journal from January 1, 2020 reads: \"I know that this is not who I truly am because when I envision my best life, I am the exact opposite of what I am now. I am killing it with music, psychology, philosophy, and outdoor programs. I am happy and sleeping and eating and working out. I am not anxious or depressed and I am thrilled to be alive.\" Trying to imagine myself at college during that time was virtually incomprehensible, yet I wanted to go in order to \"[kill] it with music, psychology, philosophy, and outdoor programs.\" In college. So, Ellie, where's the disconnect? The answer? Timing. I was first introduced to the idea of the social clock in my AP Psychology class my senior year. It seemed like an extended metaphor for how the structure of the education system worked. We move through the grades, meeting benchmarks and the knowledge that propels us into the next grade, next school, next job or career. The social clock is this societal nag that can pressure us to follow paths well-trodden at the expense of our current health and well-being. Just because something is conventional doesn't mean it is what you, as a unique individual, needs. Covid-19 disrupted all of the \"clocks\" -- social and otherwise. When life was in full swing, there was simply no time to reflect and consider other paths because school, applications, and music had me staring at the ground to avoid falling. I needed time off from the academic and competitive environment that caused so much stress. One year later, I feel ready\u2014more than ready to go back to school. I can't wait to meet and discuss and collaborate with vibrant, passionate, people. I can't wait to pursue my passions and let them guide me forward. On the last day of July, I finally came to my senses and realized that another year of playing music alone, staring at a computer screen, and constantly fearing for my safety at college was not how I wanted to spend my time. I knew that if I stopped playing horn to let my injuries heal, I might never pick it up again, but with my horn professor's blessing to take nine months off and my piano teacher's words \"You'll regret it if you don't defer,\" ringing in my ears, I decided to make the most out of this unprecedented year. I shared some highlights and insights in the hopes that my experience might serve as inspiration for an unconventional next chapter for others on the brink of big college decisions. In August I did the obvious\u2014I started a bread baking business. Well...not really, but the quarantine bread baking contagion was spreading and I soon got hooked. Next, I signed up to be a \"WWOOFer\" joining the community of folks looking for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (wwoof.net). I soon found myself at Strawbale Studio (strawbalestudio.org) in Oxford, MI and spent September learning about natural building and living out of my car (and tent). Some highlights include: making horse manure plaster, harvesting the results of our shiitake mushroom inoculation, building (most of) a stone bench, painting a house, fixing a leaky thatched roof, picking up guitar, chatting by the fireside deep into the night, learning how to work alongside people very different from me, and growing more in that month than in the past year. I learned that connection\u2014to nature, to humans, to my body, and to the universe, is really at the crux of it all. On September 25th I wrote, \"I am doing so well! I need to be grounded in order to take flight.\" That epiphany should've been no surprise\u2014we come from nature, and we are wired to be immersed and invested in the beautiful process of survival. It was bittersweet when I finally drove home. During October I gardened, worked at Human Electric Hybrids (the new electric bike store in Kerrytown) entering data, babysat, and tutored. I discovered Stoicism (check out The Practical Stoic podcast with Simon J. E. Drew!), embraced minimalism (got rid of half of my belongings) and #vanlife (travel anywhere, anytime, and be completely independent, paying only for gas and food!). An appointment with Diane Babalas at Gateway Chiropractic inspired me to become a traveling chiropractor, living out of my theoretical van, and exploring the world. How a Pandemic How a Pandemic Transformed My Life Transformed My Life After High SchoolAfter High School Perspectives and Resources Perspectives and Resources from a 2020 High School Graduate from a 2020 High School Graduate By Ellie Theriot This pressure came from what I call the \"Ann Arbor Excellence Phenomenon\" (A2EP) - a force that values external accomplishments more than happiness and well-being.

A friend introduced me to Workaway (workaway.info)\u2014a program like WWOOF where you can go stay with hosts, work for them, and in exchange receive accommodations, food, and an incredible life experience. So, for those of you looking for an adventure and to meet some new folks, check out WWOOFing and Workaway. Could lead you to some very interesting places. Thr oughout the many jobs and experiences, I did my very best to refute the stigma that those who take a gap year between high school and college fall off the wagon\u2014but taking a gap year is just one of many paths open to the high school graduate. Another ob vious path is college. I think the most important thing to remember when choosing any path, but especially college, is to know your why . Automatically assuming college is the next step can be a trap. Consider college's traditional role in the \"system\"\u2014the common justification is \"I'm doing [fill in the blank] so I can get a job that will support me and my family....\" However, this narrative is based on a future that isn't guaranteed. Instead, I implore you to consider college in relation to knowing your why \u2014the why that gives you purpose in the present and throughout the rest of your life. Your why ultimately relates to your higher purpose and overall well-being. There's a quote by Stoic philosopher, Marcus Aurelius, which states \"You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do, and say, and think.\" Covid-19 has clearly demonstrated how fragile life is and how important it is to understand your carefully chosen actions. If you're in a place where college makes sense for you, great! I plan to attend school, too. Wherever you're at, it's important to justify any path you choose for both your present and future well-being's sake. I planned to go to music school because I owed it to my past self to see how far I could take horn. I felt like I was letting myself and others down if I didn't pursue horn to my greatest potential. That reasoning failed to meet present Ellie's needs. The timing just wasn't right. I want to go to college because I want to become a chiropractor\u2014a dream I discovered in the middle of my gap year. If I hadn't given myself the time and space to explore other paths, who knows if chiropractic school would've ever entered my list of future dreams. Thinking about these big lif e decisions can be stressful. Believe me, I know. To keep the stress at a minimum, here is some advice and perspectives that have helped me along the way. 1. K now that whatever you choose to do after high school (and beyond), there will always be an opportunity cost. 2. Choices ar e not permanent. Just because I chose music in high school obviously did not mean that I continued to choose it. 3. Y ou are in control to choose and to choose again and again and again\u2014keep trying until it works. 4. \" Amor Fati\" = love your fate. Every experience is valuable, it's up to you to find the hidden lessons. 5. In addition t o knowing your why , another helpful framework for me was making life choices that would make my life story one worth retelling. F or those of you that are already considering future careers, I will offer this. Most of the jobs you will have in your lifetime likely haven't been created yet. The future is changing exponentially and because of that predicting what life will look like in 5, 10, or 20 years is a whole lot of guesswork. It's not worth worrying about. All of this comes back to the pandemic. Covid-19, thank you. Thank you for making online college just unappealing enough that I decided to defer. Thank you for cancelling my rehearsals and recitals so my other interests could grab some of the limelight. And thank you for reminding us all of how fragile life is and that I, for one, can help. Becoming a chiropractor will be a small contribution I make in this world that is hurting.

Let them discover how to manage their time and write with their own voice. It's their future, letting them take charge of it is the best thing you can do (my mom and I both agree on that one in case you were wondering). There's so much to consider when thinking about life after high school. There's so much to look forward to and be excited about. As the transition to adulthood begins and more freedom is granted, remember that the options are many. Covid-19 has forever changed our lives. It has granted us the opportunity to pause and consider our values and the fleetingness of life. It's taught us to take nothing for granted\u2014not tomorrow, not any future we may envision. It's up to us to make conscious choices knowing that the years following high school are the prime years of life and we cannot take a single one for granted.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 52 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Socially Conscious (And Distant) Kids' Art & Personal Development Programs After the Toughest Parenting Y ear Y et By Laura K. Cowan It has been a challenging year for group events, to say the least, as many kids' programs around Ann Arbor went virtual or were suspended. The situation dragged on so long, I decided to create my own after-school program for half-grown kidlet\u2014a mashup of virtual art programming and trying to get her out of the house and off her screen. Surprisingly, she adapted quite well to being home, so the biggest challenge was getting her moving again. I started thinking: what about all the other parents out there who are sick of researching which programs are still running or don't have the brain space to plan enriching activities anymore? What if we came up with a plan for this year that didn't depend on virus numbers to succeed? Here's what I came up with. It's pretty simple, though I think you'll be pleasantly surprised, as I was, with some unique programs out there right now to choose from. Mama's Master Plan: 1) Virtual kids' pr ogramming for social support after school. 2) Activities tha t bring some normalcy back without the paranoia of the virus shutting it down. 3) Don't w orry about another single thing. Have a coffee. Here are some suggestions for you, if you're trying to plan out spring or summer and are just at the end of your rope when trying to find good activities for the kids, not to mention socially conscious ones. I hope this takes the edge off the research, because I don't know about you but besides not knowing what day it is or whether I'm expected to wear pants, I have had it up to my forehead trying to re-plan my kid's schedule over and over and over as conditions change. This is our plan, and we're sticking with it, at least until the next ridiculous unforeseen crisis, in which case we will probably live out of a van and sell wind chimes. I joke, but you know what I mean. It's time to get out of the house, even for this introverted writer. Forget vacation planning. We just need a day out of these four walls. It has been a challenging year for group events, to say the least, and many kids' programs around Ann Arbor have gone virtual or been suspended. Spiritual Programming For Kids Many religious gatherings are still in session, but less structured programs are in suspended animation. I did find one still operating that is quite inclusive to many belief systems and is focused on community service, something I feel gets left off the table with so many other priorities that come with raising a child. The Ann Arbor Interfaith Center for Spirituality has moved their youth circles online to Zoom. Aside from potential privacy concerns with the link being posted publicly (have you been Zoom bombed yet?), I think this could be a great way to connect with other kids, as well as staying in touch with their frequent community service and activism opportunities for young people. It tends to lean toward older kids in this group but stay tuned for activities for all ages. As virus numbers hopefully come down toward the latter half of this year, expect programs like this to gradually resume more normal events. For more information about Interfaith Center events, visit interfaithspirit.org/youth- education/.Personal Development? In a Pandemic? How could you possibly add another to-do? Well, like meditation practice, martial arts for kids are a great way to weather a pandemic, because it feels as good as it is good for you. Asian Martial Arts Studio in Ann Arbor is a traditional dojo on Fourth Street downtown that teaches Chinese and Japanese martial arts, including a kids' program that combines karate, kung fu, and aikido. I have taken kung fu at AMAS in the past and noticed while I was in the dojo that the kids' program taught quite a bit of discipline and personal development in a positive way. I think you'll find this is true with a number of programs around town, such as Keith Hafner's Karate on Main Street and the great kids' karate program at the YMCA we've tried that's part of the Ann Arbor Karate Club, all of which have different flavors on the same idea. Group exercise classes are back in session in Michigan but require certain restrictions such as ventilation precautions. If your kid isn't high risk, you might consider getting them involved in a martial art this year to get them back in shape or reconnected with friends after remote schooling, while they also have the opportunity to learn self-control and find the self-confidence that comes from physical and mental personal mastery. Sensei Charlie Rooney teaches the kids' karate program at AMAS. I asked him about the benefits of kids studying martial arts from a consciousness standpoint. \"I think that martial arts help kids develop in five ways,\" Sensei Rooney said. \"Exercise, focus, confidence, the value of correct technique, and the importance of avoiding violence.\" That last one surprises people when they first join the martial arts. Learning proper martial arts teaches you to avoid violence, and to use it as a last resort of self-defense, not to bully or show off. Sensei Rooney said martial arts are also good physical exercise, \"developing strength, endurance, agility, and coordination. As you know, nearly all of us get too little exercise, kids included.\" So why martial arts this year, besides getting out of the house? \"It teaches the importance of focus,\" Rooney told me. \"We practice concentrating on the current task in the face of distractions through games and ippon kumite (two person fighting drills).\" It seems to me that the pandemic has created a distracted quality in me, at least, from being overly busy juggling too many priorities. But when I make time for martial arts, it keeps my body healthy and cues my mind to focus and calm down, to remember that I am not lost in an endless haze of \"Blursday,\" as our family calls the phenomenon of never remembering what day it is without the usual scheduling cues. \"Internal\" martial arts programs you could try after a basic kid's program can add to that basic regimen of physical martial arts by offering additional instruction in meditation, body posture, and sometimes energy healing and martial applications for energy principles. If your kid is an esoteric type, a kids' martial arts program, even Well, like meditation practice, martial arts for kids are a great way to weather a pandemic, because it feels as good as it is good for you. Magnus and Felix Porter Breaking Boards It seems to me that the pandemic has created a distracted quality in me, at least, from being overly busy juggling too many priorities.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 53 a start from scratch one like most of them are, is a great way to get them started on a routine that can lead to more mindfulness practice and body awareness in a healthy way down the road. \"[Martial arts are] another way for children to learn the practical importance of doing things the right way,\" Rooney explained to me. \"For example, with good technique even a small child can break boards without much effort. With poor form, they just can't do it.\" \"R epetition is another part of the learning process that martial arts stress,\" Rooney said. \"You won't maintain balance while throwing an opponent until you have practiced the technique hundreds of times. You will still be improving after years of practice.\" So, beyond the regular practice, discipline, and self-control required for martial arts, how is personal development taught to children? \"When one of the children asks, we will discuss violence and the martial artist's attitude to it,\" Rooney gives as an example of how these things come up in class. \"I think most of the children understand very well (better than my generation did at their age) that violence is a last resort, only to be used in defense, never to be considered as a solution for a real-life problem. However, it is probably helpful for the message to be reinforced by another set of adults.\" This seems particularly useful to me as the mother of a kid who gets along great in school but occasionally runs into a bully and has only been taught non-violence by parents and school staff. Martial arts are a good way to address things kids often don't know how to ask. Also, this year, it seems to me that martial arts are a great stress reliever, and many kids are struggling with frustration and pent-up energy. At AMAS, kids wear loose-fitting clothes for the first few classes and then purchase uniforms after deciding to stick with the art. This is common to many classes, though a free, standard-issue colored belt is often given to children beginning karate and uniforms vary by dojo. To learn more about martial arts options for kids at AMAS, you can call Sensei Karl Scott who runs the dojo at 734-994-3620 or email karls@a2amas.com.

This might be for the older set depending on level of interest and skill, but it's pretty inclusive and might even be a nice family activity to replace movie night. Ikebana is a flower arranging art form taught in Ann Arbor at Matthai by local Ikebana International Chapter #183. President Liz Larwa told me that they're currently showing a video once a month featuring \"an expert in Ikebana doing a demonstration of about eight arrangements using various flower and branch materials and containers.\" The demonstrator explains what he or she is doing during the arranging. Videos run on every third Tuesday evening of the month and repeat the third Thursday afternoon each month. \"We gladly welcome teens to join us\u2014and their parents, too,\" Larwa said. \"A challenge is put out to viewers to try to make their own arrangement based on one of the principles demonstrated in the video. They send a picture to me and describe their arrangement. We then show them during the next video meeting.\" Larwa said that the videos are a wonderful way to expose those who are new to Ikebana to those who are experienced in this ancient art form. \"Ikebana has been around since the fifteenth century and is practiced all over the world.\" Currently the local Ikebana chapter is not holding any classes in person but are in the process of trying to design a full online class. \"Once the pandemic is over, we will be very willing to try to set up some kind of special series of classes for teens. We normally meet at Matthaei once a month on Thursday afternoons,\" Larwa said. You can learn more about Ikebana flower arranging classes online by emailing a2ikebana@gmail.com.

The Ann Arbor Public Schools are a big collaborator with TreeTown Murals, and Thiefels also offers a paint by number mural project for groups that allow kids to collaborate on a general design and then fill in colors in a grid with Thiefels and her co-founder husband finishing out the final painting. We were wondering how people might still get together to create community art in a time of social distancing and were happy to hear that Thiefels found solutions to the challenges currently facing group activities for kids and continues to offer group projects with social distancing measures in place. Thiefels told me: Netural Zone Mural Camp Crew \"Art can be socially conscious: The excitement of being able to make something that represents their school and that collaborative element [excites kids]. Through an activity process, we have a process to draw out ideas, have kids work on their own, then team up with other people. The end result, even if a young person has painted a small area, is a sense of ownership. When it's a public piece, with kids bringing people together to show others, it brings people together to leave a legacy for the community.\" Thiefels' projects are often large scale. You'll see her work on buildings downtown, or in the public schools. Though this is an activity that requires a larger group budget and more planning ahead, I thought it would be lovely to offer a kids' activity or community family activity that people could pursue if it were a right fit, purely because the pandemic has so impacted communities that some groups might want to create art to express their experience and celebrate still being able to come together to create. Thiefels explained: Art develops individual character and is an agency for what kids want to say. The youth population is often told what to do, where to go. The freedom to express is mind-blowing. We've had tears and group hugs. Often there's a struggle to get everyone's vision, or a struggle in the painting process, seeing different skill levels for example. When kids see it come together, there's a stepping back. Young people I've worked with have developed art careers they were so inspired. In a time when many young people are feeling isolated, how wonderful would it be to sponsor a community art project that brings together kids and families to express their experiences of the last year and envision a better future through art?

We're still open to working with any party.\" TreeTown Murals has worked with the Neutral Zone, sponsors a group of artists to paint downtown Ann Arbor shop windows for Christmas, and has also created murals for the new Natural History Museum, but they're also open to kids' events and are working with Clague on a mural remotely in 2021.

I know my planning circuits are blown at this point, but I have been thinking of ways to get outdoors and keep teaching my daughter about community service and environmental cleanup. At least, that's the track running in the back of my mind behind all the other things I need to juggle. Maybe we just need a break to get outdoors. There is a retired gentleman who walks down Huron River Drive every day the same time I would drive kiddo to school (or these days, driving a fur baby to the vet while kiddo remote schools), and he picks up trash in a plastic bag. I greatly appreciate people like this who take time out to keep their local areas clean and am always sure to wave a thank you and give him space on the side of the road. There are programs through the City of Ann Arbor this year where your family can get out to learn about land stewardship or to walk in city parks, but I was thinking this year might be a good time for me to start a personal practice like the gentleman by the river that is more There are programs through the City of Ann Arbor this year where your family can get out to learn about land stewardship or to walk in city parks, but I was thinking this year might be a good time for me to start a personal practice like the gentleman by the river that is more self-sustaining. Continued on next page The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 56 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Continued from previous page self-sustaining. What if it becomes a mindfulness practice for you to pick up trash around your neighborhood on a daily walk, to pick local wildflowers (in a sustainable fashion: never take all of a plant in a given area or harvest from private property) or to keep trails clean in your local park while socially distancing and getting outdoors? Are there programs that are going under-funded this year where you could volunteer with your kids and get them out of the house? We just don't know how long this is going to drag on at this point, so instead of focusing on initial safety and practical planning through the pandemic, I'm switching over to making sure our family has a regular check-in to make sure everybody is okay, and then hopefully doing more outdoor activities in the summer that give us space to move around without worrying about who is not wearing a mask or how many people might be at an event. I'm protective of kids, but I just don't have the energy to worry anymore, so I'm creating a schedule around activities that give us a little breathing room while keeping us focused on the positive. If you've found ways to do this, I'd love to hear from you about your experience. If you'd like more structure to your outdoor mindfulness activities right now, there are a few City of Ann Arbor programs you can join. The Stewardship Network's Huron Arbor cluster gathers via Zoom these days for \"informal discussion on a monthly topic with volunteer and professional land stewards, plus others interested in nature. Free of charge.\" Recent meetings included Jason Frenzel, who facilitates current and potential watershed stewards, talking about taking the long view on environmental restoration. Ann Arbor Parks & Recreation also runs a Featured Walk of the Week through its new Park Walks program, \"inviting you to get outside and take a walk in nature. You can explore the featured walks on your own or attend a hosted walk. No registration is necessary.\" You can log pictures with the hashtag #a2parkwalks on social media and win prizes by tracking hiking goals. You can subscribe to City of Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation programming at a2gov. org. Many other environmental programs are up in the air right now, but there is a local wiki on volunteer opportunities for youth and teens at localwiki.org/ann-arbor/Volunteer_opportunities_for_youth_and_teens and learn about other opportunities for kids at www.ecocenter.org. Hang In There, Mom and Pop The kids might be struggling to remote school, or maybe they love it, but you're concerned life is nothing but screen time. I know. And who knows when things go back to any recognizable form of normal? For the time being, like I'm sure you are, I'm focused on family first and getting through this. I hope if you have the energy, some of these kids' activities give you some rabbit trails to follow to some enjoyable activities that are healthy, mindful, and that your kids will enjoy. Hang in there. Every storm runs out of rain. And kids socially conscious programming in Ann Arbor will again be as great as it ever was\u2014maybe even more diverse and accessible in the long run.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2021 Page 57 By Madeline Strong Diehl When Kathleen Wright, a beloved Ann Arbor elementary school teacher and self- confessed \"bookaholic,\" first heard about Little Free Libraries (LFLs) in 2014, she and her husband knew immediately that they wanted to install one outside their home on the Old West Side. \"I thought it was one of the most marvelous ideas I had ever heard of,\" said Kathleen. The typical LFL is roughly the size of a large birdhouse, and it usually contains one shelf of books that are available for passersby to take away for free. The general guideline is \"take a book, leave a book\"\u2014in other words, if you take away a book, you're expected to replenish the library and leave another book you're ready to donate. But there are no firm rules, and it's all done on the honor system. The LFL organization informally began in 2009 when a Wisconsin man named Tod Bol built a model of a one-room schoolhouse in tribute to his mother, a teacher who loved to read. He filled it with books and put it on a post in his front yard. Soon, he was building many more and donating them to friends, neighbors, and others who requested them. The idea gained critical mass, and by 2012, with a lot of financial and logistic support, the LFL became a nonprofit organization with more than 4,000 registered \"stewards,\" or volunteers who installed, curated, and maintained LFLs. In 2014, when the Wrights got involved, it was possible to buy a library ready- made or as a kit. But they knew they wanted to build their own, so it would closely match the design and color scheme of their house. They knew they wanted two shelves\u2014the lower one at eye level for children, and the upper for adults. \"I have a husband who can build anything,\" said Kathleen, \"but we were surprised how long it took. By the time we sketched it out and built it, it took several weeks.\" When the Wrights registered their LFL on the organization's world map in July 2014, they were told there was only one other LFL in Ann Arbor, and it was located on the far side of town. Now, six and a half years later, there are more than a hundred registered LFLs in Ann Arbor, and a spokeswoman said there are probably many more. (It is up to each library \"steward\" to decide whether or not to register locations on the world map.) There are more than 2,100 registered LFLs mapped for the entire state of Michigan, which has the seventh highest number in the U.S. And there are more than 100,000 registered LFL book-sharing boxes in 108 countries worldwide; they can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Kathleen Wright, who has taught in the Ann Arbor Public School District for more than twenty years, says it's almost impossible to keep the Wright's LFL stocked with good children's books. \"When I run low, I put the word out that I need more,\" she said. Many LFLs have a reading bench nearby, and the Wrights have two\u2014one for children and one for adults. \"I love looking out my window in the summer and watching parents and kids sitting side by side and reading books together.\" Supporting literacy is a big part of the LFL's mission; the website mentions that more than 30 million adults cannot read or write above a third-grade level. The nonprofit has various initiatives \"to fill book deserts and place libraries where they can make a big impact.\" A visit to a good LFL provides an adventure even for the most discerning readers. \"I have read many wonderful books and discovered authors whom I never would have come across otherwise,\" said Wright. When the pandemic hit last spring and not much was known about how Covid was transmitted, some LFLs closed out of an abundance of caution. Other stewards turned their LFLs into pantries where neighbors could donate and pick up such things as face masks, toilet paper, and food. Kathleen says she and her husband considered closing, but then decided that the pandemic was a time when people needed books more than ever. So, they put a sign on the door of their LFL that outlines what's known and not known about Covid transmission, which includes the information that not many scientists believe that the virus can survive long on surfaces like books. With public libraries now closed for browsing, the LFLs are the only place in town where you can look through a bunch of books and pick something out at random. My daughter Amelia came home from Chicago to shelter-in-place with us last March. She says that studying the books inside a LFL can provide insight into what people in the neighborhood are thinking about. \"After a lag of a couple of months, I can find a lot of great, almost-new books about recent events like protests against police brutality and the urgent call to address climate change,\" she said. \"The little free libraries are like a new kind of message board that have the potential to bring the community together to discuss social issues while we can't have these kinds of discussions in person right now,\" because of social distancing. Sometimes Amelia will come home from a walk with a book she has been wanting and hoping to read for a long time. Whenever she shows me one of these treasures, I am reminded of when she was young and presented me with dandelions as if they were the rarest of flowers. I've always believed good books are like medicine, so the metaphor is no stretch of the imagination\u2014after all, botanists consider every part of a dandelion to be medicinal\u2014l eaves, stem, flower, and root. So, as small as a LFL might seem, it has an outsize influence over its environment. Or, as Todd Bol, the founder of the movement said in 2018, right before his death: \"I really believe in a Little Free Library on every block and a book in every hand. I believe people can fix their neighborhoods, fix their communities, develop systems of sharing, learn from each other, and see that they have a better place on this planet to live.\" For more information about Little Free Libraries and how to build, buy, and install one, please see: www.littlefreelibrary.org.

Both Caroline Myss and Julia Cameron are well known authors in the self-help, healing, and spirituality genres. They both burst onto the scene around the same time, nearly 30 years ago. Since that time each of them has produced an entire shelf of books unto themselves and each became classroom teachers of their work. Coincidentally, both grew up in the Chicago suburbs. Devotees of their work can't help but wonder what else might Caroline or Julia might have to offer, so I decided to read and review their newest books. Author, and spiritual teacher, Caroline Myss was an original and powerful voice in the self-help genre back in the 1990's, beginning with books such as Anatomy of the Spirit: The Seven Stages of Power and Healing . Her gift of medical intuition was a new concept. Her newest release is called Intimate Conversations with the Divine: Prayer Guidance and Grace. The pre-press preface was written at the onset of the shift of 2020 and addresses the global Covid-19 pandemic. She's quick to point out that, \"We have been living in a psychic pandemic of fear for many years,\" and this prayer book seeks to address that fear. Myss is the product of a Catholic upbringing which gave her a foundation for connecting to the divine in a unique way, bridging spirituality with healing. This is the theme in all her books. Myss also teaches her work. Several years ago, at the end of her classes, Myss would share her prayers with her students. Much to her dismay, they began to request copies. Out of the many requests for copies grew the birth of this book. Sharing her own personal spiritual practice with the world was not something she ever thought she would do, but realized it was something she had to do. According to Myss, people have been praying in one form or another for centuries, but it is a language that has become absent in our daily lives. Prayer books are not new, but Myss' own prayers may be. At first glance, I expected to see pages full of simple stanzas surrounded by white space. Instead, they are actually short chapters, 100 in total, each devoted to a relatable theme. I randomly opened to a page to see what came up (something she suggests doing). It was Prayer 39 called Healing Night Flights, a prayer for repairing one's \"depleted soul. . . weary body The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 58 and . . . burdened heart,\" while asleep. As we follow her conversation, she talks about the work we have to do ourselves and writes, \"There is no such thing as a small act of darkness just as there is no such thing as a small act of love.\" There you have it. This is not a light and airy prayer book. The prayers read more like essays, or soliloquies on different topics, much like reading a sermon, only very intimate, deep, and relatable. Each two-to-four-page chapter is divided into Prayer , Guidance, and Grace, and ends with an italicized message as in chapter 39 above, \"Lord grant me the grace to awaken\u2014truly awaken\u2014and the courage to embrace that mystical experience.\" This is the part that is what you might expect a traditional prayer book to look and sound like. Other chapters have titles such as: Confronting my Frightened Inner Self, Sharing Blessings, and The Gift of Aging . What is labeled Prayer is essentially her conversation to the Divine about a certain subject. In the Prayer section of the chapter There but for the Grace of God Go I, she discusses her encounter with a homeless man who joins her on a park bench. He asks her for an iced tea, she agrees and offers to get him a sandwich as well. She becomes uncomfortable when he asks her to eat with him, not wanting to be alone. She obliges him and shares her\u2014not often seen\u2014vulnerability in this experience. She has another meeting with another woman she feels has the signature of a saint and muses as to how the Divine is choosing them these days. The sections on Guidance involve Myss going deeper into the subject matter of the related Prayer. Here she asks questions and may share a relevant story. In the chapter called Only You Could Change the World so Fast, she says the current virus is the agent of bringing the world to a stop but not the mystical agent\u2014the agent behind the scenes, so to speak. She says \"We haven't really grasped that 'creating our own reality' is a mystical truth, not a behavioral one.\" The Guidance here is to understand the truth that we have the power to create through every choice we make. In the Grace portion of a chapter on faith she says faith and trust go hand in hand and they are the foundations of self-esteem. In typical fashion, she does not mince words. \"If you cannot Trust yourself, you can never\u2014ever\u2014Trust another person.\" The thing you have to appreciate about Myss is that she's going to take you deeper than you might be comfortable with so you'll do your own inner work. She's a strict teacher and regularly raps the spiritual ruler on the reader's knuckles. Myss makes a tight case for prayer in our lives and her book provides us with the medicine. She points out that we are in a historical crisis of sorts. Where the \"majority do not know what they believe in.\" Humanity is vulnerable. Not knowing where we stand, we might believe the loudest, strongest voice around even if it's negative, even in the context of religion. Prayer or words, can help or heal and she defines the true meaning of prayer as \"a request for help in how to see.\" To find the words and the hope to guide you in this life. In this most personal work of hers yet, Myss gives us an opportunity to join her in asking for help through prayer.

Creativity is the foundation of Cameron's teachings and her new book builds on this with the concept of listening. She seeks to answer the question\u2014how does listening feature into our lives as creatives? At this point in her career Cameron is a seasoned teacher. Her long-time students and readers are seasoned as well. The Listening Path refines the creative process even more. The introduction explains the three main tools of The Artist's Way: Morning Pages, The Artist's Date, and The Daily Walk. One need not have read any of her prior books to understand these. Morning Pages are the work portion, an opportunity for you to be heard, by you! These are three completely imperfect handwritten pages of whatever is in your head written each morning upon waking. My experience is when morning pages are done consistently, they make everything a little easier. The Artist Date brings in the fun factor. Often resisted, giving yourself this special time to focus on your inner artist, you can't help but listen. A period of strong writing followed one student's artist date to a pet store where she got to pet the baby rabbits. Lastly the Daily Walk \"brings us into the present moment.\" We can't help but look and listen to our environment as we move through it. These three pieces are the foundation of her Artists Way programs. The first three weeks of The Listening Path are all about listening to what is in your immediate vicinity: the sounds in your environment, other people, and your higher self. Cameron writes at length about part of her day with respect to the entirety of sounds around her: The loud noise of a hail storm and the effects it has on her dog. She says by tuning out sounds we do ourselves a disservice. For example, tuning in to the alarm clock noise you despise may inspire you to take the action of getting one you like better. Liking your alarm clock sound will have the added effect of making you happier, and you will be more likely to tune in further. Listening to pleasant sounds makes us more pleasant. \"Happiness is a primary characteristic of the Listening Path,\" says Cameron. When it comes to listening to others Cameron points out there can be the tendency to interrupt, have your response ready ahead of time, or listen without saying anything. She interviews fellow artist friends and shares with us how listening factors into their own creative processes. This is a non-intimidating workbook with simple \"Try this...\" invitations for our ears peppered throughout. She took what she heard from her actor and writer friend and turned it into one of those suggestions. Try this: Plan to meet a friend for a chat with the intention of listening carefully to learn. Afterward, consider what you learned and discovered. It's a great opportunity to practice being curious. Working with the previous Artists Way tools can make us feel more ready to listen to our higher self. Cameron shares how writing to her \"inner elder,\" calmed her anxiety about buying a home for the first time in many years. She addressed the naysayers: the inner critic and others who claim this is just our imagination. There are a series of questions she asks herself when faced with any troubling situation, such as: \"What do I need to accept?\" Tuning into our intuition provides comforting guidance. The following weeks invite us to consider something we may have never in our lives actively listened to\u2014voices beyond our immediate environment such as listening to those beyond the veil like deceased loved ones or historical figures, and lastly, listening to silence. Here Cameron shares that she communicates The first three weeks of The Listening Path are all about listening to what is in your immediate vicinity: the sounds in your environment, other people, and your higher self. The final chapter on listening to silence may be challenging to many. \"We quake in its unexpected emptiness.\"regularly with close friends that have passed on. I was surprised how simple and easy she made it sound. \"Can I hear from Jane?\" she asks and immediately, Jane responds. Having her friends' supportive messages are encouraging. Similarly, Cameron listens to voices of public figures that are no longer living. She says the intention is key here. Who do we admire? Cameron admires and writes to Bill Wilson, the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. He offers appreciation and reassurance of her work. Cameron has previously shared that the late famous duo\u2014Rogers and Hammerstein, helped her write musicals. Writing music was something new that her Morning Pages suggested she try. She has now completed three musicals and two collections of children's songs. Cameron points out that to communicate with our heroes builds connections that strengthen ourselves. Why not make an attempt to listen to someone you find wise, who has all the time in the world to speak to you? The final chapter on listening to silence may be challenging to many. \"We quake in its unexpected emptiness.\" So many of us live with constant background noise, be it TV, radio, or even going shopping with earbuds in. Cameron encourages her silence avoiding friend to try sitting in silence for five minutes. He calls her after the experiment and reports that although it was different, he remembered something important and had some new ideas for his week. Cameron insists the silence isn't silent at all, it is filled with a benevolent presence. For those that seek silence it can also be difficult to find it, especially in the city. She suggests finding the quietest environment you can. It could be a church or a library (when open), and tuning into the silence to discover what you hear within it. After time spent in silence, our senses are undeniably sharper and more alert. As I was enjoying a bit of silence at a park recently, I picked up a safe but unpleasant burning smell from a distance which I might not have noticed otherwise. Once I began this book, I immediately found myself paying closer attention to my environment and others. I noticed listening takes patience and time, but that's also what it gives you. On the cover of the book is a single Conch shell, a perfect illustration of a seemingly silent object found in nature\u2014an ideal image to capture the essence of The Listening Path. As it turns out Caroline and Julia do have more to tell us, more to teach us. These two books, unique on their own, actually fit together nicely as a pair. Each book highlights an aspect of conversation, one is about communicating, the other listening. The invitation to participate in either requires very little on our part and by all accounts seems more than worth it. we want to be comfortable on our mats, with arms planted into the mat close to the body. On an inhale, core muscles engaged, we lift the legs toward the sky, planting the hands on the low back, and cradling the pelvis. The amount of lift through the pelvis is very much up to you. There are many variations of supported shoulder stand, and you will see many that show legs and body in one line, and others with more of an angle. The most important thing is that your core muscles are engaged, and feel lifted through the legs. The other op tion, often called Candlestick, places a blanket or pillow under the pelvis, and allows the legs to reach up toward the sky. If you need a bend in the knees, take that adaptation. This variation is quite restorative, and is something that I practice for a few minutes before bed on most days. Though children may love a supported shoulder stand, you may find that family time holding Candlestick can be held for a little longer, and can offer you a space to offer balance to one another. Namas te Katie, You talk with many readers about the challenges of meditation, and I have been struggling. I am looking for something that I can use while at work when I cannot play a guided meditation, or use one of my other go-to tools. Do you have any suggestions during this hectic time? Liz, Ann ArborDear Liz,This has been a time when meditation has been recommended a lot and has been more challenging than ever. I have found myself going back to the basics in many cases, as practices that are complicated or involved have, for me, felt overwhelming. In The Science of Breath by Yogi Ramacharaka there is a wonderful practice of pranayama that is itself meditative and fits the situation you are describing. It is called Yogic Rhythmic Breath, and involves connecting with your own heartbeat, and connecting your breath to the pace of your heart. Find y our pulse, perhaps on your wrist, or on your neck. Take a minute to find a place where this is easy, so that when you start the practice you are not searching or struggling. When you are ready you will begin counting the inhale to match six beats of your heart, allow the exhale to match six beats of your heart. Take ten breaths to feel comfortable with this practice, and if this is where you want to start, stay here. This is a beautiful way to connect deeply with yourself. If you would like to continue the practice, the space between the breath is half that of the length of the inhale and the exhale, so at this point, the count of three pulses. If the location and time allow, the length of the breath can be increased, as well as the space YOGA COLUMN Dear Katie, My family and I have had a challenging time, which we agree is a shared experience, and are wondering if there is a posture we can share that can bring us together, and bring our stress levels down. Mar cus, Ann Arbor Dear Marcus, I agree this year has been unbelievably challenging, with multidimensional trauma, and challenges coming from all directions. It can be challenging to feel reset, and at times to be set at all. Through yoga there are a number of ways that we can come into our bodies and do our best to work toward a sense of balance, even if only for a moment. One key path is to slow down, focus, and reset, through an inversion. These spaces, where the base of the spine is elevated above the base of the skull, signals to the parasympathetic nervous system to kick into gear. This part of us is the 'tend and befriend' part of the nervous system that cares and comforts. A delightful way to come together in an asana place is through a Salamba Sarvangasana, a supported shoulder stand. Her e, I offer two versions. One is using your own body, and strength to support yourself, and the other is settling into supports. Whether we are using props, or using our own body is often dependent on the day. To come into Salamba Sarvangasana between. Check in that as you expand the breath you remain comfortable. Y ogi Ramacharaka recommends that we start with twenty rounds of this breath practice, adding more rounds if time and space allow. This connection with our own rhythms draws us into a place of concentration and can become a meditative place. Connections to the breath are the foundation of a mindful practice. Dear Katie, Recently as part of a workshop on positive psychology we were all assigned to start a gratitude journal. I was discussing this with my partner, and they suggested that I also look into other heart chakra practices. Are there ways to expand on this gratitude work? Dan, SalineNamaste Dan,I am a big fan of gratitude journals and keep one myself. As you mentioned they are a part of a growing amount of research in a number of fields, including positive psychology. The Anahata Chakra, or the Heart Chakra, is the midpoint in the traditional chakra system, with three below and three above. Gratitude work is important to cultivating an open heart and forming connections with others. T o build on your work of gratitude journaling, transfer this intention and energy to a meditation practice, or into an asana practice, if you find that more accessible. Breathing in feelings of gratitude and opening ourselves up to recalling moments when we feel grateful builds our own abilities to come to these feelings and sensations over and over again. As discussed in positive psychology and in yoga, there are so many negative influences and attachments impacting us and attempting to steer us away from a compassionate and loving mindset. Gratitude is a powerful way to stay open and connected to others, and to our own ability to forge deep bonds. Whether through meditating on a particular moment of gratitude, or using a gratitude mindset as a sankalpa, see if there are ways to infuse this mindset into other practices to make your heart center shine! Katie Hoener is an RYT 500, receiving her 200 and 500 hour trainings. She is also a Licensed Master Social Worker and a partner at Verapose Yoga in Dexter (veraposeyoga.com). Please send your own yoga questions to katie@verposeyoga.com.Through yoga there are a number of ways that we can come into our bodies and do our best to work toward a sense of balance, even if only for a moment.I have found myself going back to the basics in many cases, as practices that are complicated or involved have, for me, felt overwhelming. Gratitude work is important to cultivating an open heart and forming connections with others. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 60 Namaste, Katie... Whether you're a seasoned yogi or getting ready to roll out your mat for the first time, here you'll find a variety of useful tips from local yoga instructor, Katie Hoener.Photo by Hilary Nichols By Katie HoenerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 61 By Hannah Stephenson Photography by Mary Bortmas (Editor's Note: There are quite a number of equine therapists, and equine- facilitated learning stables, in southeastern Michigan. One of our writers, Hannah Stephenson, suggested profiling one of them\u2014Sarah DesJardins, who is exceptional in that she is combining equine therapy and energy healing, and working with children, adults, and families. In addition to offering energy-based equestrian therapy, she is deeply committed to offering trauma recovery services. Healing from trauma is something DesJardins knows a good deal about. On her website, she notes that she is a survivor of incest, and suffered severe physical, sexual and emotional abuse as a child, and she has had a long journey of healing. One of her life challenges has been living and working with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) - how to understand it, how to construct a positive life with it, and how to help heal others. She is now doing ground-breaking work in this area, and readers can use the links we provide to hear her talk about it. As Stephenson reports, DesJardins is highly attuned, and she brings to bear intuitive and psychic capacities in reading people, their energies, and their soul work. She has also spent many years as a gardener/landscaper, and she incorporates nature, cooking, laughter and love into her healing work as the owner of Souls at Play Center for Creative Therapy. Now 57, she was raised in New York, spent her summers in northern Michigan, and spent a few years in schools in Vienna, Austria. For more than 30 years she has lived in the Ann Arbor area, and now resides in Manchester. She also has a son, who is 31.) Down a country road and around a corner in lovely Manchester, hot tea and home-made chocolate-chip cookies (my favorite treats) awaited my Divine Order \u2014 Not Disorder How Sarah DesJardins' Personal Journey Informs Her Equine Therapy and Energy Healing Work I explained I had known of Sarah for a while, had heard her speak. Now, I was in the position to help spread more awareness of her mission.arrival at Souls at Play Center for Creative Therapy. This was my third time seeing Sarah DesJardins. The first was at the Spring 2015 Holistic/Psychic Fair of Ann Arbor, where as a guest speaker, she presented a powerful seminar\"Psychic Awareness: The Silver Lining of Trauma\"maxing the venue's capacity. That experience prompted my arranging a field trip for a sample equine therapy session with my Onsted High School Psychology and Stress Management classes. While there, I watched an introverted young man (identified by the Special Education department as Emotionally Impaired) triumphantly manage a 1500 pound, 16 hands tall, magnificent Friesian horse under DesJardins' coaching. His smile lasted for weeks. This visit would be our first in-depth conversation about how DesJardins finds joy in \"helping people connect with their soul and start expressing it.\" DesJardins earned her Bachelor of Science in Clinical Laboratory Science from the University of Kentucky. After the sudden death of her husband in her 30s, she left the field and drew from her long-term love of gardens to begin a landscaping business. DesJardins' inspiration for each garden created was to \"make people feel better and promote healing for those who had suffered trauma or loss.\" In the creation for others' healing, her own was nurtured. It was also during this time that DesJardins' latent abilities to read animal, as well as human, conscious and subconscious energy surfaced. It began the exploration to help herself and others \"listen to the Self where the heart is.\" She has since provided psychic and energy sessions for 14 years. Add this to her total 25 years of horse experience and her 10 years offering equine therapy with Friesians, and it is understandable that she was able to synthesize her skills into a ground-breaking format. Clients of DesJardins have ranged from individuals and couples to parents, families, foster children, horse owners, and corporate team builders. By helping clients to increase Self-awareness, they garner a multitude of gains: peace, increased self-esteem, improved relationships, self-empowerment, hope, and the opportunity to reconnect with the ability to play\u2014which, DesJardins believes, most adults have lost. She has found \"the most direct route to the soul is through the innocence and joy of play, hence, the name of the center.\" DesJardins wants \"people to know the uniqueness they bring, and that the world is enriched by their presence.\" Helping people on their journey of healing from eating disorders, trauma, sexual abuse, and Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder, is a special passion. By offering experiential-based creative therapies, DesJardins creates a safe, empowering environment to nourish self-discovery needed for healing. Jennifer DeVivo, LMSW, ACSW Executive Director of Fostering Futures in Ann Arbor refers clients to DesJardins. \"I am a clinical social worker who often comes across very tough cases of trauma. In the instances when I have very complicated trauma in a child or teen, and an open, willing parent who is also willing to do their own work with their child, I want them to go see Sarah. I know she will provide a clearer picture of the core issues that are standing between the family and emotional peace. I also know she will walk through the hard work of change with her clients.\" DeViv o continued, \"I also love to recommend Sarah to adults who feel they aren't sure what to do next in their lives, but truly want to grow. Sarah's perspective and information makes paths visible that were there all along but may have been hidden by our limiting beliefs about ourselves and life's possibilities.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 62 Divine Order \u2014 Not Disorder (continued) Equine Assisted Learning \"Through her equine therapy, Sarah Desjardins quickly elucidated dynamics between my partner and me,\" said Lorri Coburn, MSW, about a personal session with Sarah. \"We were able to see and experience them first-hand, as the horse mirrored our issues. As a psychotherapist myself, it's apparent the one session of Sarah's equine therapy may be equal to several sessions of talk therapy.\" DesJardins explained that horses instinctually monitor their surroundings to stay safe and are thus experts at reading energy. Their behavior shows externally what you are feeling internally. Their reactions to a client's instruction will reveal the client's emotional, psychological, or sometimes even physical concerns. If a person gives up too easily, doubts their authority to direct others, or gives mixed signals\u2014the horses respond accordingly. During one session a 12-year-old boy was asked to back up a horse. The child verbalized the request, but internally doubted he could do it (he admitted during the debrief). The horse did not move. When told to repeat the command, the boy did verbalize again but with even less presence than before. Completely disinterested, the horse walked away. The child threw up his arms saying, \"See I can't do anything, let's just go.\" He too, began walking away. The whole interaction demonstrated that the child had little faith in himself and as soon as uncomfortable feelings surfaced, instead of being persistent or asking for help, he abandoned the situation. Instead of moving through the feelings of not being acknowledged, nor heard, he quit to avoid facing failure . This is a sample of how Equine Therapy, or Equine Assisted Learning, can bring deep internal issues to light. Once identified, the internal beliefs can be addressed. In this case, DesJardins reoriented the child to a place of self-empowerment. Together they discussed the feelings and the self-defeating thoughts he was telling himself. Given a way to revise his self-perspective to a positive self-image along with visualizing a successful completion of the task, the boy again attempted the activity. This time, the horse responded to his direction. DesJardins combines her personal experience and horse training with the philosophies of holistic horsepersons such as Klaus Hempfling (a specialist in communication and human movement). Like Hempfling, DesJardins does not use any means of physical forcible control. Her voice, light touch, and energetic presence provides the guidance to the animals. She is also a member of the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship, which was established in 1969 as the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association, to foster equine therapy. In its early years, the mission of Souls at Play was to offer \"energetic-based, equestrian therapy through specifically designed, situation-oriented sessions.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 63 He wanted to know why I was there talking with Sarah. What was my intention? He w as patient and attentive. I explained I had known of Sarah for a while, had heard her speak. Now, I was in the position to help spread more awareness of her mission. With each sentence, I felt he was intensely weighing what I was saying. He was, as always, there to protect her. I thank ed him for coming out to speak to me, that I was humbled, and then... I started to tear up. Disclosur e: Tears just start flowing when I experience profound truths. In the presence of Willie\u2014and he has his own presence\u2014I felt extremely humbled and more than a bit awed. He was, and is, of higher energy. In those few moments, I have no doubt he energetically read more than I had said, but what I was able to vocalize was deemed sufficient. In February of 2017, Michigan Healthy Minds television show hosted DesJardins to demystify Dissociative Identity Disorder. Additionally, she was a guest speaker at the 2021 Healing Together Conference sponsored by An Infinite Mind (in collaboration with Harvard Medical School's McLean Hospital). ( An Infinite Mind is a non-profit organization dedicated to educating the public and professional community about trauma-based dissociation with a primary focus on Dissociative Identity Disorder in an effort to dispel the myths and stigmas attached to it.) It is an annual event for people with DID, their allies, and clinicians. While there she was filmed for use in an upcoming documentary about DID. \"Disorder\" suggests there is a problem that needs fixing or inherent damage.Additional Therapeutic Approaches Working with nature has long held healing power for both emotional and physical distress. Modern research studies have verified its ability to lower heart rate and anxiety, reduce depression, and improve nervous and immune responses. DesJardins pulled from her prior landscaping business experience to design a healing garden for the Center. She also developed nature-based activities to aid clients' healing work and teach the interconnectivity of all. In the kitchen, DesJardins has an open island for baking therapy and a side booth for crafts, art, eating, or whatever else is needed. \"Kids often start singing as their inner baker comes out. They make huge cookies in whatever shape they want . . . and they are always happy when frosting cakes they themselves have made.\" DesJardins explains, \"Baking is very grounding and offers a range of benefits like simply allowing someone to make their own choices.\" \"You also have to be friends with your food. People with anorexia often hate food because they view it as the enemy. Perfectionism traits are also challenged. When you are baking, you work through the process. If something doesn't work out, then they learn to shake it off. Clients learn that the Universe always give you more opportunities, so you don't have to be so hard on yourself.\" Learning about energy is also offered at the Center. \"Energy is the language of the universe,\" DesJardins offered. \"We all communicate through energy whether we are aware of it or not.\" Small children are often already perceptive to energy, but their adults may not understand or know how to talk about it with them. So, what does that look like? During our interview, for example, while I paused to write some notes, suddenly DesJardins asked, \"Are you alright?\" I realized my mind had suddenly veered off conscious note-typing to tunnel vision thinking of a friend who might benefit from her services. DesJardins had sensed a subtle energy shift in the room, despite me not changing my expression, nor pausing in typing. Similar to cancer producing a smell, she shared that certain emotions (such as aggression) also produce a subtle energetic scent. This can alert would-be victims to dangerous situations developing and provide time to prepare. DID and Trauma \"They may or may not come out. I can hear them\u2014a couple of them are discussing it righ t now. They are curious about you.\" Then, jus t like that, there seemed to be a shimmer in front of DesJardins\u2014like what you might see on a hot day when the air above a road becomes blurred. Her shoulders seemed broader and momentarily there was a different face in front of that of my host. \"Hello. My name is Willie.\" The Scottish accent was clear, and the cadence paced with care. \"Can you understand me all right?\" He gestured with concern to the mask on his face. Of all of Sarah's people, he has their respect as a wise elder. He had come in at birth with Sarah, knowing what was in store, and as her earliest personality, had chosen to help her in this lifetime. In Psychiatry, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) defines DID as the following: Two or more distinct identities must exist recurrently taking control of the person's behavior. During that process, it creates an inability to recall events and information beyond ordinary forgetfulness. The behavior cannot be attributed to drug use, medication side-effects, religious culture, nor childhood fantasy play. Symptoms cause significant distress or impairment to daily functioning. Most sites estimate that 1-3% of the general population may have some form of DID. Additionally, many with PTSD also experience some form of dissociation. A person with DID has two or more different and distinct personalities, the person's usual \"core\" personality and what are known as alternate personalities, or \"alters.\" Recent research using EEGs provides proof of different consciousnesses in control of the brain during an alter's experience. One such study provided data that brain activity normally associated with sight was absent while a blind alter was in control of the woman's body even though her eyes were open. \"Remarkably, when a sighted alter assumed control, the usual brain activity returned.\" (Kastrup, Crabtree, Kelly, 2018). \"We live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles. Meantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related; the eternal ONE.... The act of seeing and the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle, the subject and the object, are one. We see the world piece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the tree; but the whole, of which these are the shining parts, is the soul.\" \u2014Ralph Waldo EmersonA second study at the Swinburne University of Technology of Australia strove to directly address the \"pretending rationale\" by critics. Using an EEG to monitor brain waves, Neuropsychologist Joseph Ciociari compared five patients with DID and their alters to \"five age-matched professional actors each pretending to have a child alter.\" While being attached to the EEG, each host and alters were asked to do simple cognitive tasks. Ciociari's study observed \"significant differences in the EEG coherence analysis between the true DID core personalities and their alters, but not between the actors and their pretended personalities\" (Harrison). Just as multiple personalities have different nationalities, ages, genders, sexual orientations, eyeglass prescriptions, and values, science is now documenting each have distinct brainwaves and brain area utilizations. \"DID is the Self protecting the mind and body. It is actively the Universe at work.\" DesJardins explained each personality, or aspect of the Self, has a different role. Some step in to take the abuse. Some step in to clean it up and hide all evidence of it from the core person when he or she comes back to a conscious state. Why is DesJardins so passionate about aiding trauma and DID survivors? At the point where she felt she had healed from the loss of her husband, DesJardins recalled, \"I wanted to be of even more service to the world. I put it out there to the Universe. It was then, I had a feeling that I had to go through something else, something big.\" That something was learning about her 98 verified personalities. Sipping the tea, DesJardins laughed. \"People have said to me, 'Really, Sarah? Why not make it 99 or an even 100?'\" She sees the humor, but it also speaks to the larger problem\u2014DID is still largely misunderstood by the average person, and, surprisingly, by many therapists. This is why DesJardins and her \"people\" (multiple personalities or aspects of her Self) endeavor to spread awareness, and also why her Center assists therapists in learning more about DID.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 64 \"Disorder\" suggests there is a problem that needs fixing or inherent damage. Without hesitation, DesJardins explains, \"It's not a disorder. What was done to me was out of order. It's a defense response.\" For her personally, DID has not caused difficulty with creating or maintaining an effective, successful life. Instead, it saved her life. \"Most people think the outside world is unsafe, but for me, it was the inside,\" DesJardins revealed. She paused, saddened to think of the number of young people and women at home with abusers during the Covid-19 shutdown...to think of the undoubtedly rising numbers of PTSD and DID during the months of the pandemic. DesJardins says her DID healing process was orderly but anything from linear. Imagine being introduced to someone you had no knowledge of, and then they ask you to accept a totally different self-history than what you remember living through. Add to that having to accept that what you thought you knew, about people you were close to, was inaccurate. Sometimes, grossly inaccurate, and often disturbing. In addition to learning a college episode of memory loss was due to an encounter with a serial rapist, DesJardins became painfully aware of being a survivor of incest\u2014including severe sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. She even coined a word\u2014 heinosity\u2014 to describe the severity of the abuse because no adequate word exists in the dictionary. She intimately understands the process of healing from trauma. Once she discovered her own DID, DesJardins then had to assist all of her \"persons\" through therapy. That is one aspect laypeople would not even fathom: healing from DID requires the personalities not just to share the trauma that happened to the core personality's body, but for the personalities to come to terms and heal from what they endured for the sake of the main person. She explains, \"As you uncover each piece it all makes more sense. It is a challenging process with lots of tears. To align with the Self, we weep.\" So how does she help others heal from trauma, PTSD, and DID? Through the various creative activities and talk, DesJardins \"helps them trust themselves\u2014which is everything. When you trust yourself, your life becomes peaceful. It is all about expressing the Self\u2014the core of it. Shining. The more one expresses the Self (in a state of self-love and joy) the more you become your pure Soul.\" DesJardins added, \"The cleaner and purer your energy is\u2014you shine.\" After traditional energy work, such as Reiki or Healing Touch, it is common for the faces of both the practitioner and the client to glow a bit. But here was a new layer: In releasing emotional or mental drag, the Self itself\u2014not just the physical package\u2014glows. She continued, \"Trust the Universe knows what it's doing. For a person brought up to believe there is no God, no support, I can now see all the things leading up to my spiritual awakening.\" When asked to clarify her spiritual understanding, DesJardins confidently stated: \"There is the All. Call it Source, the Force, God. Call it what you like.\" Her tone gave me a mental image of swatting away bothersome labels. \"There is this energy that loves us, and we are always trying to align with it.\" Divine Order - Not Disorder, continued \"The Universe shows you how amazing it is and how it can express itself through you.\" \u2014Sarah Desjardins .The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 65 DesJardins and her team explain the awareness that \"All is the Allthe Source.\" Each personality is actually a part of DesJardins' Self, or spirit, from a prior lifetime or from the original universal Source. Her team offered this metaphor: \"If you pour water into a bottle, the water is in a new package [the bottle] for a moment in time.\" Simultaneously, there may still be water in the original craft as in the bottle. In both locations, the water remains water. DesJardin's 98 personalities are all still the Self that, in this lifetime, is known as Sarah DesJardins. Just as her internal Self is connected and part of the All. It is all fluid\u2014like water\u2014part of the flow of Source. For years now, DesJardins and her people share co-consciousness. She never loses time nor has memory losses anymore. If clients are open to it, they have the option of working with DesJardins and her persons collaboratively. Depending upon the client's needs, whichever personality can offer the most benefit will come forward to share. DesJardins explains, \"I have access to all parts of myself\u2014and they are useful to others. They each have such amazing abilities to share.\" Some intuitives refer to themselves as mediums who \"channel\" a specific spirit from other realms. DesJardins shrugged at the comparison. \"You can say that I channel, but they are all me from prior lifetimes.\" Naturally, she cautions, \"Personalities do not want to be treated as a side show or expect to be trotted out as a circus act.\" Moving Forward at the Center DesJardins shared her excitement over the progress made in expanding the cen ter. It is evolving into The Souls at Play Center for Creative Therapy. It is \"A non-profit center that will offer creative types of therapy (art, equine, garden, socialization therapies, and more).\" The mission is to help people on their journey of healing and recovery from trauma and sexual abuse. Along with that? To help people diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). One of the ne w offerings at the center is a game that she and a client co- designed. It is a board game based on the metaphor of a journey. The client draws the path however desired. Next, DesJardins puts in spaces as safety nets or \"soft spots\" to land. Landing on those spots fosters conversation on how the client could create a soft spot (or comfort coping aid) in his or her own life. On other spots, the player has question prompts to answer. For DID clients, these help the child begin to talk about his or her personalities and how to interact with them. Example prompts might be, what foods do some parts like or dislike? What do you want people to know about having parts? DesJardins mentions, \"It is very important to let them choose how to discuss or name their 'parts' or alters.\" Pattern and card questions can be modified for different levels, ages, and so on. In both the design creation and the actual playing, healing occurs. Often the spontaneous conversations contribute just as much value. It is a means for starting to accept DesJardins' maxim, \"Your life gets to get good, be good, and stay good.\" In wrapping up, I asked if DesJardins could condense her insights to the top three concepts she thought everyone should know which would make the world a better place. She paused, but only for a moment. \"First, people need to Honor the Self. People have been taught to not trust their inner voice. What does your inside tell you to do or not do? Listen to your Self. Second, people need to know they are never alone. The Universe is always there and loves you. Third, be in nature every day.\" She sat back in her chair. So much more to hear, so much more available to learn at the Center. But for now, I sip my tea, thoughts simmering, and sit in gratitude for the visit. To learn more about the center, or if you are interested in a position at the center, check out DesJardins' website at Soulsatplayequinecenter.com or call 734-417-4112 or email: beaucheme56@gmail.com . By offering experiential-based creative therapies, DesJardins creates a safe, empowering environment to nourish self-discovery needed for healing. My mind recalled that after energy work, it is common for both the practitioner and the client's faces to glow a bit. But here was a new layer. In releasing emotional or mental drag, the Self itself\u2014not just the physical package\u2014glows.

The roots of the King family and their Frog Holler Farm go back to 1971, to the founding of the Indian Summer restaurant in Ann Arbor. That's where Indian Summer's co-founder, co-owner, and head cook, Ken King, met Cathy Munkholm. Cathy had been hired to make salads at the restaurant and worked alongside Ken, chopping vegetables. The organic food and locally grown movements, ubiquitous now, were brand new in '72. Frog Holler was the first organic farm in the area and grew out of Ken and his Indian Summer partners' decision to grow their own vegetables for the restaurant. \"Even at that early time, before 'local produce' was a buzz word, they just didn't like the idea of those boxes of produce coming in from California,\" says Cathy King. They began looking for land and found an old abandoned piece of property in the Irish Hills (Brooklyn, Michigan), where there had once been an orchard. As the group started to separate into two entities, the restaurant and the farm, Cathy remembers that \"Ken discovered an affinity for whatever this was, trying to grow things, even though there wasn't really anything here yet.\" Both Cathy and her son, Billy, are soft-spoken, but their eyes light up when they talk about the farm. Was farming a steep learning curve? \"We're still learning,\" says Cathy, laughing. Farming wasn't what she had planned on doing when she was younger. When she talks about growing up in Grosse Pointe, Billy jokes, \"Vibrant farming community in Grosse Pointe?\" (Laughter). Cathy started farming only after beginning a journalism degree at Northwestern, returning to Michigan after the passing of her father, and finishing with a liberal arts degree at the University of Michigan. Billy mar vels at his dad's ability to learn on the go. \"He didn't know anything, right? He just kind of figured it out. I don't know how that was even possible, but he somehow figured out how to make it work.\" By Sandor Slomovits Continued on next page We have a beautiful piece of land that we're fortunate to be living on and taking care of the best we can. And one thing we do is grow vegetables, but it's so much more than that. Not that \"farmer\" is a bad label at all, but we don't really think of the land as a farm in the traditional sense of the word. We just try to grow things on a few acres so we can preserve the rest of the 120 or so. You've seen this place, it's gorgeous. And I'm still in awe how nature just permeates our existence, that we live with it, and around it, and through it. \u2014 Ca thy King of Frog Holler Farm Photography by Mary Bortmas Editorial help from Emily Slomovits The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 68 Sandor Slomovits: What was that like, deciding to leave the relative safety of steady jobs and sharing the responsibility of running Indian Summer with other people, and then having to be responsible for it all? Cathy King: You know, Ken thought that this land was a great growing area, that we should grow our own food for the restaurant. Which was a crazy idea, but it was the early seventies and people still had a lot of crazy ideas. The group [that ran Indian Summer] founded the farm in order to grow produce for the restaurant. So, it wasn't scary to make that decision because there was going to be this connection of restaurant and farm; the restaurant would support the farm. Then it became obvious that you can't develop a farm out of an abandoned piece of land. There was nothing here except the natural beauty of the land. There was no electricity, no well, no equipment, there was nothing, no experience, except Ken had always had a garden. You couldn't do both (farm and run the restaurant). Ken became drawn to the farming and felt he had to give up his involvement in the restaurant. He never expected the person who ended up with the most shares in the restaurant to sell it. But that's what happened. So, then we really were on our own, [because] we didn't have the restaurant buying anything that we grew. The partners all fell away and it was just Ken and I here, and we were too committed to not do this. But there were some lean years, let's say. Sandor Slomovits : Tell us about those lean years. Cathy King: We really didn't know what we were doing. When the restaurant was supporting the farm, we were able to put in a well, so at least we had a well, and could buy a tractor. But the land was so undeveloped. It was just wild. We were hacking away at tree stumps and living really simply. I mean, we lived in the cabin and... Sandor Slomovits : Was the cabin already there? Cathy King: Yes. It was built by the people we bought the land from, Dr. Robert Gesell and his wife, Cora Lees. He was a U-M professor, they lived in Ann Arbor, and this was their retreat. They were conservationists and Dr. Gesell, in 1952 publicly came out against vivisection for research. That indicated their attitude toward life, people, justice for animals, and the earth. We felt like we didn't just buy a piece of land. We sort of made an agreement to take care of the land and the animals. The land was really special. It was far from Ann Arbor, and we were driving back and forth to the restaurant, back to this no electricity place. [We lived] in the cabin, trying to figure out how to make a fire and warm ourselves up, and then go back to the restaurant in the morning. It sorted itself out. It was a relief to stay here, but we were always sorry that it meant the end of Indian Summer, which was a lovely institution. Sandor Slomovits: When did it end? Cathy King: It might have been '76. It didn't last very long. That's why it was named Indian Summer. Ken named it that, because it'd be really nice, but not last very long. I didn't think he knew how or why it would end, but what he said was prophetic. Sandor Slomovits: How old were you and Ken in '72, when you moved to the farm? Cathy King: (Laughter) I think I was 24. Ken was almost 30. He was all grown up. He seemed like he knew what he was doing. He was kind of an elder, he wasn't afraid to try things. The King Family Half a Century of Farming, Making Music, Teaching Yoga, and Building Community Sandor Slomovits: When did you start bringing your vegetables to the farmers market in Ann Arbor? Cathy King: First we went to Saline to try it out and that was experience, but it wasn't many sales. Then we started in Ann Arbor on a Wednesday because we were sort of in awe of the Ann Arbor Farmers Market. Then we ended up going on a Saturday with lettuce. We had a very small sign that said 'organic' and the lettuce just flew off the table... it was probably 35 cents, three for a dollar. (Laughter) But we realized that was the market. Billy King: For many years we were the only organic farm. It still feels recent to me that there are so many other organic farms now. Sandor Slomovits: Do you think that the people who started organic farms in the area were influenced by you? Cathy King: I think it was kind of the mood of the times. There was a while, maybe in the eighties and nineties, when there was no interest. Then, in the early 2000s there was Barbara Kingsolver and Michael Pollen, and the interest came back around. I don't think it had a whole lot to do with us except, we were still there. We hadn't given up. Now of course there's much more awareness and appreciation of small farms and locally grown produce. Billy King: Although it was always decent for us. Cathy King: Yeah. Well, 'cause we didn't need that much. Billy King: We had maybe developed a loyal customer base. Cathy King: But we did press cider, for a good while. There used to be apples on the farm. We thought we could bring them back organically, these old trees that were planted in World War II, but we couldn't. So, then we bought apples. That was like a factory job, driving around buying apples. Ken was working in an unheated cider area in our barn. It didn't even have walls, just had plastic. Billy King: That paid the bills. Cathy King: Yes. That was how we could stay here in those early days because we couldn't grow enough to pay the land contract or feed ourselves. Billy King: How many years did the cider production last? Cathy King: At least fifteen years, maybe even longer. Somebody heard about an old cider press and we said, okay, we'll try it and Ken sort of put it back together again. It was nothing like the modern cider presses, but it made really good cider. We took the cider to the Del Rio, Seva, Applerose, and we sold it at the market. That was fortunate even though, again, we didn't know what we were doing. When we could stop doing that, it was a big relief because it was very physically demanding. Ken and Cathy King, and son For many years we were the only organic farm. It still feels recent to me that there are so many other organic farms now. \u2014Billy King Somebody heard about an old cider press and we said, okay, we'll try it and Ken sort of put it back together again. \u2014Ca thy King Continued from previous pageThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 69 Sandor Slomovits: Tell us about your CSA. Cathy King: We'd been taking our produce to the Ann Arbor Farmers Market for years when CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture) became popular, so we were late adapters. The basic idea is a commitment from members at the start of the year to use what's in season and abundant. This gives security to farmers that face the unpredictability of weather, pests, and customer demand. Members say it saves them time shopping, encourages them to try new things, and ensures that they will get a great selection of produce without having to 'beat the crowds.' We started small, about 25 families in 2008, which grew to 60 in a few years. We took a break from the CSA for the next few years because our growing space is limited, and our time was split between the farm and Holler Fest. Sandor Slomovits: Yes, Holler Fest. Many people know your family as farmers, but many also know you Billy, as a musician, and plenty remember the King Brothers\u2014 you and Kenny playing and recording music when you were barely in your teens. And then there's Holler Fest, the music festival you've been hosting at Frog Holler for many years. So, let's talk about all that music. It started with Ken, right? Cathy King: Yeah. I often say he really considered himself a musician more than a farmer. Billy King: I think he was always trying to elude a label. If you called him a musician he'd say, 'I don't know, I'm a philosopher.' Cathy King: If you called him a philosopher, he'd say, 'no I'm a farmer,' but certainly he wanted to include musician. Sandor Slomovits: Did he play the Ark and other places, or was it more informal than that?Billy King: He didn't perform very often, if at all. He was always writing songs and playing them around the house and at one point he decided to go to a studio. This was something he'd kind of always wanted to do, and it was way out of his comfort zone as a singer, to be in that environment. So, I'd say the result was not super flattering, but nonetheless, it showed that he had some ambition about his music. He tried to send it around to publishers, which is, you know, a wretched thing to do. Sandor Slomovits: Yes, I do know! (Laughter) Billy King: After that he was probably feeling like he hadn't been able to deliver the songs the way he would have liked to, so he ended up buying recording equipment. He came home with a cassette four-track recording studio. This is generally the way he would go about everything, 'I'm just going to figure out how to do this myself.' He was going to record his songs, and my brother and I quickly took charge of this new toy. Cathy King: You took it! Billy King: Kenny and I started recording our own songs. The roots of the King family and their Frog Holler Farm go back to 1971, to the founding of the Indian Summer restaurant in Ann Arbor.Continued on page 70I think he (Ken King) was always trying to elude a label. If you called him a musician he'd say, 'I don't know, I'm a philosopher.' \u2014Billy King The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 70 Sandor Slomovits: How old were you? Billy King: I was ten when I started recording, and by the time I was eleven, we were performing all over Ann Arbor. Cathy King: Your first cassette was when you were eleven. Kenny was seven. They were home-schooled and we tended to trust them with expensive equipment. (Laughter) We knew they would do good things with it. Sandor Slomovits: This was in 1988?Billy King: Yeah. Actually, we'd started to record before this four-track. We had miscellaneous tape decks and I found a way to make them work as multi-track by playing back what I'd recorded and singing to it\u2014very old school. But once we got this four-track, it's like the door opened. We had a little drum machine and a keyboard, and I just took to it very quickly. Cathy King: Ken did get his cassette recording finally, didn't he? Billy King: He was so much less comfortable recording. I think his best musical moments were probably either in his room, just banging out songs, or some shows he played where he really was able to connect with listeners. But I have a lot of recordings I still hope to make available at some point. Sandor Slomovits: Did your dad teach you guitar, or did you teach yourself? Billy King: I guess I resisted input from him, probably picking up on his self-guided, self-teaching mentality. I wanted to teach myself. (Laughs) Cathy King: You were just around him doing music. Billy King: I started on piano actually, just feeling it out, and then quickly switched to guitar. But I didn't bother with chords. I just played the top four strings where chording is very simple. When I finally sat down with a book of chords, it was just adding to what I already knew. Kenny King is the middle brother, four years younger than Billy, and Edwin King is the youngest of the three. On Saturdays at the Ann Arbor Farmers Market, the three of them are often among the crew manning the Frog Holler stall. Kenny played a lot with Billy when they were growing up and I wondered what role music played in his life now. Sandor Slomovits: Kenny, you played a lot with Billy when you were growing up, I remember seeing your cassettes for sale at the People's Food Co-op, and even a couple of years ago I recall seeing you in Chelsea playing bass at a gig with Billy, my daughter Emily, and a few other people. Would you talk about music in your life now?Kenny King: These days, I feel more comfortable in a less visible role. The performing that I did with Billy, as the King Brothers, that was a long, long, time ago. I was introduced to music, to performing, when I was pretty young. In my teens I stopped doing that and I don't feel like taking the stage anymore. I can fill in sometimes when there isn't someone else to do it. (Laughter) But I don't feel like being center stage. Sandor Slomovits: What about you, Edwin? Edwin King: I never picked it up. I enjoy it [music] but I managed to dodge that particular talent. (Laughter) To the best of my memory, I think I played one show with them. I think I played drums for a school sock hop. That was the full extent of my performance career. I let them have their thing and found my own. His own thing includes playing speed chess online, he was the concurrent state chess champ for elementary and middle school, and for years was on the winning volleyball team for Manchester rec leagues. His mom, recognizing her sons' reticence when it comes to self-promotion, also added, \"Kenny is visually artistic (he won't admit that now so good luck exploring it!) but it led to his attending and getting a degree in Graphic Design from the College for Creative Studies in Detroit.\" In the late 1980s, when Billy and Kenny began playing in public and recording, the King family started hosting occasional informal open mics on their front porch, and later in their barn. \"We'd have a party with music, with jamming, very casual,\" says Billy. \"Holler Fest was such a major leap from that, but that was the seed, having music in the barn.\" Since 2007, Holler Fest's inaugural year, the music festival on the Frog Holler Farm grounds has grown in both size and reputation. It's now one of the premiere folk and roots music festivals in Michigan, mentioned in the same breath as Wheatland, Blissfest, Hiawatha Traditional Music Festival, and Farmfest. Featuring a format similar to those and other music festivals, Holler Fest offers concerts, including ones especially tailored to children, as well as workshops on instruments, song and poetry writing, and more. Holler Fest primarily presents Michigan performers and has arguably the most beautiful natural setting and the best food of any music festival. For many in Southeast Michigan, musicians and music fans alike, it's become a cherished annual goodbye-to-summer tradition. \"It was, to a large extent, Kenny's idea,\" says Billy. \"He had been studying at CCS (College for Creative Studies). He came back to the farm after that and was maybe looking at it with a different perspective. He'd also been to Bliss Fest in July 2007. Continued from page 69 The King Family I was introduced to music, to performing, when I was pretty young. In my teens I stopped doing that and I don't feel like taking the stage anymore. I can fill in sometimes when there isn't someone else to do it. (Laughter) But I don't feel like being center stage. \u2014 K e n n y K i n gBilly King Kenny KingThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 71 When he came back, he looked at our land with fresh eyes and said, 'You know, we've got a perfect venue for something like these music festivals that happen in Northern Michigan.' Since it also happened to be the 35th anniversary of the farm, he said, \"There's a good excuse to throw a bigger party than we normally throw.\" When I talked with Kenny later and relayed what Billy said, he offered a slightly different, and typically self-effacing take on what happened. \"Well, you know, I wouldn't take credit. Maybe we were all sitting around and maybe I was the first person to say the word festival. I'm not sure. Having people out, sharing music on the porch, in the cabin, that kind of community was already part of what we considered the farm to be about. I guess I thought maybe we could expand that community a bit and do something a little bit larger.\" Billy King: We didn't have to do too much clearing [that first year] but a lot of mowing. Building a stage had to happen in like a month's time. (Laughter) We had neighbors who helped and it all just kind of came together once the seed of the idea was planted. It was so small, but still leaps above what we'd done before. It was just one day, we had four or five bands lined up to play. I think we had 300 people. Cathy King: But we didn't expect that many. I remember we didn't have a kitchen. We just brought some food that we had made somewhere. We were serving out of a tent and I was just madly serving, and somebody said, 'stop a minute and look up.' And the food line, it just stretched away from the tent up and over the hill. And I realized, that people really had come. Billy King: And then everyone was saying, 'So, see you next year.' And we were like, 'Wait, what? Okay.' (Laughter) We were just trying to keep it small.Cathy King: Yeah, but you changed it to three days, the second year. Sandor Slomovits: And now you have four stages; the main one at the foot of a natural bowl amphitheater is a perfect place for playing, listening, or dancing to music. But my favorite is in the small stone cabin that you, Cathy, and Ken lived in when you first moved to the property. Billy King: By now we're close to 2,000 people, that's people on the land, not paying attendees, that's musicians, volunteers, everybody.Cathy King: We didn't promote it for a long time. We still do very limited promotion. I asked Edwin and his partner, Emily Foley, about their roles in Holler Fest. \"Well, my role has generally been to do all the farm stuff while everyone else is doing festival things,\" says Edwin. Emily, whose day job is in the film industry as Head of Development at Hear/Say Productions has caused her to miss some years of the festival, adds, \"I don't have a specific role.\" Which actually means that she wears a variety of hats in preparing for the festival, generally doing what needs to be done. \"For the first twelve years that we did the festival we still went to market on the weekend of Holler Fest,\" says Edwin, \"Which was crazy! (Laughter) We were harvesting while everybody else was working on the festival. I kind of enjoyed it. I found it meditative just to be out there on my own and, you know, I get done what I get done. I was always very relieved to not be as stressed as everybody who was working on the festival seemed.\" *** Sandor Slomovits: So, Billy, are you a farmer, a musician or... Billy King: I don't think it's being difficult of me to say that I feel like I'm a homesteader or something... Sandor Slomovits: Like your dad, you're refusing to be pinned down. Billy King: Well, I don't think it's necessarily to be difficult or to resist a label. I just don't think it would be fair or accurate to say I'm a farmer because I do so many other things, and some of them, like music, I would consider a part time job. On a farm you're required to be a builder, an electrician, and a general problem solver. So, I don't really identify so much as a farmer, but I'm okay with it. It doesn't bother me. Cathy King: When you say farm, especially in this culture where farms are no longer very present in the consciousness, people see corn, they see tractors...Billy King: Animals. Everyone thinks of animals. Cathy King: Yeah, beef cattle or something. I feel like we live on the land. We have a beautiful piece of land that we're fortunate to be living on and taking care of the best we can. And one thing we do is grow vegetables, but it's so much more than that. Not that \"farmer\" is a bad label at all, but we don't really think of the land as a farm in the traditional sense of the word. We just try to grow things on a few acres so we can preserve the rest of the 120 or so. You've seen this place, it's gorgeous. And I'm still in awe how nature just permeates our existence, that we live with it, and around it, and through it. Without sounding too precious, I think the life that we have designed at Frog Holler stems largely from a space of unknowing (which can also read as insecurity). I think Ken really set the idea of the value of creativity in motion. We certainly never had a \"business plan\" and, while being firmly planted in place and dedicated to growing good food, Ken considered himself a scholar, a musician, a writer, and an artist as well.

Cathy King: I was taking yoga out here, but I also took a class in Ann Arbor because some friends said I should take a class from Barbara Linderman. She had been teaching at the YMCA but moved her classes to the Friends Center. She was going to be taking a year off while she studied psychology and she needed some people to take her classes. To this day, I do not know why she asked me to teach. I really learned to teach by the seat of my pants and also by having some really good examples, Barb Linderman and Ron Chalfant, who also taught in Ann Arbor. I didn't take a teacher training or anything, Barbara felt that I had some interest, so she asked me to teach a class. I did, and it kind of clicked. Then, along with the other teachers she asked to cover her classes\u2014Lynette Smith, Martha Laatsch, and Jonathan Tyman\u2014we decided that we needed a name. The four of us met with Barb at the Gazebo in Manchester, we sat around and brainstormed, laughed at ridiculous suggestions, and tried again, laughed some more until someone blurted out Inward Bound and Barb said, 'I think that's it.' Continued on page 72 Emily Foley Cathy KingThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 72 We met at the Friends Center where Barb and her husband had a long-time affiliation. I am grateful for my early students, that they didn't get damaged. (Laughter) I learned so much as I went. I continued to study myself and then just learned from my students. It was a real passion. Sandor Slomovits : When did you start practicing yoga? Cathy King: I sort of studied yoga off and on all my life. I had a friend, DorothyAnn Coyne, who lived out here and she and her husband, Bernie, had built a healing center. They called it Sunnyside and they had a beautiful room where she and I were practicing teaching. (Bernie passed away a few years ago.) We had the two of us, and three people came to the class. That was a good ratio of teacher to student while we learned. This was in the early nineties, probably '92, '93. The King brothers were playing, I was teaching yoga and I think we were just able to stop doing cider, and 1995 is when Inward Bound became an entity with a name. It was a very creative, rich time. I taught there until 2009, when Ken passed away. Sandor Slomovits : Do you still practice? Cathy King: Yeah, not as much as I should, in the summer... Sandor Slomovits: Farming is your yoga. Cathy King: Yes, but it's really in me. When I stopped teaching at Inward Bound, I was also still teaching through the Washtenaw senior program, so I was teaching in Manchester, Saline, and Chelsea. When I stopped doing that, I was slowly shedding driving around and teaching yoga, I was just teaching in Brooklyn. Then we remodeled our barn and the idea was I was going to teach in the barn on the farm, and then the pandemic happened, and I'm not teaching at all, but I hope to again someday. I certainly believe in the value of it. Billy King: We would integrate it into the music\u2014we used our music for classes. There was a lot of crossover. My dad was involved and there were performances.Continued from page 71Cathy King: I had a group called Still Moving Yoga Dance Group. I had access to this wonderful original music. There were maybe eight or nine people willing to do these things with me. We performed with Billy and Kenny at Performance Network, and at different yoga studios. Sandor Slomovits: I've seen videos of some of those shows. The way you combined yoga, dance, Billy and Kenny's music, humor, and storytelling was really wonderful. I'm sorry I never got to see them live. Cathy King: The Yoga Dance was separate from my classes, but I often use music with the postures. Music takes the consciousness into a whole new place. To me, designing a yoga class is a creative opportunity, drawing on the students' ability and interest, my personal interests, the cultural milieu at the time, and that great creative mystery. You have to sort of go into that unknowing space to allow something to emerge. I don't ascribe to any system or way to encapsulate what I do or how I teach. I try to be present to my students. Sandor Slomo vits: I've avoided asking, and I certainly understand if you don't want to talk about it, but Ken's passing must've been an enormous shock for all of you. If you're willing to talk about that, I would appreciate hearing. Cathy King: Thank you. I don't really know what to say. Billy King: Well, I think when you're in the middle of running the farm, you have no choice but to keep running. For at least two years prior to him passing, I was the one who mainly worked with my dad. Toward the end, I was the one that basically kept him from hurting himself. He was really struggling and trying to do what he'd always done. Cathy King: Hurting himself being on equipment that he shouldn't have been on. Billy King: Yes. Those were challenging years, especially the one before he passed, because I was trying to keep the farm going and take care of him. At some point we knew what was happening (that he was dying of cancer), not that we were necessarily processing it, it takes time to process, but kind of what we were going to be dealing with, and we just had to keep going. Prior to that, when he was very much with it and capable, I couldn't imagine how we would function without his involvement and leadership, because the way he would work was all just in his head. He didn't do things so that other people might have insight into how he was making decisions, or why things were happening. That kind of made it a mystery to us, but once we had to take the reins, we quickly found our own way, we got very organized. We started keeping notes for everything. That's how we were able to bring more people in. I think the summer after [he passed] we had quite a large crew working on the land with us. Kenny was very instrumental in that effort to bring more people in. The King Family Ken King Prior to that, when he [Ken King] was very much with it and capable, I couldn't imagine how we would function without his involvement and leadership, because the way he would work was all just in his head. \u2014 Billy King To me, designing a yoga class is a creative opportunity, drawing on the students' ability and interest, my personal interests, the cultural milieu at the time, and that great creative mystery. \u2014Ca thy King The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 73 For my dad, it would have been too difficult because he kept so much with his work in his head that it was a distraction to have other people hanging around, needing direction. The only people he could work with were his sons. Cathy King: I think the other thing Billy did right away is he spent some money and bought two big tractors? Billy King: One big tractor... Cathy King: And another newer one, right? Billy King: Yeah. The next year. Cathy King: And put in some irrigation. I just feel like Ken sort of functioned from those lean years when we had nothing and everything was just bobby pins and string, you know, just tied together. We were not in debt, but we were not that efficient either. We needed to make some investments. Kenny King: Our dad was such an energetic person and he wasn't ready to go. He was the driving force on the farm and he made the tough decisions as long as he could\u2014working non-stop most of the time. We were caught off guard and found ourselves doing what we could to adapt as his health deteriorated. Fortunately, Billy had learned a lot about farm equipment, Edwin was doing the greenhouse starts, I had a knack for records, and our mom knew the rest. The time of his passing marked the start of a new phase for Frog Holler\u2014the festival was just beginning to take off and we started to bring in more people as farm interns and festival volunteers. The community expanded and became more multigenerational, so we had a lot to keep us busy. Our dad had the vision for this farm and the determination to make it happen, along with our mom and very few others. We have taken that foundation and expanded it, made it more efficient and a bit easier. His approach was one of sheer will, rather than careful planning, and he had a very personal style that few could follow. He kept track of everything in his head, worked with unreliable equipment, and did a disproportionate amount of the labor himself\u2014so we quickly realized that we had to update some of the tools and techniques in order to continue. He had a big pr esence at the market and our customers miss him. They often tell me that he was the one that helped them start gardening, or eating more healthfully, or talked with them about the concerns facing our society. He was known for being really generous with his time and inventory which established trust and goodwill that continues to this day. On a personal level, the death of those close to me is something that I imagined in the distant future\u2014until it became immediate. I often wonder what it would be like if he was still around, and what he would think if he could see the farm now\u2014similar, but different from how he left it. As his passing grew imminent the question, \"how could we continue without him?\" became \"how could we not?\" We had market two days after his death and it seemed like the natural place to be. Billy King: I think over time we would be reminded of this major change. There were obviously times that were very sad. I think the thing I've missed the most was his music, his passion for music and having that inspiration, the backdrop of that inspiration. I sometimes still don't know where I find that now. It's not something I could replace. *** Wednesdays & Saturdays Ann Arbor Farmers Market - 315 Detroit Street Pre-order and curbside pickup available www.froghollerorganic.com Organic produce June - October Organic plant starts April - June Sandor Slomovits: How has the pandemic affected you? Billy King: You know, being out where we are, we don't feel it as much. The work has not been less. In fact, the demand for food has just increased across the board in our circle of small farms. We've been very, very busy with farm related work and finding ways to get the food to people. That was very uncertain at the beginning [of the pandemic] and has worked out via online delivery and pre-orders, and now the farmers market, as well as our CSA. Kenny King: On a daily basis it's kind of life as usual. We try not to have as many people coming to the farm as in a normal year; maybe not quite as many interns or volunteers, but we still had a small number. The big effect of Covid that I have felt is being reminded of the importance of local, nutritious, and consciously grown food in our community. We were happy to be able to provide online ordering and contact-free delivery\u2014that felt like very essential services under these circumstances. In particular, delivering garden plants to customers' doorsteps; we knew that we were helping to provide food for the whole year\u2014a great feeling! We aren't alone. I see other farms developing innovative ways to provide food under these tough conditions. Ann Arbor values good food and gladly supports their food growers, and this crisis has reaffirmed that. Edwin King: We had to get more tech savvy very quickly, which Emily was really helpful with. Emily Foley and Edwin have been together for nine years, since she interned at Frog Holler in 2011. Before that she had gone to school at the U-M and, while in Ann Arbor, had volunteered and interned at the Community Farm, and also worked at Zingerman's, before beginning a job in the film industry. She was living in Brooklyn, New York and jokes that she liked the idea of moving to Brooklyn, Michigan. She now works largely from home but, as Head of Development for Hear/Say Productions, also frequently on location for about eight months at a time, helping to shepherd film projects from the idea stage to reality. Emily Foley: When the pandemic hit, I was in Canada, scouting for an upcoming film that was supposed to hopefully go this past summer, filmed in Canada, which of course did not happen. So, we dropped everything, left early, and I came back here. A week later we had the farm's website up and all of the plants online and started selling shortly thereafter. I went from film production to farm pandemic response. For a fairly straightforward operation like this, there were still, what, a hundred varieties that we have. So, doing all that, going from a hundred percent face to face sales to a hundred percent online sales was a big transition right at the beginning of spring. Edwin King and Emily Foley Continued on page 74The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 74 Cathy King: We started with the seedlings because there was a pretty big demand for gardening and the Farmers Market was not open. Emily Foley: It was actually kind of nice because we had about two weeks, we had a little bit of time before the plants were ready to go. It wasn't like other businesses where they had to be figuring it out on the fly, like grocery stores that stayed open through the pandemic and were also trying to figure it out. We did have a little buffer time to get organized. Edwin King: Our day-to-day life changed much less than a lot of people's. Then, as the market opened back up, things gradually started to feel more normal, though with fewer faces. Emily Foley: And less portions of faces, too. (Laughter) Sandor Slomovits: Right, because of the masks. Kenny King: When the pandemic hit, the farmers market shut down for a month or so, and we were about to start going to market with spring plant starts and we didn't exactly know what was going to happen. The market didn't really come back until pretty much after the plant season was through, so we really needed to adapt. And we did successfully have a plant season, everyone that wanted plants got them and we were able to sell most of the plants that we'd already planted, so it worked out, but it was a lot of adjusting. People could pick their orders up at the farm, or they could have those orders delivered. Cathy King: We've continued that because it was very popular to have curbside pickup at the market. People who order from us online can just go to this curbside option at the farmers market and not have to park or anything, just pull in, get their order, and leave. That's continued to be a very useful option for a number of people. We're also doing some deliveries which, again, we were just meeting the need at the time when people were very uncertain if they wanted to go anywhere, if they should go anywhere, but they knew they needed food. We're continuing that on a smaller basis, because it's still helpful for a number of people. Sandor Slomovits: Do you deliver mostly to people close by, or do you come to Ann Arbor? Cathy King: They're pretty much all in Ann Arbor. We come to the market, then we go do deliveries. When Covid happened we saw how important it was for people to have access to locally grown food and the challenges of in-person sales, so we brought the CSA back and have more members than ever\u2014over 100\u2014who can pick up their box of produce without contact here at the farm, or at the market, or delivered to their door. The deliv ery aspect was new due to Covid and we give Emily kudos for anticipating the need and setting up the online ordering site. In the early spring, when the farmers market and other garden centers were closed, we made hundreds of plant start deliveries to Ann Arbor households. On our first farm pickup day we had almost a hundred folks come out to the farm to get their seedlings\u2014despite snow the day before. We transformed one of our hoop houses into a \"Plantazon\" fulfillment center and packed thousands of seedlings for delivery, farm pickup, and eventually curbside pickup at the Market. Everything was so uncertain, but we are grateful for the \"pivots\" we were able to make, for our customer's determination to get good food, and for Mother Nature who quietly went about her business of seasonal renewal and growth. Sandor Slomovits: What about Holler Fest, how was it to have to cancel this year? Was it in some ways a relief?Billy King: It was definitely kind of surreal. Around the time of the festival we just kept thinking about what we would normally be doing in early to mid-August, in terms of getting ready, and realizing that we didn't have to do any of that and trying to imagine how we did it before. Especially this year, with all of the demand, and the different avenues we've been maintaining with produce distribution, it's just felt like it would have been impossible. Kenny King: When we realized that it wasn't going to be happening, everything just filled in the space that that would have taken. It happens at a time in the year when we don't have time for it in the first place. (Laughter) I don't know if we've really processed the fact that we didn't have Holler Fest. And though we didn't have a lot of anxiety about the decision because there was really no way to even consider it, I think we need to process it a bit more because we still don't know what the situation is going to be like next year. Edwin King: I think we all missed it, but at the same time when you don't do something like that, you wonder how you ever had the time or the energy to do it The King Family When Covid happened, we saw how important it was for people to have access to locally grown food. \u2014Ca thy King Continued from page 73 because it felt like we were just as busy as we normally are without this massive undertaking. Emily Foley: It also made me wonder how Edwin keeps the farm running in normal years because we were all so busy with farm stuff this year. Cathy King: It was obviously the right decision. We were comfortable with making it, but I think we, and maybe people who are connected to Holler Fest, felt it that week. It felt like something was missing, there were so many kind comments on Facebook. It pulled at my heartstrings, but also, I felt physically not able to do anything like that,{we were] just doing all we could do growing food. Continued on page 78The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 75 Cathy King, Cinder (dog), Emily Foley, and Kenny, Billy and Edwin King. Edwin KingEmily Foley & Freya Cathy King Kenny KingBilly KingThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 76 In the late 1980s, when Billy and Kenny began playing in public and recording, the King family started hosting occasional informal open mics on their front porch, and later in their barn. Holler Fest primarily presents Michigan performers and has arguably the most beautiful natural setting and the best food of any music festival. For many in Southeast Michigan, musicians and music fans alike, it's become a cherished annual goodbye-to-summer tradition. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 77 ... All of the hundreds of Holler Fest volunteers\u2014 many who have now graduated to staff\u2014and who come back every year to give up a lot of time being at the festival to instead be in the festival. There are too many to mention but believe me, we all know that we wouldn't be here today answering questions about how awesome we are if we didn't have hundreds and hundreds of folks supporting our crazy ideas. \u2014 Ca thy King The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 78 Sandor Slomovits: Have you expanded the amount of food you're growing? Or is it that you're busier delivering the food? Billy King: A little of both. I think we're growing about as much as we can with our limited growing area. Since we didn't do Holler Fest, we didn't have to reserve the field back there for parking. So, I was able to plant more later crops in that area. We tried to expand a little, due to the demand, but there's only so much we can do. Sandor Slomovits: How did all of you, Billy, Kenny, Edwin, and Emily decide that you were going to stay here and build your life around all this? Billy King: I never went through too much thought or confusion about that. When I was younger, I was very fixated on the music and very much believing and imagining reaching some level of stardom. When I was playing with my brother at the age of 10, 11, 12, 13, the dream of making it big was always there. (Laughter) But then I started to see some of the downsides of that and became less fixated on that aspect of doing music. Once I stopped fixating on having music be... my life, I started feeling like I liked being on the farm where I had freedom to do music and also there was work readily available to me. I always felt like I had freedom, if I decided I wanted to do something different, I could. Kenny King: I never really decided. I still haven't decided. My dad would have said the same thing. He'd say I haven't decided that thing. I don't know how long I'm going to do this. I have other things that I plan to do. I guess there's enough here to keep us going and keep it interesting. And, it feels valuable, I guess that would be the answer for why I've stayed here so long. Going to college, I guess, I wanted to just see how I would do, see if I could do that. I felt like there was something that might be missing, so I went and tried to cover those bases, have that experience. And I did, and I had a graphic design job, a sort of corporate type environment. I felt like I got some of that experience and got the question answered as to whether I could do that, but I didn't continue. It didn't feel like that was it. I still wanted to keep farming and doing other things. I didn't want to just go into the corporate world and stay there forever. I doubt I would have become a farmer if I had any other upbringing. But, as time goes by, I see myself as a steward of this land, this farm operation, and the festival where our community gathers. Capitalism doesn't guarantee the existence of small organic farms or small festivals, so I'm motivated by the belief that these things matter. At the very least they matter a lot to those that shop with us and come to the fest. Also, Frog Holler is more nature sanctuary than it is farmland\u2014we farm just a few of our 120 acres, so an important reason to be here is to help keep it that way.Edwin King: It didn't really feel like a decision so to speak. I think in a sense I'm still deciding. I've never had a moment like, okay, this is it for good, forever. I'm here. This has been good for now, and I don't need to look for anything else. I don't want to close the door, you know, don't want to be pigeon-holed in one profession or one interest. Sandor Slomovits: Would you all talk a bit about the future. Billy King: [The 2019] festival went really well. We were planning on building on that momentum and we had a great lineup [for 2020]. I've always been very humbled by the lineup that we were able to put together. But 2020 was expanding on that and bringing some new people in. We were excited about that. We also have this newly renovated barn, which is now a four-season space for whatever use we find for it; shows, movies, yoga, recording. We were excited about exploring that. And there's always the general challenge with the work of the farm and how we keep improving our techniques; that's always in the mix of our thinking. Now [since the pandemic] I don't know. We're just waiting to see how this plays out. We're doing what we can on a very, very small scale in terms of maintaining those ideas. The King Family Continued from page 74 Cathy King: It's wonderful when people come out. We're not that far from Ann Arbor, but it seems like we're far, yet once you get here, you've gotten away. Billy King: We've already had more than a few inquiries about weddings. There was one scheduled that got postponed because of Covid. Cathy King: But we'd only do funky weddings. (Laughter) When I was playing with my brother at the age of 10, 11, 12, 13, the dream of making it big was always there. (Laughter) But then I started to see some of the downsides of that and became less fixated on that aspect of doing music. \u2014Billy King When the pandemic hit, I was in Canada, scouting for an upcoming film... which of course did not happen. So, we dropped everything, left early, and I came back here. A week later we had the farm's website up and all of the plants online and started selling shortly thereafter. I went from film production to farm pandemic response. For a fairly, straightforward operation like this, there were still, what, a hundred varieties that we have. \u2014Emily F oley Cathy King: I think Billy said that really well. Holler Fest, it's kind of hard to describe the breadth of it, the number of people that we've somehow drawn into the circle and have bonded through creating that together. So, we were looking to continue developing that in service to the community. To me, it's beyond our decision anymore\u2014except for now, of course\u2014it is a service we provide. I think that the land is sort of a landscape for us. This is something that I think Ken wanted to do. He didn't have time to do everything he wanted to do. We're really just in service to the land and to the beauty here. That's what we talk about, how we can make it more functional. I have an interest in flowers and beautifying that way\u2014not that it needs anything extra. The palette of the land is an ongoing, infinite practice. Billy King: We're trying to work with it as much as we can because it's not really farmland, it's rolling hills and woods. I know in the early days when (he addresses Cathy) you had somebody come and consult about buying the land and said, 'What's the best use for this land' and they said 'recreation,' basically golf course or something. (Laughter) The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 79 The Two Frog Hollers Cathy King writes: We added the \"Farm\" to Frog Holler because of confusion with the produce wholesalers in Ann Arbor also named Frog Holler. Rick Peshkin was part of the early group that owned and ran Indian Summer and also bought the Frog Holler land. Rick's affinity turned out to be wholesaling and distributing and he bought produce, cheese, and nuts from Eastern Market and the Detroit Terminal for a lot of the early alternative restaurants: Eden Deli, Seva, the Del Rio, Indian Summer. He got busy with this and called his operation Frog Holler to differentiate from Indian Summer and because the group had started an entity called Frog Holler Ltd. to purchase the farm. When Rick got so busy that he completely separated from the Indian Summer group, his business was already well-established under the Frog Holler name. So, he wanted to keep it. I suppose we could have challenged it, but we weren't inclined along those lines. We have stayed on good terms. Rick has been retired for some time and sold Frog Holler Produce to a wholesaler based in Grand Rapids. Wha t has bothered us a bit is that folks think we have a big trucking operation in addition to our farm stall. The Frog Holler Produce trucks are very visible around Ann Arbor so it's understandable. Somebody said to me recently, 'I get so happy when I see one of those Frog Holler trucks go by, because then I think about you guys on the farm'. And I feel bad because I have to say, 'Well, actually...'. We added the disclaimer [explaining this history] on the home page of our web site and on Facebook when, at the start of the lockdown, Frog Holler Produce started offering \"CSA\" boxes\u2014then it got really confusing. \"We have no bad relations with them at all,\" says Billy. \"It's just, you know, what do you do? We've thought about slightly altering our name, but that would just be confusing to people too, like, 'Where did Frog Holler go?'\" These days things are more uncertain than ever, but I feel like there's always some degree of that, so I try not to plan on anything too definite. That being said, things haven't changed very much for the past 15, 20 years, so maybe I should learn from the past and assume that the same will be true in the future. \u2014E dwin KingContinued on page 80 Where Do We Distribute The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal? 11,000 copies of The Crazy Wisd om Community Journal are distributed to more than 235 locations in the Ann Arbor area, including Crazy Wisdom Bookstore, Whole Food s, Castle Remedies at the Parkway Center, the F ood Co-op, Kerrytown, Nicola's, the Zen Temple, Sweetwaters, Pharmacy Solutions, Michigan Union, the Better Health Store, North Campus Commons, U-M, EMU, wee, Arbor Farms, the Center for Sacred Living, Complete Chiropractic, the Lotus Center, the Lighthouse Center, Jewel Heart, Tsogyelgar, Y oga Space, Michigan Theater, Seva, Clark Pharmacy, the Dakota Building and the Weber Center.

Unearth Something Amazing The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 80 The King Family Cathy King: I've been thinking about that. We are also offering recreation. Sandor Slomovits: Yeah! You sure are. Billy King: They were thinking campground, and now we have a once a year campground, and that's something that we might be able, as the infrastructure is in place more and more, to rent it out, or have other events that we don't have to be involved in necessarily. Cathy King: It's wonderful when people come out. We're not that far from Ann Arbor, but it seems like we're far, yet once you get here, you've gotten away.Billy King: We've already had more than a few inquiries about weddings. There was one scheduled that got postponed because of Covid. Cathy King: But we'd only do funky weddings. (Laughter) Billy King: Right. It's gotta be funky. Edwin King: I feel like I very rarely think that far into the future. Every year is exhausting but rewarding in its own way. Then you have a moment when you're like, well, I really want to take some time off. Then by the next spring, you're like, well, let's try it again. These days things are more uncertain than ever, but I feel like there's always some degree of that, so I try not to plan on anything too definite. That being said, things haven't changed very much for the past 15, 20 years, so maybe I should learn from the past and assume that the same will be true in the future. Emily Foley: I call the farm home now and it's always really nice coming back here, having stability, a piece of land that I love so much, having that as a place that I can return to, also going out on these adventures [for my other work] and be able to take more risks. It is a very speculative business (the film industry), in the sense that, especially with the development work that I do, you put in a lot of time and energy into projects that may or may not ever happen. I feel very grateful to have this grounding presence in my life. Not all of it is in my control obviously, but I do hope that both these parts of my life continue to develop and evolve. I feel so very grateful to have found some semblance of balance between my professional life and my home life. *** As I was finishing this article Cathy sent me an email in which she wanted to be sure we gave her family an opportunity to acknowledge all the help and support they have received over the years, \"Some sort of shoutout to the myriad folks who have helped to establish the King family brand!\" she wrote (adding a smiley face :-). Then she continued, \"I thought about this when I was picking beans (my meditation zendo :-). And she went on: Cathy King: From quizzical parents who scratched their heads but still loaned us some money in those early days of living like pioneers in the stone cabin, to the many young people over the years who have given us their energy and muscle on the farm, to the extremely loyal customers who keep coming to the market, many have become friends as well as customers, to our neighbors, the Coynes, who 'got' what we were doing right away and gave us positive support and money, and Tom Hines next door, who builds the bonfires at Holler Fest but also, as a retired construction contractor, was (and still is) our partner in crime building much of the Holler Fest infrastructure and road management, to Tom Huber, another builder responsible for some big projects (the kitchen!) and some invisible (who, along with Tom Hines helped us move from electrical cords laying all over the ground to buried wires), all of the hundreds of Holler Fest volunteers\u2014many who have now graduated to staff\u2014and who come back every year to give up a lot of time being at the festival to instead be in the festival. There are too many to mention but believe me, we all know that we wouldn't be here today answering questions about how awesome we are if we didn't have hundreds and hundreds of folks supporting our crazy ideas. I do hope that the farm and festival can continue to be a crucible for folks to find their creative path. We see it happening with former interns who now have their own farms, and Holler Fest staff who have grown in the skills and interests they bring. We don't 'train', we don't really 'instruct'. [Just] as we did with our homeschooling approach, we provide a beautiful (and hopefully inspiring) setting, provide support and resources where we can, and stand back and let the creative juices flow! ###As time goes by, I see myself as a steward of this land, this farm operation, and the festival where our community gathers.

Everyday Compassion with Susan Billmaier and Special Guest Brad Vanlandingham. (Karma Jinpa Tarchen) June 6, 13 10:00 a.m. Compassion literally means to suffer together. It is a concern for the well-being of others; it is our capacity to be open to the reality of suffering and to aspire to its healing. Compassion is similar to other types of emotional understanding such as empathy (a vicarious experience of another person's emotion); altruism (a principle of devotion to the welfare of others); and benevolence (a desire to do good or promote the happiness of others through kindness and generosity). This class teaches tools to increase capacity for compassion by making it tangible and concrete within everyday situations and relationships. This skill increases personal emotional resiliency and fortitude, which can then be used to increase the quality of compassion in relationship with other people. $54.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 89 By Lisa Teets I had been suffering from neck and shoulder pain for many years due to a car accident. Although weekly chiropractic and massage helped, my problems never fully resolved. Over the years I tried many healing modalities with no lasting relief until a friend suggested I try Bowenwork. I found a practitioner and gave it a try. Since I was used to vigorous massages, I was surprised with how little force was used with Bowenwork. After the second session, I started noticing some wonderful changes. Eventually, my neck and shoulder issues resolved, as well as other issues that I had not communicated to my practitioner. Bowenwork can provide relief for many types of injuries and health problems, both acute and chronic, and it does so holistically, via the body's innate healing mechanisms. It offers tremendous benefit to clients by using a dynamic system of muscle and connective tissue therapy that stimulates the body to heal itself, often profoundly. The Bowenwork delivers signals to the nervous system at specific locations (on muscles, tendons, ligaments, or nerves), and the body responds in its own time, sometimes for days after a session. Bowenwork is appropriate for people of all ages, in all degrees of health. I usually find myself working with clients whose conditions have developed gradually over many years, when patterns of dysfunctional muscle recruitment and posture have become entrenched over time. Bowenwork uses a \"whole-body\" approach to facilitate optimal alignment and recovery. Rather than focusing on a single complaint, I address the entire body, by restoring balance via the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS controls over 80% of bodily functions and is very susceptible to external stressors. Most people today, even children, live in a constant state of high stress, overstimulation (fight, flight, or freeze mode). Healing can occur only after the ANS shifts from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance (rest, relax, and repair mode). Bowenwork enables that shift. During a session, the client often drops into deep relaxation, indicative of a profound release from stress and a shift toward parasympathetic influence. This shift could explain, in part, the common observation that a Bowenwork session seems to reactivate the recovery process in situations where healing from trauma, sickness or surgery has stalled or reached a plateau. Clients usually lie on a massage table or may be seated in a chair. A 20 to 60-minute session involves one or more procedures, each of which consists of several sets of moves. The moves are gentle, but purposeful, and can be done through light clothing. I use my fingers and thumbs to make gentle rolling moves over soft tissue (muscles, ligaments, tendons, nerves, fascia). There are absolutely no harsh manipulations or adjustments, in fact, people are usually amazed at how something so gentle can be so powerful. I address the body as a whole, respecting the fact that the body knows how to heal itself given the right cues. A unique aspect of Bowenwork is the frequent pauses where I give the body & brain time to integrate, process & respond to the information it just received. Between each set of moves, I incorporate pauses for as many minutes as are needed for the client's body to begin responding. As the nervous system begins to adjust the tension level in the muscles, I can sense when the client is ready for the next set of moves. This differs greatly from other therapies where there is constant stimuli, sometimes too much for the brain to process in an effective manner. It's important to understand that Bowenwork is not a cure for any ailment. Instead, it activates the body's own healing abilities. It has been found through experience and research that Bowenwork has assisted people with the following health complaints: digestive, urinary, respiratory, balance and reproductive issues, back, knee, pelvic, shoulder, pinched nerve and neck pain, scoliosis, tinnitus, TMJ, migraine, PTSD, sciatica, and restless leg syndrome, frozen shoulder, chronic fatigue syndrome, and many more. Bowenwork can have a profound effect on children and babies too. It can help to relieve colic, latch, bed wetting, ADD, and more. Babies can be held in your arms during a five to 20-minute session and children can move about if needed. It is very gentle, and most children really look forward to the sessions. Lisa Teets offers Bowenwork4Kids as a way to introduce families to the work. She runs Bowenwork4Kids on the 3rd Sunday of the month by appointment near downtown Ypsilanti.

Contact Carol at carol@crazywisdom.net The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2021 Page 92 By Michael Oliver As I embarked on my journey into 2020, I found my fellow human beings becoming increasingly angry, fearful, and distrustful of each other. I asked myself this question, \"Is this who we really are?\" It felt like the negative and dark energy hiding in the shadows finally found a doorway. So many triggers appeared, and they would consistently attempt to flip the switches of light, to darkness. At times it felt terribly dark and other times, it felt like light was returning. It is a battle that continues today, but is not a new battle; it is a different battle. What is different about this battle, you may ask? Awareness! Yes, we are more aware of what was lurking in the darkness than we were in the past. Humans are waking up! And it is in that process of waking up that we are learning to acknowledge the ways of the past that have been damaging to our species and limiting our growth toward living a life of love and joy. For me, 2020 triggered a deep and self-reflective time. I kept pondering over what I could do to make life for humanity better, and I came up with the Share the Hearts Campaign. The Share the Hearts Campaign was inspired by Dr. Kenneth McCulley who founded a human potential development program which included a poem titled I Live Love Every Moment of My Life . In that poem, Dr. McCulley's primary message was to wake people up to the reality that we all come from the same source and as such, we are all brothers and sisters, one and the same. It was Dr. McCulley's dream that all humans demonstrate, unconditionally, Living Love\u2014performing acts of kindness for their fellow human beings. Motivated by the energy and effort of Dr. McCulley, our team wanted to build a campaign that would operationalize that message to the world. Sharing a simple wooden heart can make a difference! Every act of kindness, thoughtfulness, caring, and copassion, is an act of living a life of love\u2014as the Beatles once sang, \"All We Need is Love.\" True! What a difference love can make. Mindtation, a small start-up company, is on a mission to help people find their paths of joy, because when people are living their joy, they live a life that is aligned with who they truly are, living in and experiencing positive synchronicities. We decided that we wanted to do something fun, yet meaningful, to engage people back into love consciousness and help them along with aligning with their true selves. Along with teaching the power of meditation, the breath, mindfulness, intuition and sound, we are initiating the Share the Hearts campaign to help spread loving kindness. Wondering how it works? Small packets of wooden hearts are purchased from our website and then you can give them to people you \"catch\" doing acts of loving kindness. In the packet, there is a heart and a card explaining the purpose of this event. Each one of us will be the eyes of the change we want to see. This act, this awareness, plants the seed of love and kindness into one's consciousness\u2014making it grow each time it is acknowledged within someone else. Each time a wooden heart is given for an act of kindness, it reinforces love and kindness within yourself (the giver) as well as expanding the consciousness of love in others (the receivers). A t the deepest level, we are all one and the same. As Peter Yarrow said, \"There is only one river. There is only one sea. And it flows through you, and it flows through me. There is only one people. We are one and the same.\" The kick-off for Mindtation's Sharing the Hearts Campaign took place on April 9 th, 2021. To kick -off the event, Mindtation presented a video providing an overview of what it means to live in joy and love\u2014especially during stressful times and the many benefits that it can bring. The purpose of this campaign is to bring us back to loving kindness and mindfulness...bring us back to awareness of our own humanity. Let's re-learn how to respond to all situations with love. The goal is to put the intention of Living Love, our Truth, back into the world. If you are in terested in this campaign and would like to learn more, please visit Sharethehearts.com. A percentage of all heart package purchases will be donated to select charities.

Catholicity in an Evolving Global Church with Massimo Faggioli, PhD Thursday, June 10 7:00 p.m. Pope Francis' pontificate represents a threshold: there is a liminality to Francis's papacy that opens Catholicism toward a new sense of the global dimension. This started with his very election in the conclave of 2013 and symbolizes the entire pontificate and its meaning for global Catholicism. This new phase toward a new relationship between Catholicism and globalization means a new comprehension of the geography of the Church, of the relationship with different religious traditions, and civil coexistence in one human family.

This is what practitioners like Juli Johnson offer\u2014options that coexist with traditional medicine, using basic, natural, and non-invasive methods to restore a body back to health. What better way to discover all the phenomenal, innovative, and effective treatment options and services Johnson offers, than to ask Johnson herself! When entering her office, you're immediately met with a serene and peaceful atmosphere, filled with the faint smells of herbal aromas. One of my favorite treats is when she willingly brings in her fur baby Frankie, a beautiful black and white Newfoundland, to sit in on my appointments. Since my pup passed away, he is part of my treatment and loves the hugs and petting. Johnson brings Frankie in only upon request. I sit down to interview Johnson and learn more about her and what the Back to Basics Health and Nutrition experience offers. When asked about her background, Johnson responds, \"I've been in the natural health field for 18 years and began my journey as a practical nurse in cardiology and internal medicine. After struggling with multiple health issues and getting nowhere fast, a series of serendipitous events led me away from the allopathic world and into a new career as a certified massage therapist. It was then I met a young man who was struggling to overcome the effects of chemotherapy. He was on a quest to learn more about healing with nutrition. I stayed with massage therapy for a short while, but my interest turned to other natural healing modalities rather quickly.\" Desiring further education, Johnson completed her ACNC (Advanced Certified Nutritional Counselor) and ND (Naturopathic Doctor) programs through Trinity School of Natural Health. Johnson worked hard and is proud of her full-time holistic health practice in South Lyon specializing in nutrition, detoxification, mineral balancing, and emotional healing. She enjoys teaching on multiple health topics and regularly speaks for local and national health systems. Johnson Back to Basic Health With Juli Johnson This was my case just four years ago. So, what do you do when your traditional medical team delivers this type of optionless news? Everyone is dealing with some type of toxic overload. Even if you feel good, there are toxins at work and they will eventually show up.After struggling with multiple health issues and getting nowhere fast, a series of serendipitous events led me away from the allopathic world and into a new career as a certified massage therapist... I stayed with massage therapy for a short while, but my interest turned to other natural healing modalities rather quickly. -Juli Johnson By Chris Watkins Imagine receiving results from an air quality and blood test showing that your home needs remediation\u2014and so does your body. There were astronomical levels of mold and fungus in your blood. You suffered from pneumonia and had so many x-rays taken that you almost glowed in the dark. The medications prescribed were barely treating the symptoms but were further depleting your already near-extinct immune system. Your doctors finally admit that they have no effective options for your condition; their final suggestion was to wait and see if your body began to win the fight on its own. This was my case just four years ago. So, what do you do when your traditional medical team delivers this type of optionless news? One thing working in my favor was my chiropractor, Dr. Siiri Krygowski. Witnessing firsthand my breathing episodes during an appointment, she recommended a visit with holistic practitioner, Juli Johnson, and shared the amazing results from her own personal experiences. At my first appointment with Johnson, she performed a non-invasive scan using ZYTO technology. This is a method of measuring energy along the meridians\u2014energy pathways in our body. According to the principles of Chinese medicine, we have 14 meridians, and each is associated with an organ in the body. The scan creates a profile of your body's out of balance conditions. From those results, she prescribed some lifestyle changes and supplements to correct the imbalance. To date, I haven't experienced another coughing episode. It's been four years and counting. At my follow up pulmonary appointment, my doctor was amazed at the cleared condition. He noted my variety of treatments to pass on to other patients. There were other things I did that also had a definite impact on my healing, but the impact of the services from Johnson were key to bringing all the pieces together for my recovery. has also held screening and educational sessions using a basic ZYTO test for willing customers in local Better Health Stores. This gives the customer a very basic understanding of what they may benefit from regarding their needs for nutrients. With ever-increasing information and developments in the world of health, nutrition, and medical maladies, how does Johnson maintain her edge? She says that she has had lots of other training and keeps up with new modalities, or she refines the ones she currently uses by attending seminars and conferences on a regular basis. Johnson specializes in detoxification for mind, body, and spirit. Detoxification wasn't her first thought when she started in the natural health world, even though that's what she focused on for her own health recovery. Everyone is dealing with some type of toxic overload. Even if you feel good, there are toxins at work and they will eventually show up. After learning about the most effective ways of detoxification, Johnson started to incorporate them into her business. The ZYTO technology offers a method of measuring the body's energy flow. Energy changes before chemistry. ZYTO Biocommunication Testing (electro-dermal screening) creates a profile of your entire system, which includes your body's out of balance conditions or reactions in seven key areas. Foods for Wellness scans, EVOX (which is perception reframing), and Allergy testing are other popular scans that Johnson performs, but there is so much more offered. A complete list of services is on Johnson's website which includes links that give a brief description of all testing methods used, as well as her office hours. Johnson currently has three other practitioners working with her who provide a variety of services. Colon hydrotherapy, and the near infrared sauna, are popular services. Back to Basics holds classes on: making tinctures (concentrated herbal extracts), teas, crystals, weight loss, and general health principles, and they offer wellness days that feature make and take gifts, foot detoxes, foods for wellness scans, astrology and intuitive readings, crystal readings, chakra balancing, and more. When someone c omes in to see Johnson, she/he receives one hour of her undivided attention and they go over all of that client's concerns. She scans to find out which organs are in need of support, and depending on what the situation is, the client will get a recommendation for one or more methods of detox, and recommendations for nutritional support. She also provides a gift of a Bach flower remedy combination specific to the person. Johnson says, \"Everyone is unique and has individual needs. Some respond well with herbs and tinctures, some with nutrients, some with homeopathy. I support the mind, body, and spirit of each of my clients. They get an education when they come to see me!\" For more information about services provided by Back to Basics, contact Juli Johnson at 248-921.0586 or visit her website, back2ba-sicshealth.com.

It is a journey into the heart of self-expression, free from competition and comparison. I was 43 years old when I took my first art class at Eastern Michigan University. Brush in hand, I had this feeling of inner fulfillment and joy. I was fortunate, abstraction was accepted, and I painted on a large canvas on the floor. I decided after that experience, to take a drawing class. Most of my own paintings are abstract but with something recognizable within it. In some of my artworks, I like to add a word or a phrase to the surface of the work. At times, the word comes as a spontaneous reaction to the canvas or paper I've painted on, or I open pages of a book that I've been reading or have formed an attachment to. I'll read for a phrase that makes a visceral connection to my work. I usually do not form a title to a work until I am midway into my process. One painting I called \"My cup of Ocean\" and I wrote that freely on the artwork. It was based on a conversation with a friend, both of us dreaming about wanting to move near the ocean. I painted \"My cup of Ocean\" on a large canvas with dark blue background. Once I painted a very large canvas of a Yam and wrote on the canvas \"What makes a Yam Beautiful.\" I saw a variation of these words under a small photograph in an article about Chanel titled \"What makes a Woman Beautiful.\" A yam visually reminds me of a curvy figure, as a sculptured object. The muted orange color is exquisite. The threads go in different directions. A yam is strong despite its bruises\u2014whether from mishandling or growing under the ground. I love to touch the yams as I pick them out, large in the center tapering off at the ends. Of course, the bonus is its sweet taste. My paintings are \"freedom\" for me. My process has become something like magic as I intuitively use my \"senses\" to paint. When I am teaching, I offer my students techniques within exercises that broaden their awareness of their own capacity to do \"art,\" and to acknowledge the importance of finding and accepting one's own approach in the vast \"vocabulary\" of the art world of today. I have been teaching a visual journaling workshop for the last 23 years. It is designed to open new paths to communicate experiences and encourage self-expression through both imagery and words. Students work with sound, color, memory, poetry, music, and mythology in exercises and projects that help expand creative thinking. We emphasize process over product and have five core tenets: Everyone is welcome regardless of experience, every student has something to say, consider everything as an experiment, we learn from each other, ideas are welcomed, there is no right or wrong, and exploration is valued.
