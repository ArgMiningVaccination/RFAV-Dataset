UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Introduction to UCI The University of California David Pierpont Gardner President The University of California was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first decades, the University's development was strongly influ\u00ad enced by leading educators and scholars from various parts of the country. Supported by the State and many generous benefactors, the University was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward emi\u00ad nence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes nine campuses\u00ad Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. All of the campuses adhere to the same admissions guidelines and high academic standards, yet each one has its own distinct character. Among the campuses there are five medical schools, three law schools, and a school of veterinary medi\u00ad cine, as well as professional schools of business administra\u00ad tion, education, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The University's libraries are among the finest in the United States; the collections of the more than 100 Univer\u00ad sity of California libraries on the nine campuses are sur\u00ad passed in size on the American continent only by the Library of Congress collection. In just over a century, the University has become one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher educa\u00ad tion. The faculty is internationally noted for its distinguished academic achievements. On its nine campuses, the University has a total of IS Nobel laureates. National Academy of Sci\u00ad ence membership on all campuses numbers more than ZOO\u00ad greater than any other college or university system. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, agri\u00ad cultural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 locations throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agricul\u00ad tural and urban populations, and a broad program of continu\u00ad ing education for adults in the arts, business, and professions. Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy and with support from other agencies, the University operates three national research facilities: the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory adjoining the Berkeley campus; the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at Livermore, California; and the Los Alamos National Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Other major research facilities include Lick Observa\u00ad tory, White Mountain Research Station for high-altitude research, Laboratory of Radio Astronomy, Bodega Marine Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Institute of Transportation Studies, Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, Space Sciences Laboratory, Hormone Research Cen\u00ad ter, and Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Cen\u00ad ter, among others. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of Uni\u00ad versity Professors. The University Professor title is reserved for certain distinguished faculty members who are recog\u00ad nized nationally and internationally as scholars and teachers of exceptional ability. A University Professor may visit a number of University of California campuses during the aca\u00ad demic year, holding conferences with students and staff and speaking before general public audiences. A list of University Professors may be found on page 325. University Administration. Under the State Constitution, governance of the University is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the Univer\u00ad sity, and with the President's advice, appoint the Chanceliors, Directors of major laboratories, Provosts, and Deans who administer the affairs of the individual campuses and other divisions of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by The Regents to the Academic Senate, which determines academic policy for the University as a whole. The Board of Regents includes seven ex officio board members, and 20 regular members who are appointed by the Governor for 12-year terms after consultation with an ad\u00ad visory committee. In addition, The Regents appoint a student Regent for a one-year term as a voting Board member with full rights of participation. The chair and vice chair of the Academic Council serve as faculty representatives to the Board and participate fully in all discussions. A constitutional amendment provides that \"Regents shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, cultural, and social diver\u00ad sity of the State, including ethnic minorities and women.\" They shall have \"full powers of organization and govern\u00ad ment, subject only to such legislative controls as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the endowments of the University and the security of its funds.\" The President is executive head of the total institution. Each of the nine campuses has a Chancellor as its chief administra\u00ad tive officer. The Chancellor is responsible for the organiza\u00ad tion and operation of the campus, including academic, stu\u00ad dent, and business affairs. For the names of University Regents, Officers, and Chancellors, see page 324. The Academic Senate, consisting of faculty and certain admin\u00ad istrative officers, determines the conditions for admission and degrees, subject to the approval of The Regents, authorizes and supervises courses and curricula, and advises the Univer\u00ad sity administration on the important matters of faculty appointments and promotions and budgets. Students participate in policymaking at both the campus and Universitywide levels. The Irvine Campus Jack W. Peltason Chancellor The University of California, Irvine has achieved distinction nationally and internationally because of the high quality of its programs, faculty, and alumni. The campus challenges its students both academically and personally and relies on the commitment, curiosity, imagination, and judgment of faculty and students to assure its continued intellectual and cultural vitality. Since the campus opened in 1965, enrollment has grown to approximately 12,600, including 10,200 undergrad\u00ad uate students, 1,400 graduate students, and 1,000 medical students and residents as of fall1984. UCI is committed to the pursuit and transmission of knowl\u00ad edge. It makes available to its students opportunities for gain\u00ad ing knowledge, training, skills, and credentials which in turn can provide the basis for enhanced social and economic opportunities. With regard to making these opportunities available to all students, UCI has the responsibility to estab\u00ad lish and implement programs that go beyond legal minimums to ensure that all qualified segments of the public have access and equal opportunity to participate in the University's aca\u00ad demic programs. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986The Irvine Campus 5 UC IRVINE - 1985-19866 The Irvine Campus Academic Goals The University of California, Irvine offers programs designed to provide students with a foundation on which to continue developing their intellectual, aesthetic, and moral capacities. The programs and curricula are based on the belief that a student's collective University experience should provide understanding and insight which are the basis for an intellec\u00ad tual identity and life-long learning. An important aspect of the educational approach at UCI is the emphasis placed on student involvement in independent study, research, and the creative process as'a complement to classroom study. Independent research in laboratories, field study, involvement in writing workshops, and participation in fine arts productions are normal elements of the UCI expe\u00ad rience. In many departments special programs and courses which involve students in original research and creative activ\u00ad ities are integrated into the curriculum. The Irvine campus provides an atmosphere conducive to creative work and scholarship at all levels, to the exploration of the accumulated knowledge of mankind, and to the devel\u00ad opment of new knowledge through basic and applied research. Along with these objectives, Irvine has a serious commitment to public service. The campus generates research expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and seeks to provide humanistic under\u00ad standing of the problems of society. Academic Structure Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on funda\u00ad mental areas of knowledge, while at the same time provide for interdisciplinary and professional study. Five basic Schools represent five fundamental areas of knowledge: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Programs covering interdisciplinary and profes\u00ad sional studies are offered in the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Program in Social Ecology, the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, and the Office of Teacher Education. The UCI-California Col\u00ad lege of Medicine provides educational programs for medical and health sciences graduate students, medical residents, and practicing physicians. Programs in physical education, recrea\u00ad tion, and intercollegiate athletics are provided by the Department of Physical Education. The Office of Academic Affairs has responsibility for all pro\u00ad grams of instruction and research. It, as well as the Office of Graduate Studies and Research and the Office of Under\u00ad graduate Studies, report directly to the Executive Vice Chan\u00ad cellor. Matters of educational policy, including approval of programs, courses, and grades, are the responsibility of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. The Irvine Division is part of the Academic Senate of the University of California. The Office of the Vice Chancellor Student Affairs provides students with a broad range of special services and programs designed to carry out the University's commitment to create an environment ~upportive of an educational endeavor of the highest quality. Student Affairs programs and services offer students the opportunity to supplement their formal educa\u00ad tional experience by becoming involved in diverse aspects of the University. Such programs and services can broaden the student's University experience by providing opportunities for personal development in addition to intellectual growth. The Dean of Undergraduate Studies provides leadership in developing policies and programs which serve the academic needs of the undergraduate student population and affect the retention of students, including underrepresented and cui-turally diverse student populations. Undergraduate Studies provides administrative oversight for undergraduate academ\u00ad ically related concerns which require campus-level attention and coordination and which do not come under the direct authority of the heads of academic units or the Irvine Divi\u00ad sion of the Academic Senate. Student retention-related ser\u00ad vices include the Program of Academic Support Services (PASS), which involves the coordination of diagnostic/place\u00ad ment testing, student tracking, the Learning Skills Center and Tutorial Assistance Program (TAP), and the Office of Special Services. The Dean is responsible for promoting the development of honors programs and curricula on the cam\u00ad pus and for encouraging and supporting the improvement of teaching and innovation in learning within the UCI com- . munity. Undergraduate Studies holds primary responsibility for advising unaffiliated students and coordinating the Peer Academic Advising Program and works to coordinate and to\u00b7 improve the quality of academic advising for all students. The Dean of Graduate Studies and Research has general administrative responsibility for graduate education and research. In graduate education, the Dean serves as the aca\u00ad demic dean for all graduate students and is responsible for admissions, enrolled student services, graduate student sup\u00ad port, and the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram, which facilitates the involvement of minority students and women in graduate education. In the area of research, the Dean is responsible for research policy development, implementation, and oversight. Accreditation The University of California, Irvine is a member of the West\u00ad ern Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The cam\u00ad pus is fully accredited by the Senior Commission of WASC. This accreditation requires periodic review in accord with WASC policies and standards. In addition, the undergraduate degree program of the Department of Chemistry is accred\u00ad ited by the American Chemical Society; the undergraduate programs offered by the Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Departments are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology; the M.D. program of the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine is accredited by the Liaison Committee of the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association; and the credential programs of the Office of Teacher Education are approved by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, maintains a chapter at UCI. Phi Beta Kappa is the nation's oldest and most prestigious honor society; it recognizes outstanding scholastic achieve\u00ad ment in the liberal arts and sciences. Upper-division students whose undergraduate records fulfill certain requirements are eligible for election to membership. Further information can be obtained from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, 256 Administration Building. Affirmative Action Office The UCI Affirmative Action Office develops and supports programs which promote affirmative action and equal oppor\u00ad tunity in University employment, services, and education for qualified minorities, women, handicapped persons, and Viet\u00ad nam Era veterans. Additionally, the Office implements sys\u00ad tems and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with Titles VI and VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Title IX of the Educational Amendments to the Act. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986The Office is responsible for assuring fair and equal treat\u00ad ment in University admissions policies, educational program' and activities, and in both undergraduate and graduate stu\u00ad dent affirmative action programs. The Office also assists in the coordination of student affirmative action plans. For further information, contact the UCI Affirmative Action Office, 117 Administration Building, (714) 856-5594. Ombudsman The campus Ombudsman is available to assist students, faculty, and staff with any problems or concerns they may encounter while at UCI, including those related to student conduct and discipline (see p. 325). The Ombudsman responds to concerns presented by' campus individuals and group members by clarifying issues or concerns, making appropriate on-and off-campus referrals for student, faculty, and staff members; and providing a confidential, impartial, and informal setting for grievance problem resolution. The Ombudsman is located in 260 Administration Building, tele\u00ad phone(714)856-7256. The Campus Setting UCI's location offers the cultural and economic resources of an urban area along with access to the scenic, recreational areas of Southern California. Located 40 miles south of Los Angeles, five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and nestled in 1,510 acres of coastal foothills near Newport Beach, UCllies amid rapidly growing residential communities and a dynamic national and multinational business and industrial complex that affords many employment opportunities. Even so, the campus remains an oasis of green-a natural arboretum planted with trees and shrubs from all over the world. Adja\u00ad cent to the campus lies UCI's outdoor laboratory, the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which is home to a wide variety of migratory and nonmigratory water fowl and other wildlife. The UCI Medical Center, located in the City of Orange on a 33-acre site, is a major teaching hospital for the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine. Within a few miles of the campus are major department stores; branches of world-renowned boutiques; dozens of outstanding restaurants, many offering cuisines from a vari\u00ad ety of other countries; and major hotels. Cultural opportuni\u00ad ties include repertory theatres, orchestras, choral groups, dance companies, galleries, and museums. The John Wayne Airport is two miles from campus. Yet, in part, the Irvine area retains some of its traditional character as a beach-although not a sleepy-resort. The Portuguese dory fishing fleet at Newport, one of the last private fleets on the West Coast, comes ashore every morn\u00ad ing and evening to sell the day's catch, and the sun and surf crowd mingle with the art and artisan crowd at Laguna Beach during the summer and winter festivals. The temper\u00ad ate, Mediterranean climate stimulates year-round water\u00ad oriented activities such as windsurfing, sailing, and tidepool\u00ad ing. The spring, summer, fall, and winter find students\u00ad many of whom live in the nearby beach communities of Bal\u00ad boa Island, Balboa Peninsula, and Newport Beach-enjoying the warm sun and gentle sea breezes. Boa~ing enthusiasts set sail in Newport Bay in 14-or 30-foot sailboats or in canoes, available from the UCI Sailing Club. Local mountain and desert recreation areas are within easy reach, and the UCI Cooperafive Outdoor Program provides low-cost rental equipment for hiking and skiing, and instruction for other recreational pursuits. The metropolitan attractions of Los Angeles and San Diego are approximately an hour's drive from the campus. The Irvine Campus 7 Bus transportation between the campus and major housing . areas, shopping centers, and beaches is convenient, and bi\u00ad cycling is popular. Both the campus and the surrounding communities are designed to encourage bicycle traffic, and trails connect UCI to many student housing areas and to the waterfront areas of Newport Beach. Instructional and Research Facilities University Library Calvin J. Boyer University Librarian The UCI Library is a component of the extensive University of California Library system, whose libraries contain more than 20 million volumes.

Research The University of California, Irvine is among the leading 75 research universities in the United States. In 1983-84 UCI received more than $41 million from federal and state agen\u00ad cies and private organizations for the support of basic and applied research and for other scholarly activity. One of UCI's goals is to rank among the top 50 research universities in the country by the end of this decade. Research is an in\u00ad tegral part of all schools and departments, and many of UCI's research programs have achieved national and international distinction for their work. The research programs at UCI have a positive impact on both undergraduate and graduate education. Research is critical to graduate education because of the research-oriented nature of doctoral study. At the undergraduate level, research at UC IRVINE - 1985-198610 The Irvine Campus UCI provides undergraduate students with access to a faculty made up of researchers at the forefront of their fields. As a consequence, the knowledge received by UCI students is the latest and most up-to-date available. The Graduate Studies and Research section (see p. 79) describes organized research activities, organizations, and resources. Natural Reserves System The University of California manages and maintains a sys\u00ad tem of 26 land and water reserves that are representative of the State's habitat and geographic diversity. These serve as outdoor laboratories for students, faculty, and staff, and are intended primarily for purposes of education and research. The reserves are administered 1Jy local campus management committees who control their uses. The Irvine campus is responsible for two reserves: the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve and the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve. For addi\u00ad tional information, write to the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, School of Biological Sciences, Univer\u00ad sity of California, Irvine, California 92717, or telephone (714) 856-6006. San Joaquin freshwater Marsh Reserve The San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, one of the last remaining freshwater marshes of Southern California, is a 202-acre reserve adjacent to the Irvine campus. The Marsh consists of a series of freshwater ponds and their attendant aquatic flora and fauna, and is especially known for its rich bird life, both resident and migratory. Researchers and observers have recorded more than 200 species of birds in the Reserve, a major stopping point on the Pacific Flyway. Periodic tours are conducted. For additional information, write to the Museum of Systematic Biology, University of California, Irvine, California 92717, or telephone (714) 856-6031 or 856-6006.

For further information, telephone (714) 856-5139. Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project Financed through private and federal funds, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) Project began in 1972. Project goals are to create the Thesaurus Linguae Grne(lle, a data bank of Greek literature from its Homeric beginnings to approxi\u00ad mately A.D. 600; to conduct literary research using collected texts; and to apply technological innovation in these en\u00ad deavors. TLG research activities combine the traditional con\u00ad cerns and methodologies of philological and literary study with the most advanced features of computer technology. Included among current research foci are the identification of ancient Greek literary and documentary materials from vari\u00ad ous literary-historical periods; the conversion of these mate\u00ad the enhancement of auto\u00ad mated text-verification routines; and the examination of criteria for data-capture of \"nonstandard\" source materials such as nonliterary (e.g., documentary) texts. TLG staff are establishing procedures to facilitate nationwide access to data-bank resources at UCI. The data bank currently contains more than 53 million words of Greek text and is expected to grow to 63 million words. The Project's close ties with the Department of Classics are evidenced by faculty participation in TLG research and TLG support of graduate students. In addition, TLG's library hold\u00ad ings enhance those of the University Library, and TLG\u00ad related conferences and scholarly visits afford faculty and students contacts with eminent classists. The Project has made UCI a major source of classics research activity. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986UCI Medical Center and Community Clinics The UCI Medical Center (UCIMC) is a fully accredited gen\u00ad eral and emergency care hospital located in the City of Orange. UCI-California College of Medicine faculty and resi\u00ad dent physicians are the professional staff for medical services at the Center; a full complement of inpatient and outpatient services in virtually all medical specialties is offered. The Medical Center provides the only designated comprehensive emergency service in Orange County; it is also the desig\u00ad nated Countywide Level I tertiary trauma referral center. The Center serves as a principal facility for teaching andre\u00ad search programs for the UCI-California College of Medicine. Licensed for 493 beds, the Medical Center currently serves 16,300 inpatient admissions, 100,000 outpatient visits, and 42,000 adult and pediatric emergency visits. The availability of advanced technology and the nationally recognized expertise of members of the staff have made UCI Medical Center a regional referral center for the diagnosis and treatment of many medical problems. For example, a recently acquired artificial pancreas for use in the care of dia\u00ad betic patients is one of just a few in the country. One of the nation's major burn centers, and the only one in Orange County, is located at the Medical Center. UCIMC also serves as a center for the surgical replantation of severed limbs. In addition, UCIMC is recognized for its programs for high-risk obstetrical patients and critically ill infants and is the regional perinatal center for Orange County. A major redevelopment program is underway at the Medical Center to provide an enhanced professional, functional, and a more attractive environment for patient care and educational programs. The program includes the renovation of existing buildings, removal of out-dated structures, and construction of new facilities. The recently opened six-level Medical Cen\u00ad ter Tower houses state-of-the-art facilities for diagnostic radiology services, emergency and trauma care, and obstetri\u00ad cal care, as well as private and semiprivate patient rooms. A new medical sciences library opened at the Medical Center in spring 1984, and the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Center opened in winter 1985. Construction is underway on the Diagnostic Services Module which will house facilities for such services as cardiology, dermatology, and pulmonary function. UCI clinical facilities also include the Community Clinic of Orange County (CCOC) in Santa Ana and the North Orange County Community Clinic (NOCCC) in Anaheim. Both clinics provide educational experiences and patient ser\u00ad vices in primary care. Important components of UCI's medical education andre\u00ad search programs are also conducted at affiliated hospitals and clinics, in particular, the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach; Memorial Medical Center, Long Beach; and Childrens Hospital of Orange County. For further information about University-operated clinical facilities and other facilities associated with the UCI Clinical Services System, see the UCI-California College of Medicine section. Southern Occupational Health Center In 1980 the University established occupational health cen\u00ad ters in Northern and Southern California.

Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges The Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges (ORSC) serves as a liaison between the University of California, Irvine and other educational institutions of the State. Staff visit secondary schools and community colleges to interpret the policies and programs of the University and to seek information for the University about educational develop\u00ad ments throughout the State. In cooperation with community colleges, ORSC staff mediate course articulation agreements and provide assistance with the transfer process. The ORSC staff are a resource to schools and to education-oriented groups, and respond to invitations requesting University representatives and participation in college advisement pro\u00ad grams at schools and in the community. Staff members also provide information for prospective students, teachers, par\u00ad ents, and counselors. To promote an increased awareness of the Irvine campus and the uniqueness of its academic pro\u00ad grams, ORSC staff coordinate Project Accord for high school and community college faculty and staff. ORSC is committed to the University's program of student affirmative action and participates in a number of activities and projects designed to increase the enrollment and enhance the academic success of students from groups currently underrepresented in the University community. In addition, to assist community college students who plan to transfer to UCI, ORSC staff regularly visit local community college campuses and during the year also host several \"Answers for Transfers\" days on the UCI campus. ORSC also sponsors reentry programs that provide assistance to students return\u00ad ing to or first experiencing higher education after an extended break in their formal educational experience. On campus, ORSC provides a number of services for the prospective student. Program information is supplied in a variety of forms: brochures, flyers, films, and slide presenta\u00ad tions are available, describing programs of study offered at UCI and explaining how students can qualify for admission. ORSC also schedules campus visits and tours, arranges edu\u00ad cational conferences, sponsors a variety of on-campus activi\u00ad ties for prospective students and educational groups, and assists prospective students in the application process. Each fall ORSC hosts a \"UCI Day\" for high school seniors; high school juniors and their families are encouraged to attend \"Junior Day\" which is held each spring in conjunction with Celebrate UCI. The Office also sponsors a program of honors outreach to the high schools and community colleges; for example, each spring high-achieving California high school juniors are invited to an Honors Day and summer programs at UCI for gifted students (cosponsored by Pegasus Pro\u00ad grams, Inc.) are offered. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Educational Opportunity Program/ Student Affirmative Action-Outreach The Educational Opportunity Program/Student Affirmative Action-Outreach (EOP/SAA) Office serves as a liaison between the University and other educational institutions, providing relevant information regarding EOP, SAA, and UCI's academic programs to prospective students, as well as teachers, parents, and counselors. The primary purpose of EOP/SAA is to enhance the academic preparation and to increase the enrollment of regularly admissible, low-income and/or underrepresented students within the University. The Office also administers the EOP Special Action admissions process for students who may not meet the traditional admission criteria but who demonstrate potential to succeed academically at UCI. The Office staff is responsible for carry\u00ad ing out a visitation program to selected secondary schools and community colleges to interpret policies regarding admis\u00ad sions, financial aid, housing, and other appropriate areas. For further information, please refer to the Student Affirmative Action section. Campus Tours Student-led tours of the campus are conducted weekdays at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. when UCI classes are in session; during October and November, Saturday tours are conducted at 11 a.m. In the summer months (June through September), tours are conducted each weekday at noon.

UCI on Wheels hosts numerous receptions which feature a slide show about the campus and a question-and-answer session. For further information, please contact the Office of New Student Ser\u00ad vices, (714) 856-6345. University Program for High School Scholars The University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) is an opportunity for selected highly prepared and gifted high school students (primarily seniors) to utilize UCI's nationally acknowledged academic resources while still in high school. Participants enroll concurrently at UCI and participate in campus activities, iiJteracting with faculty and students and pursuing academic interests beyond those which may be part of the high school curriculum. Participants receive grades How to Use the Catalogue 13 based on the same standards as full-time UCI students and full University credit for their work. Students must meet course prerequisites where applicable. Qualified students wishing to pursue a particular subject beyond the level offered by the high school may find the advanced courses they need at the University, or perhaps courses of interest not offered at the high school. Not only does UPHSS afford the gifted high school student a source of intellectual stimulation beyond that which the resources of the high school might allow, it also serves to provide the stu\u00ad dent with an insider's view of the academic environment that UCI has to offer. For further information, please refer to page 36. How to Use the Catalogue The UCI General Catalogue contains general administrative and academic information, descriptions of schools and depart\u00ad ments, and descriptions of student activities and services. Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. The selection of courses to be offered each quarter is subject to change without notice, and some listed courses are not offered each year. The quarterly Schedule of Classes, a publication available from the Registrar's Office shortly before registration begins each quarter, provides more cur\u00ad rent information on classes to be offered, instructors, how to enroll, enrollment restrictions (for example, open to majors only, or consent of instructor required), class hours, room assignments, and final examination schedules. Students should consult the appropriate academic unit for even more up-to-date information. Admission to UCI does not guaran\u00ad tee enrollment in any particular course. Please refer to Major Campus Publications (see p. 56). Presentation of information in the UCI General Catalogue is divided into five main concepts: 1. Introduction to UCI: lntroductbry material about the Uni\u00ad versity and the Irvine campus 2. Preadmission Matters: Information of interest to potential students Contact with UCI Preparing for University Work Undergraduate and Graduate Degrees arid Areas of Study Majors and Careers Placement Testing Student Affirmative Action Expenses and Fees Financial Aid Undergraduate Admissions 3. Information for Admitted Students Planning an Undergraduate Program Enrollment and Other Procedures Orientation, Major Campus Publications, and Supplemen- tary Educational Programs Academic Regulations and Procedures Program of Academic Support Services Campus and Student Life Campus and Student Services 4. Information on the Division of Graduate Studies and Research 5. Schools and Programs: Individual descriptions of the aca\u00ad demic programs available at UCI. Rather than in alphabetical order, the academic units are listed in two general sections: those reflecting fundamental areas of knowledge and those which offer interdisciplinary and professional study. UC IRVINE - 1985-198614 Preparing for University Work Following these major sections of the Catalogue is informa\u00ad tion about University and UCI officers, University Profes\u00ad sors, student discipline and conduct, student records, an index, and campus and locality maps. For a more detailed description of each section of the Cata\u00ad logue, students should refer to the Table of Contents. Academic Units Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on five fun\u00ad damental areas of knowledge, while at the same time provid\u00ad ing for interdisciplinary and professional study. In the Cata\u00ad logue, the five basic Schools are presented first: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Programs covering interdisciplinary and profes\u00ad sional studies are presented next: Information and Computer Science, Social Ecology, Engineering, Management, Medicine, and Teacher Education. The program in physical education, recreation, and intercollegiate athletics is presented last. Included in the academic unit descriptions are the following kinds of information: a. A brief description of what areas are covered in the School or Program and a brief statement of the educational philoso\u00ad phy and orientation of the unit. b. Lists of faculty members, the institutions from which they received their highest degrees, and their academic areas of interest. c. Requirements for the undergraduate and graduate degrees offered including those for majors and minors offered. d. Additional areas of study offered (referred to as majors, minors, concentrations, specializations, emphases, tracks, modules, or options). e. Advice about planning a program of study, and other information relevant to the academic progress and experience of students majoring in fields within each School or Program. f. Courses offered, divided into undergraduate and graduate course listings; those units that are departmentalized present their courses according to the department. Course Listings Undergraduate courses are classified as \"lower division\" and refers to courses numbered 100- 199. Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate courses. \"Lower division\" usually refers to freshman-sophomore courses, \"upper division\" to junior-senior courses. However, junior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sophomores may normally take upper\u00ad division courses when upper-division standing is not a pre\u00ad requisite and when any course prerequisites have been met. Prerequisites for courses should be noted carefully; a course has no prerequisites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, lA-B-C) normally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each course in a sequence is prerequisite to the one following. The letter L following a course number usually designates a laboratory course. The \"(4)\" or \"(4-4-4)\" designation following the course title indicates the unit credits toward the 180 quarter units needed to graduate. Each \"4\" represents four quarter units. The letters F, W, or S after the course number and title indi\u00ad cate the quarter(s) in which the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring. The word Summer appears if the course is offered in Summer Session of the academic year covered by this issue of the UCI General Catalogue. While efforts have been made to provide information on when a course is offered, such information is not always available in time for inclusion in the Catalogue. The designation (4) F, W, S indi\u00ad cates a single course offered that can be taken only once for credit; a (4-4-4) F, W, S designation indicates that credit may be earned in each quarter. When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a roman numeral at the end of the course description. Preparing for University Work A carefully planned program of high school courses provides students with the best preparation for University work. It can give them a definite edge in their undergraduate studies and the opportunity to do advanced preparation for their chosen field of study. Most important, if students master cer\u00ad tain basic subjects and skills in high school, they substantially increase their chances of success at the University. The \"a through f\" requirements for admission to the Univer\u00ad sity of California are milzimum entrance standards. Complet\u00ad ing the required high school courses with satisfactory grades will not automatically prepare students for freshman work in every subject, much less in their major or program of study. Mariy entering students discover that they are not ade\u00ad quately prepared for basic University courses, such as English composition and calculus, which they are expected to take in their freshman year. Also, many undergraduate majors, par\u00ad ticularly those in the sciences and mathematics, require more high school preparation than that necessary for admission to the University. This lack of preparation can cause problems for students who do not choose a major until after they enter the University, or for those who prepare for one major but later decide to change to another. For these reasons, students should take courses that will pre\u00ad pare them beyond minimum levels of competence in reading, 1 writing, and mathematics. A student who is well-prepared for University work will have taken four years of English in high school, three to four years of mathematics, two to three years of foreign language, two to three years of laboratory science, one year of history, and one or more years of art or humanities. It is important to appreciate that good study skills and study habits are essential for doing well at the University. For example, students will need to know how to be effective in reading a textbook, how to approach word problems in sci\u00ad ence and mathematics, how to take useful notes in lectures, and how to plan and enforce their own study schedule. These skills are developed in the more advanced courses in high school. In addition, University courses often assume that background material is fresh in the student's mind and thoroughly mastered. Therefore, a student should take as challenging a high school program as possible, with a full academic course load through the senior .year. If a student takes more than the minimum number of courses required in an \"a through f\" subject, only the highest grade(s) will be used in determining the grade point average. Thus, by taking a challenging academic program in high school, a student can improve the probability of success at the University without jeopardizing their qualifications for admission. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Reading Many students are not prepared for either the kinds or amounts of reading demanded of freshmen at the University. Each student should become proficient in reading and under\u00ad standing technical materials and scholarly works and should learn to read analytically and critically, actively questioning the author's intentions, viewpoint, arguments, and conclu\u00ad sions. Students should also become familiar, and comfortable, with the conventions of standard written English, and with various writing strategies and techniques. Reading expe\u00ad rience should include original works in their entirety, not just textbooks and anthologies, and should encompass a wide variety of forms and topics. Writing Effective critical thinking and proficiency with the written language are closely related, and both are skills which every University student must master. By University standards, a student who is proficient in English composition is able to (a) understand the assigned topic; (b) select and develop a theme by argument and example; (c) choose words which aptly and precisely convey the intended meaning; (d) con\u00ad struct effective sentences, i.e., sentences that economically and successfully convey the writer's ideas and display a vari\u00ad ety of structures; (e) demonstrate an awareness of the con\u00ad ventions of standard written English, avoiding such errors as sentence fragments, run-together sentences, faulty agree\u00ad ments, and improper pronoun\u00b7 references; and (f) punctuate, capitalize, and spell correctly. A student planning to attend the University must take Eng\u00ad lish courses in high school that require the development and practice of these skills. University entrance requirements include at least four .years of English composition and litera\u00ad ture that stress expository writing: the development of per\u00ad suasive critical thinking on the written page. Preparing for University Work 15 Mathematics Many undergraduate majors require preparation in mathe\u00ad matics beyond that necessary for admission to the University. All majors in the natural and life sciences, engineering, and mathematics require calculus. Many majors in the social sci\u00ad ences require statistics or calculus, sometimes both. If a stu\u00ad dent has selected a major that requires either calculus or sta\u00ad tistics, that course should be taken during the freshman year at the University. Calculus is also required for undergraduates preparing for careers in environmental sciences, dentistry, medicine, optometry, pharmacy, and biostatistics. Many students are not aware of the large number of fields outside the natural and mathematical sciences which require calculus or statistics as prerequisites. Students should prepare for University courses in calculus while still in high school. In addition to the two years of mathematics required for admission, a second year of algebra and a year of precalculus mathematics are essential. These courses should include (a) basic operations with numerical and algebraic functions; (b) operations with exponents and radicals; (c) linear equations and inequalities; (d) polynomials and polynomial equations; (e) functions and their graphs; (f) trigonometry, logarithms, and exponential functions; and (g) applications and word problems. Students who plan to enter a field which requires statistics should take at least the second year of algebra. Students not proficient in basic and intermediate algebra will be at an enormous disadvantage in the University. It will be necessary to take one or more precalculus courses before tak\u00ad ing calculus, and preparatory courses may be essential before taking statistics. The necessity to take these preparatory courses could seriously delay a student's progress in under\u00ad graduate studies.

UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Undergraduate Majors, Minors, Concentrations, and Associated Areas of Study Undergraduate majors are offered in all of the bachelor's degree programs on the list of degree titles; the degree pro\u00ad grams are referred to as majors in the following list. In asso\u00ad ciation with these majors, UCI offers a number of minors and formal concentrations. Some concentrations are available in more than one academic unit. A minor consists of a coordinated set of courses (seven or more) which together take a student well beyond the intro\u00ad ductory level in an academic field, subject matter, and/or dis\u00ad cipline but which are not sufficient to constitute a major. Minors do not need to be declared. Minors are listed on a student's transcript but are not listed on the baccalaureate diploma. A concentration is a program of interdisciplinary studx requiring fewer units of work than does a major; it is similar to a minor, in that the area of concentration pursued by stu\u00ad dents appears on the transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. In addition to the formal minors and concentrations, other associated areas of study are available. These include speciali\u00ad zations, which enable students to focus courses in a particu\u00ad lar field within a major, and emphases, tracks, modules, or options.

Administrative Services Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis Early Childhood Education Specialist Multiple Subject Instruction (elementary) Pupil Personnel Services Single Subject Instruction (secondary) Special Education (learning handicapped; physically handi\u00ad capped; severely handicapped; and the resource specialist certificate) Majors and Careers Choosing A Major Many students select their University major-the field of study which represents their principal academic interest-at the time they fill out their University of California Under\u00ad graduate Application. Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. (Students entering the School of Humanities as freshmen may declare a major in a specific department or program upon entrance. If they do not wish to declare their major as an entering freshman, the next opportunity to do so will be at the end of the sophomore year.) In preparation for choosing a major, students need to famil\u00ad iarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its many programs. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. Much depends on initiative-on how fully a student takes advantage of opportunities that come through sugges\u00ad tions for further study and through informal communication with faculty and students. The General Catalogue is a good place to find specific infor\u00ad mation about programs available, requirements for majors, and course offerings. At UCI a number of traditionally separ\u00ad ate academic disciplines have strong interrelationships, so that the academic environment is influenced by a wide range of interactions among disciplines. As a complement to class\u00ad room study, UCI encourages its students to become involved in a variety of educational experiences such as independent study, laboratory research, field study, writing workshops, computing, and fine arts productions. In addition to consulting the Catalogue, students are encour\u00ad aged to talk to academic counselors and faculty advisors about the opportunities which are open to them. They may Majors and Careers 19 go to any department in order to learn more about its pro\u00ad grams of study, its requirements for graduation, and possible enrollment limitations. While advisors may not be familiar with all fields, they can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study and be helpful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. Occasionally courses and workshops designed to help students make the decision are offered. All students are expected to choose a major by the beginning of the junior year. It is important to look well ahead to this decision and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sophomore years. When considering possible majors, students need to keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary study. At the same time, excessive early concentration could reduce a student's options and prevent moving to a major in a different field, without delaying the time to graduation. Furthermore, courses required for graduation need to be considered. For these . reasons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs carefully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance between ex\u00ad posure to a variety of academic areas and completion of courses which are prerequisite to a major under considera\u00ad tion. A qualified student interested in two areas of study may graduate with a double major by fulfilling the degree require\u00ad ments of any two programs. Once a student decides on a major, the actual procedure to formalize the decision is not complicated. A form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be com\u00ad pleted whenever a student who has no major is ready to declare one, or whenever a student wishes to change from one major to another. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. UC IRVINE - 1985-198620 Majors ~nd Careers Unaffiliated (Undeclared) Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sopho\u00ad mores may be uncertain about which major they should choose and may not feel ready to declare their major until they have been on campus for a while. Such students partici\u00ad pate in the General Studies Advising Program (GSAP) which is administered by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. The goal of GSAP is to help students make the best informed and most rational choice of a major that is possible. All students at UCI are expected to choose their major by the beginning of their junior year. To make a good decision about what major to declare, the student should know what programs UCI offers and have some experience with them, have a good knowledge of his or her abilities and interests, have clear educational goals, and have a good sense of his or her vocational goals and of the academic programs at UCI that will provide appropriate prep\u00ad aration for them. In GSAP students receive individualized counseling that helps them explore ~he variety of course offerings on campus, become more aware of their own inter\u00ad ests and abilities, formulate sound educational goals, and learn how to prepare for possible careers .. Preprofessional Preparation Law Law schools want to produce lawyers to serve the entire legal . spectrum (for example tax, criminal, entertainment, or immi\u00ad gration law), and this requires a wide range of academic backgrounds. Law schools look less for specific .areas of study than they do for evidence of excellence in any academic pro\u00ad gram.~ A good record in physics or classics, for example, will be preferred over a mediocre record in history or political science. The majority of law schools give equal preference to students from all academic disciplines. Courses that help develop writing and analytical skills (logic, writing, mathe\u00ad matics, research methods, and statistics courses, for example) build skills that are the key to doing well on the LSAT, suc\u00ad ceeding in law school, and entering the legal profession. UCI offers a number of law-related courses that students in any major may take. The School of Humanities offers courses in logic and the philosophy of law. The School of Social Sciences offers courses in the study of law, interna\u00ad tional relations, and economics of law and recommends that students take some political science courses as well. The Pro\u00ad gram in Social Ecology offers many law-related courses in both substantive law (such as environmental and criminal law) and in law and society and criminal justice and offers its majors the opportunity to apply theories learned in the class\u00ad room to actual problems through its field study program. Students interested in applying to law school after complet\u00ad ing the baccalaureate degree should know that law schools look closely at five aspects of a student's application: grades, Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) results, the applicant's statement of purpose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities and law-related work experience. Students should be aware that not everyone who applies is admitted to law school. One consideration in selecting an undergraduate major is alternative career opportunities should one's career goals change or should experience with law school result in a decision not to enter the field of law. Medicine and Other Health-Related Sciences Although leaders in health science education strongly recommend that students obtain a bachelor's degree prior to admission to the health sciences, there is no preferred major. Many students who plan to enter the health professions major in Biological Sciences because much of the basic course work for that major is the same as the preparation required for medical school admission; however, students may major in any academic field as long as they also take the courses required by professional health science schools. The min~. imum amount of undergraduate preparation required by most medical and health-related schools includes the follow\u00ad ing: one year each of English, biology with laboratory, general chemistry with laboratory, organic chemistry with laboratory, physics with laboratory, and college mathematics, especially calculus and statistics. Courses in cell or molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, developmental physiology or compar\u00ad ative anatomy, and vertebrate embryology are recommended, as is course work in computer science. In addition, some health sciences schools have certain nonscience course requirements or recommended courses in, for example, Eng\u00ad lish and/or a foreign language. Facility with the Spanish lan\u00ad guage is ~ery helpful in California medical schools and in other areas of the United States with large Hispanic populations. Although many factors ultimately are considered when reviewing applicants for admission, admission committees look carefully at the following seven areas: college grade point average (science and nonscience grades are evaluated separately and evidence of improvement in work during the undergraduate years is important); results of the New Medi\u00ad cal College Admissions Test (MCAT), the Dental Admissions Test, and other aptitude examination scores; the student's personal essay and/or personal interview; in-depth letters of recommendation; practical experience in the health sciences, whether paid or volunteer, is regarded favorably as an indica\u00ad tion of exposure to and interest in the health sciences;\u00b7 extra\u00ad curricular activities which demonstrate the applicant's ability to interact successfully with others; and research experience-especially in a biological, medical, or behavioral science. Since medical programs cannot accommodate all qualified applicants, and competition for entrance is keen, it is impor\u00ad tant to keep in mind alternative career opportunities should one not be accepted to medical, dental, pharmacy, optometry, podiatry, or veterinary school, or should one decide to pursue instead one of the expanding number of health-related pro\u00ad grams now available. Business/Management The contemporary executive or manager must be a creative thinker, make complex decisions, and have the ability to per\u00ad ceive and participate in the full scope of an enterprise while understanding its role in the economy. Effective management requires leadership ability, strong problem-solving skills, effective oral and written communication skills, analytical skills, an understanding of economic trends, and a basic knowledge of behavioral processes iil organizations. Although UCI does not offer a prebusiness program leading to an undergraduate degree, the Graduate School of Man\u00ad agement does offer a minor in Management as a supplement to any undergraduate major. This minor can provide stu\u00ad dents with a broad understanding of management theory and practice. In addition, it may be helpful to students in deter\u00ad mining whether they wish to pursue a career in business or management or undertake further study in management at the graduate level. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Students can also supplement their major course work to develop the skills needed for business and management by taking electives such as calculus and basic statistics, econom\u00ad ics, microeconomics, macroeconomics, psychology and sociol\u00ad ogy, computer science, and political science courses. Most graduate programs in business administration or man\u00ad agement do not require prior undergraduate course work in business. For admission purposes, graduate schools of business look at five areas: grades, scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the applicant's statement of pur\u00ad pose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and evidence of leadership in school and community activities and work expe\u00ad rience. The latter is becomingan increasingly important pre- requisite for many programs. \u00b7 Career Opportunities The eight academic units at UCI which offer undergraduate education leading to the bachelor's degree provide students with a variety of opportunities to explore a wide range of interests leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level. The lists which follow are meant to indicate to students the many and varied career areas pursued by UCI graduates, and to make students aware of some of the vast array of career choices available. Addi\u00ad tional discussions of careers are presented in individual aca\u00ad demic unit sections. Any major can lead to any number of careers. Some examples of careers frequently led to by majors available within the academic units at UCI are listed below. Biological Science Career Areas Audiology \u00b7 Bioanalysis Biochemistry Cell Biology Chiropractic Medicine Clinical Chemistry Dentistry Developmental Biology Dietetics Environmental Management Forestry Genetic Engineering Health Administration Industrial Hygiene Marine Biology Medical Technology Medicine Microbiology Nurse Practitioner Occupational Therapy Oceanography Optometry Plant Biology Pharmacy Physician's Assistant Physical Therapy Podiatry Prosthetics Design Quality Control Research Sales Social Work Speech Pathology Teaching Technical Writing and Editing Veterinary Medicine The health field is one of the fastest-growing career areas in the country. Work sites may include private corporations, educational institutions, hospitals, health care complexes, private foundations, city and county governments, state agencies, the federal government, and many others. Engineering Career Areas Aerospace Communications Computers Construction Control Systems Digital Signal Processing Electric Power Electronics Engines and Fuels Environmental Control Process Control Public Works Robotics Structures Transportation Water Resources Career Opportunities 21 The above is a sample of the many fields in whiab UCI Engi\u00ad neering graduates work. Their activities typically involve them in one or more of the following: design, research and development, manufacturing or construction, operations, consulting, applications and sales, management, or teaching. At UCI they will have had the choice of civil, electrical, mechanical, or environmental engineering, but they will fre\u00ad quently find challenging positions in related areas for which their general and specialty courses at UCI, followed by formal Qr informal, on-the-job training will qualify them, such as aeronautical, biomedical, chemical, or industrial engineering. Approximately half of UCI's Engineering graduates eventu\u00ad ally obtain advanced degrees (at UCI or elsewhere), and almost all engage in some sort of continuing education to keep abreast of advances in technology. Many Engineering graduates have used their engineering background to enter graduate programs and obtain degrees in the fields of admin\u00ad istration, law, medicine, physics, or mathematics. Fine Arts Career Areas Advertising Animation Arts Administration Art Therapy Broadcasting Choreography Commercial Art Composition Consulting Criticism Curating Direction Environmental Design Instrument Repair/Tuning .Interior/Industrial Design Journalism Librarianship Lighting Marketing Medical Illustration Performance Photography Physical Fitness Printing Production Publicity Public Relations Publishing Retail Sales Set/Stage/Costume Design Teaching Tourism Writing The exceptionally talented Fine Arts graduate may choose to become a professional actor, art historian, artist, dancer, or musician. However, there are many other careers to explore in numerous arts-related -areas, or the Fine Arts graduate may wish to combine part-time professional performance with supplemental work. The field of arts administration is an increasingly important career area, offering opportunities to work with opera and dance companies, repertory theatre companies, museums, state and local arts councils, com\u00ad munity arts organizations, and arts festivals.

UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Placement Testing , UCI administers a system of placement testing which is designed to assist students in assessing strengths and weak\u00ad nesses in their academic preparation for University-level course work in various subject areas. These exams, which have been developed by University faculty, have established test score guidelines which serve as a criterion for course enrollment. Placement exams are given before registration for classes and assist academic advisors in helping students plan academic programs and make career choices. Students are encouraged to talk with available academic counselors and advisors in order to formulate a plan of study which is best suited to their learning needs and career goals. Placement testing is given in the areas of writing, mathemat\u00ad ics, chemistry, and, where indicated, reading and English as a second language. Students who wish to enroll in English and Comparative Literature WR39A, Mathematics 2A, and Chemistry 1A and who have not received a departmental exemption from the exam are required to take the appro\u00ad priate examination before registering for these classes. Stu\u00ad dents who plan to take several courses which require con\u00ad siderable analytical reading are urged to take the reading examination, which will provide assistance in deciding on a managea~le course load. Examination Dates Chemistry/Mathematics Preliminary Exams: July 19, August 2 and 16, and during \"0\" Week, September 23-27, 1985 English as a Second Language Placement Exams: July 19, August 2 and 16, and during \"0\" Week, September 23-27, 1985 Pre-Calculus Placement Exams: July 19, August 2 and 16, and during \"0\" Week, September 23-27, 1985 Freshmen Placement Exams in Written Composition: July 19, August 2 and 16, and during \"0\" Week, September 23-27, 1985 Reading Placement Exams: July 19, August 2 and 16, and during \"0\" Week, September 23-27, 1985 Detailed information about these tests will be sent from the Program of Academic Support Services to all newly admitted students. Student Affirmative Action Student affirmative action involves the provision of equal opportunities for admission and success at the University, and specifically for increased enrollment, greater retention, and higher graduation rates of underrepresented students who are regularly admissible to the University. Educational Opportunity Program The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) for low-income and/or underrepresented students may provide, according to the student's circumstances, special admissions consideration, assistance with financial aid application and procedures, and referral to advising, tutoring, and learning skills services. The goal of EOP is to encourage representation of low\u00ad income and/or underrepresented students at UCI by assisting them in enrolling and succeeding at the University. The Edu\u00ad cational Opportunity Program is designed to assist students in overcoming obstacles by providing counseling on admis-Placement Testing/Student Affirmative Action 23 sions and financial aid, and referral to advising, tutoring, and learning skills services. A special summer session is offered to those students identified as most likely to benefit from this support program. Special assistance on a continuing basis is available to all EOP students through the Counseling Center, the Tutorial Assistance Program, Learning Skills Services, and the Special Services Office. Additional information and personal admissions counseling may be obtained from the EOP/SAA staff by telephoning (714) 856-5410. Students from low-income and/or underrepresented groups are encouraged to apply. EOP assists those who are regularly admissible to the University, and also those who may not have met all of the regular admissions requirements but who can offer evidence supporting their ability to achieve at the University level. With the exception of American Indians, only residents of the State of California are eligible to apply for EOP sponsorship. American Indian applicants must doc\u00ad ument their tribal affiliation. Admission Prospective students interesteo in EOP must complete .the regular UC admission forms and follow all procedures. Appli\u00ad cants should take particular care with the required essay and indicate their interest in EOP by marking the appropriate places provided on the application. Applications may be obtained from counseling offices in California high schools and community colleges, the UCI Office of Admissions, or the EOP/SAA-Outreach Office. Applicants who require spe\u00ad cial admissions consideration are advised to submit two let\u00ad ters of recommendation from teachers, counselors, persons in the community, or employers, which document the stu\u00ad dent's background, motivation, and academic potential. UC IRVINE - 1985-198624 Student Affirmative Action Financial Assistance Personal financial resources should not be the determining factor in deciding whether or not to attend college. All stu\u00ad dents admitted to UCI, including EOP students, are eligible for financial assistance on the basis of demonstrated need. Funds can be provided to cover room and board, fees, books and supplies, and living expenses, when a student or family is unable to fully meet these expenses. Financial aid is com\u00ad prised of a combination or \"package\" of grant, loan, scholar\u00ad ship, and/or part-time employment based on the individual circumstances of the applicant. See Financial Aid, page 29. Undergraduate Student Affirmative Action Outreach Program The purpose of the Student Affirmative Action Outreach Program is to attract underrepresented minority students who are regularly admissible to UCI. Campus representatives visit high schools, community colleges, and community cen\u00ad ters to meet with students, parents,, teachers, and school offi\u00ad cials to discuss educational opportunities at UCI. The pro\u00ad gram also includes a series of seminars and workshops aimed at orienting students to specific academic disciplines, particu\u00ad larly mathematics, physics, computer science, chemistry, biol\u00ad ogy, and engineering where minorities historically have been underrepresented. Early Outreach Partnership Program Young students are the focus of two partnership programs: Partnership Junior High and Partnership Senior High. Both programs are designed to ensure that more students from underrepresented groups become eligible for admission to the University. Students, parents, and teachers are provided information and skills development sessions and are advised about appropriate University preparatory course work. For information about these programs, please telephone (714) 856-6362. Academic Enrichment Program Open to selected outstanding high school students from underrepresented groups, the Academic Enrichment Program stresses academic preparation in the areas of writing, human\u00ad ities, fine arts, computer science, and mathematics. Students participate in seminars, field trips, and discussion groups both on the Irvine campus and at their high schools. For further information, please telephone (714) 856-5997. Summer Preentry Program for Medical Students This program is designed to introduce newly accepted minor\u00ad ity and/or nontraditional medical students to the type and volume of study materials they will encounter during their medical education. Additional information is available in the College of Medicine section. Summer Premedical Program This program seeks to increase the number of minority and/or disadvantaged students who are accepted into medical school by providing participants with the special skills and prerequisites needed to obtain an M.D. degree. Additional information is available in the College of Medicine section. Special Services The Office of Special Services provides students from educa\u00ad tionally and economically disadvantaged backgrounds, dis\u00ad abled students, and underrepresented students with support services to help them succeed and earn their University degree. A primary responsibility of Special Services is to monitor the academic progress of their students. In order to best assist students who are having difficulty with their course work, professional and peer counselors maintain a close liaison with academic departments. When needed, counseling and refer\u00ad rals to other campus support services are provided. In con\u00ad junction with these academic and service units, the Engineer\u00ad ing and Computer Science Educational Laboratory (ECSEL) program and a variety of workshops are offered throughout the year by Special Services. Special Services also sponsors and conducts the Summer Educational Opportunity Program (SEOP) for underprepared students who demonstrate the potential to succeed at the University. The SEOP is designed to provide and refine basic academic skills necessary for students to successfully com\u00ad plete their course work during the regular school year. Students are encouraged to make appointments with the Special Services Office and may do so by telephoning (714) 856-6234. ' Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram (GPOP), positive steps are being taken to increase the participation of minorities, and women in certain fields, in the graduate academic and professional programs of the Uni\u00ad versity. Appropriate assistance is offered during the admis\u00ad sion process, and every effort is made through GPOP advis\u00ad ing and support to ensure that all students will have a rea\u00ad sonable chance to attain their academic objectives. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Expenses and Fees Estimated Expenses NOTE: Undergraduate and graduate estimated figures are based on three quarters of attendance. Figures for first-year medical students are based on 10 months of attendance and are higher for second-through fourth-year students, who attend for a calendar year. All fees are subject to change without notice, and the University may impose additional fees. The following is intended only as a guide in computing average expenses. Fee payment dates are announced in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Special Expenditures Special expenditures beyond the cost of books and basic sup\u00ad plies may be associated with certain courses of study. For example, field study assignments may involve transportation expenses; students who take a dance class may be required to wear a certain type of shoe; a student may need a calculator. Fees Under terms of the Alan Pattee Scholarship Act a surviving child of a California resident who died as a result of accident or injury incurred in the performance of active law enforce\u00ad ment or active fire suppression and prevention duties is eligi\u00ad ble to apply for waiver of certain fees. Additional information concerning this Act is available from the Registrar's Office. Registration Fee The University Registration Fee is $178 per quarter. The full fee is required of all students regardless of the number of courses taken. This fee, which must be paid at the time of registration, is a charge to each student for services which benefit the student and which are complementary to, but not California Residents Expenses and Fees 25 a part of, the instructional programs. No part of this fee is remitted to students who may not desire to make use of all or any of these services. Graduate students studying out of the State may be eligible to pay one-half of the Registration Fee. The $50 advance deposit on the Registration Fee (Under\u00ad graduate Acceptance of Admission Fee), required of new undergraduates, is applied to the full fee when the student registers. Continuing students are required to pay all out\u00ad standing fines and other debts, in full, before they pay their Registration Fee for an upcoming term. Medical students are required to pay the full Registration Fee for each fall, winter, and spring quarter, and a reduced Regis\u00ad tration Fee for each summer quarter. As of spring 1985, the fee for summer quarter, 1986 is $80. Educational Fee The Educational Fee for undergraduate students averages $241 per quarter. For graduate students the Educational Fee averages $260 per quarter. Medical students are required to pay the Educational Fee for each quarter in which they enroll, including the summer quarter. Part-Time Status Undergraduate and graduate students on approved part-time status (enrollment in 10 units or less per quarter for under\u00ad graduates and in eight units or less per quarter for graduate students, including physical education units) pay the full Uni\u00ad versity Registration Fee and one-half the Educational Fee paid by students on full-time status. Those part-time stu\u00ad dents who have been determined to be nonresidents of the State of California are assessed one-half the Nonresident Tuition, in addition to the Registration and Educational Fees.

Part-time status lapses at the end of each academic year. A student must, therefore, reapply each year that part-time status is desired. Associated Students Fees The Associated Students Fee is $13 per quarter for under\u00ad graduates and $9 per quarter for graduate and medical stu\u00ad dents. The undergraduate student fee is administered by the Associated Students of UCI; the graduate and medical stu\u00ad dent fees are administered by the Associated Graduate Stu\u00ad dents and the Medical Students Organization, respectively. These funds provide social activities, lectures, forums, con\u00ad certs, and other activities at either a reduced charge, or no charge, to UCI students. The fees are required of all students.

The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California campuses to open for the quarter, and for schools on the semester system, the day instruction begins for the semester. Nonresident undergrad\u00ad uate and graduate students on approved part-time status shall pay one-half the Nonresident Tuition. Inquiries from prospective students regarding residence requirements for tuition purposes should be directed to the Residence Deputy in the Registrar's Office. No other Univer\u00ad sity personnel are authorized to supply information relative to residence requirements for tuition purposes. Any student, following a final decision on residence classification by the Residence Deputy, may make written appeal to the Legal Analyst-Residence Matters (590 University Hall, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720) within 120 days after notification of the final decision by the Residence Deputy. General In order to be classified as a resident for tuition purposes upon admission, an adult student must have established his or her residence in California for more than one year im\u00ad mediately preceding the residence determination date for the term during which the student proposes to attend the Uni\u00ad versity and relinquish any prior residence. An adult student must couple his or her physical presence within the State\u00b7 of California for one year with objective evidence that such presence is consistent with the student's intent in making California his or her permanent home and, if these steps are delayed, the one-year durational period will be extended until BOTH presence and intent have been demonstrated for one full year. Physical presence within the State solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes does not constitute the establishment of Cali\u00ad fornia residence under State law regardless of the length of the student's stay in California. Relevant indicia which can be relied upon to demonstrate one's intent to make California his or her permanent resi- UC IRVINE - 1985-1986dence include, but are not limited to, the following: register\u00ad ing and voting in California elections; designating California as the student's permanent address on all school and employ\u00ad ment records, including military records if one is in the mil\u00ad itary service; obtaining a Califorl)ia driver's license or, a California Identification Card; obtaining Cali\u00ad fornia vehicle registration; paying California income taxes as a resident, including income earned outside the State; estab\u00ad lishing an abode where one's permanent belongings are kept within California; licensing for professional practice in Cali\u00ad fornia; and the absence of these indicia in other states during any period for which residence in California is asserted. Doc\u00ad umentary evidence may be required. No single factor is con\u00ad trolling or decisive. All relevant indicia will be considered in the classification determination. The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under age 18) child maintains his or her place of abode is the residence of the unmarried minor child. When the minor lives with neither parent, his or her residence is that of the parent with whom he or she maintained his or her last place of abode, provided the minor may establish his or her resi\u00ad dence when both parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by his or her own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by relinquishment of a parent's right of control. A man or a woman establishes his or her residence. A wife's residence shall not be derivative from that of her husband, or vice versa. Procedures New and returning students are required to complete a Statement of Legal Residence. The student's status is deter\u00ad mined by the Residence Deputy who is located in the Regis\u00ad trar's Office. California Residence '27 All students classified incorrectly as residents are subject to reclassification and to payment of all nonresident fees not paid. If incorrect classification results from false or concealed facts by the student, the student is subject to University dis\u00ad cipline. Resident students who become nonresidents must immediately notify the Residence Deputy. Exceptions I. A student who remains in this State after his or her par\u00ad ent, who was theretofore domiciled in California for at least one year immediately prior to leaving and has, during the student's minority and within one year immediately prior to the residence determination date, established residence else\u00ad where, shall be entitled to resident classification. This classifi\u00ad cation will continue until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident so long as, once enrolled, he or she maintains continuous attendance at an institution. 2. Nonresident students who are minors or 18 years of age and can evidence that they have been totally self-supporting through employment and actually present within California for the entire year immediately prior to the residence deter\u00ad mination date and have evidenced the intent to make Cali\u00ad fornia their permanent home may be eligible for resident status. 3. A student shall be entitled to resident classification if immediately prior to the residence determination date he or she has lived with and been under the continuous direct care and control of any adult or adults other than a parent for not less than two years, provided that the adult or adults having UC IRVINE - 1985-198628 California Residence such control have been California residents during the year immediately prior to the residence determination date. This exception continues until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident student, so long as continu\u00ad ous attendance is maintained at an institution. 4. Exemption from payment of the Nonresident Tuition Fee is available to the natural or adopted child, stepchild, or spouse who is a dependent of a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty. Such resident classification may be maintained until the student has resided in California the minimum time necessary to become a resi\u00ad dent. If a student is enrolled in an institution and the member of the military (a) is transferred on military orders to a place outside the state where the member continues to serve in the armed forces of the United States, or (b) is retired as an active member of the armed forces immediately after having been on active duty in California, the student is entitled to retain resident classification under conditions set forth above. 5. A student who is a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty, except a member of the military assigned for educational purposes to a State\u00ad supported institution of higher education, shall be entitled to resident classification until he or she has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident. 6. A student who is an adult alien is entitled to resident clas\u00ad sification if the student is a refugee, asylum applicant, asylee, or permanent resident of the United States who has estab\u00ad lished and maintained residence in California for more than one year after having been granted the status of refugee, asy\u00ad lum applicant, asylee, or permanent resident immediately prior to the residence determination date. Nonresident aliens present in the United States under the terms of visa classifi\u00ad cations A, E, G, I, K, or L who have had residence in Califor\u00ad nia for more than one year immediately prior to the resi\u00ad dence determination date while holding a valid A, E, G, I, K, or L visa may be entitled to residence classification. Inquiries should be directed to the Residence Deputy in the Registrar's Office. 7. A student who is a minor alien shall be entitled to resident classification if the student and the parent are refugees, asy\u00ad lum applicants, asylees, or permanent residents of the United States, provided that the parent has had residence in Califor\u00ad nia for more than one year after having been granted refu\u00ad gee, asylum applicant, asylee, or permanent resident status immediately prior to the residence determination date for the applicable term. Minor students holding A, E, G, I, K, or L visas should contact the Residence Deputy in the Registrar's Office for information regarding eligibility for resident status. 8. Children of deceased public law enforcement or fire sup\u00ad pression employees, who were California residents and who were killed in the course of law enforcement or fire suppres\u00ad sion duties, may be entitled to resident status. Reclassification California law requires that students classified as nonresi\u00ad dents seeking reclassification as residents demonstrate that they are financially independent. This factor is in addition to the other requirements necessary for a resident classification. Graduate students who are teaching assistants, research as\u00ad sistants, or teaching associates employed on a 0.49 percent or more time basis are exempt from the financial independence requirement. For detailed information refer to Reclassification of Nonresi-dents below. Note also that students must petition in person at the Registrar's Office for a change of classification from nonresident to resident status. All changes of status must be initiated prior to the late registration period for the term of attendance for which the student seeks reclassification. Reclassification of Nonresidents The California Education Code was amended effective July I, 1981 to reflect consideration of financial independence as an additional factor for students seeking to reclassify from non\u00ad resident to resident for tuition purposes. To be reclassified as a resident under the new legislation, a student must meet the residency requirements sta.ted above and must also demonstrate that he or she has been finan\u00ad cially independent according to the criteria specified in the new law. Students seeking reclassification should be prepared to fur\u00ad nish information verifying their financial independence for the calendar year in which reclassification is sought and in each ofthe three immediately preceding calendar years. Under the new law, a student is considered financially inde\u00ad pendent if during each of the four years he or she: I. has not been claimed by nonresident parents as an exemp\u00ad tion for federal and state income tax purposes; 2. has not received more than $750 from the nonresident parents; and 3. has not lived in the nonresident parents' home for more than six weeks. Failure to satisfy all of the financial independence criteria for the entire period will not necessarily result in a denial of resi\u00ad dence status if the durational requirement of one year is met and the showing of intent is sufficiently strong. Financial independence is of greater significance for the current and immediately preceding calendar years. Failure to satisfy all three of the financial independence criteria for the current and immediately preceding calendar years normally will result in a determination of nonresidence. Financial independence, or want of it, for the second and third calendar years immediately preceding the year in which reclassification is requested will be considered together with all other relevant factors in determining intent, with no spe\u00ad cial weight attached to the financial independence factor. Time Limitation on Providing Documentation. If additional documentation is required for either an initial residence clas\u00ad sification or a reclassification but is not readily accessible, the student will be allowed a period of time no later than the end of the applicable term to provide such documentation. Inquiries and Appeals The student is cautioned that this summation is not a com\u00ad plete explanation of the law regarding residence. The student should also note that changes may have been made in the rate of nonresident tuition and the residence requirements between the time this catalogue statement is published and the relevant residence determination date. Regulations have been adopted by The Regents, and a copy is available for inspection in the Registrar's Office. Waivers of Nonresident Tuition Nonresident Tuition waivers may be granted to spouses and dependent, unmarried children under age 21 of University faculty members who are qualified for membership in the UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Academic Senate. Inquiries regarding these waivers should be directed to the Registrar's Office. To the extent funds are available, Nonresident Tuition waiv\u00ad ers may be granted to the unmarried, dependent children under age 21 of a full-time University employee whose per\u00ad manent assignment is outside California and who has been employed by the Unive-rsity for more than one year imme\u00ad diately prior to the opening of the term. Inquiries regarding these waivers normally should be directed to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Fee Refunds Registration Fees New undergraduates who cancel their registration before the first day of instruction are entitled to a refund of Registra\u00ad tion Fee paid except for the $50 nonrefundable Acceptance of Admission Fee. The Associated Student Fee and the Univer\u00ad sity Center Fee are refunded only for canceiiation of registra\u00ad tion prior to the first day of orientation. Other fees paid are refunded in full. For ail continuing and readmitted students, and new graduate and medical students, there is a service charge of $10 for can\u00ad cellation of registration prior to the first day of instruction. Btudents who withdraw from the University during the first five weeks of instruction will receive refunds1 of Registration Fee, Educational Fee, and Nonresident Tuition Fee (less the $50 nonrefundable Undergraduate Acceptance of Admission Fee) based on the effective date of withdrawal: 1-14 calendar days, 80% of amount paid; 15-21 60% of 22-28 40% of amount paid; 29-35 calendar days, 20% of amount paid; 36 calendar days and over, 0%. The effective date of withdrawal is normally the date the student's official notice of withdrawal is received by the University. However, under extenuating circumstances, the Ombudsman, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Re\u00ad search, or the College of Medicine Associate Dean for Medi\u00ad cal Student Affairs, as appropriate, may determine that the effective date of withdrawal occurred prior to the filing of the notice. It is presumed that no University services will be provided to the student after that date. Claims for refund of fees must be presented during the fiscal year (July 1 to June 30) in which the claim is applicable. To obtain a refund, the student must surrender the identifica\u00ad tion card to the Ombudsman, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, or the College of Medicine Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs at the time of withdrawal. Refund checks are issued by the Accounting Office and are received by mail gener~lly four to six weeks after the official notice of withdrawal is processed. If any portion of a student's fees has been paid by the Uni\u00ad versity or outside sources, that portion of the refund will be returned directly to the source of those funds. Students who are receiving financial aid and withdraw from UCI during a quarter will have to repay a portion of their aid based on the same schedule as UCI's refund policy. Housing Refunds UCI Housing Contracts provide students with complete housing refund policies. 'if no credit for courses is received, a full refund of the Registration Fee of the regular session will be granted to all students entering the armed forces prior to the sixth week of the quarter. No refund thereafter. Fee Refunds/Financial Aid 29 Financial Aid Lack of funds need not be a barrier to attending UCI; almost one half of enrolled students receive some form of financial aid. Students who demonstrate that they need financial assistance in order to attend are eligible for financial aid through the Financial Aid Office. In addition to awarding-aid on the basis of financial need, the Office also offers some scholarships based on academic excellence. Students who receive financial aid will receive funds from one or more of the foilowing sources: scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study. These sources are described briefly in the following sections; more detailed information can be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. To obtain financial aid, new and continuing students must file the Student Aid Application for California (SAAC) and the necessary supporting documents each year. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible. The SAAC, addi\u00ad tional forms, information regarding the application process, deadline dates, and financial aid programs for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students may be found in the Financial Aid Handbook which is available in the Financial Aid Office. The priority deadline for loans, work-study, and most grants is around February 11. The University expects the student and the parent (or spouse) to contribute toward the educa\u00ad tional costs to every extent possible. For dependent students, an analysis of the SAAC and supporting documents deter\u00ad mines the amount a student and the student's parents can be expected to contribute toward the cost of the student's edu\u00ad cation. For independent students, the analysis determines the amount a student and/or spouse can contribute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, size of family, and the number of family members in college are the major fac\u00ad tors considered in the analysis. Assets include, but are not limited to, equity in real estate; stocks, bonds, and other securities; business and farm equity; and cash, savings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and nontaxable income such as Social Security and Veterans' benefits. All undergraduate financial aid applicants also are required to apply for a Fell Grant, and in addition eligible California residents are required to apply for a Cal Grant A or a Cal Grant B. The application deadline for Cal Grants A and B is usually around February 9 for the following academic year. Special Expenditures Financial aid recipients who are in need of money for special expenditures (beyond the cost of books and basic supplies associated with certain courses of study) may make an appointment to see a financial aid advisor to explore the pos\u00ad sibility of a budget extension, based on the availability of funds. Examples of such special expenditures include trans\u00ad portation costs for a field study assignment, special shoes for a dance class, or special equipment for handicapped students. UCI Policy on Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Undergraduate and Graduate Students In defining student eligibility for financial aid, the Higher Education Act of 1980 states that a student must maintain \"satisfactory progress in the course of study the student is pursuing, according to the standards and practices of the institution at which the student is in attendance.\" Federal regulatio11s of May 1982 further state that each institution shall establish, publish, and apply \"reasonable standards\" for UC IRVINE - 1985-198630 Financial Aid assuring that every student receiving need-based financial aid should maintain \"satisfactory progress in his/her course of study.\" Final Federal regulations, published October 6, 1983, further state that \"in order to receive student financial aid under the programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act, a student must be maintaining satisfactory progress in the course of study he or she is pursuing accord\u00ad ing to the standards and practices of the institution in which he or she is enrolled.\" The following requirements for satisfactory academic pro\u00ad gress for receipt of financial aid apply to all applicants for any financial aid awards administered by the UCI Financial Aid Office. These requirements are separate and distinct from UCI's policy regarding satisfactory academic progress. I. Grade Point Average (CPA) All financial aid recipients must comply with the following minimum cumulative grade point average requirement. Undergraduate Units (Undergraduate and Graduate) and Clock Hours (Medical) All financial aid applicants must comply with the following minimum cumulative unit or clock-hour requirement. Undergraduate students .. 12 for one quarter of attendance 24 for two quarters of attendance 36 for three quarters of attendance Graduate students ......... 8 for one quarter of attendance Medical students 16 for two quarters of attendance 24 for three quarters of attendance Regular the first year 912 in the second year 1,200 in each of the third and fourth years Extended first year 684 in each of the second and third years 1,200 in each of the fourth and fifth years All financial aid applicants who have been granted part-time status must comply with the following minimum cumulative unit requirements. Undergraduate and graduate students ....... 6 for one quarter of attendance 12 for two quarters of attendance 18 for three quarters of attendance 3. Quarter Limits for Eligibility All financial aid applicants exceeding the following quarter limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. All financial aid applicants who have been granted part-time status will be assessed one-half quarter for every one quarter of verified part-time enrollment (e.g., three quarters of veri\u00ad fied part-time attendance are equal to one and one-half quar\u00ad ters assessed toward quarter limits of eligibility). Undergraduate students: 1. Entering freshmen are eligible for all types of financial aid for a total of IS quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Advanced standing transfer students will have transcripts from previous postsecondary institutions evaluated to deter\u00ad mine the number of remaining quarters of financial aid eligi\u00ad bility at UCI. 3. Students acquiring a second bachelor's degree will have six quarters of additional financial aid eligibility. Graduate students: I. Limited Status (California educational credential) students: four quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Limited Status (noncredential) students: four quarters of academic year attendance. 3. Master's degree designed for completion in: a. three quarters: five quarters of academic year attendance. b. six quarters: eight quarters of academic year attendance. c. nine quarters: eleven quarters of academic year attendance. 4. Ph.D. students will be eligible for 21 quarters of need\u00ad based financial aid following the completion of their bacca\u00ad laureate degree. Note: Students will not be granted additional quarters of eligi\u00ad bility solely by reason of changing their field of study or pur\u00ad suing more than one major. Medical Students: I. Incoming students in their first year of attendance will be eligible to apply for financial assistance for a total of 18 quin\u00ad tiles of attendance. The time constraint for completion of this limitation is as follows: Regular curriculum ........................... four be completed in the first three years. Quintiles 9-18 must be completed in the remaining two years. 2. Advanced standing transfer students will have transcripts from previous postsecondary institutions evaluated to deter\u00ad mine remaining quintiles of financial aid eligibility. Unit Evaluation I. Remedial courses Required remedial courses will count toward the undergrad\u00ad uate, graduate, and medical student minimum unit/clock\u00ad hour requirement of the satisfactory academic progress pol\u00ad icy for financial aid. 2. Grade evaluation As defined below, units for the following grades will not be counted toward meeting the minimum unit/clock-hour requirement. Undergraduate and graduate students F Failure I Incomplete NP Not Pass U Unsatisfactory W Withdraw NR No grade reported Repeat courses Repeat of a D grade or higher repeat of advanced standing or high school course. Medical students F Failure NR No grade reported Repeat courses Repeat of a D grade or higher 3. Incomplete courses-Medical School Clock-hours for a grade of Incomplete (I) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress for the quintile during which the student took the course. If the student fails to meet the requirements for removing the I and the I becomes a grade ofF, the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic pro\u00ad gress record. UC IRVINE - 1985-19864. Courses in progress-Medical School Clock-hours for courses in In Progress (IP) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress during the first quin\u00ad tile of a course requiring two quintiles for completion. Stu\u00ad dents in the Primary Care Clerkship will have the IP count toward the clock-hour requirement for four quintiles. Should the student fail to receive a passing grade, after the course has been completed the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic progress record. Satisfactory Academic Progress Deficiencies and Their Effect on Receiving Financial Aid. The requirements for undergraduate and graduate student satisfactory academic progress stated above are monitored each quarter and at the end of the academic year. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will have their financial aid eligibility affected in the following manner. 1. Quarterly totals-Units and grade point average The Financial Aid Office will monitor the totals for units and grade point average after the conclusion of each quarter. a. A grade point average total below 2.0 (undergraduate) or 3.0 (graduate student) must be increased to 2.0 or 3.0, whichever applies, by the conclusion of spring quarter or summer session. b. Unit total below 12 per quarter- The student will be placed on satisfactory academic proba\u00ad tion. The student will receive financial aid funds for the academic year. The deficiency must be cleared by the.con\u00ad clusion of spring quarter or summer session. c. Unit total belciw 6 per quarter- The student will be disqualified for financial aid funds and will be billed for all monies received in that quarter. The bill will be due and payable at once. The student will be barred from registration until all canceled financial aid funds have been repaid. 2. Academic year totals-units and grade point average The Financial Aid Office will verify the cumulative totals for units and grade point average after the conclusion of spring quarter. Students who have unit or grade point average defi\u00ad ciencies will be required to make up the deficiency prior to receiving any financial aid funds, including funds that would also be used for payment of fees. 3. At the completion of each academic year students will be notified if they have exceeded their quarter limits for eligibility. Quarterly Unit Deficiency and Its Effect on Pell Grant and Cal Grant A and B 1. Pell Grant Students receiving a Pell Grant must be enrolled in a min\u00ad imum of 12 units each quarter. The Financial Aid Office will verify unit totals for all Pell Grant recipients at the conclu\u00ad sion of each quarter. The Pell Grant unit requirement does not provide a probationary period in which the student may make up the deficiency. Students who are enrolled for less than 12 units at the conclusion of the quarter will have their Pell Grant award reduced as follows: 11.9-9.0 units will receive three-fourths of the Pell Grant 8.9-6.0 units will receive one-half of the Pell Grant 5.9-0.0 units will have their Pell Grant canceled If the Pell Grant reduction is made due to a deficiency in the fall quarter, the spring quarter Pell Grant award will be reduced. If the Pell Grant reduction is made due to a defi\u00ad ciency in the winter or spring quarter, the student will be billed, approximately three weeks after the conclusion of the quarter, for the amount of the reduction. Financial Aid/Scholarships 31 2. Cal Grant A and B Students receiving Cal Grant A or B must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units each quarter. The Financial Aid Office will verify unit totals for all Cal Grnt A recipients at the con\u00ad clusion of each quarter, and for all Cal Grant B recipients at the conclusion of each month. The Cal Grant unit require\u00ad ment does not provide a probationary period in which a stu\u00ad dent may make up the deficiency. Cal Grant recipients who are enrolled for less than 12 units will have their Cal Grant awards reduced as follows: 11.9-9.0 units will receive three-fourths of the Cal Grant 8.9-6.0 units will receive one-half of the Cal Grant 5.9-0.0 units will have their Cal Grant canceled Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals After failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress, a student will be considered for financial aid only when one of the following conditions has been met: a. Sufficient units have been completed and/or the minimum cumulative grade point average requirement has been satisfied. b. It is established through the financial aid appeals process that the student encountered some type of extenuating cir\u00ad cumstances during the quarter(s) in question which hindered academic performance (i.e., prolonged hospitalization, death in the family). Appeals Procedure Students wishing to appeal must submit the UCI Financial Aid Appeals Request Form and a letter to the Financial Aid Office stating their reasons for failing to meet the unit or grade point average requirements, and whether or not they have solved their difficulties. The Ombudsman's assistance may be sought in the preparation of appeals. Undergraduate students also may be required to submit a degree check, course plan, or letter from their dean. All relevant material will be presented to the Financial Aid Appeals Board (the Board is composed of Financial Aid professional staff). Once the material has been reviewed, the Board will d'ecide whether or not the student's eligibility for aid will be rein\u00ad stated. In the event the Board decides not to accept the stu\u00ad dent's appeal, the student will be given the right to a personal interview with the Board. If the student decides to exercise this right, a final recommendation based upon the interview and written material will be made by the Board and for\u00ad warded to the Director of Financial Aid for a final decision. For graduate students, the appeal is reviewed by (1) the Graduate Advisor of the student's advanced program and (2) the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, who will make the final recommendations to the Director of Financial Aid for a final decision. Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achievement, and promise. They do not require repayment. Although a few honorary scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excellence alone, many also require that an applicant demonstrate financial need. To be considered for a scholarship, undergraduate students must complete and file a separate Undergraduate Scholarship Application, available from the Financial Aid Office. Filing deadlines vary each year, but the usual deadline is mid-January for the following aca\u00ad demic year. UC IRVINE - 1985-198632 Grants/Loans Regents' scholarships, among the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and exceptional promise, without reference to financial need. Undergraduate students are eligible upon graduation from high school or upon completion of the sophomore year of college. Medical students are eligible dur\u00ad ing any year of their study in medical school. The appoint\u00ad ments range from four years for students entering from high school and first~year medical students, to two years for undergraduate students appointed after their sophomore year. Regents' Scholars receive a $300 honorarium for each year of their appointment. In addition, a stipend is awarded each year to Regents' Scholars who submit a complete_ finan\u00ad cial aid application and demonstrate financial need. University scholarships are offered to\u00b7students entering their freshman Gr junior year who show evidence of high scholas\u00ad tic attainment. Students who demonstrate financial need may receive stipends ranging up to $1,200 per academic year. These stipends are renewable by submitting an application for consideration each year. UCI sponsors 10 National Merit Scholarships. Recipients are selected from a list of finalists who selected UCI as their first college choice on the National Merit Scholarship Application. Annual awards for attendance at UCI are $300. In addition, UCI National Merit Scholars who have demonstrated finan\u00ad cial need will be considered for scholarships up to $2,000 per academic year. Other scholarships are available to students who meet special eligibility requirements. For additional information, contact the Financial Aid Office. For information on ROTC scholarships, see pages 57 and 58. For additional information, contact the Financial Aid Office. Grants Grants are awarded on the basis of financial need.

NOTE: Students may not receive both Cal Grant A and Cal Grant B. If offered both, the Financial Aid Office recommends tak\u00ad ing Cal Grant B over Cal Grant A. Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) pro\u00ad vides grant aid for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens who are undergraduate students and have demonstrated financial need. These federal grants range from $200 to $2,000 per year, depending upon financial need. UC Grant-In-Aid (GIA) is funded by the University of Cali\u00ad fornia and provides grant aid for full-time students who demonstrate financial need. The amount awarded depends upon financial need. Loans Loans are often part of a financial aid award. They provide recipients with an opportunity to defer the cost of their edu\u00ad cation by borrowing when needed and paying later. How\u00ad ever, loan recipients must pay interest on the amount bor\u00ad rowed; interest rates vary from 5 to 12 percent per year. The deferment and cancellation provisions for the loans listed below are contained on the promissory note each recipient must sign and also may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office or lender. A student's loan responsibilities, prior to acceptance of the loan, are to understand the terms of the loan and participate in an entrance interview. After accepting the loan, the re\u00ad cipient must repay the loan in accordance with the repay\u00ad ment schedule, advise the UCI Collections/Disbursements Office (101 Administration Building) upon leaving UCI; par\u00ad ticipate in an exit interview; and provide the Office with a current address after leaving UCI. In case of death or total disability, outstanding loan obligations may be canceled upon presentation of official confirming documents. National Direct Student Loan (NDSL) provides long-term federal loans for U.S. citizens and-eligible noncitizens. The amounts awarded vary, depending on financial need, but can\u00ad not exceed $3,000 for the first two years or $6,000 for the undergraduate years. No interest is charged nor is repayment required while the borrower is enrolled in at least one half of the normal academic load. Interest of five percent a year be\u00ad gins six months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled or is enrolled less than half time, and repayment must be com\u00ad pleted within a 10-year period. Graduate students may receive an aggregate of $12,000 which includes loans received as an undergraduate. University Loan (UNIVL), funded by the University of Cali\u00ad fornia, provides long-term loans to full-time students who demonstrate financial need. The maximum amount for an academic year is $3,000. The five percent interest accrues from the beginning of the repayment period. Repayment begins six months after the student ceases to be enrolled full time and must be completed within five years. Two cosigners are required. Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) requires a separate applica\u00ad tion (contact the Financial Aid Office for application forms). This loan is available to undergraduate, graduate, and medical students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Stu\u00ad dents with a family adjusted gross income above $30,000 must pass a \"need\" test in order to qualify for the federal \u00b7 interest subsidy. Undergraduates may borrow up to $2,500 per year not to exceed a cumulative total of $12,500. Gradu\u00ad ate and medical students may borrow up to $5,000 per year, not to exceed a cumulative total of $25,000 (including under\u00ad graduate loans). Interest of eight percent per year begins to accrue six months after graduation, withdrawal, or less than half-time enrollment. Students who had a Guaranteed Stu\u00ad dent Loan prior to the 1981C82 academic year may continue to borrow at seven percent using a nine-month grace period. A minimum repayment of $50 per month begins after the UC IRVINE - 1985-1986student ceases to be enrolled at least half time. The entire loan must be repaid in 15 years. Both a Guarantee and Origi\u00ad nation Fee will be deducted by the lender from the loan amount. These loans are made by banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions. If the student's lending institution does not participate in this program, the Financial Aid Office can provide a list of participating lenders and their requirements and/or restrictions. California Loans to Assist Students (CLAS) require a separ\u00ad ate application which is available at the Financial Aid Office. This loan program is designed to assist parents of dependent undergraduate students whose family income is in excess of $30,000 and who are unable to demonstrate need for a guaranteed student loan. An. eligible parent may -borrow up to $3,000 each academic year on behalf of each qualified undergraduate. The loan amount may not exceed the net cost of education during the year. Repayment of principal and interest of 12 percent begins 60 days after disbursement of the loan. An independent undergraduate may borrow up to $2,500 each academic year, less any amount obtained under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. Graduate and medical students may borrow up to $3,000 each academic year. Independent undergraduate, graduate, and medical students who continue to remain enrolled full\u00ad time will immediately enter into student deferment status, and the repayment period for these students begins imme\u00ad diately when they drop below full-time enrollment, with\u00ad draw, or graduate. The student borrowe~ remains responsi\u00ad ble for payment of interest during this deferment period. Generally the borrower is allowed at least five years but not more than 10 years to repay the loan. If the student's lending institution does not participate in this program, the Financial Aid Office will forward the student's completed loan application to the California Student Aid Commission for processing. Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) provides educa\u00ad tional loans to medical students. Applicants must be U.S. citi\u00ad zens or permanent residents who are enrolled in or have been accepted for enrollment to the UCI-California College of Medicine. Applicants must be full-time students in good academic standing. A student may borrow up to $20,000 per year. The cumulative maximum is $80,000. The interest rate is tied to 91-day Treasury bills plus 3.5 percent and begins at the time the student signs the promissory note. Repayment of the principal plus interest begins 10 months after comple\u00ad tion of professional training, including internships and resi\u00ad dencies, and must be completed within 10 years. Applications are available at the College's Financial Aid Office. Health Professional Student Loan (HPSL) provides long-term federal loans to medical students. Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The amount of the loan must not exceed the cost of fees plus $2,500 per academic year or the amount of the student's actual financial need, whichever is less. The interest rate is nine percent. Loan repayment begins after a student has completed professional training, including internships and residencies, and must be completed within 10 years. Emergency loans are made from an emergency student loan fund made possible through various philanthropic individuals and organizations. Undergraduate and graduate students who have experienced unanticipated financial problems of a temporary nature may borrow up to $100 without interest or Loans/Work-Study 33 service charge. Medical students may borrow up to $300. During fall quarter only, students may have an emergency loan processed for the amount of their fees. Emergency loans must be repaid within 30 days after disbursement or by the end of the academic quarter, whichever occurs first. Applica\u00ad tions are available in the Financial Aid Office or at the Medi\u00ad cal School Financial Aid Office. This loan is not based on demonstrated financial need. \u00b7work-Study The work-study program offers eligible students who dem\u00ad onstrate need an opportunity to pay for their living and edu\u00ad cational expenses as they occur. It also helps them to avoid a large debt that will have to be repaid after leaving school. Both undergraduate and graduate students are eligible for work-study awards. Medical students must obtain the ap\u00ad proval of the Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs prior to obtaining work-study employment. Students awarded work-study have the choice of obtaining a work\u00ad study job either on campus or off campus at a nonprofit agency. A variety of work opportunities are available, and such part-time work experience can be a valuable asset when seeking employment after graduation. Information about the terms and conditions of work-study employment will be pro\u00ad vided in the UCI Financial Aid Award Guide sent to all UCI students receiving financial aid. Veterans Work-Study Program is available only to U.S. mil\u00ad itary veterans. Separate applications and detailed information are available from the UCI Veterans Student Services Office. Additional Aid for Graduate and Medical Students Most graduate fellowship programs are administered by the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Graduate stu\u00ad dents should contact the Division Office, 145 Administration Building, (714) 856-6761, for information about application procedures for other forms of aid such as graduate fellow\u00ad ships or teaching and research assistantships. College of Medicine students should contact the Medical Stu\u00ad dent Financial Aid Coordinator, 125 Medical Surge I, College of Medicine, (714) 856-6476, for information about other sources of financial assistance. UC IRVINE - 1985-198634 Undergraduate Admissions/Freshman Standing Aid for International Students Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens may be eligible for assistance from a limited number of University programs if they have experienced an unanticipated change in their financial situation. The financial change must be fully documented. These students must complete at least two years at UCI in order to be considered for assistance. Priority will be given to students who will be receiving their degrees during the current academic year. Financial aid is limited to the expenses\u00b7 for books and fees. Aid for Disabled Students All forms of student financial aid are available to eligible dis\u00ad abled students. Interested students should follow the regular financial aid application procedures and should be sure to specify on the Student Aid Application for California any additional expenses they may incur because of a disability. Supporting documentation must be provided. Student Employment The Career Planning and Placement Center assists UCI stu\u00ad dents and their spouses in obtaining part-or full-time employment during the academic year and summer vacation. It is not necessary to be a financial aid recipient to apply for jobs through the Center. Students with work-study awards also may obtain on-campus or off-campus job referrals in the Career Planning and Placement Center. The Center is located in Student Services I. Undergraduate Admissions The Office of Admissions welcomes inquiries on any aspect of becoming eligible for the University of California and on planning for transfer. Admissions counselors are available by appointment in 245 Administration Building, and inquiries may be addressed to the Office of Admissions, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. General informa\u00ad tion on application filing is available by telephoning (714) 856-6703; for specific questions regarding admission or eligi\u00ad bility, telephone (714) 856-6705. The University's undergraduate admission requirements, which are the same on all campuses, are based on two princi\u00ad ples: (I) the best predictor of success in the University is high scho!arship in previous work, and (2) the study of certain sub\u00ad jects in high school gives a student good preparation for Uni\u00ad versity work. The information on admission to UCI given below is organ\u00ad ized as follows: Categories of Application Admission to Freshman Standing New Freshman Admission Requirements Effective Fall Quarter, 1986 Admission to Advanced Standing Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission to International Students Application Procedures Additional Information Categories of Application An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to com\u00ad plete a program of studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from high school or has completed a California Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency, an equivalent proficiency examination from another state, or the General Educational Development (GED) Certifi\u00ad cate, but has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions immediately fol\u00ad lowing graduation are excluded in the determination of freshman status. An advanced standing (transfer) applicant is a high school graduate who has been a registered student in a regular or extension session of a college or university other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. An intercampus transfer applicant is an undergraduate stu\u00ad dent whois currently or was previously registered in a regu\u00ad lar session at another campus of the University of California and has not been registered in another collegiate institution. See page 55. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal permanent residence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California res\u00ad idents. Refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section for further information. An applicant for readmission is a student who was formerly registered and enrolled on the Irvine campus and who has interrupted the completion of consecutive quarters of enroll\u00ad ment. See pages 54 and 55. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. A University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) applicant is an accelerated high school student who wishes to pursue a particular subject beyond the level offered by the high school or perhaps an area of interest not offered by the high school in which the student meets the necessary pre\u00ad requisites. Scholars enroll in one or two courses on a reduced-fee basis concurrently with high school courses. Admission to Freshman Standing The University defines a freshman applicant as a student who has graduated from high school or completed a Califor\u00ad nia Certificate of Proficiency or the equivalent and who has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level insti\u00ad tution. Summer sessions are excluded in the determination. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer ahead to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. Freshmen applicants who have not yet decided on a major should refer to the section on Planning an Undergraduate Program. Applicants who do not meet the scholarship requirements for\u00b7 admission or do not qualify by examination at the time of high school graduation may be admitted after they meet the requirements for admission in advanced standing (see p. 38). Advanced standing credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if completed after the tenth grade and if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college or com\u00ad munity college which conducted the course. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Requirements To be eligible for admission to the University as a freshman, an applicant must meet the Subject, Scholarship, and Exami\u00ad nation requirements. It is also possible to qualify for admis\u00ad sion by examination alone, as explained in the section Admis\u00ad sion by Examination Alone. Subject (\"A Through F\") Requirement . To satisfy this requirement, students must have successfully completed a specific sequence of high school courses in the following subjects. (Students applying for freshman entrance for fall quarter, 1986 should read the section on New Fresh\u00ad man Admission Requirements for additional information.) Students must complete certain high school courses with at least a grade of C in each semester of each course in the fol\u00ad lowing subject areas. This course sequence is often called \"a through f\" pattern and must appear on a list of courses that high school principals certify meet University requirements. This list is called \"Courses to Meet Requirements for Admis\u00ad sion to the University of California\" and can be obtained from school counselors. The Office of Admissions will determine the equivalency of courses for graduates of out-of\u00ad State high schools. a. History- I year One year* of United States history, or one-half year of United States history and one-half year of civics or American government, taken in the ninth grade or later. b. English-4 years Four years of English: composition and/or literature, univer\u00ad sity preparatory in nature. All English courses taken must require frequent and regular practice in writing expository prose compositions of some length. Not more than one u_mt of certified English as a second language (ESL) courses will be accepted. Also, not more than two semesters of ninth grade English will be accepted. c. Mathematics-2 years Two years of mathematics: algebra, geometry, trigonom!\"try, calculus, elementary functions, and mathematical analysis. Courses such as arithmetic and business mathematics are not accepted. d. Laboratory-! year A year course in one laboratory science, taken in the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade. e. Foreign Language-2 years Two years of one foreign language. Any foreign language with a written literature may be used. f. Advanced Course- I or 2 years This requirement must be satisfied by one of the following: I. Mathematics A total of one year of advanced mathematics: intermediate algebra, trigonometry, or other comparable mathematics courses; or, 2. Foreign Language Either an additional year in the same language used for \"e\" above or two years of a second foreign language; or, 3. Science A year course in any laboratory science completed in addi\u00ad tion to the laboratory science used for \"d\" above. The subject requirement can be fulfilled with 11 or 12 high school units. Grades in these courses are the only grades used in calculating the grade point average. However, the University requires all applicants (except those with a Certifi- A year course in high school is equivalent to one credit/unit. Undergraduate Admissions/Freshman Standing 35 cate of Proficiency-seep. 43) to complete at least 16 units. Thus, 3-4 units can be taken in elective courses, which pro\u00ad vide an excellent opportunity to strengthen preparation for the University. Additional courses in mathematics and science are essential in the preparation for majors in engineering, mathematics, the sciences, and many other fields of study. Scholarship Requirement Students who attain a grade point average of 3.30 (where the letter grade A= 4, B = 3, and C = 2) in \"a-f\" courses taken after the ninth grade will be eligible to enter the Umvers1ty regardless of their scores on standardized tests. Students with grade point averages below 3.30 but greater than 2.77 will be admitted to the University if they achieve specified scores on the standardized test. (See the Eligibility Index.) Grades received in courses taken in the ninth grade or earlier are not used in determining the scholarship average, although subject requirements (except laboratory science) may be satisfied with grades of Cor better in these courses. If students successfully complete more than the minimum units within each required subject, only the best grades are used in calculating their grade point average. Grades are counted on a semester basis unless a school gives only year grades. Any a-f course in which a student received a grade of D or F must be repeated with a higher grade or, in sequential areas of mathematics, chemistry, and foreign languages only, vali\u00ad dated by successful completion of advanced course work. Honors-Level Courses The University encourages students to take demanding advanced courses in all fields while in high school. Accord\u00ad ingly, for students graduating from high school in 1984 and after, grades earned in up to four units (eight semester courses) of work in courses that are (a) certified by the high school as offered at the honors level and (b) taken in the last two years of high school will be counted on a scale of A = 5, B = 4, and C = 3 grade points. These courses must be in the areas of history, Enghsh, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, and foreign language and must be certified by the high school as offered at the honors level. Courses in these subjects that are designed to prepare students for an Advanced Placement examination of the College Board and college courses that are transferable to the University are acceptable as honors-level courses. Examination Requirement All freshman applicants must submit test scores as described below. Applicants for admission to the fall quarter should take the tests by December or January of the senior year, if possible, so that the scores will be available to the Admissions Offices on those UC campuses where enrollment demands are expected to be heavy. When preliminary screening of fresh\u00ad man applications is necessary in oversubscribed majors, hav~ng available scores from tests administered prior to December ll!ds the review process. The following tests are required: I. One Aptitude Test -Either: ' A. The Scholastic Aptitude Test-SAT-(the verbal and mathematics scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting); or B. The American College Test-ACT- composite score. 2. Three College Board Achievement Tests, which must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics, level 1 or 2, and (c) one from among English literature, foreign languages, sciences, or social studies. The Achievement Test in Litera\u00ad ture may not be substituted for the English composition test. UC IRVINE - 1985-198636 Undergraduate Admissions/Freshman Standing/New Admission Requirements Admission by Examination Alone A student can qualify as a freshman by examination alone. The required total score on the SAT is 1,100. (If ACT is pre- sented, the minimum score is 26.) Also, the student's total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,650 or higher, or at least 1,730 if a nonresident of Califor- nia, with no scoreless than 500 on any individual Achieve- ment Test. If a student achieves the required scores, and the scores are available to UCI before the high school transcript is evaluated, the campus may be able to expedite notification of admission status. This option does not apply to students who will have completed more than 12 transferable units prior to admission. The College Board Achievement Tests cannot be taken in academic subjects covered by transferable college courses a student may have taken. Eligibility Index Applicants are admissible if their a-f grade average and test score totals are higher than the combinations below: A-F ACT* or SAT** A-F ACT* or SAT** CPA Composite Total CPA Composite Total 2.78 35 1600 3.05 22 970 2.79 35 1580 3.06 21 950 2.80 34 1550 3.07 21 920 2.81 34 1530 3.08. 20 900 2.82 33 1510 3.09 19 880 2.83 33 1480 3.10 18 850 2.84 33 1460 3.11 18 830 2.85 32 1440 3.12 17 810 2.86 32 1410 3.13 16 780 2.87 32 1390 3.14 15 760 2.88 31 1370 3.15 14 740 2.89 31 1340 3.16 14 710 2.90 30 1320 3.17 13 690 2.91 30 1300 3.18 12 670 2.92 29 1270 3.19 11 640 2.93 29 1250 3.20 10 620 2.94 28 1230 3.21 9 600 2.95 28 1200 3.22 9 570 2.96 27 1180 3.23 8 550 2.97 27 1160 3.24 8 530 2.98 26 1130 3.25 7 500 2.99 26 1110 3.26 7 480 3.00 25 1090 3.27 6 460 3.01 25 1060 3.28 6 430 24 1040 3.29 5 410 3.03 24 1020 3.30 5 400 3.04 23 990 ACT is scored in intervals of 1 point from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 35. **SAT is scored in intervals of 10 points from a minimum of 400 to a maximum of 1,600. Admission to the University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) The opportunity to enroll in University classes concurrent, usually, with the senior year of high school is available to cer\u00ad tain accelerated students (see p. 34). Admission to UPHSS is based upon a combination of criteria including grades, specific preparation in the field of interest, standardized test scores, recommendations, and statement of purpose. Through UPHSS, qualified high school students may enroll in UC Irvine courses, receive grades based on the same standards as full-time students, and receive full University of California credit for their work. To continue at UC Irvine after high school graduation, a UPHSS student nee_d only complete a change-of-major peti-tion and enroll as a full-time student. Also, UPHSS status entitles students to Intercampus Transfer (ICT) privileges should they decide to attend another campus of the Univer\u00ad sity of California after high school graduation. High school students wishing more information about the Program should contact the Office of Admissions or their high school counselor. New Freshman Admission Requirements Effective Fall Quarter, 1986 Students who graduate from high school in 1986 and after will have to meet the following new admission requirements. The intent of the new requirements is to increase the level of academic preparation of entering students. This increased preparation is expected in turn to improve students' chances for success at the University, widen their choice of career options, and ease the transition from high school to Univer\u00ad sity work. 1. UC Subject Requirement A minimum of 16 units of high school work must be com\u00ad pleted during grades 9 through 12. (A one-year course is equal to one unit; a one-semester course is equal to one\u00ad half unit.) Fifteen of the 16 high school units required for admission to the University will have to be earned in aca\u00ad demic or college-preparatory courses in English, mathe\u00ad matics, laboratory science, foreign language, history, social science, and fine arts. Also, at least seven of the fifteen units must have been earned in courses taken during the last two years of high school. These required courses are often called the \"a through f\" subjects. To meet the sub\u00ad ject requirement, these courses must appear on a certified course list which is available in the high schools for Cali\u00ad fornia applicants. The Office of Admissioh will review and accept courses that meet the requirements for applicants graduating from out-of-State schools. Specific \"A through F\" course requirements a. History: 1 unit One year of United States history or one\u00ad half year of civics or American government b. English: 4 units Four years of college-preparatory English-composition and literature (All English courses must require frequent and regular prac\u00ad tice in writing expository prose compositions of some length. Only two semesters of a certified English as a Second Lan\u00ad guage (ESL) course will be accepted. Also, not more than two semesters of ninth grade English will be accepted for this requirement.) c. Mathematics: 3 units Three years of mathematics\u00ad elementary algebra, geometry, and intermediate algebra (Mathematics courses taken in grades 7 and 8 may be used to meet part of this requirement if they are accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own courses.) d. Laboratory Science: 1 unit A year course in one laboratory science, taken in the tenth grade or later e. Foreign Language: 2 units Two years of one foreign lan\u00ad guage in courses that provide instruction in grammar, vocab\u00ad ulary, reading, and composition, and that emphasize the development of aural and oral skills (Foreign language courses taken in grades 7 and 8 may be used to meet this requirement if they are accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own courses.) UC IRVINE - 1985-1986f. College-Preparatory Electives: 4 units Four units in addi\u00ad tion to those required in \"a\" through \"e\" above, to be chosen from at least two of the following subject areas: history, Eng\u00ad lish, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, foreign lan\u00ad guage, social science, and visual and performing arts. Stu\u00ad dents are urged to consult their high school counselor in the selection of course work to fulfill this requirement. The general objective of the elective program is to improve the student's analytical ability, promote their artistic devel\u00ad opment, and strengthen their oral and writing skills. Electives should involve considerable reading and writing in an amount . appropriate to the course and the subject matter. The emphasis in elective courses should be to prepare for future college-level work. Courses satisfying the \"f\" requirement: History: All history courses should require extensive reading and writing. Courses should enable students to establish a breadth of understanding of history (for example, world his\u00ad tory, political history, or economic history) and should pro\u00ad vide an understanding of the human past, including its rela\u00ad tion to the present. Courses should develop a student's criti\u00ad cal thinking, ability to evaluate historical data, and ability to analyze and synthesize evidence. English: All English courses should require substantial read\u00ad ing with frequent and extensive practice in writing which is carefully evaluated and criticized. A course in journalism, speech, debate, or drama is acceptable if it meets the rigor in reading and writing stated above. Advanced Mathematics: Courses in mathematics with second\u00ad year algebra as a prerequisite such as trigonometry, linear algebra, precalculus (analytic geometry and mathematical analysis), calculus, probability, and statistics are acceptable electives. . A computer, science course is an acceptable mathematics elec\u00ad tive if it fulfills the following objectives, The course should enable each student to express algorithms in a standard com\u00ad puter language such as PASCAL, BASIC FORTRAN, or COBOL. By the end of the course each student should com\u00ad plete substantial programming projects in the language used. The course should also involve the study and mastery of various aspects of computer science: how computers deal with data and instructions, the internal components of a computer, and the underlying computer logic. Laboratory Science: A laboratory science course should be a course in the biological or physical sciences in which students make their own observations and measurements and analyze these data to obtain further information. On average the laboratory activities should involve an amount of time equiv\u00ad alent to at least one full class period per week. A science course in the ninth grade is an acceptable science elective provided it is designed to prepare students for labora\u00ad tory science courses in the tenth grade and beyond. The course must provide an introduction to the fundamental principles of physical and biological science. Laporatory activi\u00ad ties as defined above shall be included. A terminal course designed only to meet graduation requirements is not an acceptable science elective. Foreign Language: It is recommended that elective courses be in the same language used to satisfy the foreign language \"e\" subject requirement. Elective courses in this language must have at least two years of the language as prerequisite. In order for a second language to qualify as an elective, at least two years of this language must be completed. Social Science: Courses should be in one of the social sciences: anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psy-New Admission Requirements 37 chology, or sociology, or, alternatively, should be interdiscipli\u00ad nary courses drawing knowledge from two or more of these fields. Course objectives should include as many of the fol\u00ad lowing as are applicable to the field: (I) to understand the development and basic features of major societies and cul\u00ad tures, (2) to examine the historic and contemr.orary ideas that have shaped the world, (3) to understand the fundamentals of how differing political and economic systems function, (4) to examine the nature and principles of individual and group behavior, and (5) to study social science methodologies. In order to develop a student's critical thinking, ability to evaluate ideas and information, and ability to analyze and synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence in the labora\u00ad tory and in the field, a social science course must include a body of basic knowledge, extensive reading, and written and oral exposition. Courses which are designed to meet State-mandated social studies graduation requirements are acceptable provided that they meet the above criteria. Courses of an applied, service, or vocational character are not acceptable social science electives. Visual and Performing Arts: Courses in this area consist of instruction in dance, drama/theatre, music, and the visual arts. Courses should give specific attention to as many of the fundamental arts components as possible, including the per\u00ad ceptual, the creative, the historical, or the critical as are applicable. \u00b7 Courses should enable students to understand and appreciate artistic expression and, where appropriate, to talk and write with discrimination about the artistic material studied. Courses devoted to developing creative artistic ability and those devoted to artistic performance should have prerequi\u00ad sites (either course work or experience approved by the instructor) and should assume proficiency beyond the intro\u00ad ductory level. Courses must require on average the equivalent of a five\u00ad period class per week. Work outside of class must be required; for example, portfolio/performance preparation, reading, writing, or critical listening/viewing. Dance courses offered for physical education credit or under any other departmental arrangement are acceptable provided they include content satisfying the above criteria. Courses which are primarily recreational, athletic, or body conditioning are not acceptable visual and performing arts electives. 2. Scholarship Requirement In calculating an applicant's grade point average for admis\u00ad sion, the University will use only the grades earned in the \"a through f\" courses taken in grades 10 through 12. These grades are counted as follows: A = 4 points, B = 3 points, and C = 2 points. (The grades earned in \"a through f\" subjects taken in ninth grade or earlier are not used to calculate the grade point average for admission. However, these courses will be used to meet the Subject Requirement if they are completed with grades of C or better.) a. An applicant must have earned a grade of C or better in all high school courses used to satisfy the \"a\" through \"e\" requirements. The grades earned in these courses that are taken in grades 10 through 12 will be used to compute the grade point average for admission, except that the grades earned in the third year of mathematics required under \"c\" above (intermediate algebra) will be used only if they improve the applicant's grade point average. UC IRVINE - 1985-198638 Admission in Advanced Standing b. Two of the four units in elective courses used to satisfy the \"f\" requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better, and all four units must be accepted by the high school for graduation. The best grades earned in any two of these units taken in grades 10 through 12 will be used in computing the applicant's grade point average for admission. c. The University wants to encourage students to take demanding, advanced academic courses in high school. Grades earned in up to four units of work in ~ourses that are (a) certified by the high school as offered at an honors level, and (b) taken in the last two years of high school will be given extra weight in computing the grade point aver\u00ad age for admission. Grades in honors courses will be counted as follows: A = 5 points, B = 4 points, and C = 3 points. To be counted, these grades must have been earned in honors courses in history, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, and foreign language. Courses in these subjects designed to prepare students for the Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board and transferable college courses are examples of honors-level courses. California Residents: Applicants whose grade point average is 3.3 or higher in the\" a through f\" subjects taken after the ninth grade will be eligible for admission to the University regardless of the scores on the Standardized tests used for the Examination Requirement. Applicants whose grade point average is below 3.3 but greater than 2. 77 will be eligible if they achieve the composite or total test score specified on the Eligibility Index on page 36. Applicants must have completed all of the \"a through f\" su,bjects satisfactorily. Nonresidents of California: The grade point average must be a 3.4 or higher in the \"a through f\" subjects regardless of the Scholastic Aptitude Test or American College Test scores. 3. Examination Requirement All freshman applicants must submit the following test scores: a. One aptitude test-either: A. Scholastic Aptitude Test-SAT -(the verbal and mathematics scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting); or B. The American College Test-ACT -composite score and b. Three College Board Achievement Tests, which must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics, level 1 or 2, and (c) one from among English literature, foreign lan\u00ad guages, sciences, or social studies. The Achievement Test in Literature may not be substituted for the English Com\u00ad position test. 4. Admission by Examination Alone-Refer to page 36 for detailed information. Admission in Advanced Standing The University defines an advanced standing (transfer) appli\u00ad cant as a high school graduate who has been a registered stu\u00ad dent in another college or university or in college-level exten\u00ad sion classes other than a summer session immediately follow\u00ad ing high school graduation. An advanced standing applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. Advanced standing applicants who are not residents of Cali\u00ad fornia should refer to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. Advanced Standing Admission Requirements The requirements for admission in advanced standing vary according to the high school record. Advanced standing appli\u00ad cants who have completed a California Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency or the equivalent must also meet regular University entrance requirements. In any case, if fewer than 12 units have been completed since high school graduation, the exam\u00ad ination requirements for freshmen also apply. Nonresident applicants must also meet additional requirements discussed in the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. The transcript submitted from the last college attended must show, as a minimum, that the student was in good standing and had earned a grade point average1 of 2.00 or better. If the grade point average fell below 2.00 at any one college attended, the student may have to meet additional require\u00ad ments in order to qualify for admission. An advanced standing applicant must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. A student who met the Eligibility Index and completed all the \"a through f\" courses in high school may be admitted any time after establishing an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better. If a student has completed less than 12 quarter or semester units of transferable college credit since high school graduation, the student must also satisfy the examination requirement for freshmen. 2. A student who met the Eligibility Index but had not studied one or more of the required courses in high school may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better in another college or university; and b. completed, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in the high school subjects lacked; and c. completed 12 or more quarter or semester transferable units, or met the examination requirement for freshmen. 3. A student who was not eligible for admission as a fresh\u00ad man because the Eligibility Index was not met or a combina\u00ad tion of not meeting the Eligibility Index and lacking the required subjects, may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.40 or better in another college or university; and b. completed 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of college credit in courses accepted by the University for transfer; and c. completed one of the following two options: 1. Appropriate college courses, with grades of Cor better in the \"a through f\" subjects that the student lacked. Up to two units of high school work in \"a through f\" subjects will be waived, but transfer applicants must have satisfied the freshman admission requirements of four years of college-preparatory English and two years of mathematics (part of the \"a through f\" requirements), or 'The grade point average is determined by dividing the total number of acceptable units attempted into the number of grade points earned on those units. A student may repeat courses completed with a grade lower than Cup to a maximum of 16 quarter units without penalty. The scholarship standard is expressed by a system of grade points and grade point averages earned in courses accepted by the Univer\u00ad sity for advanced standing credit. Grade points are assigned as fol\u00ad lows: for each unit of A, 4 points; B, 3 points; C 2 points; D, 1 point; I and F, no points; P/NP, no points but are included in the unit total. UC IRVINE - 1985-19862. With a grade of C or better, (1) one college course in mathematics which has algebra I as a prerequisite; the course may be geometry, algebra II, or a more advanced course and does not have to be transferable; (2) one transferable course in English; and (3) one transferable course selected from U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language. Students considering admission in advanced standing should refer to page 45. Admission for a Second Bachelor's Degree Some students may wish to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. Admission as a candidate for a second bachelor's degree requires that the applicant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admissions are subject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or program in which the second degree will be earned. Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates dur\u00ad ing a regular academic quarter should complete an Applica\u00ad tion for Undergraduate Admission and a Supplementary Information for Second Baccalaureate Applicants form, avail\u00ad able from the Office of Admissions. Students who have attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and complete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. Nonresident Admission Requirements NOTE: Admission requirements for applicants who are not California residents vary slightly from requirements for Cali\u00ad fornia residents. Nonresident Admission \u00b739 Nonresident Freshman Applicant A nonresident freshman applicant must (1) graduate from a regionally or state-accredited high school, or complete an appropriate proficiency examination (see p. 43); (2) complete satisfactorily the \"a through f\" pattern of subject require\u00ad ments listed under requirements for California residents; (3) earn a grade point average of at least 3.40 or higher in the required high school subjects (3.00 is equal to a B average); and (4) meet the examination requirement: one Aptitude Test-either the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) (verbal and mathematics scores must be from the same sitting) or the American College Test (ACT) composite score-AND three College Board Achievement Tests which must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics, level 1 or 2, and (c) one from among English literature, foreign languages, sciences, or social studies. (The Achievement Test in Litera\u00ad ture may not be substituted for the English composition test.) Please note that the Freshman Eligibility Index applies to California residents only. To be admitted by examination alone, a nonresident applicant must score either 1,100 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 26 on the American College Test. The total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,730 or higher with a score of at least 500 on each test. Nonresident Advanced Standing Applicant A student wh~lnet the admission requirements for freshman admission as a nonresident must have a grade point average of 2.80 or higher in college courses that are accepted by the University for transfer credit. UC IRVINE - 1985-198640 International Student Admission A nonresident applicant who graduated from high school with less than a 3.40 grade point average in the subjects required for freshman admission must have completed at least 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of transferable work with a grade point average of 2.80 or higher. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of that work, two units of the required high school subjects may be waived but transfer applicants must have satisfied the freshman entrance requirements of four years of college-preparatory English and two years of mathematics (part of the \"a through f\" requirements). A stu\u00ad dent who lacked any of the required subjects in high school must complete, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate col\u00ad lege courses in those subjects, or (1) one college course in mathematics which has algebra I as a prerequisite (the course may be geometry, algebra II, or a more advanced course and does not have to be transferable), (2) one transferable course in English, and (3) one course in U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language which is transferable to the University of California. Exceptions to Nonresident Admission Requirements For admission purposes only, a person residing outside of Cali\u00ad fornia may be determined by the Office of Admissions to be a bona fide resident and may be considered under California resident admission requirements if the applicant: is a spouse of a University of California faculty member; is a spouse of military personnel assigned to California; is a military dependent who has been granted a nonresident fee waiver; is an immigrant who has lived in California for a year and has chosen California as a place of residence; is a minor applicant whose parent or legal guardian appears to be a legal resident of California (as determined by the University for tuition purposes); has spent any two years or the last term enrolled in a California high school; has spent the last term (in at least 12 transferable units) enrolled in an accredited California col\u00ad lege or university; has been physically present in California continuously for at least one year prior to the quarter for which registration is requested; or if one parent has received a degree from the University of California or is a full-time employee of the University of California. Nonresident Tuition Fee Refer to page 26 for information regarding residence classifi\u00ad cation for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. Bona fide residents are still held for Nonresident Tuition. Admission of International Students The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant\u00ad a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States-are evaluated in accordance with the gen\u00ad eral regulations governing admission. However, it is possible that international applicants to oversubscribed programs may not be offered admission to either their first-choice campus or to another University of California campus. An applica\u00ad tion, official certificates, and detailed transcripts of records should be submitted to the Office of Admissions early in the appropriate application filing period. This will allow time for exchange of necessary correspondence and, if the applicant is admitted, will help the student in obtaining the necessary passport visa. International applicants whose native language is other than English will be required to demonstrate their English profi\u00ad ciency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a min: imum score of 550 on the Test of English as a Foreign Lan\u00ad guage (TOEFL). The admission of otherwise eligible appli-cants who do not meet this requirement will be deferred until it is possible for them to demonstrate an adequate level of English ability. Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made by writing directly to TOEFL, Educational Testing Ser\u00ad vice, P.O. Box 899, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. Students must request the Educational Testing Service to forward results of their tests to the Office of Admissions. Completion of an acceptable English composition course (as determined by the Office of Admissions) with a grade of Cor better will also clear the English proficiency requirement for interna\u00ad tional applicants. Prospective students who wish to improve their English pro\u00ad ficiency to meet the TOEFL requirement may enroll in the intensive Program in English as a Second Language spon\u00ad sored by University Extension. Requests for information should be addressed to Program in English as a Second Lan\u00ad guage, University of California Extension, P.O. Box AZ, Irvine, CA 92716. See page 57 for additional information. In addition to achieving a minimum TOEFL score of 550, all international students must take an English as a Second Lan\u00ad guage Placement Test upon arrival and prior to registration. Based upon the results of this test, students may be required to improve certain language skills by enrolling in English as a Second Language courses during the freshman year with other major course work being adjusted accordingly. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the Uni\u00ad versity are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa student. International students must provide proof that sufficient funds will be available to meet their educational commit\u00ad ments while studying in the United States. International undergraduate students are considered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay the nonresident tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of California. Please direct all inquiries regarding the undergraduate admis\u00ad sion of international students to the Office of Admissions. English Language Proficiency of Permanent Resident, Refugee, and International (F-1 Visa) Students: English as a Second Language Any permanent resident, refugee, or international student whose first or native language is other than English and who has a score on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) of 350 or less, or any such student without a ver\u00ad bal SAT score, must, regardless of the studenfs TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score, take an English as a Second Language (ESL) Placement Test prior to the first quarter of enrollment. The placement test is given prior to the beginning of each quarter, during Student-Parent Orien\u00ad tation Program (SPOP) weekends in the summer, and during Academic Advising and Orientation (\"0\") Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter instruction. Information concerning when and where the test will be given and the test itself can be obtained from the Program of Academic Support Services Office (telephone 714-856-6206) and the Office of English as a Second Language (telephone 714-856-6781). Based upon the results of the ESL Placement Test, students may be required to enroll in ESL courses prior to enrolling in any other required writing courses. Students required to enroll in ESL courses must begin satisfying their ESL requirements within their first or second quarter at UCI. They must take these courses in consecutive quarters. The ESL requirements are to be completed within the first six quarters at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the ESL requirement by the end of their sixth quarter will be ineligi- UC IRVINE - 1985-1986ble to enroll for a seventh quarter at UCI. Subject A must be taken the quarter following the completion of ESL require\u00ad ments. If the ESL requirements are completed in the first quarter, the Subject A time limit applies. ESL courses, offered by the School of Humanities, include classes in writing, speaking and listening, and reading and vocabulary development. See page I59 for course descriptions. Credit for English-as-a-Second-Language Course Work Students whose first language is not English may receive up to 12 baccalaureate credits for English-as-a-second-language course work. Students may receive workload credit for courses taken beyond this I2-unit limit but will not receive additional credits applicable to the bachelor's degree. Credit for Native Language Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and literature, provided such courses were completed on the college level in the country of the vernacular, or on the upper-division or graduate level at UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution. Application Procedures Application Filing Periods Application packets for undergraduate admission to the Uni\u00ad versity are available from the counseling office of any Cali\u00ad fornia high school or community college, or from any Uni\u00ad versity of California Admissions Office.

Students required to fulfill the examination requirements for freshman admis\u00ad sion should make arrangements to take the standardized tests early. Further information and details about the application proce\u00ad dures are available from the UCI Office of Admissions or in the 1986-87 Undergraduate Application Packet. Educational Opportunity Program Applicants who wish to be considered for the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) should refer to page 23for sup\u00ad plementary application procedures. Change of Campus If, after applying for admission, the student's plans change and he or she prefers to attend a different campus of the University, the student should write to the Admissions Office of the preferred campus. Transcripts The Office of Admissions requires complete, accurate, and -up-to-date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. The transcript and other doc-Application Procedures 41 uments submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they cannot be returned or for\u00ad warded in any form to another college or university. All applicants are responsible for requesting that the high schools from which they graduated and each college attended send official transcripts of work promptly to the UCI Office of Admissions. Applicants should request that transcripts be sent at the same time they file their application for.admission to the University. If a student is applying for admission as a freshman, a pre\u00ad liminary transcript (sixth semester) showing work through the junior year should be requested from the high school. The transcript should list the courses the student is now tak\u00ad ing and those the student plans to take. (A seventh-semester transcript is not usually required; however, the Office of Admissions may request one if it is needed to complete an evaluation of an applicant's eligibility at that time.) A final transcript that includes courses and grades for the senior year and a statement of graduation or a California Certificate of Proficiency, a proficiency test from another state, or a General Education Development (GED) Certificate must also be provided. A transcript from the last college attended is required if any college courses are completed before or at the time of high school graduation . Those applying for admission in advanced standing should have their graduating high school send a transcript im\u00ad mediately to the Office of Admissions which will also need a transcript from each college attended. A preliminary tran\u00ad script from the present college should list the courses cur\u00ad rently in progress and those planned before transfer. Attendance at any other schools or colleges after application to the University has been filed is considered to be part of the record and must be reported to the Office of Admissions. UC IRVINE - 1985-198642 Additional Information Examination Arrangements Students should make arrangements to take the required tests with the College Board, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, California 94704, or P.O. Box 592, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 for SAT and Achievement Tests. For the ACT, stu\u00ad dents should write to the AmericaQ College Testing Program Registration Unit, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, Iowa 52240. (Test fees should be paid to the testing services, not the Univer\u00ad sity.) At the same time the test is taken, students should request that their scores be reported to the Office of Admis\u00ad sions. To prevent confusion or unnecessary delay, it is impor\u00ad tant to use precisely the same form of the student's name on both the application for admission and the test materials. Also, final notification of admission cannot be released until scores have been received by the Office of Admissions. in 1985-86 SAT and Achievement Tests will be offered con\u00ad currently on the following Saturday mornings: October 12, 1985 (SAT only January 25, 1986 in California, Florida, Georgia, March 15, 1986 (SAT only) lllinois, North Carolina, South May 3, 1986 Carolina, and Texas) November 2, 1985 June 7' 1986 December 7, 198.5 The 1985-86 ACT Tests will be offered on the following dates: October 26, 1985 December 14, 1985 February 8, 1986 April12, 1986 June 14, 1986 Details on testing are available from the College Board, the American College Testing Program, and from most high school counseling offices. Notification of Admission Candidates for the fall quarter will be notified whether their applications have been retained for consideration at UCI immediately after they are received. Most candidates who applied early in the filing period will receive notice of their admissibility by April 15. (There are similar notification peri\u00ad ods for other quarters.) Delays will occur if required records have not been received by the Office of Admissions. Since each application is considered individually, the length of time before notification is subject to some variation depending upon the unique circumstances of each applicant. If offered admission by the University, a student will be asked to sign and return a Statement of Intention to Register, accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $50. This amount will be applied toward payment of University fees, provided the student enrolls in the quarter to which the student has been admitted. Admission fo UCI is nof an assurance of financial aid nor does if guarantee assignment fo University housing. Separate applications are required of applicants desiring financial aid or University hous\u00ad ing, and receipt of communications from the Financial Aid Office, the Housing Office, or any office other than the Admissions Office does nof imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Part-Time Study UCI offers several possibilities to pursue part-time study for credit leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree. Part\u00ad time study opportunities are available in academic units in which there exists good educational reason, as determined by the academic unit, to allow part-time study. For part-time study, quarterly course enrollment is limited to 10 units or less for undergraduate students and to 8 units or less for graduate students; these limits include physical education units. The same admissions standards that apply to full-time stu\u00ad dents apply to part-time students. Under University policy, academic deans (the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, for graduate students) may approve Petitions for Part-Time Status for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, or health. In approved part-time status, one-half of the Educational Fee and one-half of the Nonresident Tuition (if applicable) are assessed. Undergraduate petitions are available from aca\u00ad demic counselors or the Registrar's office; graduate students may obtain further information and petitions from the Divi\u00ad sion of Graduate Studies and Research. Since there are cer\u00ad tain restrictions on receiving undergraduate credit for part\u00ad time course work, undergraduates interested in part-time study should read, in addition to the Undergraduate Admis\u00ad sions section, the sections on Expenses and Fees, and Finan\u00ad cial Aid. Graduate students should refer to the Graduate Studies and Research section. Additional Information Recommended Subjects Many University programs require or recommend spedfic preparatory subjects to give students the needed background in their chosen fields of study. The lack of such preparation, particularly for advanced standing students, may delay graduation from the University. Details about these recom\u00ad mendations can be found in Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects, a University publication sent each year to high school and community college counselors. Subject A and American History and Institutions To be eligible for a bachelor's degree from UC Irvine, stu\u00ad dents must meet a number of requirements, including those of the University of California, the Irvine campus, and the individual school and major. There are two requirements\u00ad Subject A (English Composition) and American History and Institutions-which all University of California students must satisfy in order to graduate. For specific information on these requirements and ways to satisfy them before entrance to UCI, refer to page 49. College-Level Courses The University gives unit credit to students for courses they have completed in other accredited colleges or universities. To be accepted for unit credit, the courses must be consistent with those offered by the University. All applicants with questions regarding transfer of credit should contact the Office of Admissions. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) The University does not grant credit for the Coll~ge Level Examination Program. Advanced Placement The University wishes to encourage students to take demanding advanced courses in all fields. Accordingly, for students graduating from ~igh school in 1984 or thereafter, the grades in up to four units taken in the last two years of high school will be counted on a scale of A = 5, B = 4, C = 3 if these courses are certifiedby the high school as being offered at an honors level. These honors courses, which include Advanced Placement courses, must be in the areas of U.S. history, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, and foreign language. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986In addition to honors grade points, the University grants 10 quarter units of elective credit toward the bachelor's degree for each Advanced Placement examination passed with a score of 3, 4, or 5. (Exceptions: five quarter units are given for the Computer Science exam, for the Mathematics AB exam, for each Latin exam, and for Physics C, Part 1, 2; 10 units are given for one or both of the English, Music, Studio Art, and Physics B nnd C exams.) The chart below shows Advanced Placement credit in satisfaction of UCI breadth and gradua\u00ad tion requirements. Additional use of Advanced Placement credit often is made on an individual basis. For information on the UCI breadth requirement, please consult pages 50 through 52. High School Proficiency Examination The University of California will accept the California Certif\u00ad icate of Proficiency, awarded by the State Department of Education upon successful completion of the California High School Proficiency Examination, in lieu of the regular high school diploma. The University also will accept proficiency examinations from other states and the General Educational Development (GED) examination results in place of a diploma. However, all other University entrance require\u00ad ments (subject pattern, grades, tests) must be met. The date of high school graduation on University records will be the date of the certificate. Entrance by standardized test scores will remain an option for the student ineligible on the basis of the high school record. Advanced Placement 43 Physical Examination All new students and those returning after an absence of two or more quarters require physical examinations and health clearances, respectively, before the first day of the quarter.

The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institu\u00ad tion. Information regarding eligibility for transfer may be found in the section on Admission in Advanced Standing, page 38. Unit Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The University of California grants unit credit for courses completed in other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the Univer\u00ad sity as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Equivalent advanced standing credit from institu\u00ad tions on the semester calendar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI 180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed.) Transfer Students 45 10 Biological Sciences lA-B-C.

(lB is required for Infor- mation and Computer Science majors.) California Community Colleges Students may find it advantageous or necessary to complete the first two years of a University of California undergradu\u00ad ate program at one of the California Community Colleges, which are an integral part of the State's system of higher education. High school graduates who cannot be accommo\u00ad dated at their first University of California campus prefer\u00ad ence may choose to atte_nd a community college and transfer to their preferred University campus at a later time. A stu\u00ad dent may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semester units) toward a University degree in a community college. No further unit credit may be transferred from a community col\u00ad lege, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The community college counselor, with the aid of that college's transferable course list, can advise students about courses which will transfer to the University. Lists for each community college are updated annually and tell which courses will transfer and for how many units. In addition to the community college UC IRVINE - 1985-198646 Transfer Students counselor, staff in the Office of Admissions and Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges keep current copies and can advise students about the transferability of courses. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the Univer\u00ad sity of California's functions and which have been completed in colleges or universities accredited by the appropriate agen\u00ad cies. While limitations of credit may be imposed in certain subject areas, these are consonant with the curricula for all students in the University of California. No defined maxi\u00ad mum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four-year institu\u00ad tions. However, see page 50 for UCI graduation require\u00ad ments, including requirements for units earned in residence at this campus. University of California Extension Extension courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in residence at any accredited collegiate institution. Students intending to transfer Extension course credit for a degree at another college or university should verify accep\u00ad tance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the University of California must obtain the consent of the dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in an Extension course. Extension courses are not accepted as part of the residence requirements of the University. Grades earned in University Extension are not used in calculating the University grade point average. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the respective faculties. Course Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The policies above refer only to the unit. transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all campuses of the University: Thus, courses which are determined by the University of California to be transferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all bar\u00ad riers to orderly progress from California community colleges into UCI's programs. To this end, many community colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific application of their courses to UCI's University, schooL and departmental major requirements may be readily communicated to prospective transfer students. Students are urged to consult community college counselors or the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges for specific informa\u00ad tion on planning a program for transfer. The University of California bulletin Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects should also be consulted for planning the lower-division course of study for all programs offered on the campuses of the University of California. Requirements Requirements at UCI are in four categories: University of California, UCI, school, and departmental or major. Courses not specifically applicable to these are considered to be elec\u00ad tives. See pages 49-52 for a description of these requirements. University of California Requirements: Subject A and American History and Institutions Among the means of meeting the Subject A requirement is the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) transfer course in English com\u00ad position with a grade of C or better. The American History and Institutions requirement may be met by completing in high school one year of U.S. history or one semester of U.S. history and one semester of U.S. government with a grade of at least C, or upon certification by another California collegiate institution. UCI Breadth Requirement The current UCI breadth requirement applies to new stu\u00ad dents who entered UCI or any other accredited college fall term 1980, and thereafter. Transfer students who subse\u00ad quent to high school graduation attended a regular term in an accredited college any time prior to fall 1980 and transfer to UCI before fall quarter, 1986 have the option of satisfying this requirement through (I) the UCI 6-3-3 distribution (see below), (2) the current UCI breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, or (3) one of the other options indicated below. Transfer students who subsequent to high school graduation attended a regular term in an accredited college any time prior to fall, 1980 and transfer to UCI fall1986 or thereafter must satisfy this requirement through completion of the current UCI breadth requirement or through one of the other options indicated below with the exclusion of the UCI 6-3-3 distribution. The breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, may be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any time during the undergradu\u00ad ate years, except in the case of the upper-division writing re\u00ad quirement. Transfer students should not feel that the breath requirement must necessarily be completed during their freshman and sophomore years. See pages 50-51 for details on the breadth requirement. Students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have completed the general breadth requirements of that col\u00ad lege will be considered to have met the total breadth require\u00ad ment of UCI except for the upper-division writing require\u00ad ment. Students who transfer from a community college and who have met the general breadth requirements of any cam\u00ad pus of the University of California prior to transfer will also be regarded as having met the breadth requirement except for the upper-division Writing requirement. Students who, upon transfer, have not completed whatever breadth requirements may have been in progress for another campus of the University of California may elect to complete at UCI either that program (except for the upper-division writing requirement) or the current UCI breadth requirement; Stu\u00ad dents who transfer to UCI before fall 1986 and who entered their former collegiate institution and attended a regular term prior to fall 1980 may also elect to complete the UCI 6- 3-3 distribution. Students who transfer from colleges on the semester calen\u00ad dar and who elect to satisfy the breadth requirement by ful\u00ad filling the UCI 6-3-3 distribution may do so by completing four semester courses (minimum 12 semester units) in one school outside the major and two semester courses (min~ imum six semester units) in each of two other schools out\u00ad side the major. Students transferring from another institution may satisfy the UCI breadth requirement (pp. 50-52) by completing a year sequence (two semesters work, minimum six semester UC IRVINE - 1985-1986units, or three quarters work, minimum 12 quarter units) in each of the following areas: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences\u00b7 IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science Students transferring to UCI should refer to the following detailed guidelines ori how to satisfy the breadth requirement in each area: I. Writing. The lower-division writing requirement may be met by a year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be com\u00ad pleted with a minimum grade of C, or a Pass, or Credit grade equivalent to C. Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for the satisfaction of Subject A toward the completion of the lower-division requirement. Any stu\u00ad dent entering with only one semester or one quarter of Eng\u00ad lish composition through which the Subject A Requirement is fulfilled will not have satisfied any part of the writing requirement. The upper-division writing requirement nor\u00ad mally should be completed at Irvine. II. Natural Sciences. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: general biology, gen\u00ad eral chemistry, basic physics, the physical sciences with the exception of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. III. Social and Behavorial Sciences. This requirement may be met by a year of work in any of the following areas: anthro\u00ad pology and comparative culture, economics, geography, politi\u00ad cal science, psychology, sociology, or social ecology. Students on the semester system may elect to take both courses in the same area or one course from each of any two areas; stu\u00ad dents on the quarter system may elect to take three courses in one area, or two courses from one area and a third from another area. History, for the purposes of the breadth requirement, is not considered a social or behavioral science. (See IV, Humanistic Inquiry.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, comparative litera\u00ad ture, dramatic literature, art history, history of music, nature and theory of art. Performance courses may not be used in satisfaction of this requirement. V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Com\u00ad puter Science. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: probability and statis\u00ad tics, calculus, logic, linguistics, computer science, or comple\u00ad tion of the second year in a foreign language. In satisfying the above requirements, a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the discipline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than two semester courses or three quarter courses in Philosophy toward breadth. Transfer students should check with the academic counselor in their prospective major, the Office of Admissions, or the Office of Relations with S:hools and Colleges about courses that may be used to satisfy the UCI breadth requirement. A complete description of the breadth requirement is on pages 50-52. NOTE FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: In addition to the courses taken to fulfull the UCI breadth requirement, students majoring in the School of Physical Sciences are Transfer Students 47 required to take one additional year sequence from one of the following breadth areas: Social and Behavioral Sciences (III), Humanistic Inquiry (IV), or the Foreign Languages or Lin\u00ad guistics section of Category V. For purposes of this require\u00ad ment, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that a year sequence of a single foreign language at the first level is acceptable. NOTE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: By satisfy\u00ad ing the lower-division Writing requirement (I) and complet\u00ad ing a year sequence of courses selected from classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, or comparative literature toward the Humanistic Inquiry (IV) breadth requirement, students majoring in Biological Sciences can also satisfy the Humanities requirement for their major. The courses and descriptions listed elsewhere in this Cata\u00ad logue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. However, it is strongly advised that they consult with their counselors to verify the transferabil\u00ad ity of such courses and the applicability to the breadth requirement. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and which has been mutually determined with a community college as being acceptable toward completion of the breadth require\u00ad ment shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. School Requirements Since school requirements occasionally cross school lines (e.g., physical science requirements for all majors in the School of Biological Sciences), courses taken to fulfill a school requirement may at the same time be applicable toward the University breadth requirement unless the school designates otherwise. Also, courses taken to fulfill a departmental major requirement may at the same time fulfill a school require\u00ad ment or, within prescribed limits, the University breadth requirement. Although course equivalencies for the breadth requirement are liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmental major require\u00ad ments must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy \u00b7some or all of the lower\u00ad division requirements of their intended program or school prior to transfer. Departmental or Major Requirements Courses to be applied toward departmental.or major require\u00ad ments must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in content and purpose than is the case with courses applicable to the breadth requirement (see p. 52 and departmental sections). Prospective transfer students should consult with their counselors as to the applicability of courses toward UCI requirements. Prospective transfer students should address specific inquir\u00ad ies about their programs to the respective schools or depart\u00ad ments at UCL Community colleges wishing to clarify the status of transfer courses should consult with the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges at Irvine or the Univer\u00ad sity of California campus closest to them. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Information for Admitted Students Planning an Undergraduate Program Academic Advising At the time of admission to UCI every undergraduate stu-' dent is assigned to the school or program that corresponds to the student's selected major or to the General Studies Advis\u00ad ing Program if they have not declared a major. New students are encouraged to plan their academic programs with an aca\u00ad demic counselor shortly after they have been admitted. Thus, the optimum time to initiate contact with an academic coun\u00ad selor is before the student enrolls in classes. The academic counselor can help the student determine whether classes the student wishes to choose are appropriate to the student's level of preparation, whether the proposed classes fit within the student's educational goals, and whether the classes will help meet some of the various requirements for graduation. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and academic standing rests with the dean or director of the school or program to which a student is assigned for pur\u00ad poses of academic advising. Thus, all requests to add or drop courses, waive or change graduation or other requirements, and change area of academic concentration must be processed through the office of that dean or director. Each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising. These systems differ among the academic units. In some, all of the faculty serve as advisors; in others, only certain members of.the faculty are designated as advisors. Responsibility for informing students of the names of their advisors rests with the dean or director of the appropriate academic unit. This is normally done by letter, but students may obtain information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or director (see separ\u00ad ate listing). A student may request a change of advisor through the chief academic advisor or the dean of the unit. A change in area of concentration often involves a change in advisor. This will always be the case when the change of con\u00ad centration is to a different school or program; the new school or program will assign a new advisor and inform the student. In some schools and programs consultation between students and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Students are respon\u00ad sible for knowing the governing regulations of the school or program to which they are assigned for academic advising purposes. Irrespective of whether or not consultation between student and advisor is required, the student is respon\u00ad sible for initialing and maintaining periodic contact with the assigned faculty advisor. An appropriate time for the initial con\u00ad tact is during the. week prior to the beginning of the student's first classes at UCI, or earlier at the time of registration if this is possible. Thereafter, consultation between student and advisor at the time of registration for each subsequent quar\u00ad ter is desirable. The actual frequency of these meetings will be determined by the desires of the student, the advisor, and the governing regulations. It is the obligation of the faculty advisor to help the student plan an appropriate program of study and interpret the academic regulations of the campus, but the student is solely responsible for meeting the academic regula\u00ad tions and remaining in good academic standing. In addition to faculty members, academic counselors are available in each unit to assist students with major selection, program planning, and petitions. Also, peer academic advisors (trained upper-division and graduate students) can help stu\u00ad dents plan their programs, select or change majors, and arrange for tutoring as necessary. Besides furnishing counsel on such matters, these advisors dispense general campus information and refer students to the appropriate faculty and staff personnel for assistance with specific problems. Each quarter, new students are required to go to the appro\u00ad priate academic dean's office prior to the beginning of classes for advice concerning class enrollment and to pick up a Class Verification and Identification Card. These procedures for new students and provisions for continuing students are explained in detail in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Advising Personnel Biological Sciences Area Code 714 Grover C.

Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those requirements in mind when selecting courses. Further, students should supplement their under\u00ad graduate programs by anticipating foreign language require\u00ad ments at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduate work. For information about graduate or professional study in a given field, students may consult the graduate advisor or an academic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to the area of interest. Also, the Career Planning and Placement Center frequently sponsors seminars on specific career areas and offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or professional study. Supplementary Educational Programs There are several supplementary educational opportunities available to students at UCI: University Extension, Summer Sessions, the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program, the Naval ROTC program, and two Uni\u00ad versitywide activities-the Education Abroad Program and the Education at Home Program. The Education Abroad Pro\u00ad gram offers students the opportunity to experience a differ- . ent culture while making progress toward degree require\u00ad ments. The Education at Home Program enables participants interested in early American history and culture to spend a quarter in Williamsburg, Virginia; Philadelphia; and Washing\u00ad ton, D.C. For further information on each of these programs, please see pages 57-59. Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree There are four requirements that must be met to obtain a baccalaureate degree from UCI: University, UCI, School, and departmental. Each is described below. University Requirements 1. English (\"Subject A\"). Every undergraduate must demon\u00ad strate upon entrance to the University an acceptable level of ability in English composition. This requirement may be met before entrance by: a. Achieving a grade 5, 4, or 3 in either of the two College Board Advanced Placement Examinations in English; or b. Achieving a score of 600 or better in the College Board English Composition Achievement Test; or c. Completing the California State University English Equiv\u00ad alency Test with \"Pass for Credit\"; or d. Entering the University with credentials from another col\u00ad lege which show the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) course in English UC IRVINE - 1985-198650 Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree/Breadth composition with a grade of C or better. NOTE: High school English courses will not satisfy this option. Those students who have not met the Subject A requirement before entrance must satisfy the requirement before the beginning of their fourth quarter at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the requirement by that time will be ineligible to enroll for a fourth quarter. Students enrolled in Humanities 20A-B-C-D (Writing for Students for Whom English is a Second Language) must meet the Subject A requirement before the beginning of the fourth quarter after they have been authorized to take Eng\u00ad lish and Comparative literature WR39A or the Writing Workshop. This requirement may be met after entrance by one of the four following means: One is by taking and passing the Subject A Placement Exam\u00ad ination that is given during the summer and during Academic Advising and Orientation Week prior to the beginning of fall classes. Transfer students who have not satisfied the Subject A requirement should also take this examination before en\u00ad rolling at UCI. A second option, open only to those enrolled in the Humanities Core Course, is by taking the Writing Workshop. (NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core Course will be required to enroll concurrently in the Writing Workshop during their first quarter. Successful completion of the Writing Workshop will satisfy the Subject A requirement.) Third, students scoring below 600 on the College Board English Composition Achievement Test-and who have followed neither of the first two routes described above-can satisfy the Subject A requirement through taking English and Comparative Litera\u00ad ture WR39A and receiving a letter grade of at least a C in that course. (NOTE: The Pass/Not Pass option may not be used to satisfy the Subject A requirement.) 2. American History and Institutions. This requirement may be met by one of the following: a .. Completion in high school of one year of United States history with grades of Cor better, or one semester of United States history and one semester of United States government with grades of C or better. b. Receiving a score of 5, 4, or 3 in the Advanced Placement Examination in United States History. c. Receiving a score of 500 or higher in the College Board Achievement Test in American History and Social Studies. d. Presentation of a certificate of completion of the require\u00ad ment at another California institution. e. Completion at another institution of one year of college\u00ad level United States history with grades of C or better, or one course in United States history and one in United States government with grades of C or better. f. Completion at UCI, with a grade of C or better, a lower\u00ad division, four-unit course in American history (when Ameri\u00ad can history is taught in History 6 or 9) and Social Sciences 23D. g. Passing an examination in these subjects. (Students should contact the Undergraduate Study Office, School of Humani\u00ad ties, for further information about the examination.) UCI Requirements 3. Credit for 180 quarter units, earned by examination, by other evaluation, or course work. A course normally offers four quarter units of credit. *Not offered 1985-86. Offered as History 29A-B-C. 4. A grade average of at least C (2.0). 5. Candidates for the baccalaureate must attain at least a C (2.0) average in all of the courses required in the major pro\u00ad gram and at least a C (2.0) average in the upper-division courses required in the maj_or program. Higher averages than this may be required only in honors programs. Students who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major program may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privilege of pursuing a major program in that unit. (In this context, \"the courses required in the major program\" are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student's major.) 6. Credit for 35 of the final 45 units of work immediately preceding graduation must be earned in residence at the Irvine campus (i.e., three quarters of full-time attendance at UCI). Exceptions to this rule may be allowed, with prior departmental approval, to students enrolled in the Education Abroad Program. 7. Students enrolled at UCI from their freshman year may elect to meet as graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major requirements) those in effect at the time of entrance or those subsequently passed after entrance. Stu\u00ad dents transferring from other collegiate institutions may elect to meet as graduation requirements those in effect at the time of entering the other collegiate institution, those in effect at the time of transfer to UCI, or those subsequently passed. A student who seeks readmission to UCI more than three consecutive quarters after withdrawing from student status must adhere to the graduation requirements in effect at the time of readmission or those subsequently passed. NOTE: Students transferring to UCI in fall 1986 or thereafter may elect to meet as graduation requirements those in effect at the time of transfer, those subsequently passed, or those in effect at the time of entering their other collegiate institution, provided that the date of entrance at the previous institution is not more than four years prior to the time of transfer to UCI. Breadth Requirement 8. Candidates for the bachelor's degree must satisfy the UCI breadth requirement. The requirement is designed to ensure that UCI graduates will have been exposed to a broad spec\u00ad trum of fundamental areas of intellectual experience. It is a graduation requirement and therefore need not be satisfied during only the lower-division years. To satisfy the breadth requirement, three four-unit courses are required in each of the following areas: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science The specific course combinations in each area which may be used by students to satisfy the requirement are listed below. These course combinations were selected to ensure the following: (1) that students, in meeting the requirement, be exposed to subject matter, problems, and techniques which would serve as a first introduction to an academic area and (2) that in meeting the requirement students be exposed to a connected set of courses which provide a coherent experience in that academic area. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Only with respect to the lower-division writing requirement is it necessary to pass the first two courses (English and Comparative Literature 39B and 39C or Humanities IA and IB) sometime before the student's junior year. It is, of course, a good idea to begin satisfying the breadth require\u00ad ment as early as possible, as many upper-division courses have as prerequisites courses that may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement. NOTE: In satisfying the breadth requirement, a student may count toward breadth no more than three courses taken within the disci\u00ad pline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than three Philosophy courses toward breadth. I. Writing Requirement. Because of the importance of writ\u00ad ing in every academic discipline, the University is committed to developing the verbal skills of its students at all levels and in all areas. The Writing Requirement expresses this com\u00ad mitment, but the concern for and attention to dear, accurate writing is expected of faculty and students in all courses. The Writing Requirement consists of three courses beyond the Subject A Requirement. Except where otherwise noted below, students must satisfy the Subject A Requirement prior to fulfilling the Writing Requirement. Two of the three courses required must be lower-division courses and normally must be completed prior to the junior year (or in the case of transfer students within the first year of residency). The third course must be an upper-division . course, and it must be taken only after the successful comple\u00ad tion of 84 quarter units (achievement of junior status) and completion of the lower-division requirement. On.ce a student matriculates to UCI, the student can take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-divsion and upper-division writing requirements. Lower-Division Requirement: The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a grade of Cor better. Students may select from the courses specified below: I. English and Comparative Literature WR39B (Expository Writing) and English and Comparative Literature WR39C (Argument and Research) or any two quarters of the writing component of Humanities IA-B-C (the Humanities Core Course). 2. Humanities 15-16* (Humanities Writing Sequence) taken in conjunction with an associated course as designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. 3. Two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course (Humanities lA-B-C). (NOTE: Students held for Subject A will be required to enroll concurrently in the Writing Workshop during the first quarter. Successful com\u00ad pletion of the Writing Workshop will satisfy the Subject A requirement. For these students, the lower-division writing requirement may be satisfied only in the second and third quarters of the Humanities Core Course.) 4. Students who complete English and Comparative Litera\u00ad ture WR39B or Humanities IS* with a grade of B (3.0) or bet\u00ad ter may substitute as the second course of the lower-division Writing Requirement one of the following courses in creative writing, nonfiction, or journalism: English and Comparative Literature WR30, WR31, WR32, or WR38. Upper-Division Requirement: The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. The requirement may be satisfied by completing any one of the following: *Not offered 1985-86. Offered as History 29A-B-C. Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree/Breadth 51 I. English and Comparative Literature WRI39. -2. An upper-division course in creative writing, nonfiction, or journalism. Such courses frequently have special prerequi\u00ad sites. Students may not use such a course to satisfy the requirement unless they have attained a B or better in both courses taken to satisfy the lower-division Writing Requirement. 3. An upper-division course designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes as approved for satisfaction of the requirement. 4. By examination (refer to the quarterly Schedule of Classes). Students who fail to attain the required grades in the courses taken in fulfillment of the Writing Requirement should refer to page 62 for further information. II. Natural Sciences. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Biological Sciences: Students may select any three courses from Biological Sciences IA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, 80, 81. Chemistry: Chemistry IA-B-C ILB-C. Physics: Physics from 20A-B-C-D; 13A-B or 17A-B plus one course from Physics 10, 16, or 20A-B-C-D. Social Ecology: Social Ecology E3, E4, Es. UC IRVINE - 1985-198652 Enrollment and Other Procedures III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. Students must select three courses from one of the following areas, or two courses from one area plus a third from another area. The first course taken in any area must be an introductory course numbered 1-12. Anthropology and Comparative 7, SOT, SIA, SSC, must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Arts: History of Art 40A-B-C; Studio Art 30A-B-C, Humanities SSA-B-C; Philosophy I, 4, 5; 10, 12, and either 11 or 13. Literature: English and Comparative Literature CL SOA-B-C, E 6-7-8, French soA-B-C; Humanities 30A-B-C; Russian 20-30-40; Spanish SOA-B-C. V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, MathematiCs, Computer Science. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Computer Science: ICS IB, 2, 2L, 2A-B-C; Spanish 2A-B-C. Linguistics: Linguistics 50 and two courses from Linguistics 110, 120, or Social Sciences SOA; Social Sciences 153F-153H. Logic and Mathematics: Mathematics 2A-B-C, 7, or 13; 6A-B-C; 130A-B; Social Sciences llA-B-C, IOOA-B-C, Social Ecology 166A-B-C. All students planning to transfer to UCI should see page 46 for details on fulfilling the UCI breadth requirement. Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. School and Departmental Requirements In addition to the University require;J,ents listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major and, if applicable, the minor selected. UCI, school, and departmental or major and minor requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the physics course requirement in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the UCI breadth requirement. Information on specific degree requirements, as well as courses offered, can be found else\u00ad where in this Catalogue. The student should have determined an area of concentra\u00ad tion no later than the beginning of the junior year, having made certain that the background and the preparation pre\u00ad requisite to junior and senior work in the major have been accomplished. New and continuing undergraduate students should read the section on Planning an Undergraduate Pro\u00ad gram; transfer students should also read the section on Plan\u00ad ning for Transfer to UCI. Enrollment and Other Procedures Except where noted, all information applies to both under\u00ad graduate and graduate students. Additional information con\u00ad cerning enrollment and academic policies applying only to graduate students is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Enrollment and Payment of Fees To receive academic credit for 'regular courses and other supervised instruction or research, a student must be offi\u00ad cially enrolled prior to undertaking such activities. Enroll\u00ad ment does not become official until all'required fees have been paid, and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition has been completed correctly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments as indicated on the Class Verification and Identification Card are correct. The Schedule of Classes is provided by the Registrar's Office with registration materials approximately six weeks before the beginning of each quarter. The most important form in the registration materials is the Enrollment in Classes Peti\u00ad tion. It should be filled out carefully, according to the instruc\u00ad tions in the Schedule of Classes. A quarterly calendar of dates for submission of enrollment materials and payment of fees is included in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. The general procedures for enrollment are: 1. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary signatures on the Enrollment in Classes Petition for courses that require special approval. New undergraduate students entering in the fall should seriously consider attending one of the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) sessions during the summer for academic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Pay careful attention to deadlines and submit the com\u00ad pleted class enrollment and updated student information forms to the Registrar. 3. Pay required fees to the Cashier. Any other outstanding obligations must be satisfied at this time also. Class Verification and Identification Card After payment of fees and submission of enrollment mate\u00ad rials, a Class Verification and Identification Card is available for each student. The Card lists the courses in which a stu\u00ad dent is enrolled. If any courses requested could not be sched\u00ad uled, they are listed also, with the reason why the student is not enrolled in the course. Changes to course enrollments after receipt of the Card are handled through Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Cards, available from the stu\u00ad dent's academic dean's office or the Registrar. New undergraduate students are required to call in person at their academic deans' offices to secure their Class Verification and Identification Cards and advice concerning their academic programs. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Continuingundergraduate students and graduate students should consult the quarterly Schedule of Classes for instruc\u00ad tions on where to secure their cards. The Class Verification and Identification Card is certification of the student's class enrollment and is evidence that the stu\u00ad dent is registered at UCI and is entitled to Library privileges. In addition, the Card provides identification for Associated Students functions. If the Card is lost, there is a $3 replace\u00ad ment charge. Inquiries regarding the replacement of lost cards should be directed to the Registrar's Office. Late Enrollment and Payment of Fees Students who do not submit an Enrollment in Classes Peti\u00ad tion to the Registrar's Office during the published period are subject to a late service fee. The late service fee is graduated. Between the deadline and the end of the second week of classes, the late service fee is $25. Thereafter it increases to $50. Students who do not pay all required fees to the Cashier's Office during the published period for fee payment are sub\u00ad ject to a late service fee. This fee is also graduated: $25 through the end of the second week of classes; $50 thereafter. The student is subject to both late service fees (either $50 or $100) if fees are not paid to the Cashier's Office and the En\u00ad rollment in Classes Petition is not returned to the Registrar's Office by the deadlines, which are published quarterly in the Schedule of Classes. To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, students are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the pub\u00ad lished deadlines. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Financial Aid Office, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. The Registrar does not have authority to allow a student to pay fees after the deadline date or to waive the late fees, except in unusual cases where the University is responsible for the late transaction. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late service fees. Change of Class Enrollment After official enrollment materials have been filed with the Registrar, a student may add or drop courses, change sections of a course, or change the grading option by completing an Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, available from the student's academic dean's office. There is a $3 ser\u00ad vice charge for all add, drop, or change transactions received in the Registrar's Office after the second week of classes. An undergraduate student may not 'enroll in more than 20 units (excluding Physical Education) nor fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permis\u00ad sion of the student's academic dean. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limita\u00ad tions to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit without prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. During the first six weeks of each quarter, a student may add classes provided approval to add each class is granted by the instructor in charge. To add a class, a student must obtain the instructor's signature of approval on an Add card, carefully complete the Add card, and submit the card to the Registrar's Office no later than the end of the sixth week of instruction. Enrollment and Other Procedures 53 The dated signature of the instructor is always required and is valid\u00b7 for 10 working days. To drop a class or change the grading option during the first two weeks of the quarter, a student must obtain the signa\u00ad ture of the instructor in charge as evidence of notification on a Drop or Change of Grading Option Card and submit the card to the Registrar's Office no later than the end of the second week of instruction. Students may drop classes from the third through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, only with the permission of the instructor in charge. A student wishing to drop a class during this period must obtain the signature of approval from the instructor in charge on a Drop card, pay $3 at the Cashier's Office, and submit the card to the Registrar's Office. After the sixth week of a quarter, students may drop a course only with the permission of the instructor and the \u00b7 student's academic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the course and not subject to disqualification, and only if drop\u00ad ping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student and/or of the class as a whole. To drop a class after the sixth week, a student must complete a Drop card, obtain the instructor's and the dean's signatures of approval, pay $3 at the Cashier's Office, and submit the card to the Registrar's Office. Graduate students must have the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research to drop a course after the sixth week. A W notation will be recorded for each course dropped after the end of the sixth week of classes. The effective date of a \"drop\" is the date the approved Drop card is received in the Registrar's Office. Every student enrolled in a laboratory course in which equipment is issued is responsible for the equipment when dropping a course and will not be permitted to drop until the equipment is accounted for. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class for which they expect credit. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop card must be filed before the last day of instruction for the quarter. Students are urged to verify their official enrollment early in the quarter. Students enrolling for the next quarter will find this information included with en\u00ad rollment materials for the next quarter. Those students not enrolling for the next quarter can verify their official enroll\u00ad ment by inquiring at the Registrar's Office. The Registrar's Office cannot accept Add, Drop, or Change cards after the last day of instruction of a particular quarter. Lapse of Status A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed dead\u00ad line; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory arrangements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical examination; or failure to comply with admission conditions. Each student who becomes subject to lapse of status action is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situa\u00ad tion. However, if the student fails to respond, action will be taken without further notice. A \"hold\" will be placed on all of the student's records and the student will be entitled to no UC IRVINE - 1985-198654 Enrollment and Other Procedures further services of the University except assistance toward clearing the hold. A student must satisfy the conditions which caused the lapse of status before the hold can be cleared. Retention of Student Records The Registrar's Office maintains a permanent record of aca\u00ad demic work completed by each student. Support documents for the academic record are kept for one year. Students are strongly advised to carefully check their aca\u00ad demic record quarterly. (Student grade reports are available at the Registrar's Office shortly after the close of each quar\u00ad ter.) Discrepancies in the academic record should be reported to the Registrar immediately. After one year, it is assumed that the student accepts the accuracy of their academic record, and supporting source documents are destroyed. Transcript of Records The transcript of a student's academic records will be released only upon receipt of a signed request of the student authorizing the release. Application may be made in person or by mail; telephoned requests cannot be honored because payment is due in advance. Application for a transcript should be submitted to the Cashier's Office with a check or money order payable to Regents-UC for the exact amount due. The fee for transcripts is $3 for the first copy and $1 for each additional copy ordered and mailed at the same lime. All outstanding debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and payable) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. Requests for transcripts by other than the student whose transcript is being sought can be honored only (1) if the request is accompanied by a written authorization signed by the student whose transcript is sought, and (2) upon approval of the Registrar. Such transcripts can be released by the Registrar only to a\u00b7nother college, university, or educationally related agencies such as the Law School Data Admissions Service (LSDAS) or the American Medical College Applica\u00ad tion Service (AMCAS). Such transcripts cannot be released to the person making the request in the student's stead. When a student orders a transcript sent to another college, university, or agency, it is extremely important for the stu\u00ad dent to provide a complete, accurate mailing address to \u00b7 ensure delivery to the correct office. At least two weeks should be allowed for a transcript to be received by another institution or agency. Verification of Student Status. There is a $3 fee for each verification of student status performed by the Registrar's Office either at the window or by mail. Needs for which such verifications are performed include reference checks, bank loans, applications for good-student-driver insurance rates, Social Security, etc. Diplomas Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are avail\u00ad able, which is about 120 days after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Students may then call in person at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to deliver their diplomas by certified mail, or registered air mail to locations outside the United States. There is a service charge of $5 for certified mail, $6 for registered air mail, payable to Regents\u00ad UC. All outstanding debts due to the University, with the exception of long-term financial aid loans, must be paid in full before a student's diploma will be released. See Commence\u00ad ment, pages 55 and 69. Withdrawal Prior to Start of Instruction A student who pays fees for a regular academic quarter and then decides to leave the University prior to the first day of classes must submit a notice of withdrawal, with the identifi\u00ad cation card attached, to the appropriate dean's office. With the exception of new undergraduate students, there is a $10 service charge for withdrawal prior to the first day of classes. Withdrawal After the Start of Instruction After classes begin for a regular academic quarter, an enrolled student who decides to leave the University before the end of that quarter must submit an official notice of withdrawal. A student who fails to submit a notice of with\u00ad drawal may accrue failing grades and also may severely jeopardize their academic standing at the University and adversely affect their future readmission to the University or admission to another university or college. Undergraduate students must submit the notice signed by their dean, with the identification card attached, to the Ombudsman. Graduate students must submit the notice to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, and students in the College of Medicine must submit it to the College of Medicine Director of Admissions and Records. In extenuating circumstances, such as illness or emergency, the student should notify the appropriate dean or office as soon as possi\u00ad ble in order to initiate withdrawal procedures. The effective date of the withdrawal will be determined by the Ombuds\u00ad man, for undergraduate students, or by the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research, for graduate students. A W notation will be recorded for each course in which en\u00ad rollment is withdrawn if the student's effective date of with\u00ad drawal is after the end of the-sixth week of classes. A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to withdraw and intends to return within one year may submit both the notice of withdrawal and an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Further informa\u00ad tion about leaves of absence appears in the Graduate Studies and Research section. If a student plans to leave the University after completing all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal f10tice of with\u00ad drawal is not necessary. See page 29 for information on fee refunds. Readmission: Undergraduate Students Students are strongly urged to consider the policy below in formulating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCJ students who were in good academic standing at the time of dropping out and who have filed readmission applications. Readmission is not automatic. A student must file an Applica\u00ad tion for Readmission with the Registrar's Office at least eight weeks prior to the quarter in which readmission is desired and pay a nonrefundable $35 Application Fee at the Cashier's Office. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986If a student has been academically disqualified from the Uni\u00ad versity or has left the University while on probation or sub\u00ad ject to disqualification, the student must apply for readmis\u00ad sion in the manner prescribed above. The application, how\u00ad ever, will be forwarded to the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. If the dean decides that the student is serious about academic life, and/or that the student has dis\u00ad played capability at another academic institution, the student will most likely be allowed readmission to the University. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be sub\u00ad mitted as part of the application. A nonrefundable fee of $35 is charged for each Application for Readmission. Remittance by bank draft or money order payable to Regents-UC must be attached to the application. Readmission: Graduate Students A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a leave of absence approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research can resume graduate study only if readmitted. The Application for Readmission must be submitted by the published deadline for graduate admission applications. Please refer to the statement on readmission which appears in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Intercampus Transfer: Undergraduates Only An undergraduate student in good standing may transfer from the UCI campus to another campus of the University of California. To do so, the student should first check with the UCI ~egistrar to see which of the campuses is accepting transfers and which majors are being encouraged by each campus. The student then obtains an Intercampus Transfer Application form from the UCI Registrar's Office and files the form with the UCI Registrar by the deadline prescribed for the quarter in which the student wishes to transfer. The filing periods are: winter quarter-July 1-31; spring quarter\u00ad October 1-31; fall quarter-November 1-30. (UC Berkeley is on the semester system and has filing periods as follows: spring semester-July 1-31; fall semester-November 1-30.) After these dates, applications are accepted only until quotas are filled. A student may apply for only one campus in any given quarter*. A nonrefundable fee of $35 is required for all Intercampus Transfer Applications filed with the Registrar's Office. Intercampus Visitor: Undergraduates Only A currently registered UCiundergraduate student in good standing may apply for intercampus visitor status at another campus of the University for one quarter. Forms and ins.truc\u00ad tions are available at the Registrar's Office. California Residence All inquiries with regard to the requirements for the estab\u00ad lishment of California residence (including exceptions per\u00ad taining to minors, certain classes of refugees and permanent residents of the United States, and dependents of military personnel stationed in California) should be directed to the Residence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717, (714) 856-6129 or the Office of the Legal Analyst\u00ad Residence Matters, 590 University Hall, University of Cali\u00ad fornia, 2200 University Avenue, Berkeley, California 94720, (415) 642-2822. Please refer to the Fees section for informa\u00ad tion on the Nonresident Tuition Fee and California residence. *If the University adopts the multiple application system, this may change. Students are advised to contact the Registrar's Office. Enrollment and Other Procedures 55 Commencement Students who graduate any quarter of the academic year may participate in the year-end graduation ceremony. Com\u00ad mencement protocol information is mailed to all prospective graduates in late spring and also is available in the office of each academic counselor. See Diplomas, page 54. Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. \\ UC IRVINE - 1985-198656 Orientation/Publications/Supplementary Programs Orientation, Major Campus Publications, and Supplementary Educational Programs Orientation Orientation programs include Academic Advising and Orien\u00ad tation Week, held in the fall; the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP), a 36-hour live-in experience on campus for new students and their parents; and Uni-Prep, a week-long, intensive program in September to help new students develop increased social and intellectual skills. All of these programs are sponsored by the Student Support Services Office, located in 201 and 209 Administration Building, (714) 856-7244. Academic Advising and Orientation Week, commonly known as \"0-Week,\" offers academic and social activities for new and returning students and is scheduled the week prior to the beginning of fall quarter classes. Students who enroll later in the academic year (winter or spring quarter) partici\u00ad pate in an abbreviated, one-day orientation prior to the beginning of the appropriate quarter. The Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) is com\u00ad prised of three different sessions held on weekends during the summer. SPOP is designed to help new students with their registration materials and offers informative sessions on academic programs, extracurricular activities, housing choices, and much more. Participants and their parents live in residence halls for the weekend program. There is a fee for the program that covers room, board, and program costs. Applicants for admission who plan to enroll at UCI in fall quarter will be sent information about SPOP in the spring. Uni-Prep is a five-day program for entering students held in early September. Participants live in the residence halls and attend workshops and other activities designed to provide them with information about shaping their academic and personal lives at UCI. A fee is charged that covers room, board, and program costs. Applicants for admission who plan to enroll at UCI in fall quarter will be sent information about Uni-Prep in the spring. Major Campus Publications Several major publications available on campus provide information about academic programs, student activities and services, enrollment in classes, and specifics pertaining to the individual departments and schools. Some of these publica\u00ad tions are described here; others are mentioned in Antidote (the student handbook). The UCI General Catalogue The UCI General Catalogue contains general administrative and academic information, as well as specific descriptions of schools and departments and .the courses they offer, degree requirements, major requirements, the UCI breadth requirement, and various academic policies and procedures. It is available beginning in mid-July from the University Book\u00ad store and University Extension; copies are $4.50 if purchased on campus (see p. 332 for prices of mailed copies). Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the aca\u00ad demic year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. Current information on specific courses offered in any one quarter is available in the Schedule of Classes and in quarterly information published by some of the academic units. Schedule of Classes The Schedule of Classes contains updated information on fees, how to enroll in classes, and final examination sched\u00ad ules. Most importantly, it lists all classes to be offered that quarter and the time, room, and instructor scheduled for each. If there are any enrollment restrictions on the class, such as consent of instructor required, these are noted. Just prior to the first day of instruction for each quarter, the Registrar's Office issues an addendum to the Schedule that lists added and canceled classes, changes in time, instructor, or classroom assignments, and other such information. Because the Schedule of Classes is published several times. each academic year, it also is a timely source of information on new policies and procedures, or changes in fees or proce\u00ad dures, that could not be included in the Catalogue because of the latter's less frequent publication schedule. Except for the fall edition, the Schedule of Classes is pub\u00ad lished just before the beginning of each quarter; the fall Schedule is available in mid-spring for the convenience of students already attending UCI who will be continuing at UCI in the fall. The Schedule is distributed to new students when Registration Packets are mailed and also is available from the University Bookstore for 30\u00a2. Departmental and School Announcements These publications contain the most up-to-date information available regarding a wide assortment of academic informa\u00ad tion of immediate, timely interest to students, and all stu\u00ad dents are strongly urged to read them. The publications come in various forms, from brochures of several pages to one\u00ad sheet photocopied announcements, and contain information specific to the individual academic unit. These publications usually are posted on departmental bulletin boards, are avail\u00ad able in academic counselors' offices, or can be obtained from departmental offices. Antidote Antidote is the student handbook, published in the fall and available (at no cost) beginning Academic Advising and Orientation Week (\"0\" Week) while supplies last. Antidote is meant to be a handy resource guide on clubs, activities, and procedures. Arranged alphabetically, Antidote contains a broad spectrum of information for students, ranging from how to obtain a leave of absence to jobs to Third World and minority student activities to \"Zot.\" Its Quick Cure Index directs readers to answers not only in Antidote but also to room and telephone numbers of campus offices that can pro\u00ad vide additional information. UCI Journal The UCI Journal is published monthly during the academic year by the Advancement Office and the UCI Alumni Associ\u00ad ation. The Journal contains feature stories, commentaries, and other timely reports on UCI research, events, student life, educational policy, and alumni activities as well as a monthly calendar of events on campus. With a circulation of 50,000 the Journal is the only general-interest publication of UCI that serves members of the UCI community both on and off campus. Copies may be obtained by mail or from media distribution boxes on campus. Further information may be obtained by telephoning (714) 856-6922. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986UCitems UC!tems is the campus newsletter and events calendar pub\u00ad lished by the Office of University Advancement biweekly during the academic year. UC!tems reports on University and campus policies, accomplishments, and activities as they relate to faculty, students, and staff. Copies are available in media distribution boxes in the Administration Building, Library, classroom buildings, residence halls, and cafeterias. Further information may be obtained by telephoning (714) 856-6922. Campus Services and Campus Activities Publications Many campus offices that provide services or activities have brochures available describing what they offer. Many of the activities and events mentioned are available to the off\u00ad campus community. Publications include, but are not limited to, those about the services available at the Career Planning and Placement Center, the quarterly announcement of arts and lectures events, and the Cooperative Outdoor Program quarterly. \u00b7 Supplementary Educational Programs Summer Sessions Several summer sessions are held on the Irvine campus. Ses\u00ad sion I is scheduled from June 24 through July 30, 1986. Ses\u00ad sion II is from August 4 through September 10, 1986. An overlapping 10-week session extends from June 24 through August 29, 1986. Several special sessions are also held, includ\u00ad ing one for graduate students engaged in research and inde\u00ad pendent study. Those who enroll in these sessions and take an academic program equivalent to a regu'lar quarter may accelerate their progress toward a degree. A wide variety of courses from the regular sessions is planned, supplemented by experimental offerings available only during the summer. Admission is open to all university students, to high school graduates, to qualified applicants over 18 years of age, and to qualified high school students who have completed their junior year. Admission to\u00b7Summer Session does not constitute admission to a regular session of the University; therefore, official transcripts of educational records are not required. Fees for Summer Session are the same for out-of-State students as for California students. Information regarding Summer Session may be obtained from the Summer Session Office in the University Extension Building, (714) 856-5493. Application forms and course list\u00ad ings are available in March. University Extension University Extension offers more than 1,200 courses and special programs each year, many of them innovative and experimental in content, format, and teaching methods. Extension programs are designed for those adults in the community who wish to continue their education on a part\u00ad time basis for professional and career advancement, for expansion of cultural horizons, for development of scientific literacy, for growth in personal awareness and human interrelationships, and for enhanced understanding of the great issues of modern society. Utilizing the resources of the University, Extension offers credit and noncredit courses, seminars, conferences, lecture series, and certificate programs. Educational and career coun\u00ad seling is available to women and men through the Extension\u00ad sponsored Women's Opportunities Center, (714) 856-7128. University Extension programs are su.pported by fees charged Publications/Supplementary Programs 57 to students. A free catalogue may be obtained from the Uni\u00ad versity Extension Office in the University Extension Build\u00ad ing, (714) 856-5414. University Extension Program in English as a Second Language The Program in English as a Second Language (ESL), spon\u00ad sored by University Extension, prepares international stu\u00ad dents to enter and pursue their educational objectives in U.S. colleges and universities. An intensive pr.ogram in English for academic purposes, it offers core courses in grammar, writ\u00ad ing, reading and vocabulary development, seminar reporting and discussion strategies, listening, note-taking, debate and public speaking, and writing the research paper. A variety of elective courses such as TOEFL and GMAT preparation, American history, business and computer English are also available. Requests for information should be addressed to Program in English as a Second Language, University of Cali\u00ad fornia Extension, P.O. Box AZ, Irvine, CA 92716; telephone (714) 856-5414. Another ESL program is available to students who have been admitted to UCI. Students should refer to pages 40, 41, and 159. ROTC Although actual ROTC courses are not taught on the Irvine campus, a cross-town agreement allows qualified UCI stu\u00ad dents to participate in either the Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC) or Navy/Marine Corps Officer Training (NROTC) program. A brief descriptive pamphlet summarizing the programs is available from the Admissions Office, 245 Administration Building. Air Force ROTC Through arrangements with California State University, Long Beach; Loyola Marymount University; the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); and the University of Southern California, two-, three-, and four-year Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC) programs are available to all qualified UC Irvine students. Academic units earned in this program are counted as elective units toward fulfillment of UCI graduation requirements. Successful com\u00ad pletion of the AFROTC program leads to a commission as an officer in the Air Force. Those students who qualify for and plan to enter the Air Force pilot training will be given flight instruction as a part of their last year in either the two-or four-year program. Two-and three-year scholarships are available to qualified students on a competitive basis. Four\u00ad year scholarships for incoming students must be applied for before December 15 in the year prior to entering college. All scholarship recipients receive full tuition (UC Educational and Registration Fees), required fees and books, and $100 a month. Students on scholarship in the first two years of the program must successfully complete a course in English com\u00ad position within two academic years from scholarship activa\u00ad tion. Students in the last two years of the program must suc\u00ad cessfully complete a course in mathematical reasoning prior to commissioning. Students who accept a scholarship must agree to successfully complete at least one term of college instruction in a major Indo-European language prior to commissioning. UC IRVINE - 1985-198658 Supplementary Programs/Education Abroad Navy ROTC Through arrangements with the Naval Science Department of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), quali\u00ad fied UCI students may enroll in the NROTC Program at UCLA. Successful completion of this program leads to a Commission as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy or as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps. Academic classes com\u00ad pleted as part of the NROTC Program can be transferred and counted as elective units toward graduation at UCI. Qualified students may apply for NROTC competitive scholarships which provide tuition and fee payment at UCI, payment for books, and a stipend of $100 per month. Applications for NROTC enrollment are accepted during a student's fresh\u00ad man year and until March 15 of the sophomore year. For more information, students should contact the Naval Science Department (NROTC Unit), University of California, Los Angeles; Los Angeles, CA 90024 or telephone (213) 825-9075. Education Abroad Program The Education Abroad Program (EAP) of the University of California offers upper-division students the opportunity to experience a different culture while making progress toward degree objectives. Admission requirements are (1) junior standing by the end of the spring quarter prior to departure, (2) an overall grade point average of 3.0 or better at time of application and departure, and (3) two years of college-level competence in the appropriate foreign language or the equiv\u00ad alent with an overall minimum grade point average of 3.0, or the equivalent, by the end of spring quarter. Students inter\u00ad ested in the language, literature, art, culture, history, government, or social institutions of the countries where EAP study centers are located have the opportunity to gain substantially from first-hand academic experience. In addi\u00ad tion, whatever their field of study, EAP participants can broaden their outlook and gain new skills as the result of study in a foreign country. Study abroad allows students to experience _vastly different cultures and contrasting patterns of thinking while making progress toward a UC degree. The cost of studying abroad through EAP is com12arable to the cost of studying at UCI. EAP participants are responsible for UC registration and educational fees, campus fees, and room, board, books and personal expenses. The only addi\u00ad tional costs directly related to the Program are for round-trip transportation and vacation travel, and personal expenses beyond what normally would be spent at home. Most Uni\u00ad versity of California financial aid, including grants, scholar\u00ad ships, and loans, is available to students who qualify. Normally, students participate in EAP during their junior year, so generally application for EAP is made in the sopho\u00ad more year. However, students may apply for participation as fourth-or fifth-year seniors or as second-year graduate stu\u00ad dents. Students interested in EAP should contact the EAP Office early in the fall quarter concerning application dead\u00ad lines because of early deadlines for the United Kingdom and Ireland (early November). The deadline for Australia is May, and for most other countries is mid-January. Application forms are available in the EAP Office, located in Trailer 504, telephone (714) 856-6343. Shortly i).fter the dead\u00ad line for receipt of applications, applicants will be interviewed by a UCI campus selection committee consisting of faculty and EAP returnees. The files of applicants selected by the UCI committee are then sent to the Universitywide EAP Office at the Santa Barbara campus for final selection. Academic Program Generally, EAP students attend courses taught by faculty of the host university in the language of the host country; thus, language skills are very important. The academic program includes (1) an intensive preparatory course in the language of the host country (this does not apply to programs in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Egypt, India, and Kenya, in which English is the primary language); (2) a full year of academic courses; and (3) opportunity to audit courses within the host university. Students are expected to complete a min\u00ad imum of 36 units during the academic year in addition to units earned in the intensive language program. Although units and grade points earned through the EAP are incorporated into the participant's University transcript and grade point average, tl;te academic unit in which the partici\u00ad pant's major is offered determines which EAP courses will be accepted in satisfaction of requirements for the specific major. A number of majors require that certain key upper\u00ad division courses be completed in residence at UCI. EAP participants who satisfy all degree requirements while abroad and who expect to graduate upon completion of their year abroad should file for candidacy to receive their degree in September because, unfortunately, transcripts from abroad take time to reach the home campus and are not .received in time for EAP returnees to be included on the June degree list. Such returnees, however, may participate in June Commencement. Study Centers The courses and fields of study open to EAP participants vary at each center; each of the host institutions has special areas of excellence and strength. Detailed information about each center is available in descriptive brochures for each country. They are available from advisors in the EAP Office. Below is a list of countries and universities participating in the EA:P during the 1985-86 academic year. Australia: University of Melbourne, Monash University (Melbourne), LaTrobe University (Melbourne), The Austral\u00ad ian National University (Canberra), Macquarie University (Sydney), University of Sydney Austria: University of Vienna Brazil: University of Sao Paulo China: Beijing University and Nanjing University Egypt: The American University of Cairo England: University of Birmingham, University of Exeter, University of Hull, University of Kent, University of Lancas-. ter, University of Leeds, University of Sussex, Westfield Col\u00ad lege (London), University of france: University of Grenoble, Uni\u00ad versity of Marseilles, Paul Valery University (Montpellier), of University of Poitiers Germany: Georg-August University (Gottingen) Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong India: University of Delhi Ireland: University of Dublin (Trinity College) Israel: University of Haifa and Hebrew University (Jerusalem) Italy: University of Padua, Conservatorio Bisonte (Florence), University of Venice Japan: International Christian University (Tokyo) Kenya: University of Nairobi Mexico: Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Norway: University of Bergen Peru: Universidad Catolica (Lima) Scotland: University of St. Andrews, University of Stirling Spairi: University of Barcelona and University of Madrid Sweden: University of Lund Taiwan: National Chengchi University (Taipei) U.S.S.R.: Leningrad State University Wales: St. David's University College (Lampeter) Univer\u00ad sity College Wales (Aberystwyth) West Bay College (Sierra Leone), University of Benin (Togo) Education at Home Program In winter quarter the University's Riverside campus will con\u00ad tinue the Education at Home Program (EHP) for those stu\u00ad dents with special interest in early American history and cul\u00ad ture. Those selected for participation in this program will spend nine weeks in Williamsburg, Virginia; one in Philadel\u00ad phia; and a concluding week in Washington, D.C. The pro\u00ad gram is open to all undergraduates from all campuses in the University of California system. With the prior approval of their graduate advisor, graduate students also may apply. Participants register for three courses through the Riverside campus' Department of History (History 157, 158, 159). Spe\u00ad cial arrangements for additional independent study (maxi-\u00b7 mum of four units) may be made with the student's home campus. Costs for housing, food, and transportation are the individual participant's responsibility. For further informa\u00ad tion, brochures, or application forms, please telephone (714) 787-3820. Preference is given to applications received by June 30; final application deadline is November 1. Academic Regulations and Procedures Except where noted, all information applies to both under\u00ad graduate and graduate students. Additional information con\u00ad cerning academic regulations applying only to graduate stu\u00ad dents is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Student Academic Records Student's official academic records are maintained perman\u00ad ently by the Registrar and are used for purposes such as aca\u00ad demic advising, scholarship awards, admission to professional . or graduate schools, and future employment. Each student is responsible for carefully examining their en\u00ad rollment and academic records and they may do so through\u00ad out the academic year. Students must promptly notify the . Registrar's Office if they find a discrepancy in their records. Since all data entries for each student's current quarter class enrollment are put directly into the academic record system from source documents completed by the student, it is extremely important for each student to complete these source documents (e.g., Enrollment in Classes Petition and Add/Drop/Change cards) carefully and accurately. Student academic records\u00b7 may not be changed after one year or, in some cases, in less than a year if Academic Senate regu\u00ad lations specify a shorter time limit. For example, the notation \"NR,\" which means that no grade has been reported, must be removed within one quarter of subsequent enrollment\" or it will automatically be converted to the grade \"F\" (under Senate Regulation IR 345). Academic Regulations and Procedures 59 Grading System A -Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) B -Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C -Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D -Lowest passing grade (1.0 grade point per unit) F -Not passing (no grade points) -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP-Not Pass S -Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) U -Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) IP -In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so designated by the Committee on Courses, for which the final quarter grade of a multiquarter sequence course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence) NR-No Report (given when an instructor's final grade course report is not submitted or when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not report a grade for the student; NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, which\u00ad ever comes first, unless the instructor at the student's request clears the record or replaces NR with a grade within one quarter of subsequent enrollment). W -Withdrew. A W notation is recorded on a student's permanent record for each course a student drops after the end of the sixth week of instruction in a quarter. Courses in which a W has been entered on a student's record will be dis\u00ad regarded in determining the student's grade point average and will not be considered as courses attempted in assessing the 'student's satisfaction of the normal progress requirement. Plus suffixes may be attached to the grades B, C. and D; minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C. and D. Plus grades carry three-tenths grade point more per unit, and minus grades carry three-tenths grade point less per unit than unsuffixed grades. After each quarter, a copy of the student's permanent record is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the stu\u00ad dent will find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a com\u00ad putation of grade point average at the University of Califor\u00ad nia, and a list of the University requirements completed (Sub\u00ad ject A, American History and Institutions, etc.). Requirements for a bachelor's degree include the accumula\u00ad tion of credit for 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI nor\u00ad mally offers four quarter units of credit, and, in the following text, the term \"course\" may be understood to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all accumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course per unit times the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors at UCI are normally permanent and final. A professor may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical or pro\u00ad cedural error. Clerical or procedural errors should be cor\u00ad rected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. Under circumstances explained in the Academic Grievance Procedures (Manual of the Irvine Division of the UC IRVINE - 1985-198660 Academic Regulations and Procedures Academic Senate, Appendix II), a grade may be changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has determined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. Incomplete Grades An I or Incomplete grade is assigned by an instructor to a student when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and when the student has been excused by the instructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for making up an I grade is Three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I grade can no longer be replaced and will appear permanently on the record. The student should con\u00ad sult the instructor to determine how the Incomplete may be made up. The instructor is not obligated to allow the maximum three-quarter period. It is strongly recommended that the stu\u00ad dent and the instructor prepare a written agreement specify\u00ad ing how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. A form is available for this purpose. Once the work is completed within a time agreed upon by the instructor, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the office of the dean of the school in which the course was offered. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one calendar year in which to replace an Incomplete. How\u00ad ever, in exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two additional years may be granted by the instructor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within \u00b7one calendar year following the assignment of the Incomplete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the student's permanent record. Any I grade will remain indefinitely on the permanent record unless the work is com\u00ad pleted and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point average of 2.0 for all units attempted in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when 11 check for satisfaction of gradua\u00ad tion requirements is made are I's treated as F's. If the student's overall average is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades computed as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, the student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0 and this must be done within the time limits specified above. Pass/Not Pass The Pass/Not Pass option is available at UCI to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are not included in compu\u00ad tation of the grade point average which appears on a stu\u00ad dent's permanent record. However, if a student receives a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is received, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the stu\u00ad dent receives no credit for the class. The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the following provisions: 1. A student in good standing may take up to an average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, candidates for the bachelor's degree may take a total of 12 more units in courses designated by academic units as Pass/ Not Pass Only. 2. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-, D, or F, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no unit credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the student's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 3. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the 180-unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward the breadth requirement. With the exception of courses designated by the academic unit Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy spe\u00ad cific course requirements of the student's school, major, and minor department(s), unless authorized by the appropriate dean. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program, may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree, and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. 4. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option must be made during the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of classes without the approval of the dean of the student's school. No changes in the Pass/Not Pass option can be made after the last day of instruction. 5. A student on academic probation may not enroll in a course with the Pass/Not Pass option. (Physical Education courses are excepted.) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grades (Graduate Students Only) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research or other individual graduate work undertaken by a graduate student may be evaluated by means of the grades S or U. Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only. Also, the gradeS or U may be assigned provisonally in each but the last quarter of a gradu\u00ad ate course extending over more than one quarter. Upon completion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provisional grades. When a grade of S or U has been . assigned on a provisional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the course sequence, the instructor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. With the specific approval of the Graduate Council, other graduate courses may be graded on an S/U basis provided that each student enrolled in such a course receives a grade of S, U, or I (or if an undergraduate student, a grade of P or NP). The gradeS is defined as equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. Grades In Progress IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given UC IRVINE - 1985-1986only for courses designated by the Academic Senate Commit\u00ad tee on Courses for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computations of the student's grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grades Not Reported A student who receives an NR must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an For NP after one quarter of subse\u00ad quent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript notations are not included in computations of the grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grade Points and Grade Point Average Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, 1 point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit. Each undergraduate course counts one through eight units, and graduate courses range from one to 12 units each (see departmental course descriptions). Grade point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total value of courses attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades are excluded in computing grade point average. Academic Regulations and Procedures 61 Removal of Deficient Grades Undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of C-, D +, 0, 0-, F, or NP were received. (A C-earned before fall quarter, 1984, is not repeatable.) Degree credit for courses so repeated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergraduate with repeated courses in which a C-, D +, 0, 0-, F, or NP was received, only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, the grade point average shall be based oil all addi\u00ad tional grades assigned and on total units attempted. A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below Bora grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the stu\u00ad dent's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. UC IRVINE - 1985-198662 Academic Regulations and Procedures Satisfaction of the Writing Requirement Once a student matriculates to UCI, the student can take only UCI courses ,in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division Writing requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in the lower-division courses: I. Students who fail to attain a grade of C in one or both courses of the English and Comparative Literature WR39B-C sequence must repeat the course or courses in question, 2. Students who fail to attain a C in Humanities 15 normally should enroll in English and Comparative Literature WR39B; students who fail to attain a C in Humanities 16 should nor\u00ad mally enroll in English and Comparative Literature WR39C. Alternatively, a student who fails to attain a C in either Humanities 15 or 16 may repeat these courses with the per\u00ad mission of a faculty advisor or academic counselor. 3. Students who fail to attain a C in at least two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course nor\u00ad mally should substitute English and Comparative Literature WR39C if they need one quarter of additional work to com\u00ad plete the requirement, or English and Comparative Literature WR39B-C if they need two quarters to complete the requirement. The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in the upper-division course: Students who fail to attain a grade of C in English and Com\u00ad parative Literature WRI39 should repeat it. Students follow\u00ad ing any other approved upper-division option should enroll in English and Comparative Literature WR139 if a Cis not attained in the selected course. See pages 47 and 51 for further information on the Writing requirement portion of the breadth requirement. Credit by Examination An enrolled student may obtain credit for many courses by taking a special examination administered by a faculty member who normally teaches that course. Detailed proce\u00ad dures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the office of the dean of the school which offers the course. Approval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Examination Fee at the Cashier's Office. The instructor giving the examination retains the prerogative (I) to decide whether the course can be taken by examina\u00ad tion, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipulate whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as A B, C D, or F. A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the examination, grades and grade points will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. Independent Study: Undergraduates Only Another class option is available primarily fo upper-division sfu-denfs af UCI. The independent-study option allows the stu\u00ad dent to plan with the instructor a course having a clear rela\u00ad tionship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or similar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A de\u00ad scription of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor responsible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independent-study credit for undergraduates is normally limited to five units per quarter. Final Examinations Final examinations are obligatory in all undergraduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, or their equiv\u00ad alent, as individually determined by the Committee on Courses. Normally each such examination shall be conducted in writing and must be completed by all participants by the announced time shown in the Schedule of Classes for the quarter in question. These examinations may not exceed three hours duration. In laboratory and studio courses, the department concerned may at its option require a final exam\u00ad ination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Classes for the term. Final grade reports from professors are due in the Registrar's Office within 72 hours after the final examination. Undergraduate Scholarship Requirements Class Level Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sopho\u00ad more, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units acquired, as follows: Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior 0-40.4 40.5- 83.9 84.0-134.9 135.0 -180.0 Course Load Limits An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units a student must obtain the signature of the stu\u00ad dent's dean on the Enrollment in Classes Petition. Any action to add or drop courses after submission of the Enrollment in Classes Petition which will cause a student to be enrolled in more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units requires approval by the student's dean. This approval is certified by the dean's signature on the Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, as appropriate. Students in the part-time study program are referred to page 42. Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing a student must main\u00ad tain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student normally is subject to academic probation if at the end of any quarter the grade point average for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on proba\u00ad tion has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satisfactory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Normal Progress Requirement Regular undergraduate students will become subject to pro\u00ad bation or subject to disqualification from further registration in the University if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalaureate degree. (A) Normal progress for all regular undergraduate students is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units completed at the end of quarters enrolled. Normal Subject to Quarter Progress Probation I I2-I5 8-11 2 12 I80 Subject to Disqualification 7 IS 23 39 55 71 88 IOS I23 I4I I 59 (B) A student who at the end of a given quarter of enroll\u00ad ment has completed the number of units in the range speci\u00ad fied in the \"Normal Progress\" category under (A) is making normal progress. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Probation\" category under (A) is subject to being placed on probation by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. A stu\u00ad dent who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed no more than a number of units in the range spec\u00ad ified in the \"Subject to Disqualification\" category under (A) is subject to disqualification by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. (C) Students who have completed two consecutive quarters on academic probation without having achieved at the end of that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under (A) are subject to disqualification. A student will be allowed to continue on probation only if the record indicates likely achievement of the required scholastic standing within a reasonable time. (D) For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Subject to Probation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" students admitted to the University with advanced standing will be classified with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accordance with the following table: Quarter at Advanced Standing Quarter Entrance Units at Entrance I O-I4 2 IS-29 3 30-44 4 45-59 8 IOS-119 9 I20-I34 IO I35-I49 (E) Units earned under the following three circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (D) above: (I) Advanced Placement Examina-Academic Regulations and Procedures 63 tion; (2) College Level Examination Program; (3) concurrent enrollment in college courses while in high school. (F) The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students (in\u00ad cluding baccalaureate degree candidates who already hold a baccalaureate degree) seeking admission to the University with ISO or more advanced standing units will be determined by the faculty offering the curriculum in which such stu\u00ad dents seek to enroll. This determination will be made con\u00ad sistent with the program required for such students to obtain the desired degree and with University residence requirements. (G) The Normal Progress requirement described above is not to be confused with the Normal Academic Progress require\u00ad ment for Financial Aid. The former has to do with academic standing, the latter with receipt of financial aid. Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a student becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be carefully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the stu\u00ad dent's school. If the record\u00b7 indicates little probability that the student will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enrollment. Each school and program is obliged by Academic Senate regulations to maintain a procedure under which a student may appeal probation and disqualification actions. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the Uni\u00ad versity of California or from one UCI school to another, a student who has been disqualified or who is on academi_c probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty, or its designated agent, into whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. Honors* Quarterly Undergraduate Honors Quarterly undergraduate honors are awarded in each school to students who achieve a quarterly grade point average of 3.5 or better in a minimum of I2 graded units. Honors at Graduation Students may graduate with honors, summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude. The criteria used by each school in selecting candidates for these honors are included in each school's section of the Catalogue. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Graduate Scholarship Requirements For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship. Information concerning graduate student course load requirements and satisfactory academic progress is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Enrollment in University Extension If a UCI student wishes to enroll ip a University Extension course concurrently with enrollment in regular courses, the entire program of study must be approved in advance by the dean of the student's school (in the case of graduate students, by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research). *See the School of Humanities, the Program in Social Ecology, and the School of Social Sciences sections for descriptions of specific academic honors programs. UC IRVINE - 1985-198664 Academic Support Services/Campus Life and Student Activities. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Undergraduate Students UCI undergraduate students who wish to enroll in courses at another institution in either a summer or regular session and to use such courses to satisfy any UCI requirements should secure approval from the Office of Admissions and their aca\u00ad demic dean. The Office of Admissions is responsible for determining if these credits are transferable to UCI, and the academic dean or director of the academic unit which offers the student's major is responsible for determining if the cred\u00ad its are applicable to major and breadth requirements. If such courses are determined by the Office of Admissions to be transferable, and if such courses do not duplicate other credit granted and do not exceed limitations of credit, then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. Forms for securing such authorization are availabfe in the Office of Admissions and in deans' offices. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Graduate Students Graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for acceptable graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through Univer\u00ad sity Extension prior to first enrollment in graduate study at UCI. To receive such credit, the student must initiate a for\u00ad mal petition after enrollment in graduate study. Approval of the stude.nt's Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean is required. While enrolled at UCI or on a Leave of Absence a graduate student may receive unit credit for graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the student's Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. See the Graduate Studies and Research section for further information about graduate transfer credit and the Univer\u00ad sity's Intercampus Exchange Program. Program of Academic Support Services The Program of Academic Support Services (PASS) is a cam\u00ad puswide academic assistance program focused on improving students' knowledge in the areas of writing, reading, analyti\u00ad cal thinking, science, and mathematics. These programs are intended to meet the individual needs of UCI students in a coherent, pedagogically sound, and enriching manner. Although these programs are not offered for academic credit, they are developed in conjunction with the academic depart\u00ad ments and are designed to be a resource for the entire range of students at UCI. For example, programs are available to assist students who do not pass the University placement examinations in writing, mathematics, or chemistry as well as for those who desire greater academic proficiency in order to excel in their course work, upper-division research assign\u00ad ments, or in honors programs. Some of the major PASS pro\u00ad grams are discussed below. It is hoped that students who desire assistance will find a PASS program that is suited to their needs and that will make their education at UCI more succe5~ful and rewarding. Learning Skills staff provide programs designed to streng\u00ad then and develop a student's reading, writing, mathe111atics, science, analytic thinking, and study skills, in order to enrich and enhance the student's education at UCI. Some Learning Skills programs are neither discipline- nor course-specific, but stress the development of abilities that all students need regardless of field or major. Such programs include work\u00ad shops and individual counseling in time management, prob\u00ad lem solving, speed reading, listening and note taking, prepa\u00ad ration for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), and the Graduate Manage\u00ad ment Admission Test (GMAT), and classes in vocabulary development and critical reading. A special program of course-related adjuncts is offered in conjunction with designated introductory courses in writing, humanities, psychology, chemistry, mathematics, and social sciences. These adjuncts are coordinated with regular course instruction, and provide an opportunity for students to improve their academic skills. Students who are weak in cer\u00ad tain subjects are encouraged to enroll in these adjunct sections. The objective of the Tutorial Assistance Program (TAP) is to aid undergraduate students in comprehending and retaining course-specific subject matter and in developing the under\u00ad standing necessary for successful independent learning. Through individual and small-group tutorials, TAP activities are designed to engender student confidence and to cultivate, by maximizing a student's participation, his or her ability to work with and articulate aspects of the course. Tutoring is available in the following disciplines: the biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, engineering, the fine arts, the humanities, mathematics, physics, social ecology, and the social sciences. The PASS Writing Workshops seek to provide in-depth writ\u00ad ing assistance of a focused and methodical nature to students who may find English and Comparative Literature WR39A difficult because of insufficiencies in their University prepara\u00ad tion. This assistance, furnished to newly admitted students, addresses specific compositional weaknesses and endeavors to provide students, at an early stage of their coursework, with necessary verbal skills. Assistance is given in the form of workshops attached to special sections of English and Com\u00ad parative Literature WR39A. Limited in size to small groups and individual tutorials, the Writing Workshops will allow tutors to give intensive and individualized attention to students. Placement testing is being given in the areas of writing, read\u00ad ing, mathematics, chemistry, and English as a second lan\u00ad guage. This testing will provide students with a knowledge of their academic preparation prior to their enrollment in classes. Therefore, it will enable them to formulate effective plans of study and help them enroll in courses for which they have the necessary preparation. For further information, please see page 23.

On-campus residences are available for 1,550 single under\u00ad graduate students in Mesa Court and Middle Earth. UCI's residence hall program emphasizes small-group living. Each hall houses from 40 to 60 students and a student resident assistant or resident staff member. The small-scale buildings provide excellent opportunities for social interaction, student government, and leadership experience. Liberal use of wood in building design and attractive landscaping help to create a home-like environment. The residences are divided into suites of four or five double rooms, with living room and bath; each residence also contains a lounge and recreation and study rooms. A limited number of single rooms also are available in each residence hall. Every room has carpeting and draperies, and is furnished with a bed, desk, chair, chest of drawers, closet, and bookshelves for each student. Both Mesa Court and Middle Earth have complete food service and din-Campus and Student Services 69 ing commons for their residents. The halls are closed during the Christmas and spring recesses. Each hall tends to have distinctive characteristics and often focuses on a specific interest or life-style. Examples include halls devoted to the fine arts, the humanities, languages, the outdoors, or crafts. Students who live in the residence halls participate in a prepaid meal plan. Meals are served cafeteria\u00ad style, and the menu offers a wide selection of food, with fresh fruit and an array of salads daily. Meals are served three times daily on weekdays (brunch and dinner only on Saturday and Sunday) in the Mesa Court and Middle Earth Commons.\u00b7 The Student Programs Offices at Mesa Court and Middle Earth have responsibility for providing student residents with an environment conducive to their intellectual, social, and personal growth. The housing staffs work closely with students to create opportunities for educational exploration and ways of developing interpersonal skills. Academically oriented residential learning programs include the Social Sci\u00ad ence Center, Social Science Hall, Humanities House, Social Ecology Center, Foreign Language Programs, and Center for the Arts. The Outdoors and Photography Halls are examples of special interest hall programs. Weekend field trips and retreats, designed to amplify on-campus experiences, are often part of the interest hall programs. The Student Pro\u00ad grams Offices also supervise and train resident assistants and resident staff, advise the residential student government, and coordinate information and skill development workshops. An unusual housing option at UCI is the 80-space recrea\u00ad tional vehicle park, Irvine Meadows West, which provides housing for graduate and undergraduate students. The rate for 1985-86 is $75 per month per space. Students must provide their own recreational vehicle or trailer which must contain a sink, hardware for running water, and a stove. An application for Irvine Meadows West may be obtained from the On-Campus Housing Office; there is a $15 nonrefund\u00ad able application fee. Currently, there is a waiting list of 18 to 24 months. An apartment complex for single undergraduates, Campus Village, offers 200 two-bedroom apartments housing 800 students. Half of the units are furnished; all apartments include carpeting, draperies, a stove, and a refrigerator. Vari\u00ad ous programs are offered in the Community Center Building, and in the complexes' two lounges and recreation buildings. Monthly rates, which include utilities, are $230 per student for an unfurnished apartment and $262 per student for a furnished apartment for 1985-86. An increase in rates for 1986-87 is anticipated. The University also has 862 one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments in Verano Place for full-time registered students who are married, single parents, graduate students, or who are single and 25 years of age or older. Approximately one\u00ad third of the apartments are furnished, and all have carpeting, draperies, a stove, and a refrigerator. They are attractive and considerably lower in rent than comparable units in local communities. An assortment of social, cultural, and educa\u00ad tional programs such as community dinners, courses, and workshops is offered in the community. Students may apply to live in Verano Place at any time by requesting an applica\u00ad tion from the On-Campus Housing Office. A nonrefundable application fee of $15 must accompany the application. Appli\u00ad cation should be made well in advance of the date the student wishes to move in. Undergraduate applicants wanting to live in the undergradu\u00ad ate residence halls or apartments must indicate their interest UC IRVINE - 1985-198670 Campus and Student Services in on-campus housing by marking the appropriate item on the UC Undergradu'ate Application for Admission in order to receive an application for housing. Due to the large demand for housing, newly admitted students wishing to live on campus will participate in a lottery for housing space. The lottery system will apply to students entering UCI in the 1986-87 academic year and thereafter. To be eligible for the lottery, prospective students must return their housing appli\u00ad cation by February 3, accompanied by a $15 nonrefundable application fee. (Housing applications received after February 3 will not be placed in the lottery.) The lottery will be held on February 10. Names of applicants will be drawn in random order. Letters will be sent to applicants regarding their lot\u00ad tery status by late February. To maintain lottery status, the student must have been accepted for admission to UCI and their Statement of Intention to Register (SIR) must have been received by the Admissions Office on or before May 1. Only those prospective students who have returned both their housing application and their SIR will be eligible to receive a housing contract. Any applicant for housing who is admitted to UCI but who does not return their SIR by May 1 will lose their lottery status, and their names will be dropped to the bottom of the waiting list. Those students who do not receive notification of their admission status prior to May 1 will retain their lottery position but must return their SIR within two weeks of receipt of notification of acceptance from the Admissions Office. In addition, priority is given to those students who live outside a specified radius from cam\u00ad pus who apply for the undergraduate residence halls or undergraduate apartments between November 1 and Febru\u00ad ary 3. Continuing undergraduates must participate in a lot\u00ad tery for space in the residence halls or undergraduate apart\u00ad ments for the following academic year. Students who become eligible for residence hall contracts will be obliged to pay approximately $100 as a reservation fee at the time the contract is returned to the University; any can\u00ad cellation, regardless of the circumstances or time of year, will result in a nonrefundable penalty fee. Charges for 1985-86 are $4,126 for a single room and $3,742 for a space in a double room; both rates exclude an $18 annual association fee. We anticipate an increase in cost for the 1986-87 aca\u00ad demic year. The cost of room and board in the residence halls is paid in quarterly payments. Students who live off campus may wish to take advantage of the Nonresident Meal Contract. This contract, good for any quarter, enables a student to eat 19 meals per week in Mesa Commons. For spring quarter, 1985, the price of the meal plan was $6.50 per day. Student Health Service All fully registered students and students approved for par\u00ad ticipation in the part-time study program are eligible for Stu\u00ad dent Health Service benefits under the UCI program. Stu\u00ad dent Health facilities include a complete outpatient clinic, staffed by physicians and nurses, supported by an x-ray and clinical laboratory. General medical clinics are held 8:00a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day during the week. Specialty clinics are held at variously scheduled times by appointment and include Dermatology, Gynecology, Orthopedics, Mental Health, Birth Control, Minor Surgery, Nutrition/Weight Control, and Ear, Nose, and Throat. Emergency service is provided after regu\u00ad lar hours and on weekends when classes are in session. An infirmary provides inpatient care for students who need bed care. The main telephone number for Student Health is (714) 856-5301. A basic insurance program also is available which provides limited coverage for emergency care and hospitalization when such care is required but not available at the Student Health Service. Each fully registered student at UCI will automatically have this limited Health and Accident Insur\u00ad ance plan in effect. To assure coverage each student is required to have a current medical history ami physiwl examirwlion on file a/ the Student Health Sen1ice. Undergraduate students are mailed medical history and physical examination forms after they return their $50 Undergraduate Acceptance of Admission Fee; graduate and medical students should visit the Center when they arrive at UCI to obtain and complete the forms. Students should check with the Student Health Service for information on the benefits and limitations under the insur\u00ad ance plan. Student Health coverage extends from the first day of the quarter to but not including the first day of the following quarter, but begins only after the student has paid the full Registration Fee and has been issued the Class Verification and Identification Card. There is an exception for spring quarter coverage which extends only to the last day of that quarter. Optional additional insurance for students, spouses, and chil\u00ad dren and coverage for the summer or one unregistered quar\u00ad ter each year is available. Enrollment in this plan is limited to a short time at the beginning of each quarter. To ensure cov\u00ad erage, students should visit the Student Health Center dur\u00ad ing the first week of each quarter for more information and application forms. Physical Examinations and Health Clearances. All new stu\u00ad dents and students returning to UCI after an absence of two or more quarters are required to have a complete physical examination within 90 days prior to the first day of the quar\u00ad ter. Students returning after participation in the Education Abroad Program must comply with this requirement upon their return to UCI. The examination should be performed by the student's own physician. If this is impractical, the examination can be obtained at the Student Health Service for a moderate charge. Please call for an appointment. Stu\u00ad dents transferring from another University of California campus where their medical records are on file should have the records transferred to UCI Health Services. Failure to comply with the physical examination requirement results in loss of insurance eligibility and services provided by the Stu\u00ad dent Health Service. Student Health coverage provides as many services as possi\u00ad ble without additional charge; however, some services are available only on a fee-for-service basis. Some of the services available for a charge are immunizations, allergy desensitiza\u00ad tion injections, prescriptions from the Student Health Phar\u00ad macy, dental services including minor surgery, elective labora\u00ad tory tests, and, time permitting, physical examinations for employment, insurance, or a marriage license.

Rodriguez Dean Graduate education and research, two major areas of respon\u00ad sibility of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, are vital and integral parts of academic life at UCI. Programs leading to doctoral or master's degrees are offered in more than 40 academic and professional areas. Many of UCI's graduate programs and research activities have achieved national reputations for excellence, and several are interna\u00ad tionally recognized as leaders in their respective fields. UCI graduate programs continue to grow and to evolve in direc\u00ad tions that are consistent with the University's teaching, research, and public service missions. Graduate study at UCI provides the excitement and satisfaction that spring from the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge, as well as from meeting new challenges. The Dean of Graduate Studies and Research has general ad\u00ad ministrative responsibility for graduate education and research. Graduate education responsibilities include admis\u00ad sions, enrolled-student actions and advising, degree awards, fellowship and assistantship administration, Teaching As\u00ad sistant training, and the Graduate and Professional Oppor\u00ad tunity Program, which facilitates the involvement of minor\u00ad ity students and women in graduate education. In the area of research, the Graduate Dean has responsibility for the administration of extramurally funded training grants, gen\u00ad eral research administration, and research policy develop\u00ad ment and implementation. The Division of Graduate Studies and Research also is ad\u00ad ministratively responsible for Organized Research Units, Focused Research Programs, the Office of Contracts and Grants Administration, and other campus research activities. The following sections describe areas of graduate education and research, and include information about academic regula\u00ad tions and policies important to applicants and graduate students. Graduate Education With the exception of programs conducted by the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine for the training of medical professionals, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research administers graduate education, in accordance with academic policies established by the Academic Senate and by the Grad\u00ad uate Council, a standing committee of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. There is no separate graduate faculty at UCI; graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have concurrent responsibility for under\u00ad graduate studies. A great deal of information about graduate education at UCI is published in the UCI General Catalogue, the annual gradu\u00ad ate study announcement, and individual graduate program publications. The staff of the Division Office is ready to help :Jnswer questions about admission, academic policies and procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assist\u00ad ance, student services, and other matters of concern to appli\u00ad cants or graduate students. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram (GPOP), positive steps are being taken to increase the participation of minorities, and women in certain fields, in the graduate academic and professional programs of the Uni\u00ad versity. Appropriate assistance is offered during the admis\u00ad sion process, and every effort is made through GPOP advis\u00ad ing and support to ensure that all students will have a rea\u00ad sonable chance to attain their academic objectives. UCI does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, or marital status. Admission to Graduate Standing Applicants for admission to graduate study at UCI must apply for acceptance into a specific graduate program to work toward an advanced degree. A general requirement for admis\u00ad sion is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philosophy, or Science (or an acceptable equivalent) from a recognized academic institution. A grade point aver\u00ad age of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or better is required. Each applicant's file is evaluated by the admissions committee of the specific graduate program and by the Graduate Dean on the basis of such factors as academic subject preparation, scholarship, letters of recommendation, test scores, and examples of previous work. A critical question is whether the applicant's academic objectives can reasonably be satisfied by the graduate programs on this campus. The University of California does not have the capacity to accommodate all , applicants who meet the minimum admission requirements. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to assess the professional placement opportunities that are anticipated in the field of interest. It is generally recognized that the number of traditional academic appointments in certain disci\u00ad plines is limited. There are, however, other attractive career options, many of them as yet unrecognized, for highly moti\u00ad vated men and women who demonstrate intellectual strength, integrity, and discipline in earning an advanced degree from a respected university. UCI is committed to help\u00ad ing graduate students develop, in addition to their academic training, the communication and problem-solving skills that also may be critical to future careers. Application Procedures How to Apply Applicants must complete the Application for Admission which may be obtained by contacting individual graduate programs or the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. The application must be submitted on the forms supplied by UCI and accompanied by a check, draft, or money order pay\u00ad able to Regents-UC in the exact amount of the $35 Applica\u00ad tion Fee. This fee is not refundable. Detailed instructions on how to complete the application are contained in the applica\u00ad tion packet. When to Apply For all graduate programs, applications should be completed by January 1 to receive full consideration for fellowship and assistantship awards. Some academic units will accept appli\u00ad cations for winter or spring quarter admission for which deadlines are October 15 and January 15 respectively. In order to process applications in time for the applicant to receive full consideration, letters of recommendation, official transcripts, and test scores must be received before the pub\u00ad lished deadlines. Applications for admission received after the published deadline for the quarter requested will be deferred automatically to the next open quarter. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Required Supporting Documents Letters of Recommendation Applicants should arrange to have three letters of recom\u00ad mendation forwarded directly to their prospective major department or program. Recommendation forms are enclosed in the application packet. Only one set of recommendation letters needs to be submitted in support of an application for admission and fellowship or assistantship consideration. It is important that letters of recommendation be completed by professors or instructors in disciplines related to the proposed course of study who are in a position to analyze an applicant's abilities and academic promise. \u00b7 Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) Scores All applicants are required to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test, with the following excep\u00ad tions: (I) the Graduate Schoo.! of Management prefers that applicants take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), and (2) no tests are required of those who seek the Master of Fine Arts degree, the Master of Arts in Teaching degree, or. California education credentials. There is no min\u00ad imum GRE score. Several programs also require, or strongly recommend, that an applicant report the score of a GRE Sub\u00ad ject Test. Applicants should register for either the October or December test dates to ensure the timely receipt of their score results for admission consideration. The GRE is admin\u00ad istered five times a year in the United States and in 96 other countries. In addition, several administrative service tests are given each year in major U.S. cities (dates vary). Applications for the GRE may be obtained from the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 955, Princeton, New Jersey 08541. Academic Records Domestic applicants should request that official transcripts be forwarded directly to their prospective major department or program. Two complete sets of official records covering all postsecondary academic work attempted, regardless of length of attendance, are required. University of California tran\u00ad scripts must also be requested by applicants, including those who are UCI undergraduates. Applicants with academic work in progress must expect to complete their undergraduate degree programs before the intended date of enrollment at UCI and must submit evidence of degree conferral before officially enrolling. Foreign Academic Records Official records from overseas institutions should be sent directly to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research at UCI for an evaluation. The Division Office will then forward the documents to your major department. Records of aca\u00ad demic study from foreign institutions must be official, bear\u00ad ing the signature of the registrar and the seal of the issuing institution. Do not send the original of an academic record which cannot be replaced; obtain instead properly certified copies. Unless academic records and diplomas are issued in English by the institution, the official records in their original language must be submitted with an authorized, complete, and exact English translation. Foreign academic records must be in duplicate and include all subjects or courses taken on a yearly basis, together with the units of credit or time allotted. to each subject each term or year and the marks or ratings in\u00b7 each subject or examination passed. In all cases, the institu- . tiona) grading scale or other standard of evaluation, including maximal passing and failing marks and definition of grades between them, should appear on official records or as an offi-Graduate Studies/Application Procedures 73 cia! attachment. Official evidence of degree conferral must also be supplied, together with evidence of rank in class if available. Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) All applicants whose primary language is not English are required to submit the test results of the TOEFL examina\u00ad tion. The TOEFL examination should be taken at the earliest available date to allow for scores to be reported in time to \u00b7 meet the application deadlines. A score of 550 or better is required for admission consideration. Arrangements for tak\u00ad ing the TOEFL may be made through the nearest United States Embassy or by writing to the Educational Testing Ser\u00ad vice, P.O. Box 2896, Princeton, New Jersey 08541. Test of Spoken English (TSE) All applicants whose primary language is not English and who wish to be considered for a first-year Teaching Assist\u00ad antship appointment must undergo and submit results for the Test of Spoken English (TSE). A minimum score of 220 is required in order for a TA offer to be made without an on\u00ad campus evaluation. The Test of Spoken English is given six times during the year at TOEFL test centers around the world. Information on taking the TSE may be obtained by writing to the Test of Spoken English, P.O. Box 2918, Prince\u00ad ton, New Jersey 08541. Special Note to Foreign Applicants Foreign applicants are required to certify that they possess sufficient funds to cover all fees, transportation, and living expenses for the duration of their studies at UCI. A Foreign UC IRVINE - 1985-198674 Graduate Studies/Academic Policies Applicant Questionnaire for the purpose of verifying the amount and source of funds available for graduate study will be forwarded to foreign applicants upon receipt of the com\u00ad pleted Application for Admission. The required financial veri\u00ad fication must be provided before formal admission can be offered and visa forms issued. Admission and Registration A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each\u00b7 applicant by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research as soon as possible after the application and complete records are received, and after the department has made a recom\u00ad mendation. Only the official Notification of Admission from the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research constitutes for\u00ad mal admission to a graduate program at UCI. The official not\u00ad ification will be mailed well in advance of the beginning of the quarter for which application has been made. Admission to graduate standing does not constitute registra\u00ad tion for classes. A student is not officially registered for classes until the entire registration procedure is completed each quarter. Information on registration dates and proce\u00ad dures will be mailed to new applicants prior to the registra\u00ad tion cycle. If any applicant wishes to defer admission to a later academic quarter, the Division of Graduate Studies and Research must be notified in writing. After formal admission has been offered, the academic unit must approve a request for deferral. ' Limited Status University of California academic regulations provide for the admission of students to Limited Status for two purposes: (1) to prepare for admission to a graduate or professional program by enrolling for a prescribed set of courses; or (2) to pursue a specific academic program which does not lead to a graduate degree. While Limited Status is intended to serve a broad range of educational objectives, the most common objective for which the Graduate Dean offers Limited Status admission is study leading to California education credentials. The general requirements for admission to Limited Status are the same as those for graduate admission, with the exception that Graduate Record Examination scores are not required. Admission to Limited Status is ordinarily for a period of three quarters (one academic year) and does not imply admission to a UCI graduate degree program at some later date. Although Limited Status does not represent graduate stand\u00ad ing, admission is offered by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon the recommendation of an academic unit which has agreed to oversee the student's program. Graduate courses taken while in Limited Status ordinarily qualify for transfer credit toward advanced degree requirements, but will not satisfy minimum degree or residency requirements for any UC graduate program to which the student eventu\u00ad allymight be admitted. Academic Advising In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed Graduate Advisor or Director of Graduate Studies. The Graduate Advisor is a regular faculty member responsible for supervising graduate study in that unit, for monitoring the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor. The Graduate Advisor plays a key role in the academic lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program require\u00ad ments and the academic policies of the Division of Graduate . Studies and Research, approving study lists, and evaluating academic petitions. In many academic units the Graduate Advisor is instrumental in the selection of students for assistantship and fellowship appointments, and in the super\u00ad vision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there also is an Associate Dean for Graduate Studies who coor\u00ad dinates many of the functions which affect graduate students within that school. Both Graduate Advisors and Deans are important links between the student and the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research. Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty advisor or advising committee, especially after the first year of advanced study. When a student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral committee becomes the primary source of academic guidance; however, student academic peti- tions still must be approved by the Graduate Advisor. Academic Policies The academic policies described in this section of the Cata\u00ad logue apply to students enrolled in study leading to graduate degrees and California education credentials. Other regula\u00ad tions and procedures of importance to graduate students are covered in the Academic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Procedures sections and in the description of each graduate program. Schoiastic Requirements A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Graduate Council, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in graduate study. Satisfactory progress is determined on the basis of both the recent academic record and overall performance. A graduate student normally is expected to complete satisfac\u00ad torily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regular academic session (unless on an approved Leave of Absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship and may be applied toward advanced degree requirements. However, a UCI course in which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted in partial satis\u00ad faction of the degree requirements if the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all courses applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass or Not Pass toward any degree or satisfactory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfactory, and a student whose grade point average is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's per\u00ad manent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a graduate student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. Formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees conferred, certain examinations passed, UQit credit accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information is recorded also. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory progress is not eligible for any academic appointment, such as Reader, Research Assistant, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or other award which is based upon academic merit. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Grading With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory (S/U). Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only, with the approval of the Gradu\u00ad ate Council. A grade of S is equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit is given for a course in which a grade of U was assigned. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality, but is incom\u00ad plete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Although Incomplete grades do not affect a graduate stu\u00ad dent's grade point average, they are an important factor in evaluating academic progress. The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enrollment, but stricter limits may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade notice to the Registrar, ordinarily through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade is recorded permanently. IP (In Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequen\u00ad tial courses extending over two or more quarters, for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript nota\u00ad tion must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. After one quarter, an NR becomes an F which will remain permanently upon the student's record. A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the stu\u00ad dent's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Academic Regulations section. Academic Disqualification After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research may disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper-division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required exami\u00ad nation within the time specified for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of the faculty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student is paramount. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet academic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. Graduate Studies/Policies 75 Prior to taking final action to disqualify, the Graduate Dean ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic disqualification and will provide reasonable opportunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated academic records, to submit other information or comments in writing, or to request a second review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Graduate Dean, disqualification will be noted on the formal academic record of that student. Following the formal notice of disqualification, the student may appeal to the Graduate Dean only on the basis of procedural error. Academic Residence A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an academic quarter if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one academic quarter of residence may be earned by com\u00ad pleting at least two units of credit in approved courses in each of two Summer Sessions. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecutive sessions. Enrollment Policy Full-time academic enrollment ordinarily is expected of grad\u00ad uate students at the University of California. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or graduate academic credit per quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower-division courses with the approval of their academic advisors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-division courses, or a proportionate number in com\u00ad bination. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by both the student's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Although in most instances completion of an advanced degree at UCI requires full-time study, the University recog\u00ad nizes the legitimate need for part-time study opportunities and is committed to increasing those opportunities wherever possible. Graduate degree programs may be opened to part\u00ad time students wherever good educational reasons exist for so doing. Under this policy, part-time enrollment at the graduate level is defined as enrollment for eight units or less, including enrollment in Physical Education classes. Within the guide\u00ad lines and limitations on the application form available in the \u00b7 Division Office, graduate students may petition for part-time status and, if the petition is approved, shall pay the full Uni\u00ad versity Registration Fee and student activities fees, one-half the Educational Fee, and one-half the Nonresident Tuition Fee (if applicable). Continuous Registration A graduate student is expected to enroll for each regular aca\u00ad demic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, including final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dissertation. Enrollment is not offi\u00ad cial until all required fees have been paid and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition is completed correctly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. For more information, see the Enrollment and Other Procedures section. UC IRVINE - 1985-198676 Graduate Studies/Policies A student engaged in study or research outside the State of California for an entire quarter ordinarily will register in absentia. Unless an official Leave of Absence has been granted, or a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registra\u00ad tion has been approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, a student who does not register by the final dead\u00ad lines for any regular quarter will lose graduate standing, and candidacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to resum\u00ad ing graduate study in the University, a former student must successfully apply for readmission. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candi\u00ad dacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree cannot be conferred earlier than the second quarter following readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after enrolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawalor Cancellation with the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. A graduate student in good academic standing who withdraws from graduate study and intends to return within one year may submit an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Leave of Absence A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid a lapse of student status should request a Leave of Absence. A Leave of Absence of up to one year's duration may be granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon the recommendation of the student's aca\u00ad demic unit, subject to the following guidelines: 1. The student must have completed satisfactorily at least one quarter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consistent with the student's academic objectives. 2. Leave ordinarily is approved in cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a University fellowship, research grant, or financial aid pro\u00ad gram, and may not hold an academic appointment or compar\u00ad able University employment. During a period of leave, a stu\u00ad dent may not take comprehensive or qualifying examinations or earn academic credit (except by a transfer of credit from another institution approved in advance by the Graduate Dean). Leave may not be granted to students who intend to make use of most University resources or facilities (including housing), and it may be revoked if they do so. 4. A student failing to register for the next regular academic session following the expiration of leave will lose graduate standing and will be subject to the following readmission policy. Readmission A student who previously withdrew from the University, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission to graduate study by submitting an Application for Readmission with a $35 fee, which is nonrefundable. The Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research may grant readmission when recom\u00ad mended by the academic unit. If readmitted, a student's pre\u00ad vious academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the Gradu\u00ad ate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including those for formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student must regis\u00ad ter and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the second quarter following readmission. Intercampus Exchange Program A graduate student in good standing who wishes to take advantage of educational opportunities available only at another campus of the University of California may do so through the Intercampus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange student will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one year of graduate study at the home campus and will have well-defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the Deans of the respective Graduate Divisions is required. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses are encouraged so as to ensure that courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the participat\u00ad ing student's needs. Students may tak12 courses on more than one campus of the University in the same academic session. The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home campus and then enrolls at the .host campus, following the procedures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home campus. Although eligible for all normal student services, the exchange student is a visitor and is not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from the Graduate Division Office of the student's home campus and should be filed with the Office at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter in order to avoid penalties for late filing of the study list. Transfers of Credit At least one-half of the course requirement for a master's degree must be completed while in residence as a graduate student at UCI. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may 'be allowed for graduate-level work completed at another institu\u00ad tion or through University Extension prior to first graduate enrollment at UCI. Such courses do not count toward the required number of units in 200-series courses. Up to one\u00ad half the units required may be accepted from another Gradu\u00ad ate Division of the University of California. After enroll\u00ad ment, the student must initiate a formal petition for such credit. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another pro\u00ad gram must be recommended by the academic unit to which the student has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no circumstances will grade credit be transferred. A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or on a Leave of Absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at another institu\u00ad tion or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. No transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equivalent was assigned. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986A student who begins graduate study at UCI in the fall quar\u00ad ter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in preced\u00ad ing UCI Summer Sessions, provided that the formal date of admission precedes Summer Session enrollment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in intervening UCI Summer Sessions. Graduate Degrees Master's Degrees The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. The student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree prior to the beginning of. the final quarter of enrollment. Therefore, an application for advancement to candidacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be sub\u00ad mitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) degree normally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis; or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. Both require a minimum of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of prescribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achievement. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level; a thesis; and a general examination. Plan II requires at least nine courses (36 units), including 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a comprehensive examination cover\u00ad ing a broad range of subject matter in the discipline. Only approved 200-series courses completed while in residence at the University satisfy the minimum graduate course require\u00ad ment. Some programs will have course requirements exceed\u00ad ing the minimums cited above and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the descrip\u00ad tion of the specific program for more information. Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the School of Fine Arts (M.F.A. in Fine Arts) and by the Program in Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon successful completion of the equivalent of two years or more of full-time study with an emphasis upon creative expression and professional devel\u00ad opment. Special thesis or comprehensive examination requirements are established for these programs. Master of Arts in Teaching.(M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of secondary school teachers and college instructors. A minimum of one year in residence is required, usually including Summer Session course work. A thesis project or other comparable evidence of professional attainment is part of each M.A.T. program. Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Master of Pub\u00ad lic Administration (M.P.A.), and Master of Business and Pub\u00ad lic Administration (M.B.P.A.) degrees are awarded by the Graduate School of Man~gement upon successful completion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in the devel\u00ad opment of professional managerial skills. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular area of concentration within it. The research dissertation is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intellectual syn\u00ad thesis, creativity, and skill in written communication. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time res-Graduate Studies/Degrees 77 idence for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years of full-time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs administer a preliminary examination on the student's mas\u00ad tery of fundamental knowledge in the discipline. Upon suc\u00ad cessfully demonstrating a high level of scholarship on this examination and after further study, the student will con\u00ad tinue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been completed, when qualifying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Students are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candidacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council. The proposed candidacy committee list must be sub\u00ad mitted to the Division Office (on the Ph.D. Form I) at least two weeks before the final qualifying examination is to be given, so that formal appointment can be made before the examination date. The Report on Qualifying Examination for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Form II) must be signed by the committee at the time the candidacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Following a unanimous favorable vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon payment of the $25 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A re~dmitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must\" again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. may be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research (on behalf of the Graduate Council) supervises the student's program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examination if required. The chair of the doc\u00ad toral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for providing primary guidance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in res\u00ad idence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied. The In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant By action of each academic unit, the Graduate Council, and the Academic Senate Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs, a Normative Time has been established for each Ph.D. program. This is the expected number of 12-month years from first enrollment to completion of the Ph.D. for students entering with normal preparation who are able to study without serious interruptions. The Normative Time established for UCI Ph.D. programs is five years in all fields except (years in parentheses): Administration (six), Anatomy (four), Classics (six), Comparative Culture (six), Comparative Literature (six), English (six), French (six), German (six), His\u00ad tory (six), Philosophy (six), Physics (six), Social Ecology (six), Spanish (six). UC IRVINE - 1985-198678 Graduate Studies/Financial Assistance A Ph.D. student in good standing will be eligible for a quar\u00ad terly grant equal to the Educational Fee if: I. the student is a formal candidate for the Ph.D., as of the first day of the quarter; 2. the student's accrued time since first enrollment is less than the Normative Time for completion of the Ph.D. estab\u00ad lished for that graduate program (accrued time is equal to elapsed time from first enrollment as a UCI graduate student less (a) up to three quarters of approved leave, and (b) any time between completion of a graduate program or formal withdrawal and readmission in a different field of study); 3. the student is not entitled to payment of the Educational Fee from an extramural fellowship, grant, or traineeship; and 4. satisfactory academic progress has been certified by the Graduate Advisor. Additional information about the In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant program and application forms are available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Theses and Dissertations Candidates for the Ph.D. and certain master's degrees must conduct an extensive research project and submit a thesis or dissertation in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses are not supported by the University, and the cost of preparing the thesis or dissertation ordinarily ranges from $200 to $1,000, but may be considerably more. Soon after advancement to candidacy, those Ph.D. or mas\u00ad ter's candidates who are writing a thesis or dissertation should consult with the Manuscript Advisor in the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. The Manuscript Advisor has the responsibility of ensuring that the established proce\u00ad dures and standards of UCI are upheld in the preparation of theses and dissertations. After approval by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for each candidate by the Gradu\u00ad ate Council, a copy of the dissertation (two copies of a mas\u00ad ter's thesis) must be filed with the Manuscript Advisor for placement in the UCI Library. The final copy must meet the University's requirements for style, format, and appearance before the degree can be conferred. Dissertations and theses must be filed no later than the end of the eighth week of instruction in order for them to be reviewed and accepted in time for the degree to be conferred in that quarter. The Filing Fee Under certain circumstances, a student may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of reg\u00ad istration, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis, or the completion of a final oral or comprehensive examination. The student who intends to make use of any University resource, to hold any academic appointment or comparable University employment, or to receive any student service for which official registration and payment of regular fees is a requirement is not eligible to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following readmission and will be accepted immediately following a Leave of Absence only under exceptional circumstances. The date for payment of the Filing Fee without a late service fee is the same as that for the payment of other student fees. If all degree require\u00ad ments are not completed during the quarter in which the Fil\u00ad ing Fee is paid, the student must subsequently register and pay all applicable fees. Conferral of Graduate Degrees Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have advanced to candidacy for that degree and should have received formal notice confirming candidacy from the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. The student should consult the departmental Graduate Advisor to determine which degree requirements, if any, have not yet been satisfied. No later than the beginning of the final quarter, the student should file a Diploma Information form with the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. If a master's thesis or doc\u00ad toral dissertation is to be submitted, the Manuscript Advisor should be consulted well in advance about the final format and the deadline for submission of the approved manuscript. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are avail\u00ad able, which is approximately 90 days after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Financial Assistance for Graduate Students Several types of financial assistance are available to graduate students at UCI. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, tuition fellowships for nonresident students, grants-in-aid, student loans, and Work-Study. Applicants interested in assistantships or fellowships should so indicate on their application when applying for admission. For all graduate programs, applications should be completed by January I to receive full consideration for fellowship and assistantship awards. Continuing students interested in an assistantship or fellowship should contact the Graduate Advisor for their program. The awarding of fellowships for the following academic year will be made during the month of April. The University of California, Irvine subscribes to the agree\u00ad ment of the Council of Graduate Schools of the United States, under which successful applicants for awards for financial support are given until April 15 to accept or decline such awards. An award accepted from one of the member universities may be resigned at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after that date commits the student to not accepting another appointment without first obtaining formal release for that purpose from the awarding institution. Regents' Fellowships will be awarded to a number of promis\u00ad ing students entering graduate study at UCI leading to the Doctor of Philosophy or Master of Fine Arts degree. Awards include a stipend, all required student fees, and, if applicable, Nonresident Tuition. Other fellowships are offered, including tuition awards for outstanding applicants who are not resi\u00ad dents of California. In many cases, fellowship stipends may be supplemented by partial assistantship appointments. Entering or continuing graduate students may be awarded research or teaching assistantships for all or part of the aca\u00ad demic year. The types of assistantships, number available, and required duties vary according to the activities of the academic unit. Neither assistantship includes remission of fees or tuition, but a graduate assistant who is not a Califor\u00ad nia resident also may receive a tuition fellowship. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram, a number of fellowships and assistantships are awarded to first-and second-year graduate students from groups including minorities and women in certain fields who traditionally have been underrepresented in higher education in the United States. All fellowship awards and assistantships appointments are made in accordance with the affirmative action policies of the University. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Grants for doctoral research and a limited number of disser\u00ad tation fellowships are awarded each year; additional informa\u00ad tion is available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. The Division Office also provides information and assistance to students who wish to apply for fellowships from federal agencies, foundations, and other non-University sources. The Expenses and Fees and Financial Aid sections contain information about assistance based upon financial need that is administered by the Financial Aid Office, including grants, loans, and Work-Study awards. A Financial Aid Handbook is available from the Financial Aid Office. Research The University of California is the State's primary research institution. Most scholarly research and creative activities are supported by University funds or by grants and contracts from federal and state agencies, foundations, corporations, and individual sponsors. In addition to University funding, more than $41 million from extramural sources was awarded to the University of California, Irvine in the 1983-84 fiscal year for basic and applied research and for other scholarly activity. Under direction of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Re\u00ad search, the Office of Contracts and Grants Administration (OCGA) is responsible for the submission of proposals, acceptance of grant and contract awards, and negotiation of all awards for extramurally funded research, training, fellow\u00ad ship, and public service programs. The OCGA maintains a Resource Center containing the most current information about extramural funding sources for student and faculty research. While most research takes place at the academic unit level, the academic quality of many of UCI's educational programs is enhanced by Organized Research Units and Focused Research Programs that extend beyond unit boundaries. Organized Research Units An Organized Research Unit (ORU) ordinarily consists of an interdepartmental group of faculty, students, and other re\u00ad searchers engaged in a continuing program of research, sup\u00ad ported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some ORUs is directed toward the solution of complex contemporary problems, while others conduct basic research essential to the understanding of natural or social phe\u00ad nomena or of humanistic ideas and expressions. Organized Research Units established on the Irvine campus by The Regents of the University are the Cancer Research Institute, the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, the Developmental Biology Center, the Institute of Transpor\u00ad tation Studies (ITS), and the Public Policy Research Organi\u00ad zation (PPRO). Cancer Research Institute The Cancer Research Institute is an Organized Research Unit established by The Regents of the University in early 1980 to provide leadership and support for researchers work\u00ad ing toward understanding and controlling cancer. The Insti\u00ad tute serves as a means of focusing, coordinating, and direct\u00ad ing efforts of scholars in basic and clinical sciences from sev\u00ad eral departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the UCI-California College of Medicine. The ORU provides a central source of information concerning cancer-related research, as well as a forum in which basic researchers and . clinicians can assess advances that may be of immediate value \u00b7 in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and in the detection Graduate Studies/Research 79 of chemicals or conditions that cause cancer. Ongoing and projected research activities involve the regulation of cell function, tumor cell surfaces and control of ,proliferation and metastasis, viral carcinogenesis, environmental carcinogene\u00ad sis, and clinically related studies. Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory The Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory was established to foster multidisciplinary research which will provide an understanding of the neurobiologiCal pro\u00ad cesses underlying learning and memory. Research efforts are stimulated and coordinated through research seminars, collo\u00ad quia, and quarterly conferences, as well as collaborative research projects involving faculty members, visiting fellows, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students. The research programs of the Center include inves\u00ad tigations at several levels of analysis, including cell chemistry, cell physiology, brain systems, and cognitive processes. Members include faculty from the Department of Psychobi\u00ad ology in the School of Biological Sciences, the Department of Pharmacology in the UCI-California College of Medicine, the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Department of Physics in the School of Physical Sciences, and the School of Social Sciences, as well as three faculty members from other UC campuses. UC IRVINE - 1985-198680 Graduate Studies/Research Developmental Biology Center The Developmental Biology Center is an Organized Research Unit that provides focus and support in several related areas of developmental biology and genetics. The major goal of the Center is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the control of growth and the generation of spatial patterns of differentiation during development. Experimental techniques and concepts from the fields of cell biology, embryology, genetics, neurobiology, molecular biology, immunology, and endocrinology are applied to developing\u00b7 insects, hydra, fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals. Undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate students and postdoctoral fellows all participate actively with faculty from the School of Biological Sciences and the UCI-California College of Medicine in these research pro\u00ad grams. The Center also sponsors and organi.zes a variety of local, national, and international conferences and hosts visit\u00ad ing scientists for collaborative research work. The work car\u00ad ried out in the Center has potential implications in such areas as the control of growth; the regeneration of lost body parts; and the cause and prevention of cancer, nervous system anomalies, and birth defects in humans. Institute of Transportation Studies The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) was established to foster research, education, and training in the field of transportation. The Institute has been an Organized Research Unit within the University of California since 1947. With the establishment of the Irvine branch in 1974, it became a University-wide Multi-campus Research Unit, the only such unit on the Irvine campus. Emphasis at Irvine has been on the development of a strong interdisciplinary research capability. Completed and ongoing research projects have involved faculty and students from the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, the School of Social Sciences, the Program in Social Ecology, and the Department of Information and Computer Science. Research at Irvine focuses upon transportation systems engi\u00ad neering, planning and evaluation, fiscal and administrative management of public transit systems, transportation eco\u00ad nomics, labor relations in the transit industry, and energy and environmental issues. Current projects include \"Chaining Be\u00ad havior in Urban Trip Making,\" \"Rehabilitation Strategies for Urban Freeways and Highways,\" \"Ownership-Management Forms and Transit Property Performance and Efficiency,\" \"Performance Indicators and Peer Groups for Comparison of Transit Properties,\" \"Fiscal and Organizational Impact on Part-time Labor in Public Transit,\" and \"Evaluation of Private Sector Provision of Urban Freeways and Highways.\" The Institute of is also actively engaged in the development of microcomputer applications in transportation research. A portion of Institute funding is used to sponsor graduate stu\u00ad dent research assistantships, postdoctoral research fellow\u00ad ships, and visiting professorships. The Institute maintains an extensive research collection to support these activities. The 18,000-volume collection includes books, journals, dissertations, and technical reports in the field of urban transportation. A wide range of services is provided. Students and faculty are encouraged to meet with the information center's trained personnel to discuss research needs and strategies. Public Policy Research Organization The Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) is an Organized Research Unit established to foster empirically grounded research into problems of public policy. In pursuing . its broad policies studies mission, PPRO has focused its effort since 1973 on information technology and public policy and more recently has developed research programs concerned with public management, community and environmental studies, and an annual survey of Orange County residents. As a campuswide research unit, PPRO draws its research expertise from the full faculty and student resources of the Irvine campus. Of the 92 faculty and students currently doing research in PPRO, the majority are from the School of Social Sciences, the Department of Information and Com\u00ad puter Sdence, the Program in Social Ecology, the Graduate School of Management, and the UCI-California College of Medicine. Among PPRO researchers are experts in law, pub\u00ad lic administration, economics, public finance, political science, sociology, psychology, planning, and public health. PPRO projects are multidisciplinary by nature. Among the 29 projects currently in progress are studies of the social dynam\u00ad ics of computer user in complex organizations; the use of information systems in local governments; the social and mental health impacts of economic change; stress and coping skills among U.S. Marine Corps drill instructors; incidence of injuries to children in auto accidents; and a national study of the impacts of computing in the home. In support of survey research in the social sciences, PPRO has created the Survey Research Facility, designed to facili\u00ad tate academic research using telephone survey methods. PPRO maintains extensive survey research, data analysis, and data archiving capabilities which support its research efforts and which serve researchers in various UCI academic units. A limited number of graduate assistantships and Work\u00ad Study positions are available to qualified UCI students who wish to participate in PPRO research projects or in the prepa\u00ad ration of research proposals. Focused Research Programs Focused Research Programs are established by the Chancellor for the purpose of developing and, for a limited period of time, sustaining interdisciplinary research that could not be carried out through individual effort or within a single aca\u00ad demic unit. Because of the developmental nature of these programs, they ordinarily are approved for no more than three years and are supported partly by University funds. If a research program develops successfully, it may continue with extramural and/or University support. Nine groups of faculty, students, and other researchers have been recognized as Focused Research Programs. Convex Programming Participants in this program include faculty from the Schools of Social Sciences and Engineering, the Department of Information and Computer Science, and the Graduate School of Management. Its interdisciplinary approach brings together optimization theorists and applied researchers to focus on a way of mathematically modeling and analyzing decision-making situations. Specific attention will be given to the potential and problems of convex programming in solving a variety of important problems associated with our modern society, in areas such as \"high tech\" industries and national defense. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Critical Theory Participants in this interdisciplinary program include faculty from the Departments of English and Comparative Litera\u00ad ture, French and Italian, History, Philosophy, and Spanish and Portuguese in the School of Humanities as well as from the School of Fine Arts. The program is designed to provide a forum for debate among the competing theoretical move\u00ad ments in contemporary critical theory. A series of lectures and seminars for faculty and graduate students will be pre\u00ad sented during each of the first two years by two distin\u00ad guished visiting scholars and by members of the program. As a culmination, a major symposium will be held in the third year on issues being raised in the lectures and seminars pre\u00ad sented .. the first two years. Gene Research and Biotechnology Participants in this program currently include faculty from the School of Biological Sciences, the UCI-California College of Medicine, and the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences. The objective of the program is to estab- . lish cooperative programs with appropriate industrial spon\u00ad sors which will enhance graduate and undergraduate teach\u00ad ing and research programs. The program is also designed to facilitate rapid application of basic research discoveries in the area of biotechnology. The ultimate goal of the program is the establishment of a comprehensive Biotechnology Center of the UCI campus. Image Engineering The Focused Research Program in Image Engineering is a cross-disciplinary collaboration among 12 faculty members in seven departments and more than 20 engineering firms in Orange County and other parts of the United States. The group is conducting research in four areas of image engineer\u00ad ing: image instrumentation, image modeling, image-based automation, and basic image engineering. The disciplines represented include electrical engineering, radiological science, psychiatry, psychology, mechanical engineering, chemistry, and cardiology. Imaging instrumentation includes projects on medical ultra\u00ad sound, ocular fundus microscopy, and ultrasonic microscopy. Image modeling encompasses the modeling of fluid mechan\u00ad ics, geophysical turbulence, molecules, arteries, and brains. Image-based automation includes computer-aided engineer\u00ad ing and multimicroprocessor systems. Basic image engineer\u00ad ing includes projects on digital filtering, artificial intelligence, and human vision. Medieval Theatre Faculty from the Departments of English and Comparative Literature, French and Italian, German, History, and Spanish and Portuguese in the School of Humanities and from the School of Fine Arts are involved in research and production activities centered on the Corpus Christi Plays produced in English between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. Project activities will include an annual symposium. Produc\u00ad tion of the plays in Aldrich Park will commence in September 1985 and continue during the second and third years of the project. Ultimate goals of the project include development of videotapes of the performances and the possible creation of a University of California Consortium in Medieval Studies. Mexico/Chicano Area Studies Faculty participants include researchers representing the Schools of Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and the Program in Social Ecology. The Mexico/ Chicano area studies program is designed to provide coordi-Grad-uate Studies/Research Sl nation and development of support bases for faculty and graduate student research in Mexican studies, Chicano studies, U.S.-Mexico relations, and in collaborations between University and Mexican scientists. Research topics include immigration, public policy, culture, literature and film, com\u00ad munications, urbanization, and agriculture. Objective Drama Researchers from the School of Fine Arts, the Department of English and Comparative Literature in the School of Human\u00ad ities, the School of Social Sciences, and others are engaged in cross-cultural and interdisciplinary, practical research with the purpose of isolating and studying the technical aspects of ritualized interaction, i.e., the elements in ritual arts of vari\u00ad ous world cultures which have an objective impact on both performers and participants. Studies center on movements, sonorities, rhythms, and uses of space as they exist in the ancient cultures, with an eye toward better understanding the underlying elements of such performative phenomena. Orange County Area Studies Researchers from the Departments of History and Spanish and Portuguese in the School of Humanities a.re involve<il in a collaborative effort of analysis and understanding of Oran~ County's economy, social composition, ett.lnic and racial chac\u00ad acteristics, politics, and culture. Projects will examine the interrelationships of economic growth aoo development, class formation am:! social stratification, immigrant assim~IatiOA and exclusion, distributions of wealth and power, tR.e evolu\u00ad tion of family forms, and social and cultural cohes-iOfl and fragmentation. Vulnerable Populations Faculty from the Program in Socia-l Ecology, the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, and the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine are working to advance knowledge about \"vulnerable groups\" in the population. Interviews will be conducted with a random sampl\u20ac of Orange County residents, focusing on substantive issues such as population growth, housing, environmental quality, transportation, employment, and human services. A collab\u00ad orative effort of data collection and survey analysis wiJ-1 pro\u00ad vide systematic studies of the extent to which attitudes, life circumstances, and responses to change vary among distin\u00ad guishable populations.

Yahr, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Psychobiology No one can predict the future, but this much is known: the next quarter century is the time of the biologist, who will be in the midst of many of the activities that govern major aspects of life. These include some of the most challenging intellectual problems, such as the mechanisms of memory and of learning, the molecular basis of embryonic develop\u00ad ment, and the rules that help predict the behavior of the environment. Biology also lies at the heart of major social problems that face mankind in the coming decade, such as sensible management of the environment and the effective control of human populations. It is vital that educated men and women understand the contributions that biological sci\u00ad ences have made and will continue to make for the future welfare of mankind. The School of Biological Sciences reflects new concepts of biology in both its curriculum and its research programs. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with the opportun\u00ad ity to avail themselves of theprinciples and ever-increasing knowledge of biology. The curriculum is designed to meet present and future educational needs of majors and non\u00ad majors. In keeping with the responsibilities of the University, the School encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. The School provides an excellent opportunity for undergrad\u00ad uates to participate in research, through the Biological Sci\u00ad ences 199 program. Each quarter nearly 350 undergraduate students and 200 graduate and postdoctoral students partici\u00ad pate in independent research programs. In addition to the regular University requirements for admis\u00ad sion, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum, in addition to a course in biology, four years of mathematics, as well as courses in chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The biological sciences are presented as an integrated area of study through the eight-quarter Biological Sciences Core, with lectures and laboratories developing the major concepts of modern biology. Satellite courses expand upon and inten\u00ad sify areas covered in the Core and provide students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the biological sciences. In addition to the regular major in Biological Sci\u00ad ences, a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, also leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, is available at the undergraduate level. The degree requirements of these UC IRVINE - 1985-1986two programs are similar, with the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology placing a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Introductory courses for nonmajors are designed to make the biological sciences mean\u00ad ingful and interesting and to inform intelligent citizens of bio\u00ad logical phenomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. Students with an interest in the application of ecology to human needs may choose the Applied Ecology major, leading to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology, which is offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. See page 247. Degrees Biological Sciences ............ : ......... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. A concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is available at the undergraduate level.

Degree in Biological Sciences University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements Biological Sciences Core Curriculum (90, 101, 102, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, 105, 105L, 106, 106L, 107); or 5A-B-C, 5LA-LB-LC; and Humanities 1A-B-C, or another option of the lower\u00ad division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humani\u00ad ties or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry). Students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the Biological Sciences Core Curriculum and three satellite courses. In addition to the listed Biological Sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and Physics 18A-B-C can be used to satisfy the satellite requirement. Students with a double major in Psychology and Biological Sciences can also use Psychology 151A-B-C to satisfy the satellite requirement. No student may enter as a double major, but students inter\u00ad ested in other areas may possibly become double majors after the first quarter, if the second school or program approves. A strong academic performance in the second area is requisite for acceptance as a double major. For information on requirements for the B.S. degree in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences with a concentration in Ecology and Environ\u00ad mental Biology, see page 87. UCI Breadth Requirement Those students majoring in Biological Sciences who have completed the School requirements and who have passed any two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core or its alternative with a grade of C or better will have satisfied the UCI breadth requirement, with two exceptions: the upper-division writing requirement and Category III, Social and Behavioral Sciences. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986I 86 Biological Sciences Specifically, the Humanities Core or its alternative satisfies Category IV;Humanistic Inquiry; it also satisfies the lower\u00ad division writing requirement when two quarters of the writ\u00ad ing component are passed with a grade of C or better. Chem\u00ad istry and physics satisfy Category II, Natural Sciences. Cate\u00ad gory V, Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science, is satisfied by completion of the School mathematics requirement. Planning a Program of Study Since biological sciences cours~s are built upon a base of the physical sciences, it is important for students to take their required physical sciences early. Note: The academic program shown below is only a suggested program. Students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for individual academic planning. Freshmen will normally take eight units of the humanities re\u00ad quirement, Chemistry IA, and a freshman seminar (Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences 2) during the fall quarter. Students with a score. of 6SO or higher on the mathematics part of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may enroll in mathematics during the fall quarter and should note the prerequisites for Mathemat\u00ad ics 2A. During their freshman year, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sciences 90. Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry SIA), con\u00ad tinue the Biological Sciences Core, and complete the Humani\u00ad ties requirement if they have not taken it during their fresh\u00ad man year. Sophomores often begin taking courses in other schools to meet the UCI breadth requirement and fulfill their mathematics requirement if they have not done so as fresh\u00ad men. Sophomores who have completed the mathematics requirement as freshmen may enroll in physics. Students who intend to double major in Chemistry may be required to take Physics SA-B-C in place of Physics 3A-B-C. During their junior year, most majors continue the Biological Sciences Core and take physics if they have not yet done so. Juniors complete their breadth requirements and often become involved in the satellite course requirements. Since Sample Program -Biological Sciences Freshman Sophomore Fall Chem.IA Bio. Core Human. IAa Chern. SIA, LA Bio. 2 (Fr. Sem.) Math 2A or Physics 3A, LN Math 2Ab Bio. LB Math Spring Chern. IC. LC Bio. Core Human. IC Chern. SIC most satellites are based upon material contained in the Core, it is usually preferable for students to have completed most of the Core before taking satellite courses. Finally, during their senior year, students complete the Core and may become involved in an area of specialization within the School. Individualized accelerated programs of study are designed for students entering the School with strong backgrounds in biology. Please see page 88 for details regarding the Fresh\u00ad man Honors Curriculum. A special program of study should be considered by students who enter the biological sciences with a weak background in the sciences and in writing skills. A weak background might consist of not completing high school chemistry or mathe\u00ad matics through trigonometry, and not satisfying the Subject A requirement before entering the U~iversity. This program allows a student to gain the necessary background skills and may require five years of study at the undergraduate level. Before beginning this program of study, students must see an academic counselor in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs 0~. . . Freshmen should complete English and Comparative Litera\u00ad ture WR39A, Mathematics 1, Biological Sciences 2, and an additional humanities course (to satisfy the alternative to the Humanities Core) during the fall quarter. The winter quarter should include Chemistry 10 and continuation of humanities and mathematics. Continuation of humanities and mathemat\u00ad ics, and an elective, are taken during the spring quarter. During the second year, students should begin general chem\u00ad istry (Chemistry lA-B-C), continue working on the breadth requirement and any remaining humanities requirements, and complete mathematics. During winter quarter, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sci\u00ad ences 90. The Biological Sciences Core, organic chemistry (Chemistry SlA-B-C), and elective courses should be taken during the third year. Junior Senior Bio. Core Bio. Core Physics 3A, LA or Electived Bio.

Normally students must satisfy the Subject A requirement prior to fulfilling the lower-division writing requirement. Students taking Humanities 1A must also enroll in Writing Workshop (2 units) if they have not satisfied the Subject A requirement. bstudents with a score of 650 or higher on the mathematics portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may begin mathematics as freshmen. Students with a score below 650 on the mathematics portion of the SAT should defer mathematics to their sophomore year. Please note the prerequisites for Mathematics 2A cStudents ~ho have completed mathematics in their freshman year may take Physics 3A-B-C and 3LA-LB-LC in their sophomore year. Students who take the mathematics requirement in their sophomore year should defer physics to their ju;,ior year. Physics 3A-B-C is the course for non majors and is fully acceptable for a degree in the Biological Sciences. Physics 5A-B-C. which begins in the winter quarter, better prepares a student for Physical Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and for some graduate schools. dElectives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: UCI breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. eln addition to the listed biological sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C. Physics 18A-B-C, and Psychology 151A-B-C (for Biological Sciences/Psychology double majors) are counted as satellites. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986The fourth year should include Physics 3A-B-C continuation of the Biological Sciences Core, biological sciences satellites, and possibly research or other electives. The fifth year should be relatively free to explore additional satellites and research and to complete any remaining Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences Core courses. Requirements for the B.S. Degree in Biological Sciences with a Concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology The School of Biological Sciences offers a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology which provides a second pathway to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences. The concen\u00ad tration in Ecology and Environmental Biology differs from the regular undergraduate program in having a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Its principal objective is to afford the student an integrated, interdisci\u00ad plinary program in environmental studies within the frame\u00ad work of a broad and rigorous physical and biological sciences background. A vital goal is to allow the student completing the course of study to be broadly trained as a biologist, with the breadth of educational experience to view environmental problems from an informed ecologist's perspective. In addi\u00ad tion to completing basic required courses in the humanities and the physical and biological sciences, the student must complete a core of environmentally based courses from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, the Pro\u00ad gram in Social Ecology, and the School of Engineering. Ex\u00ad posure to current thought in several subareas of ecology is emphasized, and the acquisition of elementary statistical and computer skills is stressed. Opportunities to specialize in sev\u00ad eral general study areas are furnished. Students will study theoretical concepts and experimental relationships in terres\u00ad trial or aquatic systems through Ecology and Evolutionary Biology satellite courses, but may also choose to specialize in the demographic and planning aspects of environmental management through classes in Social Ecology, or the techno\u00ad logical approach to environmental problem solving through advanced course work in Environmental Engineering. Biological Sciences 87 Students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in Environmental Engineering (p. 263), offered by the School of Engineering. Students should also investigate the Applied Ecology major (p. 247), offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. The Applied Ecology major emphasizes ecology as it pertains to human needs, whereas the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology emphasizes ecology as a basic science. University Requirements: See pages 49-S2.

Students must attain a 2.0 grade point average in required Biological Sciences courses. Planning a Program of Study A normal program of study for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is similar to that for the regular Biological Sciences major. A program of study in Ecology and Environmental Biology requires Biological Sciences 166 and 120. In addition, required electives in biological sciences, engineering, and social ecology replace the requirement for three satellite courses. The UCI breadth requirement may be satisfied in the concen\u00ad tration in Ecology and Environmental Biology in the same manner as the regular Biological Sciences major. Further clarification on the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology may be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office.

Students with a score below 650 on the mathematics section of the SAT should defer mathematics to their sophomore year. cstudents who have completed mathematics in their freshman year may take Physics 3A-B-C and 3LA-LB-LC in their sophomore year. Students who take the mathematics requiremenrs in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. dElectives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. eRequired electives are Biological Sciences 174 or 186, Biological Sciences 169 or 179, and two courses from among various Engineering and Social Ecology courses. See School requirements for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology. UC IRVINE - 1985-198688 Biological Sciences Special Programs and Courses frestlman Horrm-s Curriculum Individually accelerated programs of study can be designed for freshman students who enter the School of Biological Sciences with strong backgrounds in biology and who have achieved scores of 4 or 5 in the biology section of the Advanced Placement Examination. Such freshmen are exempt from thte first course in the Biological Sciences Core (Biological Sciences 90, Diversity of Life) and begin the second Core course (Biological Sciences 101, Evolutionary Biology and Genetics) during the fall quarter of their first year. This program enables participants to complete the fourth Core course by the end of their first year. Any stu\u00ad dent with such Advanced Placement credit should contact the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for more informa\u00ad tion regarding this program. SieWgical Sciences 199 Every undergraduate student in the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences has the opportunity to pursue independent experimen\u00ad tal laboratory or field research under the direct supervision of a professor in the School of Biological Sciences or in the UCI-California College of Medicine as an apprentice scientist. Under the guidance of a senior scientist, the student is able to experience the challenge and excitement of the world of sci\u00ad ence and to develop new scientific skills. This activity may commence as early as the sophomore year or, in the case of exceptional students, earlier. Interested students should investigate the possibilities for research early in order to obtain a great deal of research experience, if they so desire; before they graduate. Although the School of Biological Sciences does not require training in a foreign language, some areas of research demand that stu\u00ad dents possess foreign language skills. Students are, therefore, encouraged to discuss foreign language needs with their advisors to see if such training is important for their own careers. Advising for research careers in the biological sci\u00ad ences is best accomplished by students working together with a faculty advisor. Excellence in Research Program The School of Biological Sciences believes that successful par\u00ad ticipation in creative research is one of the highest academic goals its undergraduates can attain and accordingly rewards such students with Excellence in Biological Sciences Research certificates. Through undergraduate research and the Excel\u00ad lence in Research Program in Biological Sciences, students have the opportunity of presenting the results of their research endeavors to peers and faculty, and possibly of see\u00ad ing their research papers published. Selected papers are pub\u00ad lished in the School's journal of Undergraduate Research in the Biological Sciences. All Biological Sciences majors doing experimental research under Biological Sciences 199 who have completed a min\u00ad imum of three quarters (with at least one quarter taken dur\u00ad ing the academic ye~r of the symposium) are eligible to par\u00ad ticipate. They must be in good academic standing, have a grade point average of 2.3 or better, and be making normal progress in Biological Sciences. Ecolagy Super C~mrse During one quarter of each academic year (usually either winter or spring), several courses are combined into a Super Course. Such courses include Biological Sciences 167 (Field Botany), 181 (Advanced Marine Ecology), 184 (Insect Ecol\u00ad ogy), and 189 (Ecological Energetics). These courses, together with a Biological Sciences 199 (Independent Study in Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences Research), constitute the student's entire curricu-lum for that particular quarter. (During any quarter in-which the Super Course is taught, students may not enroll in part of the Super Course requirements individually.) Extensive fieldwork is involved. Enrollment is limited to 20 students, with selection based upon a questionnaire available during the preceding quarter. Prerequisites are completion of Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences 102 and consent of instructor. Undergraduate Teaching Opportunities Through the Tutoring Program, students can immediately put to practice skills they have learned in their biology train\u00ad ing. This program provides opportunities for students to develop teaching abilities and to perform a worthwhile and necessary service. In the Tutoring Program, UCI students tutor other UCI students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in man\u00ad agement and who will have cdmpleted all of the course requirements (including breadth requirements) for their bachelor's degree by the end of the junior year may apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram. This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in either Business Administration (M.B.A.), in Public Adminis\u00ad tration (M.P.A.), or Business and Public Administration (M.B.P.A.), along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum overall grade point average required is 3.2. Completion of either the Grad\u00ad uate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Program. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's degree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Graduate School of Management section and contact their academic counselor. Special Research Resources Special research resources include the Laser Microbeam Pro\u00ad gram (LAMP), a research, training, and service facility in the area of laser microbeam technology; the School of Biological Sciences Biohazard (P-3) Facility, which provides laboratory facilities for working with biological agents or biological molecules such as recombinant DNA which would be haz\u00ad ardous when used in open laboratories; the Museum of Sys\u00ad tematic Biology, a teaching and research facility which cur\u00ad rently contains material on local populations of plants, inver\u00ad tebrates, and vertebrates; the Developmental Biology Center, devoted to analyzing developmental mechanisms in amphibi\u00ad ans, insects, and other invertebrates; the Center for the Neu\u00ad robiology of Learning and Memory, a research center for studies of the brain mechanisms underlying learning and memory; the UCI Arboretum, a botanical garden facility; the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which supports con\u00ad trolled marsh biota; the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve, a high\u00ad desert habitat in San Bernardino County; the Theoretical Neurobiology Facility, which provides computational re\u00ad sources for physiologically realistic simulation of neuronal systems; and the UCI Ecological Preserve, which includes coastal hills on the campus, once under heavy grazing, but now returning to a more natural state. It is important to note that the School has access to the UCI-California College of Medicine, thereby providing an opportunity for the sharing of both teaching and research activities. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Advising: Academic, Career, Health Sciences Academic Advising The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office coordinates the advising program and provides academic counseling as v-:eii as special services particularly in the area of preprofes\u00ad Sional career counseling. Undergraduate Biological Sciences students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for information on academic requirements for the degree, career opportunities, the Biological Sciences 199 Research Program, available tutoring for Biological Sciences courses, Biological Sciences student organizations, and scho\u00ad lar.ship information. Students can also come to the Biological SC!~nces Student Affairs Office to change a grade, change th.eir maJor, apply for graduation, or for any other help they might need related to their academic career at UCI. All freshmen will enroll in small-group freshman seminars (Biological Sciences 2) and all other new students will enroll in special sections of Biological Sciences 190. Upper-division peer advisors are actively involved in these seminars. Peer Academic Advisors. The Peer Academic Advisors are upper-division Biological Sciences majors who bring with them valuable academic and social experiences. Their func\u00ad tions include counseling students in matters of major selec\u00ad tion, program planning, petitioning, tutoring, learning skills problems, and participation in cocurricular and extracurricu\u00ad lar activities. The Peer Advisors are located in the Biological Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. Office hours are posted at the beginning of each quarter. Biological Sciences 89 Career Advising Information on graduate and professional schools in the health sciences can be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Additional career information and job opportunities are available through the UCI Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC). The Student Affairs Office\u00b7 has developed a comple.te career library and a\u00b7close relation\u00ad ship with the CPPC in an effort to provide current, relevant career information for biology students. Special events ~esign.ed fo provide career information are the annual Biolog\u00ad Ical Sciences Career Fair and monthly career workshops, many of which are cosponsored by the Student Affairs Office and the CPPC. Areas of opportunity open to those with a Bachelor of Sci\u00ad ence degree include laboratory technology, publishing, tech\u00ad nical editing, pharmaceutical sales, and training programs in county, state, and federal agencies. The bachelor's degree is necessary to pursue studies leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. A B.S. degree, plus short training periods, may prepare stu\u00ad dents for employment in education, medical technology (usu\u00ad ally one year), physical therapy, and various other areas. UC IRVINE - 1985-198690 Biological Sciences Education (community colleges, state colleges, or private schools), medical illustration, and public health (which includes hospital administration, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, social work, public health education, maternal and child health, and infectious and trop\u00ad ical diseases) are fields in which opportunities are available upon completion of a Master's program. The Ph.D. degree may lead to research in many areas, among them bacteriology, biochemistry, biometeorology, botany, cytology, ecology, fishery biology, genetics, home economics, microbiology, pathology, physiology, psychobiology, public health, range management, soil conservation, and zoology. Other areas where advanced degrees are necessary include medicine, dentistry, law, optometry, podiatry, osteopathy, and veterinary medicine. Health Sciences Advising Advising for careers in the health sciences is a specialty of the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Students desiring to enter the health sciences should have their programs checked in the Office. They also should check deadlines for taking the New Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) or other required tests and application deadlines. The New MCAT and the Dental Admission Test, required by most medical and dental schools, are administered in spring and fall each year on the Irvine campus. These tests should be taken in the spring, a year and one-half before the student plans to enter medical or dental school. Many Biological Sciences students desire a career related to their education in the biological sciences. Students can go into medicine, dentistry, optometry, osteopathy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, and related medical fields; into teaching; and into research in the biological sciences. In properly pre\u00ad paring for such careers, planning is essential early in a stu\u00ad dent's education. Leaders in dental, medical, and veterinary education recom\u00ad mend that students preparing to seek admission to their schools plan to obtain a bachelor's degree. Students who plan to enter a school of dentistry, medicine, or other areas of the health sciences may receive the required preprofessional training on the Irvine campus. This preprofessional training may be accomplished by (1) completing the major in Biological Sciences or (2) majoring in any school or department and ful\u00ad filling concurrently the specific course requirements of the dental, medical, or other professional school the student expects to attend. Students interested in the health sciences should choose elec\u00ad tives in the social sciences, possibly a foreign language, physi\u00ad cal chemistry, or other specific courses required or recom\u00ad mended by graduate schools. Health Sciences Advisory Committee The Health Sciences Advisory Committee consists of faculty and academic counselors in the School of Biological Sciences. The Committee oHers specialized services, for a fee, to all students applying to postgraduate professional schools in the health sciences, including (1) a Committee interview and let\u00ad ter of recommendation for most professional school applica\u00ad tions, (2) a personal file containing the student's letters of recommendation, and (3) a service of sending all recommen\u00ad dations for a student to professional and graduate schools. Student Participation BSSA. The School of Biological Sciences highly recommends undergraduate participation in its student organizations. The Biological Sciences Student Association (BSSA) is an auton\u00ad omous student-run organization which provides a liaison among the administration, science faculty, Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office, other biology-oriented organizations, and other students. Some of its activities include an annual Biofaire, special quarterly events, publication of a list of 199 research courses available in the Biological Sciences. AED. Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED) is an international honor society for students preparing for careers in the health pro\u00ad fessions. AED strives to stimulate an appreciation of health careers through interaction among prehealth students, health educators, and practitioners in a variety of health care fields. AED annually sponsors workshops on interview techniques and a series of talks on selecting, applying to, and financing medical school. Blood drives, sponsored by AED and offered in conjunction with the UCI Medical Center and the Student Health Center, take place twice per quarter, while guest speakers from every aspect of the health care field highlight weekly meetings. AED recruits new members early in the fall and spring quarters. Because AED is an honor society, mem\u00ad bership is contingent upon class ranking (the top 35 percent), completion of five quarters of academic work, and a brief pledge period, during which commitment to the society is assessed. BSSO. The Black Students Science Organization (BSSO) was established to maintain a unified and supportive community of successful Black science and prehealth professional stu\u00ad dents at UCI. The group holds bimonthly meetings; sponsors guest speakers; provides academic support in the form of study sessions, examinations, and study aids from previous courses; organizes trips to medical schools, hospitals, and conferences; arranges gatherings with physicians and medical students; hosts fw;~.d-raising events; and compiles and dissem\u00ad inates information on careers, conferences, hospital and laboratory positions, and issues affecting the Black com\u00ad munity in particular. BSSO also works in close association with the UCI-California College of Medicine chapter of the Student National Medical Association. Major achievements have included \"BSSO Week\" and the cosponsoring of the annual UCI-CCM Third World Pre-Medical Awareness Conference. CCM. Chicanos for Creative Medicine has been established to promote interaction among Biological Sciences and pre\u00ad health professional Chicano-Latino students at UCI. The aims of CCM are (1) to help members attain their career goals, (2) to provide resource information pertinent to the success of Chicana-Latino students at UCI, and (3) to create and maintain a sense of awareness and attitude of being a Chicano-Latino student at UCI. Activities include guest lec\u00ad turers speaking on their research; Latino professionals, including physicians, dentists, and other health professionals, speaking on their careers; field trips to communities lacking adequate health care; and quarterly fund-raising activities. The group works closely with the Chicano Medical Student Association of the UCI-California College of Medicine and with the La Raza Medical Association, a Statewide organization. Dental Club. The Dental Club is an organization designed to promote exposure to dentistry for students interested in a career in the dental profession. The Club provides an oppor\u00ad tunity for students to learn about dentistry through listening to guest speakers and attending workshops featuring visiting dentists. The Dental Club helps students with their applica\u00ad tions to dental school and offers information on dental schools, field trips to local schools, and counseling. The Club also offers mock Dental Admission Test examinations. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Medspur. Medspur, conceived in 1977, is dedicated to serving prehealth professional students in both social and academic endeavors while at UCI. As one of the largest registered campus organizations, Medspur brings together each year well over 500 students into the club who are interested in pursuing professional careers in human and animal medicine and in dentistry. Medspur's main goal is to bring students together in an environment conducive to the development of cooperation and friendship. Medspur is committed to provid\u00ad ing members with the opportunity to learn about the realities of their prospective careers and the issues which face the\u00b7 health care specialist. Medspur invites members of the medical community to speak about their professions and organizes interactions between undergraduate students, medical students, and faculty. In addition, Medspur sponsors dances, athletic events, MCAT preparation sessions, and examination reviews for Chemistry 1A-B-C, Chemistry 51A-B-C, and Biological Sciences 90, 101, 102, 103, 104. The highlight of each year is the annual UCI Medspur Southland Pre-Health Conference which allows students to explore all aspects of the health care professions. Flying Samaritans. The Flying Samaritans subchapter at UCI was founded in 1983 to provide health care for the indigent people of Mexico. The student volunteer Flying Samaritans operate a clinic in EI Testerazo, Baja California. One weekend per month, members staff the clinic and serve the com\u00ad munity by translating, administrating, and by assisting the health professionals. Volunteer services are also rendered at the Orange County Clinic in Santa Ana, California. The organization also holds diverse charity drives to support the El Testerazo Clinic and promote goodwill among the mem\u00ad bers and the needy of Mexico through volunteer service. Third World Women in Health. Third World Women in Health provides an opportunity for women interested in pur\u00ad suing careers in the health professions to learn how to suc\u00ad ceed in them. It also enables members to participate in com\u00ad munity outreach through individual and group volunteer work, to learn how cultural values affect health care delivery, and to be aware of health care delivery conditions in the minority community. In addition, the group sponsors work\u00ad shops and guest lecturers including Third World women from all stages of career development; topics include aca\u00ad demic success and health issues. Members also have the opportunity to attend prehealth conferences and to partici\u00ad pate in study sessions, with access to a test file and note library. Graduate Program The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the bio\u00ad logical sciences. The four Departments of the School of Bio\u00ad logicaf Sciences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Psychobiology) and four Departments of the UCI-Cali\u00ad fornia College of Medicine (Anatomy, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Physiology and Biophysics) cooperate in the conduct of a unified graduate program, administered by the School of Biological Sciences. The organization of the Departments encourages an interdis\u00ad ciplinary approach to scientific problems, especially at the graduate level. All programs of study, regardless of emphasis, lead to the degrees of Master of Science (M5.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in the Biological Sciences (with the exception of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics which offers only the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences). Each Department has a Biological Sciences 91 graduate advisor whom students may consult in regard to the technical details of their individual programs. Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated both by the Division of Graduate Studies and Research and by the program or the Department to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, grades, and other qualifications of the applicant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to consult the department(s) whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests. Some faculty are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. These faculty are from the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences; the Departments of Developmental and Cell Biology and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in the School of Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences; and the Department of Physiology and Biophys\u00ad ics in the UCI-California College of Medicine. This program provides an opportunity for interaction among graduate stu\u00ad dents and faculty who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a. degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to discuss research prob\u00ad lems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdiscipli\u00ad nary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in the Biological Sciences While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy programs are offered (with the exception of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics), emphasis a/the graduate level is on the Ph.D. programs. Most training takes place within one of the departments, although full facilities and curricular offer\u00ad ings are available to all graduate students in all departments of the biological sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times, attain the Master's degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four or five years, depending on departmental affiliation. A Master's degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. During'the first part of the initial year of graduate work, the student plans an academic program in consultation with the graduate advisor or a small committee. Faculty advisors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. Stu\u00ad dents are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and academic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assistants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching experience varies with the department. UC IRVINE - 1985-198692 Biological Sciences Master of Science Plan 1: Thesis Plan -The student completes seven upper\u00ad division and graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan -The student \u00b7 completes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the student's field specialization. This program is terminated with a comprehensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy First Level of Competence- The student attains this level by completing oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence -This level is attained by pass\u00ad ing an examination dealing with the student's particular interests. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have for\u00ad mally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dis\u00ad sertation on this research and defends it at an oral examina\u00ad tion during the final year of graduate study.

Schneiderman: Developmental biology and insect physiology Grover C. Stephens: Comparative animal physiology The Department of Developmental and Cell Biology is con\u00ad cerned with the development, physiology, structure, and function of organisms and their component cells. The main emphasis of the Developmental and Cell Biology graduate program is research training in developmental biology, com\u00ad parative physiology of animals, or cellular and developmental plant biology. The Department maintains facilities for research involving biochemistry; genetics; electron micro\u00ad scopy; cell, tissue, and organism culture; microsurgery; and neurophysiology. Students in the Department of Developmental and Cell Biol\u00ad ogy generally enter one of three graduate curricula. In the first year, those emphasizing comparative physiology take a three-quarter sequence of organismic physiology (Develop\u00ad mental and Cell Biology 210). Those emphasizing develop\u00ad mental biology take a series of three courses on molecular and cellular biology during the first year, followed by a total of five advanced courses during the subsequent years. Those emphasizing plant biology take a three-quarter sequence with topics which center on plant molecular, cellular, and devel\u00ad opmental biology. The selection of the first-year course pro\u00ad gram is made in consultation with a faculty advisory commit\u00ad tee when the student first arrives on the campus. This com\u00ad mittee monitors the student's progress through the first year after which the student's thesis committee is established and takes over the advising function. Students are able to diverge from this basic core into their areas of special interest by means of graduate seminar courses in subsequent years. At the end of the first year students in comparative physiology and cellular and developmental plant biology take an oral examination that covers a broad area in the general and related fields of interest to that student. Students in devel\u00ad opmental and cell biology prepare and defend a research proposal and are examined in fields related to the proposal. Since many doctoral students in the Dep\"\"artment undertake Developmental and Cell Biology 97 academic careers, the Department expects each graduate stu\u00ad dent to participate in a directed teaching experience during the graduate program. Students who enter with normal aca\u00ad demic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within five years or less. Some faculty from the Department are members of an inter\u00ad disciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. See page 91 for a description of the program.

Stephens: Comparative animal physiology Ecology and evolutionary biology dea:ls with the establish\u00ad ment of adaptations over evolutionary time and .with the sig\u00ad nificance of these adaptations in ecological time. The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology focuses on problems at the population and community levels, with par\u00ad ticular emphasis placed on coevolved processes. While the Department has faculty specialists in plant and animal ecol\u00ad ogy and in marine and terrestrial ecology, primary attention is given to important ecological questions rather than to par\u00ad ticular habitats or taxa. Faculty and graduate student UC IRVINE - 1985-1986research is often centered at the interface of two or more of these specialties. Departmental research activities include eco\u00ad logical energetics, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator inter\u00ad actions, population and reproductive ecology, and community ecology. These research endeavors attempt to achieve a bal\u00ad ance between empirical and theoretical approaches to evolu\u00ad tionary and ecological problems. Primary emphasis in the Department graduate program is placed on training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences; under exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted initially to the M.S. program. All entering students are required to enroll during the first year in a two-quarter graduate core sequence. At the end of the first year, these students will complete an oral examination based upon the core courses and other materials the Department might require. Satisfactory perfo~mance on this examination is required for continuation in the graduate program. Students entering with a B.A. or B.S. degree will enroll in the graduate core for two consecutive years, while those entering with an M.A. or M.S. degree will enroll only for the initial year. Each entering graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor and a three-person advisory committee for guidance, with whom the student will meet at least once each quarter. All students are encouraged to submit a research proposal to their advisory committee during their first year of residency. A comprehensive proposal is required before the end of the second year. The progress of each student is reviewed by the departmental faculty before the end of each academic year. Normally, all requirements for the Ph.D. should be completed within five years. No more than seven years will be allowed for completion of the program. Prior to advancement to can\u00ad didacy for the Ph.D., students must satisfy two breadth requirements at the discretion of their advisory committee. One of these must be satisfied with a foreign language and the second by the attainment of an additional skill equivalent to a second foreign language (i.e., a second foreign language, demonstrated skills in computer-statistics, attainment of unusual technical.expertise necessary for dissertation research, etc.). Advancement to doctoral candidacy by a com\u00ad prehensive oral examination will be expected during the third year for students entering with a B.A. or B.S. or during the second year for those entering with an M.A. or M.S. Appli\u00ad cants for this program should have a solid undergraduate program in biology and ecology, emphasizing both research and field work. In addition, course work in statistics, mathe\u00ad matics, and physical and chemical sciences is expected. All applicants are required to submit verbal, quantitative, and advanced biology GRE scores. The deadline for application is February I.

The program makes extensive use of health science facilities, in addition to those of the School of Biological Sciences. The curriculum is designed to produce creative and productive scientists who have an in\u00ad depth comprehension of modern biochemistry and molecular biology and who are highly competent in a given subspecialty. The faculty's research interests include structure and syn\u00ad thesis of nucleic acids and proteins, regulation, metabolism, biochemical genetics, gene organization, and immunology. The first-year student is required to take a core of advanced courses (203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, and '209), to become associated with the laboratories of at least three different investigators, and to attend the 201A-B-C seminar series. During the first year, students are advised by members of the graduate committee. Upon successful completion of the first year, the student is given a comprehensive oral examina\u00ad tion to test breadth and depth of knowledge. Although further supplemental workmay be recommended, the stu\u00ad dent normally begins a specific research project with a faculty member in the second year. The student, by passing an oral examination by the end of the third year on the proposed dis-sertation work, may advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Students normally complete their degree programs after a total of five years of graduate study. Participation in the seminar series (201A-B-C) and completion of at least one satellite course per year (210-279) are expected of all continu\u00ad ing students. Regular teaching of undergraduates is part of the training of graduate students at all levels. The gradua.te committee may waive some of the above requirements for candidates for the Master's degree. Applicants should have adequate undergraduate preparation in calculus, physics, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. Students who have not had an adequate physical chemistry course are expected to take Chemistry 130A-B-C during their first year. Some faculty from the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group.

The faculty's research interests include the bio\u00ad chemical, endocrinological, genetic, and experiential determi\u00ad nants of nervous system function and behavior. Focal processes, learning and memory, reproductive ,behavior, and communi\u00ad cation. The importance of developmental and comparative approaches to these problems is stressed. The Department of Psychobiology offers graduate training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences. Graduate students must complete a sequence of core courses (lectures and laboratories) during their first and second years. They also must take a minimum of four advanced courses before grad\u00ad uation and must participate in directed research and teaching each year. To advance to candidacy, the student must prepare a critical review paper in the area of the proposed dissertation research and must pass an oral examination in psychobiology by the end of the third year. Graduation depends on success\u00ad ful preparation and oral defense of a dissertation based on the student's research. Students are expected to complete this program in five years of study. Ideally, applicants for this program should have taken under\u00ad graduate courses in biology (one introductory year plus some advanced work), psychology (experimental, physiological, and learning), chemistry through biochemistry, introductory physics, calculus, and statistics. They also must submit GRE Aptitude test scores. Because graduate training emphasizes research, preference is given to applicants having laboratory research experience as undergraduates. The Department accepts only those students seeking a doctorate, though stu\u00ad dents who do not successfully complete their course work or do not advance to candidacy may, with the consent of the faculty, complete a Master's thesis and receive an M.S. degree in Biological Sciences. Applicants with substantial outside commitments that would curtail laboratory research or pro-long the time to degree are not accepted. Students are encouraged to take the GRE no later than October.

Fallon: monoamine systems, neuro- Christine nervous system morphological plasticity Roland A. Giolli: Experimental neuroanatomy; visual system Herbert system forebrain organization John E. Swett: Peripheral nervous system, spinal cord, pain mechanisms UC IRVINE - 1985-1986I 104 Anatomy The Department of Anatomy in the UCI-California College of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, with specialized research train\u00ad ing in the neurosciences. Research programs in the neuro\u00ad sciences include neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, the central neural regulation of circadian rhythms, forebrain organization, and function and development of sensory and motor systems. Research programs also include growth inhibi\u00ad tion, cartilage, and pulmonary edema. The Department main\u00ad tains research facilities so that the student can become expe\u00ad rienced with the analysis of neuroscientific data. Students are encouraged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using numerous techniques in various species. Students in the Department of Anatomy have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge necessary to con\u00ad duct innovative and fundamentally sound research. The second goal is to become knowledgeable anatomists with the ability to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anatomy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended academic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of modern neurobiology, with an emphasis on morphology, chemistry, and physiology. In the first year, students are required to take selected courses in anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology, and physiology, includ\u00ad ing a year-long course in neural science techniques. Over the usual four-year training period the student is required to complete a practical course in statistics, selected departmental seminar courses, laboratory rotations, and a total of 50 credit hours of research in anatomy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy or other departments on campus may also be taken, and research and training in areas other than neurobiology are possible. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Only a minimal time in the third year is spent taking courses. Following the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in at least one major anatomy core course. When a student is accepted into the graduate program, the student and the Graduate Committee decide to which labora\u00ad tories the student will be assigned the first year. During the first year the student will spend approximately 25 percent of the time doing research. At the beginning of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. A Qual\u00ad ifying Examination at the end of the summer of the second year is given to the student by a Candidacy Committee. The examination consists of written papers in three of the follow\u00ad ing: fundamental neuroscience, developmental neuroscience, neural systems I, or neural systems II, determined by the candidate's field of specialization. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Graduate Committee, and an oral research proposal is made. The majority of the second, third, and fourth years is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written dissertation suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the stu\u00ad dent's advisor and Doctoral Committee constitutes the final examination. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded following completion of all the requirements, a pro\u00ad cess that normally will take four years to complete.

The Department provides rl!search opportunities in the molecular biophysics of membranes and proteins; endocrinology; cellular physiology; developmental neurobiology; pulmonary and exercise physiology. The faculty research is generally oriented toward molecular and cellular physiology but opportunities for research in organ physiology also exist. The core curriculum provides the stu\u00ad dent with a broad background in physiology and biophysics and the closely related fields of anatomy and biochemistry. Elective courses permit in-depth exploration of particular areas. Interdisciplinary dissertation research involving the research of more than one faculty member is encouraged. Prerequisites for admission normally include a bachelor's \u00b7degree in o\u00b7ne of the biological sciences, physics, chemist~y, UC IRVINE - 1985-1986mathematics, or engineering, as well as undergraduate courses in calculus, organic and physical chemistry, biochem\u00ad istry, and advanced biology (e.g., neurophysiology, cell biol\u00ad ogy, neurobiology, psychobiology). Up to two prerequisites may be fulfilled as first-year electives. GRE Aptitude and Advanced tests are required. Preference will be given to those students who have prior research experience. The Department admits about three highly qualified students each fall. The program emphasizes original research, and stu\u00ad . dents are expected to become involved in the research of the Department as early as possible. The core program includes graduate courses in physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, morphology, and cell biology. After the first year, training will follow the classical tutorial pattern in which a S!Tiall number of students are tutored by the faculty in an informal setting. Students also will participate in a program of labora\u00ad tory rotations and attend the weekly colloquium in physiol\u00ad ogy. The third and fourth years will be spent primarily in research, with some participation in teaching physiology to medical students. Each student must submit a written disser\u00ad tation on an original research project and successfully defend this dissertation in an oral examination. Incoming students will receive academic advising from the Department Graduate Advisor until such time as they choose a dissertation advisor. The faculty conducts quarterly reviews of all continuing students to ensure that they are maintaining satisfactory progress within their particular academic pro\u00ad gram. Students who have completed all necessary prerequi\u00ad sites should be able to complete the Ph.D. within five years. A comprehensive examination will be administered in June at the end of the second year. The examination is based upon the tutorials in advanced physiology and is designed to test the student's ability to organize a body of knowledge and to think critically. Some time during the third year, the student will present a seminar on a topic assigned by the formal can\u00ad didacy committee. Following the seminar, the committee will critically examine the student's qualifications for the success\u00ad ful conduct of the doctoral dissertation. Advancement to can\u00ad didacy for the Ph.D. is recommended to the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research upon the unanimous vote of the committee. Some faculty from the Department are members of an inter\u00ad disCiplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. See page 91 for a description of the program.

UC IRVINE - 1985-1986108 Fine Arts School of Fine Arts Robert Garfias Dean The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is creating and performing works of art in an atmosphere in which the creative process is central. The School is committed to the creative act: to making and performing. A program based on such a commitment requires a faculty experienced in the creative process. The faculty in the School of Fine Arts is comprised primarily of permanent artists-in-residence. Studio courses in all areas are taught by eminent faculty who have earned their living professionally and who continue to main\u00ad tain professional assignments and commitments. In addition to the permanent artists-in-residence faculty, vis\u00ad iting artists comprise about one-third of the staff, providing a constant inflow of ideas and personalities. A variety of artists challenges the students' sensibilities and encourages them to think and to create freshly and freely. The focus on the creative process, the professional and scholar-performer faculty, and the individual's commitment and courage provide, it is felt, an ideal condition for the serious student in the arts who wants to be painting, sculp\u00ad turing, dancing, acting, singing, directing, choreographing, writing, or playing an instrument six to 10 hours a day dur\u00ad ing the most sensitive and formative years of life. The central concern of the faculty is the development of a creative talent in an atmosphere of creative activity. In addition to programs concerned primarily with studio and performance activity, courses of study in the history and theory of the arts are offered as major areas of concentration. The School of Fine Arts is organized into areas of instruction rather than with formal departments. Undergraduate majors are offered in Fine Arts (General Interdisciplinary), History of Art, Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. Requirements include extensive studio and work\u00ad shop experiences, essential theoretical and historical back\u00ad ground studies, and exercises in criticism. The requirements for all performing and studio majors in the fine arts are designed to provide opportunities for the student-artist to work creatively for at least four hours a day from the fresh\u00ad man year through graduation. Courses in film writing and television are available in the Drama program. A student who wishes to pursue a double major by combin\u00ad ing two majors from the School of Fine Arts or by combining a major from the School with a major from another academic unit may do so with the proviso that only one major can be officially declared until the senior year. At that time, when the requirements for both majors are nearly completed, the student can be approved as a double major. In addition to producing student concerts, musicals, and dramatic performances, the School of Fine Arts presents a varied offering of cultural events each year, including distin\u00ad guished lecturers, world-renowned concert artists, outstand\u00ad ing dance and drama groups, jazz and folk performers, a film series, and a gallery program. The Fine Arts Village includes studio and classroom space for the areas of History of Art, Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. Specialized facilities for the studio art area include an Art Gallery and six well-lighted studios for drawing, paint\u00ad ing, sculpture, graphics, and ceramics. Power equipment for sculpture, two presses for graphics (intaglio), print making and lithography, and two kilns for ceramics are available. The Village Theatre, conventionally designed, contains an orches\u00ad tra pit, a large completely equipped stage, and seating for 420 people. The Concert Hall, seating 230, has a thrust plat-form stage, a Baroque pipe organ, and excellent acoustics. The Studio Theatre provides an experimental stage base without fixed seats, allowing complete freedom in determin\u00ad ing the style of production. The Little Theatre, located in Humanities Hall, and the Virginia and Norman Nixon Studio Theatre are intimate proscenium theatres for Drama Work\u00ad shops and graduate directing projects. All theatres are com\u00ad \u00b7pletely equipped with modern sound and lighting systems, and students involved in productions work in completely equipped and professionally operated scenery and costume shops. Campus television studios are also located in the Vil\u00ad lage. Music students attend orchestra rehearsals in a special Village facility also utilized for choral and instrumental ensemble rehearsals. Practice rooms are equipped with Steinway and other practice pianos, and Steinway concert grands are used in concerts. A music listening laboratory is also available to music students. Dance classes in ballet, mod\u00ad ern, and jazz are held in four locations: the two main studios in the Fine Arts Village, Crawford Hall (gymnasium), and the Studio Theatre. In addition to their formal instruction and participation, stu\u00ad dents in the School of Fine Arts and qualified students from other academic areas are involved at a less. formal level as participants, organizers, and coordinators throughout the . year in the various production units, including University Chorus, UCI Symphony Orchestra, University Theatre, Stu\u00ad dent Exhibitions, Graduate Art Gallery, Dance Concerts, Dance Workshop, Drama Workshop, Music and Opera Work\u00ad shop, and Television Production. The opportunity is provided for all qualified UCI students to participate in the UCI Pep Band and Song Leaders, and to receive course credit for this participation. Those interested should see the instructor of Theatre Orchestra, Music 173, about requirements for participation and enrollment in the appropriate course. All new Fine Arts students are assigned or may choose their own faculty advisors and are encouraged to meet with them during orientation week and periodically throughout the year to plan programs of study and to discuss educational and career objectives. In addition, students. are invited to make use of the counseling services in the Fine Arts Counseling Office for assistance with programs, requirements, or any academic matter.

This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in either Business Administration (M.B.A.), Public Administra\u00ad tion (M.P.A.), or Business and Public Administration (M.B.P.A.), along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Completion of either the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or the UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Fine Arts 109 UC IRVINE - 1985-1986I llO Fine Arts/General Interdisciplinary Graduate Record Examination (GRE) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Program. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's de\u00ad gree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management section and contact their academic counselor. Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies encourages the student to examine religion and religious phenomena in the context of the several disciplines repre\u00ad sented in the Schools of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences. The Concentration, which is available with any major offered by these three Schools, is, for the most part, made up of courses already offered in the undergraduate cur\u00ad riculum; it allows the student to organize these courses, however, into a program complementary to the student's major. It is the objective of .the Concentration that participat\u00ad ing students expand their appreciation and understanding of religion in the context of their own major discipline while also developing critical abilities in the area of religious studies in its own right. While the Concentration takes as its subject all religion and religious phenomena and courses are offered in non-Western religious subjects, the academic specialties of the majority of the contributing faculty lie in Western traditions. Students electing the Concentration are required to take eight one-quarter courses from those approved for the Con\u00ad centration. The courses are gathered into three generic cate\u00ad gories: religious theory and comparative religions, canonical literature, and topics in religious studies. Students take two courses from each category as well as two additional courses from among those approved for the Concentration. For further information and a quarterly list of courses available, please contact the Coordinator of the Concentration, 343 Humanities Office Building. Honors Students who have distinguished themselves academically will be conside~ed for honors at graduation. A general criteria is that students must have completed at least 72 units in resi\u00ad dence at a University of California campus. In keeping with the Academic Senate Resolution no more than 12 percent of the graduating seniors may receive honors. Undergraduate Program Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: None (see under programs). Graduate Program The School of Fine Arts offers a program leading to the degree of Master of Fine Arts (in Fine Arts) with concentra\u00ad tions in Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is performance-the crea\u00ad tive act. Research activities are concerned with illuminating performance and inspiring the studio experience. The intel\u00ad lectual activity of theoretical, literary, and historical courses complements the practical work in studio workshops and per\u00ad formance. The aim of the program is, thus, to produce liter\u00ad ate artists who are responsive to intellectual stimuli, who are capable of integrating knowledge into creative acts, and who are disciplined to the point of freedom. It is the strong belief of the School that intellectual integrity and professional excellence cannot exist without each other. Admission to the Program Applications are accepted for fall quarter admission only, and ordinarily must be completed by March 1 as the number of graduate students that can be admitted to the School of Fine Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for audi\u00ad tions, interviews, and the submission of portfolios, composi\u00ad tions, and dossiers, as appropriate, by March 1. Students applying for scholarships and fellowships should do so by March 1, and are also encouraged to apply for financial assistance through the Financial Aid Office. The School of Fine Arts has a modest number of teaching assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by June 1 for the following academic year. Upon admission to the program the student will be assigned an advisor. The student should discuss with this advisor the scope of undergraduate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthening if the student is to derive full benefit from graduate_ study. Fine Arts General Interdisciplinary Keith Fowler, D.F.A. Yale University, Chair of General Inter\u00ad disciplinary Studies, Assistant Professor of Drama, and Head of Directing The program in general interdisciplinary studies is designed for students who wish to combine the various disciplines in fine arts. Although participation in studio classes is required, the program emphasizes the study of the history, theory, and criticism of the arts in three of the School's instructional areas. The nature of the program provides each student the opportunity to plan a uniquely individual course of study with the approval of an advisor. Because the general interdis\u00ad ciplinary program is designed for students with a strong sense of personal direction and a desire for an academic appreciation of the arts, students wishing to enter the pro\u00ad gram must submit a statement of purpose to the General Interdisciplinary Studies Committee prior to the quarter in which they intend to declare their major. Admission to the program is based upon the statement of purpose and upon the student's prior record of high academic performance. Upon completion of this program, students will be awarded the B.A. in Fine Arts with General Interdisciplinary as the area of concentration. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: Statement of purpose (see above).

All majors in the history of art are encouraged to study a second language beyond the minimum program requirement of two years in a single language at the university level. Careers for the History of Art Major A Bachelor's degree in the History of Art is excellent prepa\u00ad ration for pursuing either a career as an art historian or museum curator, or professional study in an entirely differ\u00ad ent discipline. History of Art majors have gone on to gradu\u00ad ate and professional school to study art history, archaeology, law, library science, business (in some cases with special focus in the fine arts), or teacher education. The study of the His\u00ad tory of Art is a valuable part of a liberal education that pro\u00ad vides a means of looking at the history and culture of both the past and the present through the world's great masterpieces.

UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Careers for the Studio Art Major UC Irvine's Studio Art faculty and gallery exhibitions have provided the starting point for a great many prospective practicing artists. An unusually high percentage of Studio Art alumni have gone on to successful careers as profes\u00ad sional; exhibiting artists. Many graduates teach at all levels and work in museums as curators or preparators (those who prepare the gallery for an exhibit and hang or install the works). A Studio Art major is also good preparation for further study at the graduate level. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: None.

General Information The M.F.A. program focuses primarily on development of experimental concepts and format relevant to contemporary issues as they affect visual arts, rather than on processes of traditional techniques and ideas. A small, personal environ\u00ad ment supports the individual's efforts in research, develop\u00ad ment, and exhibition of ideas by providing as much latitude for special needs as possible. By meeting with students on a one-to-one basis or in small groups, a variety of art experi\u00ad ences occur. Internships, selected field trips, contemporary exhibitions in the Art Gallery, contact with visiting profes\u00ad sional artists, and seminars provide the framework for the program. Off-campus graduate student studio space is available on a limited basis by application to the appropriate program chair or to the graduate advisor. Admission Applicants for admission to the degree program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate study, hold a B.A. or B.F.A. in Art, and submit by March 1 a port\u00ad folio of their creative work or 12 or more slides, on a #80 Kodak Carousel tray, of their most recent work. Normally, anyone who has earned an M.F.A. degree in Studio Art will not be considered for admission into the program. General Degree Requirements Normally two years of residence are required. Each candidate must enroll for three courses each quarter for six quarters, exclusive of summer sessions. The student's progress and body of work will be reviewed by a faculty committee, on a regular basis, yearly.

This project is to be supported by a thesis incorporating visual and written material relevant to the proj\u00ad ect and the candidate's creative research while at UCI. Oral defense of the project and essay may be required to test the candidate's general knowledge in the area. in which the proj\u00ad ect falls. Specific Degree Requirements Seventy-two quarter units in graduate or approved upper\u00ad division undergraduate courses must be completed with a grade of at least B or the letter grade S in each course. Not more than 20 units in upper-division courses may count toward the degree. Electives may be taken in any discipline. The 72 units will normally be made up in the following manner: First Year: three courses in Graduate Problems (Studio Art 215); three seminars in Problems of Contemporary Art (Stu\u00ad dio Art 230); three courses in Graduate Projects (Studio Art 240).

The classical academic approach to ballet adheres to those principles developed from Noverre through Petipa and Cecchetti modified to accommo\u00ad date our current understanding of those laws of physics and of the human anatomy applicable to the study of dance. The workshops in contemporary dance explore and extend the Dance 115 various approaches to modern dance and jazz, concentrating on physiological and rhythmic problems encountered in con\u00ad temporary choreography. Studies in preclassic dance forms and their musical structures provide additional workshop experience as well as significant research materials for chore\u00ad ographic problems. Workshops in ethnic dance provide addi\u00ad tional choreographic resources in the context of their cultural setting. Theoretical and historical courses complement the practical work in workshops, choreography, and: perfor\u00ad mance. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as dancers, as choreographers, as teachers, or as historians, as well as for stu~ents who, while not planning to make dance their vocation, have a serious interest in the theory, practice, criticism, research, or therapy and history of dance. The traditional technique of classical ballet constitutes a craft and style that serves not only as a physiological center for the logical training of the body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. Workshop experiences build progressively on the techniques of ballet and extend through the contemporary idioms of modern and jazz. The aim is to develop kinetic resources, precision, flexibility, and freedom in a coordinated and intelligently responsive body. Careers for the Dance Major In addition to the perhaps more obvious careers in profes\u00ad sional dance, choreography, and teaching, a major in Dance also can serve as a basis for graduate study or job opportuni\u00ad ties in, for example, dance therapy, dance history, kinesiology/ anatomy, and dance notation. Related fields such as adminis\u00ad tration, design, and music also offer positions in dance. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: None. Performance Requirements Students planning to major in dance should develop basic ability in techniques of ballet, modern, and jazz dance forms. Although freshmen entering with fewer than 12 units are not required to audition, a placement examination is offered. The evaluation of the examination indicates the level of ballet and modern at which the student is placed. Freshmen declar\u00ad ing the dance major are encouraged to take the placement examination, especially if they feel they could be placed at a higher level than Ballet I and Modern I. At the end of the freshman year the student should select one of the four major emphases with faculty approval. At the end of the sophomore year, the faculty will determine whether the stu\u00ad dent is making sufficient progress to proceed as an upper\u00ad division major. All advanced standing applicants (entering students with 12 units or more) to the University who have indicated an inter\u00ad est in majoring in dance are required to audition and will be notified by the School of the date. Evaluations of the stu\u00ad dent's audition will indicate whether or not the student may major in dance and will indicate the appropriate placement level in ballet and modern for students admitted to the major. This placement level determines the minimum amount of years it will take to complete the degree requirements. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986116 Dance Inasmuch as the level of performance ability generally deter\u00ad mines the length of time in study, and all transfer students must anticipate meeting the total performance requirements for the B.A. degree, students deficient in level of perfor\u00ad mance in comparison to their level of academic study should be prepared to.extend their studies in order to meet perfor\u00ad mance requirements.

Each major in drama experiences exacting and rigorous training in the mutually interrelated areas of the theatre: performance, design, literature, history, and criticism. The curriculum con\u00ad stantly relates studio practices, technical resources, and pro\u00ad ductional techniques to the development of dramatic litera\u00ad ture and current critical theory. The student specializes dur\u00ad ing the last two years of study in acting, directing, design, television, or criticism. The continuous production of plays, musicals, operettas, and operas constitutes the major activity of the program. Stu\u00ad dents are treated as members of a theatrical organization, and they acquire experiences in all phases of theatrical pro\u00ad duction in a professionally disciplined atmosphere. Dramatic production centers on an exhaustive analysis of the script and on the challenge of communicating the complexities of the plan to an audience in a unified and meaningful production. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as actors, directors, designers, critics, and \u00b7teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama. Careers for the Drama Major A degree in Drama may or may not lead to professional employment in theatre or films. A professional career in act\u00ad ing demands, in addition to excellent training, great talent, great dedication, and not a little bit of luck-intangibles no drama program can promise or even imply. Graduates in Drama at UCI have performed in Broadway plays, regional and summer theatres, and in films and televi\u00ad sion. At least seven thriving repertory theatres in the coun\u00ad try have been created by UCI Drama graduates; all of these theatres regularly add new members from the UCI alumni. Not all Drama students become professional theatre artists.

Bailes Dean The School of Humanities sets for itself the goal of helping to develop both the analytical and creative powers of its stu\u00ad dents with particular respect not only to vocational goals, but also the larger questions of human conduct, the modes of human communication and symbolization, speculative thought, and the verbal arts. The School includes those basic disciplines of language, literature, history, and philosophy that deal fundamentally with the texture and dimensions of experience, both individual and social, past and present. The School takes as its concern a large portion of the liberal edu\u00ad cation not only of students who intend to major within its confines, but also of students who come to it from other parts of the campus. Because of the nature of the disciplines collected in the School, it is deeply concerned with language and its many facets. Further, though the School has estab\u00ad lished a number of specific major courses of study, it is intent on integrating the basic disciplines in a variety of ways at the undergraduate level and to some extent at the graduate level.

To be nomi\u00ad nated the stud~nt must achieve a UC grade point average of at least 3.40 and receive strong recommendation from the department. A minimum of 18 courses (72 units) in residence at a UC campus is a necessary condition for honors at grad\u00ad uation. To be eligible for nomination, the student must meet all honors criteria and file an application for graduation by the end of the winter quarter of the senior year. Undergraduate Programs The School offers undergraduate majors in Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion, Classics, Comparative Literature, English, French, Ger\u00ad man, History, Humanities (including Emphases in Film Studies and Women's Studies), Linguistics, Philosophy, Rus\u00ad sian, and Spanish. It offers lower-and upper-division courses in Italian and Portuguese. A corps of lower-division advisors is designed to meet the special needs of freshmen and sophomores who are inter\u00ad ested in the humanities but who have not\u00b7chosen a major in the School. The advisors are particularly interested in under\u00ad graduate education and especially knowledgeable about Uni\u00ad versity regulations, requirements in and outside the School, course content, options to major, and other matters that may present difficulties. For the first two years, students in Humanities are encouraged to explore the various disciplines represented in the School. During that time the lower\u00ad division advisor is prepared to help the undeclared student keep options to major open, plan a coherent program of humanistic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Humanities, additional meetings between individual students and the instructor may be required. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely with their advisors will construct programs that include a good number of such courses. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities partici\u00ad pate in the affairs of the School in anumber of ways: by serv\u00ad ing on committees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the Humanities Council, which directly advises the Dean. Graduates of the School of Humanities often go on to gradu\u00ad ate and professional schools. An undergraduate major in the humanities is excellent preparation for future careers in law, teaching at all levels, business, journalism, administration, government service at all levels, and also medicine. Humanities Honors Program The Honors Program of the School of Humanities is designed to challenge superior students and provide them with unique opportunities for interdisciplinary work. Honors Program participants will have the added advantage of being able to pursue independent research with a faculty member and to participate in advanced seminars in humanistic inquiry. The Program is open by invitation to students from programs and disciplines outside the School of Humanities. The Humanities Honors Program offers three honors sequences. Honors Humanities IA-B-C open by invitation to selected students, provides special discussion sections for honors students enrolled in the Humanities Core Course. Honors Humanities 2A-B-C compares and contrasts modes of analysis and critical thinking in history, literary studies, and philosophy in a small seminar setting. The third honors sequence (Humanities HI38, Hl39, Hl40) combines critical analysis with the writing of an honors thesis in the student's major field. \u00b7 Honors students are invited to participate in special student\u00ad faculty colloquia as well as informal gatherings. Individual\u00ad ized counseling on courses and careers is available. Entering freshmen participants may request priority consideration for housing. For additional information, please contact the Office of the Dean, School of Humanities, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, CA 92717, telephone (714) 856-5132. Language Laboratory The Language Laboratory serves as the audio-lingual re\u00ad source center for the following languages taught in the School of Humanities: Spanish, French, German, Russian, Portuguese, and Italian. Students, faculty, and staff may . listen to cassettes of audio material in the Laboratory, or they may check out cassettes and cassette players to practice at home. Members of the community are welcome to use the Language Laboratory facilities on campus. In addition to the languages offered in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, the Language Laboratory has a tape library that includes reels in Persian, Romanian, Chinese, Japanese, Dutch, Swed\u00ad ish, Norwegian, English, Hebrew, and Swahili. Arrangements can be made to provide these languages on cassette. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Humanities 133 UC IRVINE - 1985-1986134 Classics Through the business office, the Language Laboratory oper\u00ad ates a translation referral service for students, faculty, staff, members of the community, and local businesses. The Lan\u00ad guage Laboratory is located in 207 and 213 Humanities Hall and is open from 8:00a.m. until 4:00p.m., Monday through Friday. The telephone number is (714) 856-6344. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements .Humanities 1A-B-C, taken in the freshman year (transfer students may substitute appropriate course work in composi\u00ad tion, literature, history, humanities, and philosophy for the Core Course by permission: apply in the Dean's Office); two years of work in a single acceptable foreign language, either modern or classical (through 2C), or equivalent competence; quarterly consultation with an assigned advisor and the ad\u00ad visor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. Consultation should be made by the second week of each quarter. School Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for each major must be completed success\u00ad fully at UCI. See individual major requirements for specific courses. Graduate Programs The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most depart\u00ad ments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. Exceptions are the two-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) and the two-year Master of Arts of Teaching in Spanish. In addition to the seminars offered by the various departments, the School sponsors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught jointly by faculty members from various depart\u00ad ments. Further, several departments offer a few students the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. A limited number of students is accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the Office of Teacher Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of the various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the student gradu\u00ad ate advisory committee, which directly advises the Dean. Department of Classics Richard I. Frank, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Chair of the Department and Associate Professor of Classics and History (Roman history, Classical tradition) Luci Berkowitz, Ph.D. The Ohio State University, Professor of Classics (pastoral poetry, literary criticism) Theodore F. Brunner, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Classics and Director, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project (computer de Nantes, Professor of Classics (Late Greek literature, Greek novel) Dana F. Sutton, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Associate Professor of Classics (Greek drama, satyr-play) Undergraduate Program The Department of Classics aims to provide the undergradu\u00ad ate student with an exposure to the origins and heritage of Western civilization. The Department is committed to a two\u00ad fold purpose: (1) disseminating interest in and knowledge of classical civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin language and literature; and (2), through English translation courses in classical literature, history, civilization, and mythology, helping students to appreciate the pervasive influence of Greece and Rome on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics with an emphasis on Greek, Latin, or Linguistics and a major in Classical Civili\u00ad zation in which most of the required courses are in English translation. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appropriate choice of major and design of program. For the Classics major the basis of studying the Classics must be competence in both of the classical languages. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this compe\u00ad tence as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of first-year Latin or Greek the student has already been introduced to some of the major classical authors in the original. From then on the student is concerned with reading and interpreting the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and will devote study to literary and textual criticism. In addition, students obtain an extensive background in ancillary fields such as ancient history, archaeology, art, drama, philosophy, and religion. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for those stu\u00ad dents who have no plans to pursue graduate studies in the classical languages, yet wish to obtain an undergraduate degree based on a sound knowledge of the classical world. The nucleus of this major consists of one year of study (or its equivalent) in either classical language and a minimum of 10 courses in English translation (seven of which are given by the Department) concerning such topics as classical literature, civilization, history, archaeology, art, and drama. The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civili\u00ad zation should obtain a copy of the pamphlet, \"The Classics,\" available in the departmental office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training will be given advanced standing as follows: in general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Latin will enroll in Latin 1B, 1C, 25, and 100 respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the approval of the Department Chair. Students with high school training in the classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics staff before enrolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision\u00ad making process. Student representatives, elected from and by the undergraduate majors, participate in all departmental meetings. They are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their constituency, for representing the students' inter\u00ad est in curriculum and personnel matters, and for the evalua\u00ad tion of both the academic program and the academic staff. Inquiries regarding language placement, prerequisites, plan\u00ad ning a program of study, or other matters related to the Department's offerings should be directed to the Office of the Chair, 142 Humanities Hall, (714) 856-6735/5896. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Hebrew and Judaic Studies Courses in Hebrew and Judaic Studies were initiated by the Department of Classics in September 1976, through a joint agreement between the School of Humanities and the Uni\u00ad versity of Judaism in Los Angeles. Normally two years of Hebrew are offered which meet the Humanities foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement. Emphasis is on modern Israeli-spoken Hebrew, with some instruction in Biblical Hebrew during the second year. Hebrew language courses will not be offered in 198S-86 but may be resumed in 1986-87. Courses will con\u00ad tinue to be offered in aspects of Jewish history, philosophy, and literature (Classics 180A-B-C 181, and 182A-B-C). Through this program the Department of Classics is able to broaden its offerings to include both the Greek and Hebrew contributions to Western civilization. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-S2. School Requirements: See page 134. Departmental Requirements for Majors Two separate majors: Classics (with an emphasis in Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and Classical Civilization. Classics (Greek emphasis): Greek 1A-B-C; Greek 24; five courses in Greek Greek 100; Latin 1A-B-C; Latin 2S; two courses in Latin 100. Classics (Latin emphasis): Latin 1A-B-C; Latin 2S; five courses in Latin 100; Greek 1A-B-C; Greek 2S; two courses in Greek 100. Classics 135 grams. All majors are assigned to a faculty member for aca\u00ad demic advising. Career Opportunities The practical value of the study of the ancient world extends very distinctly into modern life. The discipline of Classics is primarily a valuable component of a liberal education; a knowledge of Greek and Roman language and literature, his\u00ad tory and philosophy, religion and mythology offers an excel\u00ad lent foundation for the investigation and appreciation of many aspects of modern civilization; in effect, it is an inter\u00ad disciplinary study. For this reason, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization may find many professional opportunities open. Graduate and professional schools in law, medicine, management, and other fields wel\u00ad come students with training in the Classics. So do many bus\u00ad iness corporations. In a world of rapid industrial develop\u00ad ment, in which highly specialized skills quickly become obso\u00ad lete because of changes in technology, many enterprises find it necessary to train prospective executives themselves, to suit their own needs. Businesses are well acquainted with the value of a classical training; they are aware that a student with a strong background in a respected and demanding major such as Classics has been trained in disciplined think\u00ad ing, ability to learn, and the ability to express oneself in clear, coherent, and cogent language, capabilities which they find valuable in a future manager. There are also specific vocational opportunities open to the graduate in Classics or Classical Civilization. Most imme\u00ad diately, a major in this field may lead to a career in high school teaching, or (after appropriate further study) in college or university teaching. It is also an excellent preparation for advanced study in other academic disciplines, such as archaeology, history, comparative literature, and linguistics, as well as for theological studies and for work in a wide range of humanities and social science subjects. Classics (Linguistics emphasis): two possible plans of study. Greek concentration-Greek 2S; five courses on the Greek 100 level; Greek 110; Latin 2S; two courses on the Latin 100 level; Linguistics SO, 110, 120, 130 (Greek 120 recommended) or Latin concentration-Latin 2S; five courses on the Latin 100 level; Latin 110; Greek 2S; two courses on the Greek 100 level; Linguistics SO, 110, 120, 130 (Latin 120 recommended). NOTE: With the permission of the Department, an additional . Graduate Program 100 series course in the same language may be substituted The Classics graduate program emphasizes individual atten- for Greek or Latin 2S. tion under tutorial conditions and study in small groups. The Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) 1A-B-C or equiva\u00ad lent; Classics 3SA-B-C or SOA-B-C; four upper-division Classics courses; three additional courses in classical history, classical philosophy, or classical art. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for Minors The Department also offers minors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilization. Greek: Greek 1A-B-C; Greek 2S; five courses in Greek 100 or 120. Latin: Latin 1A-B-C; Latin 2S; five courses in Latin 100 or 120. Classical Civilization: Classics 3SA-B-C or Classics SOA-B-C; five courses from Classics 140, 1SO, 1S1, 160, 16S, 169, 170. Planning a Program of Study The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising, program planning, and discussion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty at the earliest possible moment, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various pro-number of students admitted is carefully limited and work is closely supervised. Each student is associated with various faculty members while developing general competence in the discipline, research methods, and teaching. The principal strength of the program is in the area of literature. The entering student should be qualified at least to the level of the B.A. in Classics; some students may be required to do additional work at the undergraduate level. Students entering with the B.A. are normally expected to complete the Ph.D. program in five years. Completion of a dissertation and its successful oral defense are required. A sample Ph.D. curriculum can be obtained on request from the Department. The M.A. degree may be conferred after two years of satisfactory work. Students meet in one group for regular course work consist\u00ad ing of three elements as follows: (1) a single weekly seminar, covering a different topic each quarter, which may meet on another UC campus in some quarters; most seminars are devoted to major literary topics; (2) a topically arranged directed reading course covering, in a three-year cycle, texts on the reading list; (3) tutorial instruction in Greek and Latin language and sty\u00ad listics and advanced prose composition. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986136 Classics In addition to the above, instruction is given regularly in the tradition, methods, and tools of classical scholarship, includ\u00ad ing computer application to literature. In addition to course work, students are required to read extensively in the general field of Classics, under faculty guidance. Students take written examinations, and their progress is assessed periodically. Students are required to pass reading examinations in German and French at an early stage. After course work is completed, each student must pass an individ\u00ad ually designed qualifying examination, covering both the general field of Classics and the student's own interests, in order to become a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dis\u00ad sertation stage. The resources of the program are appreciably enhanced by contributions from other sources. In particular, cooperative arrangements are in force among the Classics graduate pro\u00ad grams of the UC campuses at Irvine, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara. Additionally, the program calls on visiting scholars, faculty from other UCI departments, and members of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project (see below). Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project, a unique resource for research in Greek literary and linguistic studies, is closely affiliated with the Department of Classics although it is administratively separate.

Wlecke, Ph.D. Michigan State University, Associate Profes\u00ad sor of Ellglish (English and American Romanticism, teaching of composition) The Department of English and Comparative Literature is concerned with the nature and value of literature, possible approaches to literary works, and the relation of literary criti\u00ad cism to the intellectual fssues of the day. Fundamentally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary concern is critical and theoretical. Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all students write the English language with clarity and grace. Students. are given the opportunity to participate in depart\u00ad mental affairs through two elected student committees, one of undergraduates, one of graduates, which are concerned primarily with matters of personnel and curriculum. The committees meet periodically with faculty committees of the Department, and the recommendations of student commit\u00ad tees .become matters of record which accompany any recom\u00ad mendations emanating from the Department. Each quarter all students taking classes within the Department have the opportunity to evaluate the particular course and teacher. Careers for the English or Comparative Literature Major The study of literature helps students to express their ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analytically and imaginatively. These capabilities will help qualify majors for careers in education, law, technical writing, communications, journalism, public relations, business, and management. An undergraduate major in either English or Comparative Liter\u00ad ature is also an especially good preparation for graduate study. The Undergraduate Majors Committee and the depart\u00ad mental faculty work closely with the Career Planning and Placement Center to help majors plan careers appropriate to the education in English or Comparative Literature at Irvine. Advisors encourage their students to investigate various careers-especially those outside the traditional fields for such majors (e.g., graduate study and law)-before these stu\u00ad dents have completed their undergraduate educations. Undergraduate Program The Department offers to the undergraduate three areas of study: The Program in literary Criticism, which emphasizes a vari\u00ad ety of critical approaches in the reading and criticism of Eng\u00ad lish, American, and comparative literature. The Program in Writing, which offers an emphasis in the writing of poetry, fiction, or drama. Undergraduate courses in journalism and nonfiction are also available, including for\u00ad mal instruction and workshop experience for staff members of the campus newspaper. The aim of the program is to encourage the creative powers of students while introducing them to the discipline of reading and practical criticism, often in workshop situations. Under certain circumstances, creative writing courses may satisfy part of the writing requirement portion of the UCI breadth requirement (Category 1). See page 51. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986The Program in Comparative Literature, which though administratively a part of the Department, is basically inter\u00ad disciplinary in its orientation, drawing on faculty and other resources from the fields of the various modern and classical literatures and drama. The consciousness of the modern edu\u00ad cated person is the product of centuries of cultural heritage, including not only works of literature in one's own language but world literature from Homer to Gide and Thomas Mann. At UCI, Comparative Literature is regarded as the study of literature from the international point of view rather than in a national framework. A student who completes a degree in Comparative Literature will be expected to have a grasp of the history of literature in its broad outlines and to be able to deal competently with literary texts, whatever their period or national origins. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoretical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaintance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of liter\u00ad ary creation at first hand, the Department invites students to take work in all three of its programs, with an emphasis in one of the first two (toward a Bachelor's degree in English) or a major in the third (toward a Bachelor's degree in Compara\u00ad tive Literature). Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the Department recognizes that no course can treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. Students intending to major in English or Comparative Liter\u00ad ature should obtain a copy of Undergmduate Study in English and Compamlive Litemture from the departmental office. Comparative Literature is well-suited for students interested in a double major. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: See page 134. Departmental Requirements for the English Major Two courses from the E 28A-B-C or CL 50A-B-C groups (including either E 28A or CL 50A) and a third course either from those two groups or from E 6, 7, 8 or CL 8; CR IOOA; CR IOOB and CL 100 (approved seminars from the course groups numbered in the 103s and 104s may be substituted for these courses); at least four courses from the E 101 group; at least five Department courses numbered\" above 101; competence in a foreign language, either classical or modern, equivalent to six quarters of work at Irvine (in classical lan\u00ad guages, IA-B-C and Greek or Latin 100 three times, though Greek or Latin 25 may be substituted for one of the 100 courses), plus (in modern languages) one course in a foreign literature in which texts are read in the original language. Students selecting a writing emphasis have some flexibility in substituting writing workshops for period and genre courses; their total courses normally number more than the usual major. Residence Requirement for the English Major: CR IOOA, CR IOOB, and three E lOis must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the English Minor Three courses selected from E28A-B-C, CL50A-B-C, or E6, 7, 8 sequences, including at least one quarter of E28; and at least five English or writing courses numbered 101 or higher, although two courses from the following may be substituted: CRIOOA, CRIOOB, WRIOOB, CLioo, CLI04. English and Comparative Literature 139 Residence Requirement for the English Minor: Four upper\u00ad division courses must be successfully completed at UCL ' Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Major Sufficient competence in a foreign language, either modern or classical, to be able to read any standard literary or critical text in that language. If the student intends to continue with graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly recommended before graduation. Three quarters of lower-division work: Comparative Litera\u00ad ture majors are normally required to take CL 50A-B-C Transfer students may be required to take one or more courses in the sequence depending on the courses they have taken previously. Normally 10 upper-division courses in addition: usually these will include CR IOOA, CL 100 twice, two courses (one 101 and one above 101) in a selected foreign language, or two lOis in two different foreign languages, or two years of a classical language; two courses from CL '103 or CL 104; three additional upper-division courses chosen from the offerings in comparative literature, English, literary criticism, and crea\u00ad tive writing. Courses in allied areas, e.g., history, philosophy, social scien~;e, may be counted toward the major if they deal with literary or philosophical texts, though prior approval of a faculty advisor is necessary. The Comparative Literature Program maintains a compre\u00ad hensive reading list in world literature, on which CL SOA-B\u00ad C is based. Students may, by prior arrangement with the Direc\u00ad tor of the Program, take an examination on one or more parts of the list and thereby become exempt from one or more quarters of CL 50A-B-C Residence Requirement for the Comparative Literature Major: CR IOOA and four upper-division English or Compar\u00ad ative Literature courses must be completed successfully at UCL \u00b7 Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor CL50A-B-C, CRIOOA, CLIOO, CLI03 or 104 (three courses), and one upper-division literature course taught in a foreign language. Residence Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCL Planning a Program of Study Students should plan, with their faculty advisors, coherent programs of study, including undergraduate seminars, work\u00ad shops in writing (for students choosing a writing emphasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is pos\u00ad sible to combine a cluster of courses in literature with other majors in the sciences and social sciences, and to use an Eng\u00ad lish or Comparative Literature major as preprofessional train\u00ad ing in government, law, medicine, etc. Students who wish advice in planning such programs should consult both the Department and people in their prospective professional areas. Students who intend to pursue a single subject or multiple subject teaching credential must consult with Professor Myron Simon (as well as with the Office of Teacher Educa\u00ad tion) to ensure that they understand the departmental and State requirements. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986140 English and Comparative Literature Graduate Program The Department's three principal areas of work on the un\u00ad dergraduate level-English and American Literature, Com\u00ad parative Literature, and the English major with writing emphasis-are reflected in the graduate programs: the M.A. and Ph.D. in English, the M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and the M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing). A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include or emphasize work in American literature as well; and the faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special interests in criticism and theory, an area which candidates for the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Litera\u00ad ture may stress in their qualifying examinations and disserta\u00ad tions. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English or Comparative Literature programs unless they plan to con\u00ad tinue, and are qualified to continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted creative work. A committee of the Department, with the consent of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, admits students to these programs. Each program has a director appointed by the Department Chair. A deliberate effort is made to maintain close adminis\u00ad trative and intellectual ties among the programs. Specific requirements for the graduate degrees will be reached by consultation between members of the faculty and the candidate. The first-year graduate student or the candi\u00ad date for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plans a program with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan with an advisor and three-person committee. At the time of the M.A. examination, the Graduate Committee evaluates the student's graduate career up to that point and offers advice about future prospects. Candidates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philosophy, history, foreign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Applicants for graduate degrees in English and Comparative Literature must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) including the Subject Literature in Eng\u00ad lish Test; applicants must also submit sample papers and a statement about competence in foreign languages. Only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the academic year. The normal expectation, however, is enroll\u00ad ment in three courses each quarter, except for Teaching Assistants, who take two courses in addition to earning credit for University teaching. Students who are not teaching should be able to complete course work in two years. The Ph.D. qualifying examination should be taken within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. Dissertations can fre\u00ad quently be written in a year. The Ph.D. in English or the Ph.D. in Comparative Literature normally should be com\u00ad pleted in six years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate stu\u00ad dents intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars-indeed, that teaching and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. candidates, in English as well as in Comparative Literature, may gain supervised training as part of the formal seminar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity to participate in this program. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the brochure on graduate programs from the departmental office. English Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes (1) the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2.) demon\u00ad strated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modern or classical; and (3) the submission of materials (including a statement about work accomplished and plans for future study, and a sample essay) to the Graduate Com\u00ad mittee, who will review and assess the student's progress, recommend whether further study toward the Ph.D. is advisable and, if so, give advice about areas for further study. Master of Fine Arts in English The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the comple\u00ad tion of a two-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two\u00ad thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in con\u00ad sultation with the student's advisor. It is expected that M.F.A. candidates will complete at least one supervised teach\u00ad ing seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to pass an examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre selected, and to present as a thesis an acceptable book\u00ad length manuscript of poetry or short stories, or a novel. Doctor of Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond the B.A. (two courses of which may be in the graduate teaching program); proficiency in the reading of two acceptable for\u00ad eign languages, modern or classical; the dissertation; and satisfactory performance on designated examinations. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the stu\u00ad dent's program as determined by the student's advisors. Reading competence in one of these languages must be estab\u00ad lished in the first year of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examination. Students admitted at the post-M.A. level must provide evi\u00ad dence of satisfactory competence in foreign languages. Com\u00ad petence in one of the two languages required for the Ph.D. is verified through a course in theory and practice of transla\u00ad tion; the other language may be verified through examination. Upon completion of course work the student takes general examinations on literary theory and criticism; some particular literary form, genre, style, theme, or structure; a historical period; a group of authors; and a specific topic. The first four of these examinations are written; the fifth is oral. The stu\u00ad dent has the opportunity to present personal choices for the examination, but the choices must enable an individual to demonstrate breadth of knowledge as well as literary under\u00ad standing and therefore must be approved by the advisory committee. Upon satisfactorily completing the general examination and the oral Qualifying Examination, the student is admitted to candidacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examination as is practical, the student presents an essay leading to dissertation for the approval of the doctoral committee. The dissertation itself must also be approved by UC IRVINE - 1985-1986the committee, which may or may not require an oral exami\u00ad nation on it. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate students. Comparative Literature There are at least four avenues by which the student may approach graduate work in Comparative Literature: 1. An undergraduate major in Comparative Literature equiv\u00ad alent to the one described above; 2. An English major, provided that a sufficient background in at least one foreign language is demonstrated (a beginning on a second foreig~ language is desirable); 3. A normal major in drama, with same proviso as 1 above; 4. A normal major in a foreign language, provided that a suf\u00ad ficient general background in world literature is demonstrated. Make-up work will be required before\u00b7 graduate studies can begin if one of these avenues has not been taken. At the graduate level, the study of Comparative Literature becomes more specialized, with the student engaged in a par\u00ad ticular area of research and concerned with such problems as the development of genres, interrelations between litera\u00ad tures, the theory and practice of translation, and other liter\u00ad ary questions transcending national boundaries. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature a profes\u00ad sional competence in foreign languages is essential. French and German are usually required for all doctoral candidates, since these languages along with English are the accepted tools of international literary scholarship. A classical language may prove indispensable for work in many traditional fields of literary study, and the scholar's own specialty may require the mastery of other languages. The underlying assumption of language requirements is that, after the tool languages have been mastered, the professional scholar's own interests should determine the specific kinds and degrees of language skill to be acquired. At the graduate level, the nucleus of the foreign languagere\u00ad quirement is the course CL 220 (Problems in Translation) in which, after a suitable theoretical preparation, the student plans and carries out a high-quality translation of a literary text. The translation, along with an introduction or other scholarly apparatus explaining and defending the technical decisions involved in the task, is then submitted as a paper for course credit. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature Students entering the Master of Arts program should com~ plete their course work in three quarters. This course work should include CL 220 (Problems in Translation) with a proj\u00ad ect in either French or German and appropriate graduate\u00ad level work in English, foreign languages, drama, comparative literature, and other areas as recommended by the advisor. Soon after beginning graduate work the student, with the advice and approval of the assigned advisor, will decide on a field of specialty, which will be emphasized in progressing toward the M.A. degree. (Normally this choice will be a pre\u00ad liminary step toward the selection of an area of specialty for the Ph.D.) Graduate study in Comparative Literature requires an excep\u00ad tional facility in foreign languages, and the student should not attempt a Master's degree without a thorough knowl\u00ad edge of one foreign language and literature and a considera\u00ad ble knowledge of a second language. Normally the greatest part of the student's work will involve the study of literary texts in the original languages. English and Comparative Literature 141. At the end of course work, normally about nine courses at the graduate level, the student will be examined on a reading list in world literature that the student's committee has approved. This list should be designed by the student in con\u00ad sultation with the committee and based on the general World Literature list for Comparative Literature. The student's own list should follow some organizing principle, such as an emphasis on the fields and languages of the student's special\u00ad ization. Nevertheless, every list should include works from all of the different groups represented on the general World Literature list. The M.A. examination is a three-hour written examination, which focuses on essay questions based on the student's approved reading list. Exceptional students may be exempted from taking the examination by petitioning the Graduate Committee, which will review the student's per\u00ad formance and qualifications in arriving at its deci\"sion. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The doctoral program is designed to prepare the student for a professional career as a scholar and critic of literature. Details of the doctoral program in Comparative Literature may be obtained from the Director of the Program in Com\u00ad parative Literature. Normally the degree requires two years of course work (usually a minimum of three courses per quar\u00ad ter). Of these courses, the only required course is CL 220 (Problems in Translation), which is taken twice, with projects in acceptable languages. The rest of the student's work will be in seminars or other graduate-level courses in Compara\u00ad tive Literature,cEnglish, the various foreign language departments, or drama. In general an exceptional command of foreign languages is required, normally involving a professional competence in two or more foreign languages, either modern or classical. The doctoral student is encouraged to design and carry out a personal plan of study (the area of specialty) in a particular field of interest. The requirements for the doctorate also include an area of competence in literary theory and practical criticism; a student may also stress theory in preparation for the Qualifying Examination. Upon completion ofthe course work, the student will be examined in the following areas of knowledge: (1) mastery of a limited topic in literary theory or history of criticism, along with general knowledge of major critical texts in the history of literature; (2) an area of specialty as described above; and (3) major works and authors appropriate to the study of comparative literature. 'Following this examination, and upon recommendation of a candidacy committee appointed by the Graduate Dean on behalf of the Graduate Council, the stu\u00ad dent is formally admitted to candidacy. The study toward the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will culminate in the writing of a suitable dissertation, normally on a comparative subject, although subjects lying within a single literature or dealing with general literary\u00b7 and aesthetic problems not confined to any specific liter,atures may also be acceptable. Studies of the relation between literature and the other arts are also encouraged. Undergraduate Courses Satisfaction of the Subject A requirement is a prerequisite for all departmental courses except E 6, 7, 8 and CL 8. However, students scoring from 550 to 600 on the College Board Eng\u00ad lish Composition Achievement Test normally should be able to satisfy the Subject A requirement with the same courses they take to satisfy the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category 1).

UC IRVINE - 1985-1986144 French and Italian Department of French and Italian Richard L. Regosin, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Chair of the Department and Professor of French (sixteenth- and seventeenth-century French literature) Daniel Brewer, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Assistant Pro\u00ad fessor of French (eighteenth- and nineteenth-century French literature) David Carroll, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Professor of French (literary theory and twentieth-century French literature) James Chiampi, Ph.D. Yale University, Associate Professor of Italian (Italian Renaissance) Judd D.

Laborde, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Pro\u00ad fessor of French (eighteenth-century French literature) Elizabeth Leemann, M.A. University of Illinois, Lecturer, Director of the French language program Leslie W. Rabine, Ph.D. Stanford University, Associate Professor of French (nineteenth-century French literature and women's studies) Aliko Songolo, Ph.D. University of Iowa, Associate Professor of French (French African and Caribbean literature) Franco Tonelli, Ph.D. Louisiana State University; La urea, University of Catania, Professor of French and Italian (dramatic literature and theory of drama) Bernard Tranel, Ph.D. University of California, San Diego, Professor of French and Linguistics (French linguistics) The Department of French and Italian offers courses designed to provide linguistic competence and a broad knowl\u00ad edge of diverse aspects of French and Italian culture: literary, social, historical, aesthetic. It seeks to enrich the students' appreciation of their own civilizations and to create a deeper sense of international understanding. The program brings the students to participate in the crea\u00ad tive process of language, to think in French or Italian as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. Most classes are taught entirely in the foreign language, and a multiple approach stresses the interdependence of the four basic skills and makes them mutually reinforcing. The Language Labora\u00ad tory is used to complement classroom activity. Representatives chosen by the undergraduate French majors and by the graduate students serve on departmental commit\u00ad tees. These representatives also participate in Department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. Careers for the French Major The great majority of students who major in French pursue careers in various sectors of the world of business and com\u00ad merce, where they can take advantage not only of their com\u00ad petency in communicating in French but also of their knowl\u00ad edge of French literature and civilization. They gain an inter\u00ad national perspective which provides them with a clearer pic\u00ad ture of their own cultural heritage. In practical terms, this perspective will allow them to operate efficiently in market\u00ad ing, publicity, and public relations, where sophistication has become essential. A number of students also follow careers in education, continue their studies in graduate school, or enter the diplomatic service. Undergraduate Program in French While preparing the student for graduate work and for the teaching profession, the French major is essentially a liberal arts program offering a broad, humanistic course of study. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contempor\u00ad ary literary and social interest provide the focus for advanced conversation, reading, and composition. After the second year, courses in speaking (conversation and phonetics) and writing enable the students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in French literature and linguistics and in French civilization and culture. In the introductory courses in literature, complete texts are studied in historical context. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is introduced to various critical techniques. At the more advanced level, literature courses may emphasize a single author, movement, or genre within a historical period. The content of these courses changes yearly according to the interests of both faculty and students. Senior seminars are offered periodically to discuss literary problems which cannot be dealt with in depth in the regular offerings. Courses in civilization and culture explore aspects of French history, intellectual thought, and the arts. Courses are offered w'ith a historical emphasis (for instance, the world of the Renaissance in France; the Age of Louis XIV; colonialism; anti-Semitism) and with a comparative orientation (for instance, poetry and painting; literature and society; women in literature; Paris and the history of art; literature and history). Courses in linguistics introduce students to aspects of the structure of the French language and to the application of linguistic techniques to problems of literary analysis. Students are placed in elementary and intermediate courses according to their years of previous study and their grades; placement examinations are given. One year of high school is equated with one quarter of work at UCI. A student may not go back more than one quarter and receive credit. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: See page 134. Departmental Requirements for the Major French Major with Emphasis in Literature and Culture: French 11, 100A-B, 101A-B-C, and eight other upper-division courses taught in French, at least six of which must be in literature, culture, or civilization. French Major with Emphasis in Linguistics: French 11, 100A-B, 101A-B-C, two courses in French civilization, Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130, and French 113, 131. Prospective elementary and secondary school teachers who choose this option should take as electives additional courses in French language, civilization, and/or literature. Work in French civili\u00ad zation is required by State credentialing authorities. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper\u00ad division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor French 100A-B plus five other French courses, four of which must be upper-division. Prerequisite: French 2C or . equivalent. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Planning a Program of Study The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program of courses to ful\u00ad fill the literature and culture or the linguistics emphasis dur\u00ad ing the junior year. The Department encourages the student to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently. Information is available in the Department Office. Students should consult with the departmental coordinator of advisors concerning career plans in the areas of teaching, industry, journalism, law, civil service, etc. Undergraduate Program in Italian Third-and fourth-year offerings provide an introduction to Italian literature and culture that serves as a basis for compo\u00ad sition, conversation, and phonetics. Tutorial and seminar courses are available for advanced stu\u00ad dents. Students are encouraged to pursue their interests through a major in Humanities, leading to a B.A. degree in Humanities, which combines Italian literature, culture, his\u00ad tory, art, and music. Graduate Program in French The Department stresses understanding rather than encyclo\u00ad pedic knowledge, experimentation with various critical approaches rather than the perpetuation of a tradition, crea\u00ad tivity rather than conformity. Internationally known scholars often participate in the graduate program as guest lecturers. Students choose their courses from three categories: (1) Crit\u00ad ical Theory: problems in French literature and criticism; (2) Comparative Methods; (3) Author, Genre, Period, Movement. Master of Arts in French The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to pursue studies for the doctorate are admitted to the program. Performance on the Master's examination, usually given in the second year of graduate study, determines entrance into the doctoral pro\u00ad gram. Most candidates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses, with at least six in literature, one in linguistics, and one in writing and style. Particularly well-prepared students may receive special permission to take a minimum of nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. All entering graduate students are assigned a faculty advisor. Individual programs are arranged in consul\u00ad tation with the faculty advisors. During the spring quarter of each year, the teaching performance and academic record of each student who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate students are also given a written evaluation of their work on a course-by-course basis. Proficiency in a foreign language in addition to French is requirecj (proficiency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass a written and oral comprehensive examination on material drawn from the class program and the Master of Arts reading list. The student writes essays demonstrating an understanding of theoretical concepts and their application to the study of specific literary texts as well as an ability to establish relationships among literary works of different periods, genres, or authors. The oral part of the examination allows elaboration on aspects of the written examination, but seeks primarily to test the stu\u00ad dents' broader knowledge. French and Italian 145 The Master's examination is given in mid-fall quarter and at the end of winter quarter. Students who are Teaching Assistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. Doctor of Philosophy in French Upon successful completion of the Master's examinations and admission to the Ph.D. program, or admission with a Mas\u00ad ter's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Com\u00ad mittee is appointed to advise the candidate in the choice of courses to help prepare for the written and oral Qualifying Examinations leading to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The formal Guidance Committee is composed of five members in fields closely related to the student's interest and projected area of specialization in which the dis\u00ad sertation will be prepared and one member who is not affil\u00ad iated with the School. One member of the committee will be expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two for\u00ad eign languages relevant to the student's area of specialization and subject to the approval of the Guidance Committee. ' Course Requirements: A minimum of 18 graduQte courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A., including one graduate course in French linguistics, one graduate course in writing and style, and three graduate courses outside the Depart\u00ad ment in areas related to the field of specialization. Students entering with a B.A. degree are required to take at least three courses in each of these three course categories as they pro\u00ad gress to the Ph.D. degree; students entering with an M.A. degree must take at least two in each area. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with particular emphasis in literary theory by taking additional course work in theory beyond the minimum number required. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candi\u00ad dates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsi\u00ad bility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is pos\u00ad sible, all candidates without previous teaching experience are required to p<;~rticipate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. Qualifying Examination -Written and Oral: Upon comple\u00ad tion of course work, the student takes a series of written open book examinations involving clearly defined problems of a critical or historical nature. The student may be given from one to three days to answer any part of the examination. The oral Qualifying Examination assesses the student's knowl\u00ad edge of French literature and understanding of a given liter\u00ad ary movement. The student will be examined on (a) five of the following six periods of French literature: Medieval; Six\u00ad Century; or four of these periods p:us the development of a single literary genre through all periods of French literature; (b) a given literary movement (e.g., Romanticism, Baroque, etc.) in a non-French literature. The written and oral parts of the examination are based both on material covered in the graduate seminars and on the Ph.D. reading list. Upon successful completion of the written and oral Qualifying Examinations, the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986I 146 French and Italian Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The disserta\u00ad tion must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recom\u00ad mended for the degree. Three faculty members, chosen by the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed by the Graduate Council, constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the prepa\u00ad ration and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doc\u00ad toral Committee supervises an oral defense, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation, and certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory.

We can understand ourselves and our immediate culture more clearly through the study of allied and diverse languages and cultures. The Department offers courses on the German language and on German literature and film. The study of German literature is pursued from various critical perspectives. Some courses emphasize its his\u00ad torical, social, and political significance and setting; in others literature is approached as an imaginative experience which transcends its immediate context. The history of German literature and film, the theory of literature and literary criti\u00ad cism, and the relations of German literature to other litera\u00ad tures are also studied in the Department's courses. Undergraduate Program The German major offers alternative emphases, one in litera\u00ad ture and another in linguistics. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the basic courses the student will develop an understanding of the nature of the language, based on linguistic principles, while \u00b7 learning the necessary skills. Use is made of the Language Laboratory. At the end of the first year, students will have attained mastery of the basic structure of the language. At the intermediate and advanced levels the student's ability to read and write German will be developed gradually. A three-quarter, third-year course stresses composition and provides an introduction to contemporary German culture. It can be followed by a course in phonetics which aims to per\u00ad fect the pronunciation as well as to introduce historical and dialectal variants. The introductory course in literature, usu\u00ad ally taken in the third year, presents a first view of some periods of German literary history, familiarizes the student with German terminology used in the interpretation of liter\u00ad ature, and uses these concepts in practical interpretations. A certain number of courses in the series German 117, 118, 119, 120 will be designated as \"core courses\" which cover German literature from the Reformation to the present and are espe\u00ad cially recommended for majors. It is assumed that the student is familiar with basic concepts of literature in English. A further series of courses (German 130, 140, 160) treats ques\u00ad tions of theme, genre, topics in literary theory and criticism, as well as perspectives in German cinema. Students are given the opportunity to participate in programs of work and study abroad during the summer and the junior year. The University's Education Abroad Program has study centers in Go \u00b7\u00b7 ttingen and Vienna among other locations. Cer\u00ad tain courses taken while participating in the Education Abroad Program are recommended as contributing to fulfill\u00ad ment of the German major requirements. Students entering UCI with previous German training will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, arid four years of high school German will normally enroll in German 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B respectively. Exceptions to this placement procedure must have the approval of the director of first-or second\u00ad year German instruction. Credit is given for the Advanced Placement Test in German. Careers for the German Major German is excellent preparation for professional schools. It can be combined successfully with work in the natural sci\u00ad ences, business and management, and the computer sciences, and it is invaluable for advanced work in the humanities and the fine arts. The ability to speak and write German, when combined with other skills and specific training, can open up opportunities in communications, foreign trade and banking, transportation, government, science and technology, tourism, library services, and teaching. Recent graduates of the German Department have begun careers in international law, business, the foreign service, the airline industry, professional translating, journalism, and all levels of education, including university teaching. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: See page 134. Departmental Requirements for the Major German Major with literature Emphasis: German 100A-B\u00ad C; German 101; eight upper-division literature courses; two courses selected from German 140, 150, Linguistics 50, Ger\u00ad man 30, English and Comparative Literature 50A-B-C, a course in German history, and a course in German philos\u00ad ophy. German 139 may not be used to satisfy major requirements. Students who plan to acquire a teaching credential, or intend to do graduate work in literature, are encouraged to take the major with literature emphasis. German Major with Linguistic Emphasis: German 100A-B\u00ad C; German guistics 50, 110, 120; one course selected from Linguistics 130, a Middle High German course, or a course in the history of the German Language; one course selected from German 140, 150, 160. German 139 may not be used to satisfy major requirements. The German major with linguistic emphasis is recommended especially for students who intend to do graduate work in lin\u00ad guistics or enter a linguistics-related profession. Residence Requirements for the Major: At least five upper\u00ad division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. At least four of the courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven upper-division courses, which must include German 100A-B-C and German 101. German 139 may not be used to satisfy minor requirements. Graduate Program In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical understanding of the nature of literature in its specific appli\u00ad cation to literature written in the German language. The Department also offers regular courses devoted to the his\u00ad tory, analysis, and theory of German film, viewing the medium in its relationship to other forms of expression as well as considering it as an art form in its own right. Courses also are offered elucidating the structure and history of the German language. The graduate program in German is essentially a program leading to the Ph.D. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The Department will decide after completion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or not to permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. thus may be in some cases a ter\u00ad minal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UC IRVINE - 1985-1986UCI graduate program in German with an M.A. from another institution, the Department will evaluate the stu\u00ad dent's progress during the first year of study before deciding to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarilyshould be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. Master of Arts in German Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a bachelor's degree in another subject may be considered for admission. Normally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is considered individually by the faculty. The min\u00ad imum course requirement for the M.A. degree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Depart\u00ad ment of German. Reading knowledge of a foreign language other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Whenever possible, a candidate is urged to complete this requirement before entering the program. Further require\u00ad ments follow. The Preparation of a Reading List. All candidates should pre\u00ad pare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German literature, e.g., both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other literatures which, in the can\u00ad didate's opinion, relate to the German works in the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German literature and some works of criti\u00ad cism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter. Candidates should indicate on the list a number of works with which they are especially familiar. In its final form (e.g., including works read during the year both in and out of class) the list will be sub\u00ad mitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the student's responsibility to keep the reading list current. The Master's Essay. The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's methodological progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay in which a text is elucidated and related to: (a) pertinent works by the same author, (b) its social and historical context, and (c) other works of German or other literatures with which the candidate is familiar. The level of the discussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secondary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively formulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. The Oral Examination. During the oral examination the fol\u00ad lowing items will be discussed: (a) the essay, (b) the reading list. The discussion based on the reading list will focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. One Course in University Teaching (399) One Year of Residence Ph.D. in German The Department requires a minimum of 22 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. Students entering with the master's degree will be advised individually as to remaining course requirements. These may include courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, etc., suitable for the individual student's program of study. The German 149 course Introduction to Middle High German and one course in medieval German literature are required. The student also will participate in each of the German Department's collo\u00ad quia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current during the whole course of study. At least two years of residence are required. Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recognizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candi\u00ad dates for the Ph.D. are required to teach under the supervi\u00ad sion of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted toward the 22 re\u00ad quired courses for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination. There are two parts to the examination. In order to fulfill the written examination re\u00ad quirement the student will choose either (I) to present a lec\u00ad ture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or (2) to write a three-part examination (one part on a signifi\u00ad cant author, one on a major genre, and one on an historical period) within a period of two weeks. These examination essays may be either closed-book or take-home, by agree\u00ad ment with the candidate's examination committee. The exam\u00ad ination essays or the lecture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from a reading list submitted by the student for the comprehensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive examination is the formal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's studies, to be taken\u00b7 within two weeks after completion of the written examination. The stu\u00ad dent will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written examination after consultation with the members of the examination committee. Language Requirements. The candidate must demonstrate reading competence in two languages or extensive compe\u00ad tence in one language other than German or English. Choice of language(s) depends on the student's area of specialization. French and Latin are recommended. For the various ways in which this requirements may be fulfilled, the student should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation. Toward the end of the second year of study, the student should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed by the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and completion of the disserta\u00ad tion. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dis\u00ad sertation is satisfactory through the signature of the Com\u00ad mittee members on the title page of the dissertation.

Wiener, Ph.D. Harvard University, Professor of History (history and social theory) Undergraduate Program The undergraduate program in History is designed to develop critical intelligence and to foster an awareness of ourselves and our world through the study qf the past. The Department offers a variety of approaches to history, and each emphasizes basic disciplinary skills: weighing evidence, expository writing, constructing logical arguments, and exploring the role of theory in historical analysis and human action. In addition to offering a number of lower-division history courses open to nonmajors, the Department requires all His\u00ad tory majors to participate in an introductory core course, His\u00ad tory 29A-B-C. This is a comparative course that acquaints students with the modern world by examining some of the basic characteristics of modernity and by focusing on the his\u00ad toric process of modernization in different societies over time. The Department has established a minor in History, designed for students who are interested in the study of history but who are majoring in other disciplines. The program incor\u00ad porates the main elements of the Department's program for majors but allows students enough flexibility to pursue pro\u00ad grams in other departments and schools. From this introductory course the student moves on to a ser\u00ad ies of upper-division courses, the contents of which range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., British History), to studies of the relations among nation-states (e.g., European International History), to historical analyses of political, socio-economic, and cultural factors (e.g., Women and the Family in the United States). Students are also pro\u00ad vided the opportunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of colloquia in the following areas: social history, political history, international history, intellectual history, social thought, and comparative history. The colloquia are conducted as discussion groups and involve close reading and analysis of secondary texts. The senior seminar is a two\u00ad quarter research seminar in primary materials that cul\u00ad minates in the writing of a research paper. Faculty me~bers in the Department of History work closely with their students. All upper-division History majors are assigned a faculty advisor, whom they are encouraged to consult at least once each quarter. Careers for the History Major The training and discipline derived from historical studies provide a valuable experience for all educated persons seeking to understand themselves and their world. Many students who complete undergraduate degrees in the Department of History go on to graduate school in a variety of fields, includ\u00ad ing history, law, business, international relations, and teacher education. The study of history is valuable preparation for many other careers as well. The strong academic and profes\u00ad sional orientation acquired by History majors is necessary to pursue successful careers in such diverse fields as advertising, banking, journalism, management, public relations, publish\u00ad ing, and government service. History 151 Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: See page 134. Departmental Requirements for the Major Fourteen courses are required, including History 29A-B-C (for which transfer students may substitute such year-long surveys as European, American, Asian, or Latin American history), six upper-division Historical Studies courses, three colloquia, and a senior seminar (two-course sequence) or two additional colloquia. Residence Requirement: Three historical studies and a senior seminar (or two colloquia) must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven courses are required, including either at least one quarter of History 29 or at least one quarter of History 50. (Minors are encouraged to take the full History 29 sequence.) At least four of the remaining six courses must be upper\u00ad division History courses and must include two colloquia or one senior seminar. Residence Requirement: At least four upper-division History courses must be completed successfully at UCI. Graduate Program The graduate program leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in History is designed to provide students with both basic historical skills and a rigorous grounding in historical theory. This combination of theoretical study with training in histor\u00ad ical method reflects the Department's conviction that scho\u00ad lars should be encouraged to deal with significant questions about the past and to approach these questions in a methodo\u00ad logically sophisticated way. This approach requires that the student develop the critical abilities necessary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrelation\u00ad ship of history and theory. Candidates for any advanced degree in History are expected to gain teaching experience as an integral part of their graduate training. Ordinarily this is accomplished through service as a Teaching Assistant or Associate. Basic to the Department's curriculum is a year-long course in History and Theory which deals with both theoretical texts and historical studies that have utilized theoretical concepts and models. The History and Theory course also examines the phenomenon of modernization-the general world trans\u00ad formation of the past four hundred years-and seeks to und~rstand the social institutions through which this process has occurred. The course directs attention to the diverse implications of modernity in the modern world, to the groups which dominated and were dominated by it, and to the costs and benefits of the process. These matters can be studied most satisfactorily by the historian whose theoretical self\u00ad consciousness and methodological facility have been system\u00ad atically and carefully developed. A three-quarter research seminar is offered every year and is required of all graduate students (including those entering with an M.A. degree). This course offers guidance in the selection of significant research topics, the formulation of coherent statements of historical problems, the carrying out of projects of original research, and the writing of research papers. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986152 History The colloquium, a reading course that examines the chief his\u00ad torical works in a \"time-place\" field, enriches the student's knowledge of the main areas of historical research and devel\u00ad ops critical reading skills. Colloquia are offered yearly in American history and Modern European history, and biannu\u00ad ally in Early Modern European history, Latin American his\u00ad tory, and Ancient history. A student may prepare a disserta\u00ad tion in any of these fields. In addition, independent reading and research courses are provided for advanced, specialized study in tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to develop four fields of competence in preparation for a com\u00ad prehensive examination. These fields are: history and theory; first \"time-place\" field (field in which the dissertation is writ\u00ad ten); second \"time-place\" field; \"focus\" field (such as social, political, intellectual, or international history). The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both objectives, the Department offers intensive consultation with the faculty as well as a lively intellectual atmosphere. Stu\u00ad dents have long shared in the decision-making processes of the Department, which engages the entire historical commu\u00ad nity at Irvine in the collective pursuit of excellence. Students profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program that brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with UCI students and faculty. Master of Arts in History Requirements for Admission. Although it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in History, the Department also welcomes students who have previously specialized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 (B) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommendation, scores from the Graduate Record Examination, and examples of written work in his\u00ad tory from their undergraduate classes. Students living in Southern California must arrange to come to UCI for an interview with the Department Chair or the Coordinator of Graduate Advising. Students are accepted for admission for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is May 1. Program of Study. The M.A. program emphasizes the theo\u00ad retical and historical dimensions of the field in general, and of European, American, or Latin American history in particu\u00ad lar. Each candidate for the M.A. will choose a graduate ad\u00ad visor who will supervise the student's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: three in History and Theory (History 200A-B-C), three in \"time-place\" colloquia (taken in sequence, as a unit), and three in a research seminar. Stu\u00ad dents intending to pursue the Ph.D. should begin at once to delineate doctoral interests in order to fit their work for the M.A. into the total program. Language Requirements. Normally a reading knowledge of one foreign language is required for the M.A. degree. Stu\u00ad dents in American history, with an advisor's permission, may substitute a sequence of courses in communications science, statistics, or comparable studies for the M.A. foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement. Language proficiency can be demon\u00ad strated either by achieving a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS examination or by passing a departmental examination. Comprehensive Examination. At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive examination covering the student's major field (e.g., American, Early Modern Europe) and focusing upon material assigned in the three-quarter \"time-place\" colloquium series. Time Limits. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of graduate study. Doctor of Philosophy in History Requirements for Admission. Continuing students must have satisfactorily passed a departmental evaluation in order to be admitted to the doctoral program. This includes stu\u00ad dents entering with an M.A. from elsewhere who will be evaluated at the end of the first year. New students must undergo a more formal admissions procedure, submitting transcripts, letters (three), papers, and aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. These documents must be supplemented by an interview whenever possible. The potential doctoral student is advised to begin graduate work on this campus, since the doctoral student who has taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in all of the same courses required of all incoming students. Greater experience will work to advantage later, in the second and third years, in speeding the student to examinations. Incoming students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is May L Program of Study. The Department requires doctoral stu\u00ad dents to prepare themselves in four different areas: L History and Theory. 2. The first \"time-place\" field (such as Modern Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the focus of the student's dissertation. 3. The second \"time-place\" field (such as American History), which is designed as a second teaching field. 4. A \"focus\" field (such as social history, etc.), which is designed to enhance the student's capability for dealing with the problems and phenomena of the field, to make compari\u00ad sons, and to introduce the student to the theory and method of relevant related disciplines (e.g., sociology). The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquia series in both time-place fields, and a research seminar sequence. The normal academic load is three courses per quarter. Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental advisor in the same general area of study who will be responsible for approving defined fields, guiding the student to consultant faculty, and supervising the examinations. Language Requirements. All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of one foreign language relevant to the field of graduate study, no later than the end of the second year in the program. Normally, completion of the M.A. foreign language requirement will fulfill this requirement. Proficiency can be established by a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS examination or by passing a department test. Students in American history who have opted for a language substitute in completing the UCI Master's degree will be allowed to submit this work in fulfillment of the alternate skill requirements discussed below, and will not be subject to the time limit in achieving a foreign language competence. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Additional language requirements depend on the subject the student seleCts for the first \"time-place\" field and must be met before the student takes the candidacy qualifying exami\u00ad nations. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in Amer\u00ad ican history may either demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second useful foreign language (by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test designed by the advisor), or complete, as a doctoral student, a sequence of courses in an alternate skill (e.g., communications science, statistics, computer work, content analysis, linguistics) that will be use\u00ad ful in mastering the chosen historical fields. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in a non\u00ad American subject must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second foreign language. This may be done either by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test arranged by the advisor. Qualifying Examinations and Dissertation. After completing the appropriate courses and other preparatory work (nor\u00ad mally seven to nine quarters after entering the graduate pro\u00ad gram at UCI), the student will take written examinations in the History and Theory and two \"time-place\" fields, followed by the oral Qualifying Examination in the \"focus\" field, first \"time-place\" field, and dissertation topic. Upon successful completion of these examinations, the student will be advanced to candidacy and will begin intensive work upon the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort are expected to require from one to two years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation will be held, focusing on the adequacy of the student's research and thesis. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less.

UC IRVINE - 1985-1986156 Humanities/Film Studies Special Programs in the Humanities Undergraduate Major in Humanities The major in Humanities is one of the many options available \u00b7 to a student who wants to select a major in the School of Humanities. As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Linguistics, and other majors in the School. The major in Humanities accommodates students who want to organize their undergraduate education around a humanistic perspec\u00ad tive on a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdisciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature and Politics in Twentieth-Century America; The Problem of Community; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reformation). The student enters the program at the end of the sophomore year and, in consul\u00ad tation with the Humanities Major Committee, devises an individually tailored set of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on the basis of the stu\u00ad dent's own preference. At the end of the senior year the stu\u00ad dent will prepare, under the advisor's supervision, a long paper in the area of the special major. This requirement is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in the Humanities must also meet the regular School, UCI, and University requirements for graduation. (See p. 46 and p. 115.) Inquiries by third-quarter sophomores should be addressed to the academic counselors in the School's Office of Undergraduate Study. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Emphasis in Film Studies Participating Faculty Eric Rentschler, Ph.D. University of Washington Director (German film, history, criticism, and theory) Homer Obed Brown, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University (film theory, American film, popular culture) David Carroll, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University (film history and criticism, French cinema, film and society) Oakley Hall, M.F.A. University of Iowa (fiction writing, film adaptation) Renee Riese Hubert, Ph.D. Columbia University (Surrealist film/ fantastic film, early comedy) Alejandro Morales, Ph.D. Rutgers University (Latin American film) Franco Tonelli, Ph.D. Louisiana State University, (French and Italian cinema, theory, criticism, genre) The Emphasis in Film Studies enables students to deal with films and the cinema in a critical and systematic fashion. The program offers a wide range of approaches to film, spanning the medium's connection to other disciplines and art forms as well as concentrating on film's singular operations as a pro\u00ad ducer of meaning and a reflector of experience. Seeking to situate film within a host of pertinent contexts, the Emphasis in Film Studies likewise looks at film as an object of close analysis, particularly stressing film criticism, history, and theory. While the Emphasis in Film Studies concentrates on the his\u00ad tory and theory of film through a progressive and coherent sequence of classes, it also offers additional courses, such as Humanities SOA-B-C and 117 A-B-C, which acquaint students with the practical and technical aspects of the cinematic medium, the essentials of film production, and scriptwriting. The Emphasis in Film Studies enables Humanities majors to participate in a highly creative and active educational expe\u00ad rience outside of the classroom in regular film series and visits by filmmakers and critics. The School charges a laboratory fee of $15 per course to all students taking Film Studies courses. Students majoring in Humanities with an emphasis in Film Studies may have the opportunity to spend their junior year in France studying at the Inter-University Center for Film and Critical Studies in Paris, through a program sponsored by the University's Education Abroad Program (EAP). Infor\u00ad mation is available in the Film Studies Office and from the EAP Office. Career Opportunities Besides providing students with a solid grounding in human\u00ad istic studies to allow them to pursue a number of educational or business opportunities normally offered by a liberal arts major, an emphasis in Film Studies prepares students: (a) to seek a career at the production or commercial end of the rapidly growing entertainment industry; (b) to go to graduate school in film studies; (c) to continue literary studies con\u00ad nected with film. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: See page 134. Program Requirements: Humanities 50A, 101A-B-C, 110, 112 (two courses), 115, and 199, and four upper-division courses from the following: French 160, Italian 160, German 160, Russian 160, Spanish 160. These courses are cross-listed with Humanities 160. Humanities 197 or 198 can be substituted for one or two of the 160 courses, when the topics relate to film studies. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the Emphasis must be completed successfully at UCI.

(Russian language and methodology, contemporary Soviet prose, Russian culture and civilization, nineteenth- and twentieth-century Russian literature, contemporary guitar poetry, Ukrainian language) The Wome(1's Studies Emphasis of the Humanities major is \u00b7designed to provide for the systematic inquiry into the rela\u00ad tionship of women to culture and society. As an interdiscipli\u00ad nary course of study, the Emphasis in Women's Studies offers an opportunity for reflection upon these relationships from a variety of perspectives and from the broadest point of view. Courses focus on the cultural role of women, women's his\u00ad tory, and women's socioeconomic condition, as all of these have been conceived traditionally and as they are currently undergoing change in the modern world. The value of pursu\u00ad ing this Emphasis at this time will continue to increase as women come more and more to take positions of decision\u00ad making and leadership in determining the future shape and direction of cultural and social life. The Emphasis equips stu\u00ad dents with the proper critical tools for accomplishing the his\u00ad torically unprecedented tasks with which they are faced in contemporary life. Career Opportunities The degree in Humanities with an Emphasis in Women's Studies affords the student several options in diverse career fields in both the public and private sectors: several leading universities have begun to offer graduate training in women's studies; businesses and corporations, as more women join the workforce, are discovering needs for special\u00ad ists in women's studies; and the growth of women's organi\u00ad zations, women's research centers, and women's resource organizations across the country and around the world (including the United Nations) indicate that opportunities for people with backgrounds in women's studies are growing and should continue to grow in the foreseeable future.

Though the Concentration as such can be elected by any student in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology, the courses of the Concentration are open to all UCI students. Participants in the Concentration must complete the equival\u00ad ent of nine courses, beginning in the sophomore year with an introductory series and culminating with the Peace and Con\u00ad flict Forum and its related Seminar, usually taken during the senior year. The student selects the remainder of the courses comprising the Concentration from an approved list of upper-division courses and must organize these choices in consultation with a panel of the participating faculty into a coherent interdisciplinary program complementary to the student's major. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Requirements for the Concentration: Three lower-division courses: History 11 (introduction to Peace and Conflict), Social Science 260 (The Nuclear Arms Race), Physics 16 (Physics of Nuclear Weapons) Five relevant upper-division courses selected from the follow\u00ad ing: History 146B (American Foreign Relations Since World War II), Social Sciences 123G (U.S. Foreign Policy), Social Sci\u00ad ences 1231 (U.S. National Security), Social Sciences 113E (Political Economy of National Defense), Social Sciences 122A-B (Soviet Society and Politics), History 133A-B-C (European International History), Philosophy 182 (Issues in Social Philosophy; 1985-86 topic is morality and nuclear weapons), Humanities 198 (topic in 1985-86 is foundations of nonviolence), Social Ecology 180A-B-C (Social Ecology of Peace), Social Sciences 161Z (Men and War), Social Sciences 115S-T-U (Political Economy of International Relations). A minimum of two quarters of Humanities 180 (same as Social Sciences 123S or Social Ecology E184)-Peace and Con\u00ad flict Forum-totaling two units, taken during the senior year. One quarter of Humanities 181 (same as Social Sciences 123E or Social Ecology E185)-Peace and Conflict Seminar-total\u00ad ing two units, taken during the fall and winter quarters of the senior year. Further information concerning the Concentration in Global Peace and Conflict Studies is available from selected faculty representatives in Social Science Tower 531, Humanities Office Building 300A, or Social Ecology 356. Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies encourages the student to examine religion and religious phenomena in the context of the several disciplines repre\u00ad sented in the Schools of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences. The Concentration, which is available with any major offered by these three Schools, is, for the most part, made up of courses already offered in the undergraduate cur\u00ad riculum; it allows the student to organize these courses, however, into a program complementary to the student's major. It is the objective of the Concentration that participat\u00ad ing students expand their appreciation and understanding of religion in the context of their own major discipline while also developing critical abilities in the area of religious studies in its own right. While the Concentration takes as its subject all religion and religious phenomena and courses are offered in non-Western religious subjects, the academic specialties of the majority of the contributing faculty lie in Western traditions. Students electing the Concentration are required to take eight one-quarter courses from those approved for the Con\u00ad centration. The courses are gathered into three generic cate\u00ad gories: religious theory and comparative religions, canonical literature, and topics in religious studies. Students take two courses from each category as well as two additional courses from among those approved for the Concentration. For further information and a quarterly list of courses available, please contact the Coordinator of the Concentration, 343 Humanities Office Building. 3-2 Program with the Grad1,tate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in man\u00ad agement and who will have completed all of the course requirements (including breadth requirements) for their bachelor's degree by the end of the junior year may apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram.

UC IRVINE - 1985-1986162 Humanities/Critical Theory Ph.D. with Interdisciplinary Emphasis in Humanities The School of Humanities offers no degree called the Ph.D. in Humanities. However, some Ph.D. students in regular programs in the School may elect an interdisciplinary modifi\u00ad cation of their degree with the permission of the departments or programs concerned. Such students will do about 60 per\u00ad cent of their graduate work in a major field a~d about 40 per\u00ad cent in one or more minor fields. At least one of the student's courses will be in the Humanities series 200-230. Those interested in an interdisciplinary degree should contact the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies or the Graduate Ad\u00ad visor in their major department. Emphasis in Critical Theory An Emphasis in Critical Theory, under the supervision of the Committee on Critical Theory, is available for doctoral stu\u00ad dents in all departments of the School of Humanities. Each Ph.D. student in Humanities may, with Committee approval, complete the Emphasis in addition to the degree require\u00ad ments of the student's graduate program. Although there is no change in the existing Ph.D. program requirements or procedures, if the student wishes to have a letter (signed by the Dean and by the Director of Critical Theory) testifying that the student has satisfactorily added this theoretical dimension to the graduate program, then additional require\u00ad ments must be met: these consist of a theoretical section of courses in theory, the qualifying exam, and a theoretical component in the dissertation. Critical theory at Irvine is understood in the broad sense as the study of the shared assumptions, problems, and commitments of the various dis\u00ad courses in the humanities. The faculty regards critical theory not as an adjunct to the study of one of the traditional hu\u00ad manistic disciplines but as a necessary context for the study of any humanistic discipline. In recognition of the \u00b7interdisciplinary nature and goals of crit\u00ad ical theory, the Committee on Critical Theory coordinates the activities of theorists from literary, historical, philosophi\u00ad cal, and linguistic fields of study. The membership includes: David Carroll, Professor, Department of French and Italian; Director, Focused 'Research Program in Critical Theory Peter Colaclides, Professor, Department of Classics Lucia G. Cunningham, Associate Professor, Department of Spanish and Portuguese Alexander Gelley, Associate Professor, Department of Eng\u00ad lish and Comparative Literature Wolfgang Iser, Professor, Department of English and Com\u00ad parative Literature Murray Krieger, University Professor of English, Depart\u00ad ment of English and Comparative Literature David McDonald, Associate Professor, Drama, School of Fine Arts Jane Newman, Assistant Professor, Department of German Mark Poster, Professor, Department of History John Carlos Rowe, Professor, Department of English and \u00b7 Comparative Literature Guy Sircello, Professor, Department of Philosophy David Smith, Professor, Department of Philosophy Juan Villegas, Professor, Department of Spanish and Portuguese Jonathan Wiener, Professor, Department of History Each year at least six graduate courses in critical theory are offered: a three-course sequence designed to introduce stu\u00ad dents to major theoretical issues and their historical settings, from Plato to the mid-twentieth century; and at least three advanced seminars which build on the student's historical competence in order to probe topics of contemporary inter\u00ad est. Additional theory courses are offered by the several departments. The Focused Research Program (FRP) in Critical Theory is an important resource for graduate students in Humanities doc\u00ad toral programs. To acquaint Humanities. graduate students with the most recent developments in the field, the FRP augments its teaching and research resources by inviting vis\u00ad iting theorists for varying periods of residence. The campus library has strong holdings in critical theory, and students also have access to the resources of the recently acquired Rene Wellek Collection of the History of Criticism. The annual Wellek Library Lecture Series provides for an extended dialogue with major contemporary theorists. For further information, please contact the Committee on Critical Theory, School of Humanities, University of Califor\u00ad nia, Irvine, CA 92717, (714) 856-6722. Graduate Courses Graduate courses in Humanities are under the direction of the School's Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. These courses are designed for all graduate students in the School of Humanities, with the exception that students in philosophy may not count Humanities 230 as part of their degree program. Humanities 200, 210, 212, 220, and 230 introduce study in five disciplinary areas, either to students planning a degree in history or one of the literature departments or to those seek\u00ad ing familiarity with disciplines other than their own.

Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Director of the Program and Lecturer in German and Linguistics (second lan\u00ad guage acquisition, language teaching, applied linguistics, German linguistics) Richard Barrutia, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Spanish and Linguistics (applied linguistics, bilingualism, English as a second language) Peter Colaclides, Ph.D. University of Athens, Professor of Classics (history of linguistics, linguistics and poetics, Greek and Latin semantics) Mary Ritchie Key, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Linguistics (historical and comparative linguistics, American Indian lan\u00ad guages, sociolinguistics, nonverbal communication) Tracy D. Terrell, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Spanish and Linguistics (second language acquisition, language teaching, Eng\u00ad lish as a second language, phonology, Spanish linguistics) Owen Thomas, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Profes\u00ad sor of Linguistics, English, and Education (syntax, linguistics and education, computers and education, the teaching of writing, nineteenth-century American literature) Bernard Tranel, Ph.D. University of California, San Diego, Professor of French and Linguistics (phonetics, phonology, French linguistics) (See also the School of Social Sciences for additional faculty in Linguistics.) Linguistics is concerned with descriptions of human lan\u00ad guages, with theories that seek to explain the nature of lan\u00ad guage, and with the various uses of language. Additionally, linguistics has potential relationships with other disciplines concerned with language. The undergraduate major in Linguistics is offered by the School of Humanities and by the School of Social Sciences. The UCI campus programs are administered by an inter\u00ad School Linguistics Committee. Students are able to select a Linguistics major in either School according to their interests.' A Linguistics minor is also offered. There are three ways to major in Linguistics as an under\u00ad graduate. They are designated as Tracks I, II, and III. Track I, General Linguistics, will appeal to students who wish to receive a broad introduction to the major subfields of Lin\u00ad guistics. Track I may be taken either through the School of Humanities or through the School of Social Sciences . Track II, Theoretical and Formal Linguistics, will appeal to stu\u00ad dents interested in areas of the cognitive sciences such as psychology and artificial intelligence. Track II may be taken through either the School of Humanities or the School of Social Sciences. Track III, Applied Linguistics (Language Teaching and English as a Second Language), will appeal to students interested-in language teaching including but not limited to the teaching of English as a second language. Track III is available through the School of Humanities. Students may also major in Classics, French, German, and Spanish with an emphasis in Linguistics. Students are encouraged to consider a double major in Lin\u00ad guistics and either English or a foreign language. This is especially recommended for students following Track III. Students who double major may not satisfy requirements in one major with courses which count for the other major, unless the same course is required for both majors. Careers in Linguistics A major in Linguistics prepares students for a wide variety of careers-in teaching, law, publishing, and public service, among others. Linguistics at UCI is also excellent preparation for graduate work in a number of areas. General Linguistics Linguistics 163 prepares students for advanced work in the field; Theoretical and Formal Linguistics students may continue work in formal linguistics, psychology, or other areas in the~cognitive sci\u00ad ences; and those who concentrate in Applied Linguistics may pursue careers in the teaching of English as a second lan\u00ad guage or in other language teaching.

Each discipline inevitably poses prob\u00ad lems concerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total frame\u00ad work of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as morality and religion, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understand\u00ad ing and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. Careers for the Philosophy Major The study of argument and the precision and clarity of thought and writing required of Philosophy majors are excel\u00ad lent preparation for a variety of career\u00b7s. Many undergradu\u00ad ates trained in philosophy go on to professional schools in medicine, business, or law. The analytical skills developed in philosophy courses seem to be especially useful in legal edu\u00ad cation; indeed, many UCI philosophy graduates have estab\u00ad lished fine records at top law schools. Former philosophy stu\u00ad dents also have used their skills to advantage in careers in government, business, teaching, law enforcement, and com\u00ad puter programming. Many Philosophy majors also continue their education at the graduate level, either in philosophy or a related discipline. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986I 166 Philosophy Undergraduate Program Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possible, therefore, classes are severely limited in size in order to per\u00ad mit sustained dialogues between student and instructor. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to all stu\u00ad dents. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and special disciplines. Among these are courses in the philosophy of science and of art. The staff should be con\u00ad sulted for advice about courses best suited to the specialized needs of particular students. . The program of course offerings is also designed for those majors in philosophy whose intention may be either to enter some professional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-S2. School Requirements: See page I34. Departmental Requirements for the Major Philosophy 30, Philosophy IO and I2 and either 11 or I3; two of the following: Philosophy I40A-B, 14SA-B, or I70A-B; four additional quarter courses from Philosophy IOI-I99. Students planning to go on to graduate school are strongly advised to take Philosophy I30. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor The minor consists of two portions: a lower-division portion and an upper-division portion. Both must be satisfied. Lower division: Three courses selected from Philosophy I, 4, S, 30 or three courses selected from Philosophy IO, 11, I2, I3, 30. Upper division: Four courses in a given subfield of philosophy, some of which have been pre-approved by the Department and are included below: Value theory (ethics, political/social, beauty), and philosophy of science, which includes Philosophy I27, I4SA-B, ISS, IS6, I60, I62, and I86. Metaphysics religion, which includes Philosophy I22, 140A-B, I9S, and I96. Logic and philosophy Philoso\u00ad phy I22, I30A-B, I32, I33, I34, ISO, ISI, and I6S. History of philosophy, which includes Philosophy courses numbered between IOO and 129 and Philosophy I8I. Other four-course sequences may be possible, subject to written permission by the Department. Such a sequence must consist of related courses in a coherent subfield. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Graduate Program Students are encouraged to seek the counsel of any and all members of the Department whose recommendations the student would deem helpful. It is hoped that there will be a close intellectual relationship between graduate students and professors in order to provide the students with optimum conditions for philosophical development and to expedite their progress toward advanced degrees. In addition, the Department sponsors a series of colloquia each year. Partici\u00ad pation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. Every new graduate student is assigned a committee of faculty members whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements fot the advanced degree. The student consults with the committee each quar\u00ad ter about progress and any administrative or academic diffi\u00ad culties. Each student's overall record is evaluated by the Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of March. When the student has satisfied residency, language, logic, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Committee supervises the qualifying examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the subsequent writing of the dissertation itself. The Chair of this committee is the principal person with whom the graduate student will consult on the dissertation. Master of Arts in Philosophy There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy takes one year at a minimum. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in consultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the Logic and Portfolio require\u00ad ments for the Ph.D. (see below). Please refer to the Graduate Studies and Research section for information on the min\u00ad imum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not auto\u00ad matic, but requires formal application to the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and must take place before the beginning of the quarter in which the student expects to receive the degree. Doctor of Philosophy in Philosophy There is no set number of courses required for the Ph.D., thus allowing course work to be tailored to the individual student's needs and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. The Ph.D. program is designed to take four years for the normally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within three years. A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. The following five items are requirements for the Ph,D. degree. Tools of research, to be satisfied bydemonstrating profi\u00ad ciency in a single appropriate foreign language* or by passing with a grade of B or better five to six courses at the graduate level in a discipline or disciplines outside of the Philosophy Department. Approval for the latter alternative will be granted by the Department only if, in its judgment, the courses form an integrated unit in light of the student's research interest. *The foreign language examinations are administered by the Department of Philosophy. They are two hours in length and con\u00ad sist of translating, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from two authors. Students wishing information as to courses to prepare them for these examinations and dates when these examinations will be given should consult the Philosophy Department Office, 500 Humanities Office Building, (714) 856-6525. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Logic Requirement: Students entering the program are expected to be familiar with elementary quantification theory and some natural deduction techniques. If they are not, stu\u00ad dents may take Philosophy 30 (no graduate credit is given for this course). In the Ph.D. program, students must complete with a grade of B or better Philosophy 230A-B and an additional course requiring substantial use of logical or mathematical tech\u00ad niques. Philosophy 230A covers the syntax and semantics of first-order logic with identity, including a proof of the com\u00ad pleteness theorem. The content of Philosophy 2308 varies and covers advanced topics in mathematical logic, including recursion theory and Godel's incompleteness theorem, higher order logic and type theory, and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Courses which satisfy the third-course requirement include courses in mathematical and philosophical logic, mathematics, computer science, and mathematical social science; others may be permitted by the Department on a case-by-case basis. Portfolio of papers representing the student's best work in philosophy. The papers may be, or may be based upon, essays written for course work. Papers will be evaluated by the faculty for the purpose of determining whether or not the student is ready to seek admission to candidacy. Breadth Requirements. Historical Breadth: To be satisfied by receiving a grade of B or better in at least four courses cover\u00ad ing at least three of the following five historical periods: Ancient, Medieval, Modern, Kant and nineteenth-century, and twentieth-century. Field Breadth: To be satisfied by receiving a grade of B or better in one course in metaphysics, one course in epistemology, and two courses in value theory. Both breadth requirements must be satisfied by the end of the seventh quarter of graduate study. Advancement to candidacy and the writing of a thesis. Upon successful completion of the above requirements, the student will apply for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree by filling out the appropriate forms and returning them to the Philosophy Department Office. A Candidacy Committee including one or two members from an academic area outside of Philosophy is then appointed by the Graduate Council. This Committee administers an oral Qualifying Examination to determine whether the student is qualified to begin work designed to lead to the completion of a thesis. Upon passing this oral examination, the student becomes a candidate for the Ph.D. degree. The Doctoral Committee appointed by the Graduate Council supervises the student's further course work and research, as well as the actual writ\u00ad ing of the doctoral thesis. The defense of the thesis. At a suitable point during the development of the thesis, the Doctoral Committee adminis\u00ad ters an oral examination, the focus of which is the content of the thesis itself. If at all possible, this examination will be given while the student is still in residence. Undergraduate Courses 1 Problems of Philosophy (4). An introduction to some basic philo\u00ad sophical problems, concepts, and methods. Varies in content from quarter to quarter. Emphasis on both discussion and writing. (IV) 4 Introduction to Ethics (4). Selected topics from the history of ethics. Problems include the nature of the good life and the moral justification of conduct.

Required of and limited to Teach\u00ad ing Assistants. Program in Russian Guy de Mallac, Ph.D. Cornell University, Director of the Program in Russian and Professor of Russian (modern Russian literature, religious studies, philosophy of nonviolence [Tolstoy's thought, Gandhi's thought], peace studies, Russian. intellectual thought, Pasternak's life and work) Michael A. Green, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Associate Professor of Russian (eighteenth-century Russian thea\u00ad tre, Pushkin, Chekhov, Russian Symbolist theater, Russian liter\u00ad ature and theater of the 1920s, relations between literature and the arts, Russian painting and music) Helen Wei!, M.A. California State University, San Diego, Lecturer in Russian (Russian language and methodology, contemporary Soviet prose, Russian culture and civilization, nineteenth- and twentieth-century Russian literature,. male and female role mod\u00ad els in Russian fiction, contemporary guitar poetry, Ukrainian language) Russian is a language spoken by 215 million people in the Soviet Union and ranks with English and Chinese as one of the three major world languages. Russian is a language of the Indo-European family and is thus related to English, French, and German. Russian is an infinitely rich language, as is Eng\u00ad lish, and adapts itself well to a variety of styles and genres from lyric poetry to the seeming harshness and brashness of the futurist poets. For the\u00b7first two years, the Program in Russian emphasizes a combination of speaking, writing, and reading skills. At the end of the senior year, the student can expect to have at\u00ad tained a rather high level of proficiency in all language skills-reading, writing, speaking, and understanding. By then students will have read a number of selected literary texts-including a fair portion of the significant master\u00ad works-in the original. They will also have familiarized themselves with some of the historical background of the language and with its relation to other Slavic and European languages. And they will have achieved a reasonable degree of familiarity with the major cultural and social trends in Russian history and thought. In addition to the regular Russian major with emphasis on language and literature, the Program in Russian offers a modified major with emphasis on linguistics. This major was designed for those students who have no plans to pursue advanced study in Russian literature, while they wish to focus on the study of the structure of Russian viewed within the framework of Slavic and general linguistics. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986170 Russian The Program in Russian also offers a major with an emphasis in Russian civilization, which is geared to the interests of students who do not intend to specialize in Russian language and literature. This emphasis is based upon a multidiscipli\u00ad nary approach (through language, the arts, thought, litera\u00ad ture, history, study of institutions) to the rich variety of a culture that both before the Revolution and during the Soviet period has made an important contribution to man\u00ad kind's cultural heritage. Various specializations and challeng\u00ad ing new career possibilities in today's world are available to students electing this option. Two minors are also offered by the Program. The Russian Language minor is geared to the student who already has a good command of the language and who wishes to streng\u00ad then language skills while acquiring knowledge of Russian literature in the original. Students whose main interests are cultural and historical will find the Russian Area Studies of value. Students planning to major or minor in Russian should con\u00ad tact the Program Office to obtain the most current informa\u00ad tion. Students entering UCI with previous training in Rus\u00ad sian will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Russian will enroll in Russian lB (or lOB), IC (or lOC), 2A (or llA), and 2B (or liB), respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the ap\u00ad proval of the Program Director. Students with high school training in Russian should consult with the Russian staff before enrolling in Russian courses. The Self-Paced Courses: IOA-B-C/UA-B-C During the regular academic year, the Program in Russian offers students a self-paced option in the first and second years of language study. The Self-Paced Courses are designed to accommodate students who cannot attend regular class meetings, or who wish to progress toward language compe\u00ad tence at their own pace (please see IOA-B-C and 11A-B-C). Students interested in enrolling in the Self-Paced Courses should contact H. Weil, Coordinator. UCI Summer Russian Institute and Practicum In planning their programs of study, students should note that certain courses bearing the designation Summer are also offered within the three-week UCI Russian Institute and Practicum (Russian IA-B-C, 199, 220, 290, and The UCI Russian Language Institute is a three-week, total-immersion program in Russian lan\u00ad guage and culture for students of all levels, conducted in Russian and encompassing all of the student's daily activities. The Practicum adjunct of the Institute affords prospective and practicing language teachers an opportunity for intensive language review and participation in established and experi\u00ad mental teaching methods.

Residency Requirement for the Russian Area Studies Minor: Four upper-division courses must be succcessfully completed at UCI. Planning a Program of Study The Program in Russian believes in close consultation with students on academic advising, program planning, and discus\u00ad sion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Russian with an emphasis on literature or on linguistics are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty as early as possible; in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various programs. After indicating an intention to major in Russian, the student is assigned to an academic advisor who will help in the task of selecting courses toward the completion of one of the three options open to students majoring in Russian studies at UCI. Special attention is paid to the unique aspects of the Russian field. In particular, students' attention is alerted to the com\u00ad bined academic and career implications and potentialities of these major options. Career Opportunities The major in Russian may lead to a career with the federal government, in private enterprise, or in education. The U.S. Departments of State, Defense, Health and Human Services, the Information Office, and the Library of Congress all hire people who can speak and write Russian. The United States Information Agency's Voice of America offers oppor\u00ad tunities in research, scriptwriting, editing, translating, and announcing. Because of the importance of Russia in world politics and economics, private businesses and corporations dealing in the international marketplace increasingly employ persons skilled in Russia_n language and knowledgeable about Russian soci\u00ad ety and political institutions. Individuals with degrees in Rus\u00ad sian may find employment in private enterprise as interpre- UC IRVINE - 1985-1986ters and translators in the following areas: library science, communications media, science, and technology. Students who major in Russian may either go on to graduate programs or enter a career in education. Many students have entered teaching at the secondary level, while others, after graduate work in education, seek positions at colleges and universities. Since Russian is second only to English as a world language of science, the study of Russian provides access to a large body of the world's scholarly, scientific, and technical litera\u00ad ture. While the study of Russian language, literature, and civ\u00ad ilization provides training that may lead to careers similar to those described above, the major program is viewed primarily as a valuable component of a liberal education and an instru\u00ad ment for the investigation and appreciation of the modern world.

Students are placed in Spanish courses according to their years of previous study and a placement test. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, students attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and ability to converse on everyday topics as well as to read and write on an elementary plane. In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year course of two quarters stresses composition as opposed to translation. Further, a course in phonetics perfects pronunci\u00ad ation and presents historical and dialect variants of Spanish. The introductory courses in literature, also in the third year, emphasize the analysis and appreciation of complete literary works by genre rather than the study of many short selec\u00ad tions of innumerable authors in an anthology. The courses in Hispanic civilization combine a panoramic overview with a close look at a specific country or topic. Although no major in Portuguese is offered, advanced litera\u00ad ture courses are available. In addition, an undergraduate minor is offered. Students are encouraged to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year. Elected representatives of the undergraduate majors, the graduate students, and the Teaching Assistants participate with full voting rights in Department meetings. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: See page 134. Departmental Requirements for the Major Spanish lOA-B, 11, 101A-B-C; 110A, B, or C. In addition, the student will choose one or more of the following emphases: Literature and Culture: Seven upper-division courses in literature with a minimum of one in Spanish-American litera\u00ad ture. Two\u00b7courses in Hispanic culture and civilization may be substituted if desired. Linguistics: Linguistics 50, 110, 120; Spanish 113 and any three upper-division or graduate Spanish linguistics courses such as 100A-B-C, 186, 200, 201, 204, 205. Bilingualism and English as a Second Language: Spanish 100A (Multiple Subject) or 100B (Single Subject), Spanish 100C (ESL methods); one course in Chicano literature, one course in Chicano culture, Spanish 113, and two upper\u00ad division courses in literature at least one of which must be Latin American literature. (Education 140A-B-C is the same as Spanish 100A-B-C.) UC IRVINE - 1985-1986For students who plan to teach Spanish, the following courses are strongly recommended: Linguistics 50, Linguis\u00ad tics 140 (Second Language Acquisition),. Spanish 113 (Spanish Linguistics). Also, Spanish 200 and Spanish 204 should be taken as seniors or as members of the credential program. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Spanish Minor Seven courses in Spanish, including Spanish lOA and lOB and at least four upper-division courses. Prerequisite: Spanish 2C or equivalent. Residence Requirement: At least four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental requirements for the Portuguese Minor Prerequisite: Portuguese lC or the equivalent. Requirements: Seven upper-division courses: Portuguese 140A-B, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145. (These are offered on a two-year cycle.) Career Opportunities Spanish is particularly useful in international business or trade, community or social service, and in the foreign service. Spanish majors interested in writing may look to publishing, writing, or editing positions. Majoring in Spanish is excellent preparation for graduate and professional study in law, medicine, social welfare, library science, business or public administration, education, interna\u00ad tional relations, journalism, or advanced study in Spanish. An option available to Spanish majors is UCI's 3-2 Program offered by the Graduate School of Management, in which students may earn a Bachelor's degree in Spanish and a Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Management in five years rather than the usual six. Bilingualism and English as a Second Language are very use\u00ad ful preliminary emphases for many of the fields described above. These areas are closely related to the teacher prepara\u00ad tion program offered by the UCI Office of Teacher Education for students interested in the Bilingual/Cross Cultural Emphasis credential. Graduate Program in Spanish and Portuguese Master of Arts in Spanish The candidate is expected to have the equivalent of the UCI undergraduate major. The student takes a minimum of 11 courses, eight of which must be at the graduate level. Two of the 11 courses must be in linguistics. Spanish 239A, Methods of Literary Criticism, is required of all literature majors. A maximum of two courses may be transferred from another university, but a maximum of five may be accepted from another University of California campus. Proficiency (defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C) in a foreign language other than the major language is required. The comprehensive examination, in part written, in part oral, will be based both on a reading list and the courses taken by the students and will also test the students' ability to express themselves correctly in Spanish. No thesis is required. The student may choose an emphasis in literature or linguistics. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than three years of graduate study. Normally only students who are studying for the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate pro\u00ad gram. The comprehensive examination for the M.A. may be accepted as the written portion of the qualifying examination for the Ph.D. Spanish and Portuguese 173 M.A.T. in Spanish This program is specifically directed at meeting the needs of working credentialed teachers, although others may apply. It seeks to provide a group of modern, relevant courses that will enable teachers to keep abreast of recent developments in their field. It is structured so that working teachers can take courses in iate afternoons and evenings. Applicants should have a B.A. in Spanish and should acquire proficiency in a foreign language other than Spanish. The program con\u00ad sists of 10 courses (eight of which must be at the graduate level) as follows: three courses in Hispanic literature; three courses in Hispanic civilization and literature; three courses in Hispanic linguistics; and one course in Recent Trends in Foreign Language Teaching, to be combined with a curricular research project or a thesis. M.A.T. students are counseled by a faculty member in the Department. Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis The bilingual/cross-cultural emphasis is a specialization in addition to the regular teaching credential for high school (Single Subject) or elementary school (Multiple Subject). Undergraduates may plan from the beginning to aim for this emphasis by choosing the track in Bilingualism and English as a Second Language. See page 291. Ph.D. in Spanish The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree with a minor in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature. The program attempts to integrate period and genre studies with work in literary theory, linguistics, and socio-historical studies. A number of courses outside of the Department are required. The Department thereby hopes to aid in the formation of Ph.D. candidates who are not narrow specialists but rather scholars acquainted with the various fields that relate to their discipline. The Department is con\u00ad cerned also with the practical aspects of helping its graduates become good teachers. The secondary field can be Spanish literature, Spanish\u00ad American literature, Chicano studies, Spanish linguistics, literary theory, comparative literature, or a non-Hispanic literature. Language Requirements A reading knowledge of Portuguese and two other languages relevant to the student's area of specialization is required. Advanced study in one of these languages may be offered in lieu of the reading knowledge of the other. The choice of languages requires Department approval. Course Requirements A minimum of 23 courses is required for the Ph.D. as follows: A. Two graduate courses in linguistics, diachronic and syn\u00ad chronic (the students who select Linguistics as a secondary field will substitute two courses in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature); Spanish 239A-B; a course on the socio-historical context of the period of the stu\u00ad dent's specialization; a course in Brazilian or Portuguese literature (preferably related to the student's specializa\u00ad tion); two courses outside of the Department in non-Iberic literatures; two courses in Spanish or Spanish-American literature, whichever is not the major. Ph.D. candidates should take one course in each genre within their area. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986174 Spanish and Portuguese B. Additional courses for the major and the secondary field: 1. Ten courses in the major, including one course on the\u00ad ory of the genre. Those students who major in twentieth-century Spanish-American literature are required to take Spanish 238A-B: Spanish-American Literature in the Colonial Period and in the Nineteenth Century. 2. Three courses in the secondary field. Candidates who have the M.A. degree from another univer\u00ad sity will be interviewed by two professors representing peninsular and Spanish-American literature, in order to eval\u00ad uate their past studies in terms of our doctoral program; it is recommended that the student's graduate advisor direct the doctoral dissertation and that the choice of dissertation and director be made as early as possible. Each incoming graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor who will supervise the student's program and with whom the student should meet at least once each quarter. All graduate students will be formally evaluated at the end of each year by the faculty with whom they have studied. Students pursuing a full-time pro\u00ad gram of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. Teaching Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, all Ph.D. candidates without previous teaching experience are required to teach under supervision and at UCI one course in each of three quarters. All Ph.D. students will student-teach in an upper-division course related to the major. This will count as one of the required courses in the major. Comprehensive Examination The student is admitted to candidacy by passing, by a major\u00ad ity vote, an oral examination administered by a Candidacy Committee appointed by the Graduate Council. The Candi\u00ad dacy Committee is composed of five members, of whom four will be from the Department. The oral examination will be preceded by a written examination as follows: A. The student, in consultation with the Doctoral Commit\u00ad tee, may choose one of the following options: 1. A comprehensive examination including a dissertation project. The student will then take parts 1, 2, and 3 of the examination described below, and will submit a dis\u00ad sertation project. 2. A comprehensive examination including the minor instead of the dissertation project, part 4 of the exami\u00ad nation described below. B. The written comprehensive examination will consist of\u00b7 three parts: 1. A genre in all periods. The studerit will demonstrate knowledge of literary theory and methods of literary criticism. 2. A historical literary period, including all of the genres and the socio-historical context. 3. Textual analysis. A representative text in the student's genre of specialization will be given to the student at the time of the examination. If the genre is poetry, the text may be a complete poem or a section from a larger poem. In the case of the short story, novel, theatre, or essay, a relatively brief organic section will constitute the text. The student's analysis should be intrinsic; it should also demonstrate the relationship of the text to the total work as well as to the author's total produc\u00ad tion and the author's position in the literary history of the country or the continent. 4. Dissertation project. During the year preceding the comprehensive exams, the student will write a disserta\u00ad tion project of approximately 40 typewritten (double\u00ad spaced) pages which will be turned in one month before the comprehensive exams. The topic as well as the dis\u00ad sertation advisor will be chosen by the student. The essay should: a. Define clearly the topic of the dissertation and jus\u00ad tify it by discussing its significance. b. Discuss previous studies on this topic and prove the originality of the new study. c. Describe and justify the critical method to be followed. d. Include a bibliography of special, general, and theo- retical works. Dissertation A dissertation topic will be chosen by the candidate and nor\u00ad mally, but not necessarily, will fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. Three faculty members appointed by the Graduate Council will constitute the Doctoral Committee which supervises the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises a final examination, the focus of which is the content of the dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will not be given after the dissertation is completed, but rather at an appropriate point during its development. Such final examination normally will be given while the graduate student is in residence at UCI. The Doc\u00ad toral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signatures of the individual Com\u00ad mittee members on the title page.

UC IRVINE - 1985-1986176 Physical Sciences School of Physical Sciences Myron Bander Dean The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional training and general education in the Departments of Chem\u00ad istry, Mathematics, and Physics. The faculty, active in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of students ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activities and accomplishments of physical scientists to those seeking a comprehensive under\u00ad standing that will prepare them for creative research in phys\u00ad ical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interdepen\u00ad dent but separate intellectual disciplines. This development is reflected in the departmental structure of the School of Phys\u00ad ical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disci\u00ad plines have moved into domains of abstraction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concom\u00ad itant increase in understanding of the physical universe pro\u00ad vides the major challenge to the student of the physical sci\u00ad ences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technology that dominates contem\u00ad porary civilization, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. In recognition of the contribution students can make to the academic affairs of the School, a variety of responsibilities on School and departmental committees is given to undergradu\u00ad ate and graduate students. Degrees Honors Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candidates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approxi\u00ad mately 1 percent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research and cumulative grade point average. The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have dis-\u00b7 tinguished themselves by their work in their major subject. A gt;>neral criterion is that students must have completed at reast 72 units in residence at a University of California ~am pus. Undergraduate Programs Each department offers courses that are of value to non\u00ad majors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in business or industry, of students planning advanced pro\u00ad fessional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Introductory courses in chem\u00ad istry, mathematics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and are also appropriate for students in other disciplines who seek a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences. In addi\u00ad tion, a number of courses within the School have few or no prerequisites and are directed particularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. Planning a Program of Study Every undergraduate student who has chosen to major in Physical Sciences is assigned a faculty advisor. The name of this advisor is communicated to the student prior to enroll\u00ad ment or may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean or of the appropriate Department Chair. Students are free to change academic advisors at any time. Each depart\u00ad ment also has a Chief Academic Advisor who is responsible for interpreting degree requirements and dealing with special advising problems. An academic advising and counseling staff is also employed in the Associate Dean's Office and is avail\u00ad able to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In con\u00ad sultation with the advisor the student should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, the student may often concentrate very heavily in a second department within the School or in some other school. Occasionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-division work in each major. A student interested in any of the physical sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these prerequisite courses. Furthermore, students interested in either physics or chemistry will usually include work in both of these subjects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a work\u00ad ing knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of their University studies. This can be done by taking Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science IA or lB. Career Opportunities The majority of UCI Physical Sciences graduates continue their education beyond the Bachelor's degree level. Many pursue advanced academic degrees in preparation for careers in scientific or medical research, engineering, or postsecon\u00ad dary education. Some students enter professional school in areas such as medicine, dentistry, law, or business adminis\u00ad tration. Students who choose not to continue their studies beyond the baccalaureate level most frequently find employ\u00ad ment in private business or industry. In addition to technical areas directly related to their major fields of study, students often enter careers in less obviously related fields such as computing, systems analysis, engineering, journalism, mar\u00ad keting, or sales. 3-2 Program Physical Sciences majors who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for further information. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements In addition to the courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI breadth requirement, students with a major in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional approved three-course group chosen from one of the follow\u00ad ing breadth categories: Category III (Social and Behavioral Sciences); Category IV (Humanistic Inquiry); or the Language and Linguistics section of Category V.

The curriculum of the Department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry 1A-B-C (or the two\u00ad quarter course Chemistry 61A-B) is prerequisite to all study in the Department at more advanced levels. The subject mat\u00ad ter of this course serves also as a thorough introduction to the varied aspects of modern .chemistry for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond this introductory level. Chemistry 51A-B-C is a one-year sequence in organic chemistry which is required for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain more advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of particular inter\u00ad est to the latter groups, among others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department emphasizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research under. the direction of a faculty member. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Rus\u00ad sian, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and many graduate schools require the demonstration of such competence as a prerequi\u00ad site for an advanced degree. Chemistry majors are encour\u00ad aged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are urged to consult with their ad\u00ad visors and with the Office of Teacher Education early in their undergraduate careers. Chemistry majors who plan subse\u00ad quent study in medical, dental, or other professional schools should request information concerning admission require\u00ad ments directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with their academic advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: See page 176. Departmental Requirements Basic Requirements: Mathematics 2A-B-C, Physics 5A-B-C and 5LA-LB-LC, Chemistry 131A-B-C or 130A\u00ad B-C, Chemistry 151. Electives: Four courses chosen from the elective list below. These must include at least two co~rses offered by the Chemistry Department (Chemistry 180 may be counted no more than once, and Chemistry 192, 194, 196, and 199 may not be counted) and at least one of the laboratory courses in the following laboratory course group: Chemistry 152, Chemistry 153, Chemistry 160, Chemistry 165, Chemistry 170, Physics 150, Physics 151, Physics 152, Physics 153. Elective List: Chemistry 125, 135 and all Chemistry courses numbered 152-235, Bio. Sci. 106 (Biochemistry), Bio. Sci. 107 (Molecular Biology), Physics 111A-B (Classical Mechanics), Physics 112A-B (Electromagnetic Theory), Physics 113A-B-C (Quantum Physics), Physics 115 (Statistical Physics), Physics 116 (Thermodynamics), Physics 132 (Nuclear Physics), Phys\u00ad ics 133 (Condensed Matter Physjcs), Physics 134 (Modern Optics), Physics 150 (Electronics for Scientists), Physics 151 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 152 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 153 (Advanced Laboratory). Scientific Breadth Requirements: A total of six additional four-or five-unit courses chosen from the offerings of the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Information and Computer Science, and the School of Biological Sciences. (These may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Planning a Program of Study The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of latitude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue interests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemical physics on the other. Many of the basic require\u00ad ments above coincide with those of the School of Biological Sciences, and a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sci\u00ad ences does not require much extra course work. The Depart\u00ad ment is accredited by the American Chemical Society to offer an undergraduate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. While it is not necessary, it is desirable for stu\u00ad dents to pursue a course of study that the American Chemi\u00ad cal Society judges to merit a certified degree. A certified degree specifically requires that the following courses be included in the program of study: Mathematics 3 (any two quarters); Chemistry 152 and 153; Chemistry 160, 165, 170, or 180. Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemis\u00ad try 1A-B-C and 1LB-LC, Mathematics 2A-B-C, and required writing courses during the freshman year. The sophomore year should include Chemistry 51A-B-C and 51LA-LB-LC; the Physics 5A-B-C and 5LA-LB-LC sequences should be completed no later than the fall quarter of the junior year. The balance of the freshman and sophomore program can be chosen at the student's discretion with consideration given to progress toward completion of the School of Physical Sci\u00ad ences breadth requirement, the UCI breadth requirement, and the Chemistry Department scientific breadth require\u00ad ment. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in the year sequence of physical chemistry (Chemistry 131A-B\u00ad C or 130A-B-C) and in Chemistry 107 (fall) and 151 (winter). During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Depart\u00ad ment electives requirement should be fulfilled, as should other University, School, and departmental requirements. There is no foreign language requirement, but Chemistry majors are urged to obtain reading competence in a foreign language through course work. Outlines of several typical programs of study for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Society-certified Chemistry majors, and Chemistry-Biological Sciences or Chemistry\u00ad Physics double majors have been prepared. Students are urged to obtain copies of the sample programs from their academic advisors, from the Chemistry Department Office, or from the Physical Sciences Associate Dean's Office. Graduate Program The Department offers graduate programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry. The Ph.D. degree is granted in recognition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories of modern chemistry and an ability to carry out independent chemical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertati9n. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an approved program of grad{Jate course work (Plan II). A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the Ph.D. program. Upon entering the graduate programs all students are required to take a series of Area Examinations which test the students' competence in the general areas of chemistry, e.g., organic, physical, inorganic, at the undergraduate level. The Area Examinations are designed to ensure a proper funda\u00ad mental level of preparation for graduate study and are used as a guide in choosing the appropriate program of course work for each entering student. Chemistry 179 Students in the Ph.D. program are expected to demonstrate their knowledge of chemistry at the advanced level through satisfactory completion of a series of Cumulative Examina\u00ad tions. These examinations are designed to encourage the independent study of chemistry through reading of the clas\u00ad sic and current chemical literature and attendance at advanced seminars and colloquia. Normally, beginning with the second year of graduate study, students must take the monthly examinations until four have been passed. This requirement must be satisfied within 12 consecutive Cumula\u00ad tive Examinations. Following completion of the Cumulative Examination require\u00ad ment, participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral exami\u00ad nation for formal Advancement to Candidacy. This examina\u00ad tion normally comes in a student's third graduate year and consists of an oral defense before a faculty committee of the student's dissertation research project and a second original research proposition conceived, developed, and documented by the student. The committee may examine the student at this time on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit of chemical research. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses, including six graduate-level courses in chemistry. The M.S. Plan II (Course Work) program requires that the student complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses. Graduate stu\u00ad dents are expected to maintain a grade point average of B or better to remain in good academic standing. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate pro\u00ad gram, and all graduate degree candidates are expected to par\u00ad ticipate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate career. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the doctoral dissertation, which must describe the results of orig\u00ad inal research performed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member of the Department. The criterion for acceptability of the dissertation is that its contents be of a quality suitable for publication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph.D. candidate is expected to pre\u00ad sent the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, following which the candi\u00ad date will be examined in public on the contents of the disser\u00ad tation by a committee of the faculty. A Master's thesis pre\u00ad sented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.S. under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's orig\u00ad inal research performed under the direction of a faculty member. However, no public oral defense of the Master's thesis is required. Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in residence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. Some faculty from the Department of Chemistry are mem\u00ad bers of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemis\u00ad try group. The program provides an opportunity for interac\u00ad tion among graduate students and faculty from a number of UCI departments who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together to discuss research problems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdisciplinary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide for\u00ad mal instruction in areas encompassed bybiophysics and bio\u00ad physical chemistry.

Its activity is reflected in undergraduate and graduate courses which are responsive to new developments at the research frontier and the ever-changing requirements of government, industry, and education. The Department of Mathematics offers undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to fashion a thorough and soundly based pro\u00ad gram of study leading to professional competence in mathematical research, or in an area of application. The \u00b7curriculum in mathematics includes opportunities for supervised individual study and research, and is augmented by seminars and colloquia. It is designed to be compatible with curricular structures at other collegiate institutions in California in order to enable students transferring to UCI to continue their programs of mathematics study. The Depart\u00ad ment maintains an LSI-11-based minicomputer and a number of programmable calculators that are available for student and faculty use and that supplement the campus Computing Facility. Undergraduate Program Undergraduate mathematics courses are of several kinds: courses preparatory to advanced work in mathematics, the exact sciences, and engineering; courses for students of the social and biological sciences; and courses for liberal arts stu\u00ad dents and those planning to enter the teaching field. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: See page 176. Departmental Requirements Mathematics Major: I. Mathematics 2A-B-C or H2A-B-C 3A-B-C 120, 121A-B, and 140A-B-C. 2. Computing skills attained through either Information and Computer Science 1B or Engineering E10. 3.

A three-course sequence in a single foreign language selected from the list given for Category V of the breadth requirement, with the exception that a first-level sequence is acceptable (e.g., German 1A-B-C or R1A-B-C). French, Ger-man, or Russian is recommended. (This will also satisfy the School's additional breadth requirement.) 6. Each Mathematics major must select an area of specializa\u00ad tion and complete additional requirements in it. The three specializations are in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and mathematical statistics. The requirements for each are given below: A. Mathematics Major with Specialization in Pure Mathematics Nine upper-division or graduate-level courses selected Mathematics Major with Specialization in Applied Mathematics Six upper-division courses selected from the used in place of Mathematics 143A-B-C and Engineer\u00ad ing EE 181A-B-C may be used in place of Mathematics 17IA-B-C. Three mutually related upper-division one-quarter courses in some field of application. These courses must be approved by the Mathematics Department. C. Mathematics Major with Specialization in Mathematical Statistics Mathematics 129A-B-C and 129LA-LB-LC and Mathe\u00ad matics 131A-B-C. Three mutually related upper-division one-quarter courses in some field of application. These courses must be approved by the MathematicsOepartment. The above requirements for the major are new and apply to students who will be at the freshman level during the 1985- 86 academic year. Students who will be sophomores, juniors, or seniors during the 1985-86 academic year are held to the requirements in effect prior to the 1985-86 academic year. Specific information is available from the Undergraduate Advisor in the Department of Mathematics. Program Requirements for the Minor The student must select one of three areas of specialization and complete the requirements in that area. The specializa\u00ad tions and their corresponding requirements follow: A. Mathematics Minor with Specialization in Mathematical Statistics Mathematics 129A-B-C and 129LA-LB-LC and Mathe\u00ad matics 131A-B-C.

Planning a Program of Study There is a variety of career patterns the Irvine Mathematics major may select. In many instances, a double major (in Mathematics and an appropriate related field) provides the strongest preparation for the career desired. A sample program is presented for each specialization. These programs are recommended only for the well-prepared stu\u00ad dent who intends to pursue graduate work in Mathematics or some related area. For many students the pace reflected by UC IRVINE - 1985-1986186 Mathematics these sample programs will be too intense; such students will want to shift electives from the senior year to an earlier year and to take certain Mathematics courses later than indicated in the sample programs. The programs include all courses needed to satisfy the requirements for the Mathematics major, and they also include a few nonrequired courses (such as Mathematics 201A-B-C). Assistance in planning a program of study is available from faculty advisors and from the Undergraduate Advisor in the Mathematics Department .

UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Graduate Program Graduate courses are designed to meet the needs of students doing graduate work in mathematics and in those disciplines that require graduate-level mathematics for their study. Among the fields covered are analysis, algebra, functional analysis, geometry and topology, probability and statistics, ordinary and partial differential equations, and mathematical logic. In addition to formal courses, there are seminars for advanced study toward the Ph.D. in various fields of mathe\u00ad matics. Topics will vary from year to year. Each seminar is conducted by a staff member specializing in the subject studied. Enrollment will be subject to the approval of the instructor in charge. Master of Science in Mathematics The Master's program serves a dual purpose. For some stu\u00ad dents it will be a terminal program of mathematics education; for others it will lead to study and research at the doctoral level. To earn the Master of Science degree, the student must satisfy course, language, and residency requirements, and pass a comprehensive examination administered by the Graduate Studies Committee of the Department. There are three areas of concentration: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Applied Mathematical Statistics. Each concentration requires the satisfactory completion of 12 upper-division or graduate courses; this includes a core of nine courses (36 units), in each of which the student must earn a grade of B (3.0) or better, and three elective courses (9 to 12 units). At least eight of these courses must be at the graduate level (200-series courses). The specific requirements are described below. A grade point average of at least B (3.0) is required for all courses applicable to the M.S. degree. The student's selection of alternative or elective courses must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The nine required core courses for the Pure Mathematics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A-B-C, and Mathematics 230A-B-C. The student must complete three additional approved courses, one of which must be an appropriate course offered by a department other than Mathematics. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A or 230A, Statistics (Mathematics 131A-B-C or 201A-B\u00ad C) or Differential Equations (Mathematics 142A-B-C or 295A-B-C), plus two additional graduate courses in Mathe\u00ad matics. The student must complete three additional approved courses, including two appropriate courses offered by a department other than Mathematics. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematical Statistics concentration are Mathematics 201A-B-C and 20ILA-LB-LC, Mathematics 202 and 202L, Mathematics 204A-B and 204LA-LB, and three additional approved gradu\u00ad ate courses in Mathematics or an appropriate applied area. The student also must complete Mathematics 129A-B-C ana 129LA-LB-LC. Ordinarily, the final examinations in the courses listed below will comprise the comprehensive examination for the Mas\u00ad ter's degree. Pure Mathematics: Mathematics 2IOC, Mathematics Applied 295C. Mathematics 187 Applied Mathematical Statistics: Mathematics 20IC, Mathematics 202, and Mathematics 204B. The student must satisfy the language requirement for the Master's degree by demonstrating reading proficiency in French, German, or Russian; or by demonstrating program\u00ad ming proficiency in one higher level programming language. The residency requirement for the Master's degree ordinarily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters imme\u00ad diately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appropriate, a leave of absence may be granted between matriculation and the final quarters of study. Ph.D. in Mathematics To be admitted to the doctoral program in Mathematics, an applicant must have completed a Master's degree in Mathe\u00ad matics with distinction. When accepted into the doctoral program, the student em\u00ad barks on a program of formal courses, seminars, and individ\u00ad ual study courses to prepare for the Ph.D. qualifying exami\u00ad nation and dissertation. A candidate for the Ph.D. should have both breadth and depth of knowledge. Breadth is dem\u00ad onstrated by advanced knowledge and competence in algebra and analysis. Depth of knowledge is demonstrated by pro\u00ad found familiarity with a well-defined subject in mathematics, e.g., Banach algebras, group theory, operator theory, probabil\u00ad ity theory, or topology. After an appropriate period of advanced study, the Graduate Studies Committee will invite the student to prepare for the qualifying examination (or recommend that the student withdraw from the program). This decision will be reached after consultation with the student's faculty advisor and a review of \u00b7the instructors' evaluations of the student's per\u00ad formance in courses and seminars. To prepare for the qualify\u00ad ing examination, the student should study, in depth, two top\u00ad ics selected with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. The oral qualifying examination is conducted by a candidacy committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council, including at least one member of the faculty outside of the Mathematics Department. Following a successful examination, the com\u00ad mittee recommends admission of the student to candidacy for the Ph.D. . The Ph.D. in Mathematics requires a demonstration of the ability to read the literature of mathematics in two of these languages: French, German, or Russian; and the ability to program in a higher level programming language. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to partici\u00ad pate in the teaching program of the Department. \u00b7 The candidate must demonstrate independent, creative re\u00ad search in mathematics by writing and defending a disserta\u00ad tion that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathe\u00ad \u00b7matics in the candidate's area of concentration. Following advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council, guides and supervises the candidate's research, study, and writing of the dissertation; conducts an oral defense of the dissertation; and recommends that the Ph.D. be conferred upon approval of the doctoral dissertation.

Wallis, Ph.D. Catholic University of America, ,Professor of Physics (condensed matter theory) \u00b7 Joseph Weber, Ph.D. Catholic University of America, Visiting Profes\u00ad sor of Physics (gravitational physics) (visiting W, S) Physics is that branch of science concerned with the study of natural phenomena at the fundamental level. Physicists study the smallest structure of matter (quarks, nuclei, and atoms); the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and even the origin and fate of the universe. Other disci\u00ad plines such as chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. In the past Physics 191 century applications of phenomena encountered in the field of physics have led to more changes in our lifestyle than have occurred in the previous millenium. These changes have brought us a \"high\" standard of living on one hand, and a threat of societal extinction on the other. The knowledge gained in physical studies has affected our daily life, our view of life, our philosophies, and our religions. A subject of so great and general an influence is not only of interest to the specialist but should be understood in its scope, power, and promise for the future by every educated person. The Department offers courses for students of various inter\u00ad ests, from those in the liberal arts to those in engineering and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in several forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as elementary particles, plasma physics, and condensed matter at both advanced and undergraduate course levels. Instruc\u00ad tion varies in approach from traditional lecture courses to seminars at various levels, to independently constructed pro\u00ad grams, and to experimental computer teaching. The faculty is generally young, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and univer\u00ad sity service to community action; literature, and national pol\u00ad icy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student-faculty interaction. The Department consists of people committed to intellectual activities and is exciting to those who are so inclined. Undergraduate Program Courses in the Physics Department are designed to meet the needs of many kinds of students, from those students with\u00ad out facility in mathematics whose main interests lie in the humanities or the arts to those students with professional goals in science and engineering. In addition to the regular Physics major, a concentration in Applied Physics and a con\u00ad centration in Biomedical Physics are offered. The three lower-division sequences in physics are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summar\u00ad ized in the following table: Physics 3 Intended Audience Premedical students, Biological Sciences Physics 5 Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering majors majors Prerequisites Physics 10-24 Nonscience majors Algebra and trigo- Math 2A (Calculus); None nometry; concurrent Physics 1 is enrollment in Math 2 recommended. Preparation for Advanced Courses Physics SC with All upper-division None permission courses in physics Requirements for Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52 . . School Requirements: See page Departmental with laboratory; Physics lllA-B, 112A\u00ad B, 113A-B, and 115; two quarters of advanced laboratory (Physics 150-153); Mathematics 2A-B-C (or H2A-B-C); Mathematics 3A-B-C; three courses from Physics llOA-B-C, UC IRVINE - 1985-1986192 Physics Mathematics 140A-B-C 142A-B-C, or 144A-B with Physics 110A-B-C particularly recommended; and three additional coherently related four-unit upper-division courses chosen from the Schools of Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, or the Department of Information and Compu\u00ad ter Science. Students should be aware that alternative pro\u00ad grams can be developed to meet their special interests and that graduate courses can be used to satisfy undergraduate requirements. Applied Physics Requirements The requirements of the concentration in Applied Physics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus six courses in engineering approved by the Physics Department. One quarter of the advanced laboratory requirement may be waived with appropriate engineering laboratory work. Biomedical Physics Requirements The requirements of the concentration in Biomedical Physics include the requirements of the Physics degree, except as noted below, plus the following: Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104 with associated laboratories; Chemistry IA-B-C with laboratory; a three or four quarter sequence of courses in a specific area. Suggested sequences are as follows: I. Chemistry SlA-B with laboratory; Biological Sciences 106 and 107 2. Biological Sciences 105 plus two Psychobiology courses 3. Chemistry 130A-B-C 4. Radiological Sciences 200A-B plus one additional Radio\u00ad logical Science course Approval must be obtained from the program coordinator. Sequences other than those above may be acceptable. The requirement for three additional coherently related upper\u00ad division science courses does not apply to students in this concentration. Planning a Program of Study Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical stu\u00ad dents, students majoring in Biological Sciences, and non\u00ad science majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics with strong orientation toward modern physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 10-24. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 with a grade of A orB may, with the consent of the Department, enroll in Physics SC. The premedical physics requirements may be met with Physics 3 or with Physics SA-B-C. Physics I is a preparatory course for the Physics 5 sequence and offers a review of math and problem-solving techniques in the context of introducing physics. Although not required, Physics I is highly recommended for all students who lack strong high school preparation in physics and mathematics. Physics 5 is an intensive five-quarter course for students in physics, chemistry, engineering, and other areas interested in a careful quantitative approach to the subject. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Students expecting to enroll in the entire five-quarter sequence of Physics 5 should enroll in Mathematics 3A concurrently with Physics SC. Students planning to enroll in only three quarters of Physics 5 need not enroll in Mathematics 3A. Biological Sciences majors with facility in calculus should consider Physics 5 as an alternative to Physics 3. Physics courses numbered between 10 and 24 are general education courses intended for nonscience majors. Physics 13A-B is particularly oriented toward students in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. The content and format of Physics 21-24 will vary from year to year. In general, these courses will not include regular laboratory work. Courses numbered 110 and above are for Physics majors and other qualified students. This series of courses in the upper\u00ad division curriculum is sufficiently broad to provide programs both for the Physics major who does not intend to pursue the study of physics beyond the Bachelor's degree level and for the Physics major preparing for a professional career in phys\u00ad ics. The Physics major with a career goal in medicine, law, teaching, or business, for example, should emphasize the Physics 130 series, which covers most of the important phenomena of physics. Any major who is so inclined can take more than the minimum two quarters of advanced laboratory work. Able students may begin the Physics 111 series in their sophomore year. Courses numbered between 110 and 116 emphasize the mathematical and theoretical structures that have unified our understanding of nature. Those numbered between 130 and 149 emphasize particular domains of the structure of matter. Laboratory work is assigned to separate courses, 150-154. Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual consultation with a member of the Physics faculty before deciding on a program of courses. Since many graduate physics departments require a reading knowledge of one foreign language, Physics majors planning graduate work should, if possible, study some Russian, Ger\u00ad man, or French. Introductory courses in biology and chemis\u00ad try are also recommended options. Every Physics major should avoid overspecialization and wisely use undergraduate years to explore some areas remote from physics. Physics majors with interests other than graduate work in physics or astronomy need not take as many physics courses as indicated above. Note also that alternatives to Physics major requirements can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. As a guide to preparing a suitable program, the Department makes the following suggestions: Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate school in engineering should complete the Applied Physics requirements: The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in chemistry, biology, or various interdisciplinary areas should contain: Chemistry IA-B-C and SIA-B-C and Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104. The concentration in Biomedical Physics is offered for Phys\u00ad ics majors who wish to follow an integrated program which combines biology and/or chemistry with physics, and is suit\u00ad able preparation for a graduate career in one of these inter\u00ad disciplinary areas. The course program of Physics majors considering a teaching career in the public schools or the community colleges should contain: Education 173 and 174, and additional preparation in some other area of science or mathematics. Courses from the Phys\u00ad ics 10-24 sequence may be appropriate. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in the history of science should contain at least: History 29A-B-C. Courses from the Physics 10-24 sequence may be appropriate. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Physics 193 Sample Programs -Physics A typical course program for Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate study in physics or astronomy is shown below.

Program Planning -Biomedical Physics The Biomedical Physics concentration is designed for the stu\u00ad dent who anticipates a career in physics applied to biology and medicine, such as health physics or radiological physics, or who intends to work in a scholarly field which deals with the physical aspects of biology or medicine, such as molecular biology or physiology. Completion of requirements for the Physics major is required, except as noted in the Biomedical Physics requirements, as are six quarters of basic courses in biology and chemistry (see table). A sequence of three or four integrated additional courses which must be approved by the program coordinator com\u00ad pletes the program. Students who wish to follow the Biomed\u00ad ical Physics concentration are advised to seek guidance early in their college careers. The requirements are such that coor\u00ad dination of a program in the first and second years is essential. Graduate Program The Department offers the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in Physics, the first in recognition of demonstrated knowledge of the basic facts and theories of physics, the second primar\u00ad ily in recognition of demonstrated capacity for independent research. A typical course program for Physics majors in the Biomedical Physics concentration differs from the Physics major pro\u00ad gram in the sophomore, junior, and senior years.

Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regular colloquia and informal seminars. The graduate stu\u00ad dent is a member of an intellectual community and is expected to participate fully in departmental activities. Attendance at colloquia is considered an essential part of graduate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in condensed matter, high energy, and plasma physics. About 60 graduate students of physics were \u00b7enrolled in 1984-85. Active programs of research are underway in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, low temperature physics, plasma physics, mathematical physics, and astrophysics. Sources of support available to graduate students include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Students planning to pursue graduate work in physics should obtain a copy of the booklet Physical Sciences from the Department. Master of Science in Physics The requirements for the M.S. degree are: (1) at least three quarters of residence; and (2) mastery of graduate course material, which may be demonstrated either (a) by passing, with a grade of B or better, a minimum of nine quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 213A-B, 214A, and 215A-B, and a written comprehensive examination; or (b) by passing the Ph.D. qualifying examina\u00ad tion. Under special circumstances, a research project and the\u00ad sis may be accepted in lieu of a written comprehensive exam\u00ad ination. There is no foreign language requirement for the M.S. degree. In addition to the stated course requirements, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying exami\u00ad nation must register continuously for Physics 264A-B-C (Seminar in Conceptual Physics). A typical program in preparation for the written examination for the M.S. degree would consist of 12 courses: 211 (Classical Mechanics) 212A-B (Mathematical Physics) 213A-B (Electromagnetic Theory) 214A-B (Statistical Physics) 215A-B (Quantum Mechanics) Three electives chosen from Physics 212C, 214C, 215C, 216-219, or undergraduate upper-division courses in related areas. Doctor of Philosophy in Physics The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a min\u00ad imum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and a two-part oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a dissertation reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candidate must complete cer\u00ad tain graduate course requirements. There is no foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Course Requirements. The student is required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences, Mathematical Physics, Classi\u00ad cal Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics. A minimum of 15 quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 212A-B, 213A-B, 214A-B, and 215A-B, must be passed with a grade of B or better. In addition, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualify\u00ad ing examination are required to register for Physics 264A-B\u00ad C. It is expected that students, having selected a research specialty, will ordinarily take the core course in that subject (237 A-B-C, 238A-B-C, or 239A-B-C) early in their graduate career. Qualifying Examination. For advancement to Ph.D. candi\u00ad dacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consisting of a written part and two oral parts. The written part covers a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels. The first part of the oral examination will be administered shortly after the written examination. All members of the first oral committee will be faculty from the Physics Department. The second part of the oral examination will be taken approximately one year after successful completion of the written examination and the first oral. The candidacy committee that administers the second oral examination will contain one or two faculty members from outside the Physics Department. The second oral will cover principally material related to the broad and general features of the student's dissertation area. The writ\u00ad ten portion of the qualifying examination will be given once per year, generally in the fall. The examination may be taken by some students after one year of graduate study. A second attempt will be permitted if the first is not successful. A third attempt will be permitted only in extraordinary circumstances. Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the graduate program, and all graduate students are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate careers. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of orig\u00ad inal research performed by the student under the supervision of a doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council will be required for the Ph.D. degree. The criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication in a scientific journal. The disserta\u00ad tion must not have been submitted to any other institution prior to its submission to the Physics Department at UCI. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the disserta\u00ad tion, the student will take an oral examination, open to the public, before the doctoral committee. Suggested Course Sequence. Typical programs for the first two years designed to prepare the student for Ph.D. qualifi\u00ad cation and provide the foundation necessary for understand\u00ad iQg and participating in modern research might include: (Relativistic Quantum Mechanics). In the second year of graduate study, the student may begin to take courses that will provide a broad background for the dissertation area.

Wiener, Ph.D. Harvard University, Associa/e Professor of Hislory and Social Sciences John I. Yellott, Jr., Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Psychology Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of Social Sciences at UCI represents a commitment to modern social science. The classic subject matter areas of anthropol\u00ad ogy, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, psy\u00ad chology, and sociology are included in the School's educa\u00ad tional programs, but these programs go well beyond the traditional disciplines and can be characterized by the follow\u00ad ing three-way emphasis: First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behavior. Developments in computer science and in mathe\u00ad matics oriented toward the problems of the social sciences, and the refinement of techniques for the observational, experimental, and statistical study of human behavior, have contributed major new elements to social science. Students in the School of Social Sciences will become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools underlying modern social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional dis\u00ad ciplinary boundaries. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross orthodox boundaries are political sociology, pub\u00ad lic policy, cognitive anthropology, comparative culture, semi\u00ad otics, and psycholinguistics. Therefore many courses and course modules are built around social science phenomena rather than representing social science disciplines. Third, the School shares the academic philosophy that con\u00ad siders the design of hypotheses and of systems of interrelated ideas about the possible structure of the world to be an essential part of scientific pursuit. Consequently, the educa\u00ad tional programs place substantial emphasis on understanding social science phenomena through the development of the\u00ad ories that can be used to guide empirical studies. Opportunities for students in the School of Social Sciences to participate in the educational process extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with interested faculty members; they are invited to participate in the quarterly eval\u00ad uation of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifications in existing programs, to nominate candidates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School committees. The School provides a variety of oppor\u00ad tunities for faculty-student interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. Careers in Social Sciences Graduates of the School of Social Sciences find many and diverse career opportunities. Social Sciences graduates have been in demand for jobs in government, primary and secon\u00ad dary teaching, and human services, as well as for careers in business. Many Social Sciences graduates have gone on to further studies, some at the doctoral level in preparation for careers in research and university teaching, others in the pro\u00ad fessions of law and medicine, in education, and in business administration. Because all Social Sciences degrees involve an educational program that is interdisciplinary and that emphasizes quan\u00ad titative methods of data analysis, gradt:'ates of the School are well prepared for research and analysis positions in all levels of government and in private firms. Their firm grounding in contemporary social science methods and their familiarity with a broad spectrum of social scientific thinking gives them a solid basis for the pursuit of further training in graduate and professional programs. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Special Facilities The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facili\u00ad ties for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Laboratory occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sci\u00ad ences Laboratory Building. The facility contains 40 experi\u00ad ment and control rooms situated around a central core where two PDP 11-44 computers are available for experimental research. The laboratory is used for both faculty and student research. The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in children and how they learn. Each quarter under\u00ad graduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educational materials, and for observing and analyzing child behavior at the school. The Anthropology Laboratory provides research facilities which include computer terminals for statistical studies and for the analysis of texts and other verbal material. The labor\u00ad atory is also available for undergraduate and graduate instruction in field methodology and in analytical techniques through the use of video-cassettes, films, tapes, computer quizzes, and artificial intelligence programs that simulate interviewing situations. The School also maintains a Video Laboratory where social science students and faculty can produce and edit video-tapes for various purposes. The facility currently contains a tape library of use in the study of conversation and interaction. Visiting Distinguished Professorships The School of Social Sciences sponsors a program of Visiting Distinguished Professorships designed to provide students with exposure to seminal thinkers in the social sciences. The professorships normally are of a quarter's duration. During 1984-85 participants included Philip Converse, Robert C. Angell Professor of Political Sciences and Sociology (Univer\u00ad sity of Michigan), President of the American Political Science Association, and member of the National Academy of Sci\u00ad ences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Beatrice Whiting, Professor of Anthropology and Education Emeritus, Graduate School of Education (Harvard Univer\u00ad sity), and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; John Whiting, Professor of Social Anthropology (Harvard University) and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and James Coleman, University Profes\u00ad sor of Sociology (University of Chicago) and member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

NOTE: Psychology majors are strongly encouraged to take Biological Sciences 79-SO-S1 in partial satisfaction ofthe natural sciences portion of the breadth requirement (Cate\u00ad gory II). Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that stu\u00ad dents who intend postbaccalaureate work in psychology take Social Sciences 151A-B-C and Social Sciences 152F. Honors Program in Psychology: The honors program in Psy\u00ad chology is open to selected students majoring in Psychology. It provides the opportunity for basic research in some area of psychology under faculty supervision. The program has a limited number of openings and seeks to attract outstanding students who plan to undertake postgraduate education in some field of the psychological sciences. Admission to the program is based on a formal application to the Psychology Honors Committee, normally submitted in the spring quarter of the sophomore year or the fall quarter of the junior year. Applicants should have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in psychol\u00ad ogy courses, although this requirement may be waived in unusual cases. Participants are expected to have taken or to take Biological Sciences SO and S1 (or suitable substitutes), Social Sciences 151A-B-C and Social Sciences\u00b7 152F, and to enroll in the Honors Seminar in Psychology (H1SOA-B-C) each quarter.

Juniors: Junior transfers electing to major in one of the School's degree programs and with good records at other ac\u00ad credited colleges and universities normally will be presumed to have satisfied School requirement B and the University re\u00ad quirements, with the exception of the upper-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category 1). Stu\u00ad dents anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year, how\u00ad ever, should plan their programs so as to anticipate the spe\u00ad cial mathematics requirements of the program (School requirement A). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual variation in background, provided students are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two-year program for jun\u00ad ior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four\u00ad year program, except that students who hilVe not satisfied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in man\u00ad agement and who will have completed all of the course requirements (including breadth requirements) for their bachelor's degree by the end of the junior year may apply to the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in either Bus\u00ad iness Administration (M.B.A.), in Public Administration (M.F.A.), or Business and Public Administration (M.B.P.A.), along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Completion of either the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Program. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's degree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Graduate School of Management section and contact their academic counselor.

Though the Concentration as such can be elected by any student in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology, the courses of the Concentration are open to all UCI students. Participants in the Concentration must complete 'the equival\u00ad ent of nine courses, beginning in the sophomore year with an introductory series and culminating with the Peace and Con\u00ad flict Forum and its related Seminar, usually taken during the senior year. The student selects the remainder of the courses comprising the Concentration from an approved list of upper-division courses and must organize these choices in consultation with a panel of the participating faculty into a coherent interdisciplinary program complementary to the student's major. Requirements for the Concentration: Three lower-division courses: History 11 (Introduction to Peace and Conflict), Social Science 260 (The Nuclear Arms Race), Physics 16 (Physics of Nuclear Weapons) Five relevant upper-division courses selected from the follow\u00ad ing: History 146B (U.S. Foreign Relations Since World Wat II), Social Sciences 123G (U.S. Foreign Polic\"y), Social Sciences 123I (U.S. National Security), Social Sciences 113E (Political Economy of National Defense), Social Sciences 122A-B (Soviet Society and Politics), History 133A-B-C (European International History: 1870-1985), Philosophy 182 (Issues in Social Philosophy; 1985-86 topic is morality and nuclear weapons), Humanities 198 (topic in 1985-86 is foundations of nonviolence), Social Ecology 190A-B-C (Social Ecology of Peace), Social Sciences 161Z (Men and War), Social Sciences 115S-T-U (Political Economy of International Relations). A minimum of two quarters of Humanities 180 (same as Social Sciences 123S or Social Ecology E184)-Peace and Con\u00ad flict Forum-totaling two units, taken during the senior year. One quarter of Humanities 181 (same as Social Sciences 123E or Social Ecology E185)-Peace and Conflict Seminar-total\u00ad ing two units, taken during the fall and winter quarters of the senior year. Further information concerning the Concentration in Global Peace and Conflict Studies is available from selected faculty representatives in Social Science Tower 531, Humanities Office Building 300A, or Social Ecology 356. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986206 Social Sciences Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies encourages the student to examine religion and religious phenomena in the context of the several disciplines repre\u00ad sented in the Schools of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences. The Concentration, which is available with any major offered by these three Schools, is, for the most part, made up of courses already offered in the undergraduate cur\u00ad riculum; it allows the student to organize these courses, however, into a program complementary to the student's major. It is the objective of the Concentration that participat\u00ad ing students expand their appreciation and understanding of religion in the context of their own major discipline while also developing critical abilities in the area of religious studies in its own right. While the Concentration takes as its subject all religion and religious phenomena and courses are offered in non-Western religious subjects, the academic specialties of the majority of the contributing faculty lie in Western traditions. Students electing the Concentration are required to take eight one-quarter courses from those approved for the Con\u00ad centration. The courses are gathered into three generic cate\u00ad gories: religious theory and comparative religions, canonical literature, and topics in religious studies. Students take two courses from each category as well as two additional courses from among those approved for the Concentration. For further information and a quarterly list of courses available, please contact the Coordinator of the Concentration, 343 Humanities Office Building. Anthropology and Linguistics Historically there have been close ties between anthropology and linguistics. In the past, many linguists were originally trained as anthropologists, and many anthropologists have focused their research on aspects of linguistic structure. Lin\u00ad guists who work on unfamiliar languages benefit from train\u00ad ing in anthropological field methods and elicitation techniques. Recommended courses for those majors in Anthropology who have a special interest in language, and for majors in Linguistics with a special interest in anthropology, are the fol\u00ad lowing: Social Sciences 3 (or Linguistics 50), 135D-E, 131N, 141A, 141F, 157B, Linguistics 110 and 133. For the linguis\u00ad tically oriented Anthropology major, the basic courses in lin\u00ad guistic structures (syntax, phonology, and semantics) are essential, while the Anthropology courses in collection and analysis of data are essential to the Linguistics major with an interest in field work. To complete a major in Anthropology or Linguistics, both School and major requirements must be completed. Planning a Program of Study Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with their assigned faculty advisors or visit the Undergraduate Advising Office (122 Social Science Tower) to design an appropriate program of study. Students who elect one of the Social Sciences majors in their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics se\u00ad quences listed under Part A of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental concepts that will be widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the student might complete the course on computing, three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in the social sciences, \u00b7and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Teaching Credentials Students planning to seek State of California teaching cre\u00ad dentials in social science should discuss their undergraduate curriculum plans with the School's academic counselors. Stu\u00ad dents completing any of the B.A. programs in the School qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Credential Exami\u00ad nation in social science. For additional information about teaching credentials, see the Teacher Education section. Mathematics and Social Science The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modern social science. The concepts and terms of mathemat\u00ad ics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocabulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an understanding of current literature in the social sciences, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of social science models. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addi\u00ad tion, for students who are preparing for g!'aduate school in an area of social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodol\u00ad ogy. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, however, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should consult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work. Graduate Programs Graduate education within the School of Social Sciences is administered by faculty groups in Cognitive Sciences, Com\u00ad parative Culture, Economics and Public Policy, Mathematical Social Sciences, Politics and Society, and Social Relations (including graduate anthropology). Doctoral students may be admitted to one of six established concentrations: Cognitive Sciences, leading to the Ph.D. in Psychology; Comparative Culture, leading to the Ph.D. in Comparative Culture; Eco\u00ad nomics, leading to the Ph.D. in Economics; Social Networks, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science; Politics and Society, leading to the Ph.D. in Political Science; and Social Relations, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science. When the interests of the student lie outside of or across the areas encompassed by UC IRVINE - 1985-1986the recognized groups, the Associate Dean of Graduate Stu\u00ad dies, School of Social Sciences, may appoint a faculty commit\u00ad tee of at least three members to guide an independent course of study leading to the Ph.D. degree in Economics, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science. Although the School does not offer other programs leading to a Master of Arts degree, the M.A. degree in Comparative Culture or Social Science may be conferred upon doctoral st4dents who satisfy the requirements of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Admissions Potential graduate students should apply to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research for.admission to the graduate program of the School of Social Sciences, indicating the title of the degree which they intend to pursue (Ph.D. in Compar\u00ad ative Culture, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science), and the academic area in which they expect to concentrate. In addition to the Division admission require\u00ad ments, each group may prescribe special requirements or expectations of applicants. All applicants are required to submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination General Test. Letters of recommendation are an important factor in the admission decision. Financial Support Limited financial support in the form of teaching assistant\u00ad ships and fellowships is available to qualified students. There may be research assistantships available under grants to indi\u00ad vidual faculty. Students are expected to seek such aid as they are eligible for from sources external to the University. General Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree in Economics, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science The general requirements for the Ph.D. in Economics, Politi\u00ad cal Science, Psychology, or Social Science (in addition to those which apply to all UCI graduate students) are summarized below. Each recognized group within the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences may describe additional requirements, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council. Length of Study The faculty envisages a student's Ph.D. program to be of ap\u00ad proximately four to five years' duration. Residence Because the intellectual training the School proposes requires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students. Language A knowledge of one foreign language, appropriate to the stu\u00ad dent's research concerns, is required. Each student's group or candidacy committee will prescribe specific requirements. For those proposing to engage in field research, this may involve interviewing capabilities. Quantitative Methods Candidates for the Ph.D. degrees in Economics, Social Science, Political Science, or Psychology must satisfy a quan\u00ad titative methods requirement. This may be met by (1} satis\u00ad faction of the quantitative methods requirement of the stu\u00ad dent's group, or (2) completion of two years of college-level mathematics, statistics, logic, or applications of statistics to social science research problems, in courses approved by the student's group or committee. In the latter option, courses may include one computer science course; ordinarily at least one year of these quantitative methods courses will be taken during the student's graduate career. Social Sciences 207 Examinations The scope and format of the qualifying examinations will be determined by the student's candidacy committee. These examinations may be written or oral, or both, and usually will be conducted after approximately two years of residence. Also, a student may be required to take additional examina\u00ad tions, submit research papers, or conduct experiments which the committee deems appropriate to the student's interests and goals. Upon satisfactory completion of the qualifying examinations, and approval of the dissertation topic, the can\u00ad didacy committee will recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation Following advancement to candidacy, the dissertation is supervised by a doctoral committee ordinarily consisting of three members of the candidacy committee. The purpose of the dissertation is to demonstrate the student's ability to orig\u00ad inate significant research problems, to investigate such prob\u00ad lems both broadly and deeply, and to write scholarly material of publishable quality.

Matthei: Language Development, Psycholinguistics, Child Development Louis Narens: Measurement and Logic W.C. Watt: Semiotics Kenneth Wexler: Theoretical Psycholinguistics John I. Yellott, Jr.: Mathematical Models and Visual Perception The Cognitive Sciences group is made up of certain faculty of the School of Social Sciences and of graduate students who are pursuing the Ph.D. in Psychology, all of whom share common research interests in human cognition. The Cognitive Sciences group is concerned with how the human mind works. It conducts research and provides advanced graduate training in cognitive psychology and theo\u00ad retical linguistics. The group lays special stress on precise scientific approaches to issues in human cognition. It views the formation of formal models as instrumental in under\u00ad standing the nature of the human mind. The group takes as its intellectual domain the following: mathematical psychology, perception (visual and auditory), cognitive development, problem solving, artificial intelligence, learning, memory, psycholinguistics, semiotics, and theoreti\u00ad cal linguistics. It does not emphasize traditional training in psychology or linguistics per se; rather, it stresses the inte\u00ad gration of research in the areas mentioned above, and in related areas, into a discipline whose central focus is the study of human knowledge and human information process\u00ad ing, regardless of the medium in which it is expressed. Admissions In addition to meeting the general requirements for admis\u00ad sion, applicants should have acquired a background in mathematics equivalent to at least one year of calculus. Advanced courses in some of the following fields are con\u00ad sidered highly desirable: computer science, mathematics and the physical sciences, biology, logic, and linguistics. Each admission application will be considered on its own merits. Requirements Each student is expected to take two three-course graduate sequences. The first is a three-quarter methods sequence covering the areas of probability and statistics, experimental design, and mathematical models of language (Social Sciences 241A-B-C). The other is a proseminar sequence covering areas such as learning, memory, perception, and linguistics (Social Sciences 242A-B-C). Suitable substitutes may be made with written approval of the group. Additional advanced course work in other fields relevant to the student's interests will supplement the required courses. Students are expected to enroll in the Cognitive Sciences Research Seminar (Social Sciences 240A-B-C) during all quarters in residence prior to advancement to candidacy. Each student is expected to carry out theoretical/empirical research during the first two years. By the end of the second year, each student should have completed a research project of a scope and nature that would be potentially publishable in a relevant journal. The student's advisor is responsible for assisting in the planning and other facets of the project. Stu\u00ad dents are expected to write a paper based on their research and to present a talk to the \"Cognitive Sciences Seminar\" or another appropriate forum by the end of the spring quarter of their second full year in the graduate program. Reviews At the end of each academic year the faculty in the group will meet to discuss the progress of each of its students and to provide feedback on the progress and perceived deficiencies of each student. The advancement-to-candidacy examination will consist of an oral examination and, at the faculty's option, a written exam\u00ad ination as well. Normally this step will be completed by the end of the third or beginning of the fourth year of the pro\u00ad gram. The examination will be based on the student's disser\u00ad tation proposal. A student who fails the examination twice will be asked to withdraw. Prior to submission of the final version of the dissertation the student will be expected to defend the dissertation in a public colloquium. Comparative Culture Group Dickson D.

White: Anthropology, Social Networks and Relations, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Mathematical Models of Social Constraints, Decision-Making Networks and Social Processes Joseph L. White: Black Psychology, Community Mental Health, Child Development, and Psychotherapy The doctoral program in Comparative Culture emphasizes study centering on the cultures of the United States, includ\u00ad ing dominant and minority cultures and their antecedents. The program is designed to meet the following objectives: to educate interdisciplinary intellectuals-research scholars and teachers-in ethnic studies; to study the range of cultures found in America on a comparative basis; to provide the resources in literature, religion, myth, and the arts that will enable students to become expert analysts of these expressive forms in history and social science and that will enable other students to become expert analysts of culture from the per\u00ad spective of social inquiry. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Admission Requirements and standards for admission into the program are in keeping with those of the University of California as a whole. Students with a B.A. degree will be considered for admission on the basis of past academic performance and present academic interests. In addition to 'the general applica\u00ad tion material, Graduate Record Examination General Test scores are .required. Applicants who are admitted to the pro\u00ad gram begin their study in the fall quarter of the academic year. The deadline for applications is February I. Residence Although the University residence requirement for the Ph.D. is a minimum of six quarters, doctoral students in Compara\u00ad tive Culture must complete three years of course work (108 units). Normally, three courses (12 units) will be completed per quarter. Required and Elective Courses The program requires 21 courses (84 units for the doctorate). Courses are selected in consultation with the academic ad\u00ad visor, to prepare the student for the comprehensive first-year examination, the qualifying examination, and the develop- \u00b7 ment of a dissertation topic. The Proseminar in Expressive Forms (Social Science 2 70A-BJ and the Proseminar in Social Inquiry (Social Science 2 7 3A-B) are required of all first-year graduate students. In addition each student must enroll in five approved electives. Electives may be taken in Comparative Culture or other areas pertinent to the program. During the second year, a course sequence in Nondominant American Classes and Cultures (Social Science 274A-B) is required of all doctoral students. For students emphasizing Social Inquiry, Cross-Cultural Comparisons, a methodological sequence (Social Science 275A-B-C) is also required while Expressive Forms students must complete a methodologies sequence (Social Science 276A-B-C) or approved alternative courses. Each second-year student must enroll in four approved electives totaling 16 additional units. During the third year, all doctoral students must enroll in three approved electives (12 units). All graduate students, including Teaching Assistants and Associates, are expected to enroll for a minimum of 12 units of academic credit (ordinarily, three courses) each quarter. Any student who wishes to take more than four courses (16 units) must petition the Graduate Committee and gain the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Incomplete grades will not be assigned for year-long courses except under extenuating circumstances. Credit for Previous Academic Work Students entering with an M.A. degree may request credit for a maximum of nine courses (36 units). These courses might be accepted in lieu of electives. A written petition requesting acceptance of previous work in lieu of electives should be made to the Graduate Committee after consulta\u00ad tion with the academic advisor. Approval of the School's Associate Dean of Graduate Studies is required. Language Requirements One foreign language and one \"alternate skill\" are required. The language will be decided upon by the student in consul\u00ad tation with the advisor. The language requirement must be satisfied either through a standard ETS examination or by another method approved by the Graduate Committee. The \"alternate skill\" may be another language, or a sequence of two courses in statistics, linguistics, or computer science, or Social Sciences 209 some acceptable skill, necessary for research, from the arts. Both the language and the alternate skill must be satisfied before the qualifying examination can be taken. Comprehensive First-Year Examination Prior to the commencement of class work for the fall quarter, second-year doctoral students are administered a comprehen\u00ad sive examination which covers the materials from the two proseminars offered during the first year, including reading lists provided in those seminars. An ad hoc examination committee appointed by the Chair reads the examinations. It is possible for students who fail this examination to take it a second time. A second failure results in academic disqualifica\u00ad tion and no degree will be awarded. A student who passes the first or second examination may be awarded the M.A. degree. On the basis of students' performance in courses and on the comprehensive examination, the program faculty will decide which students to invite to continue studies toward the Ph.D. degree. Master of Arts Degree Those doctoral students who pass the first-year comprehen\u00ad sive examination but do not continue beyond that point, or those who have passed the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination, may be awarded the Master of Arts degree by (a) completing 36 units (nine courses), 24 units (six courses) of which must be in Comparative Culture and 12 units (three courses) of which are approved electives in Comparative Culture or a related area; and (b) demonstrating proficiency in a second language or an alternate skill. The Ph.D. Qualifying Examination A Ph.D. Qualifying Examination is scheduled after the com\u00ad pletion of course work and language requirements and is based upon the program courses and electives taken by the student during the second and third years. A faculty commit\u00ad tee (normally the student's advisory committee) appointed in \u00b7the name of the Graduate Council is responsible for conduct\u00ad ing the qualifying examination. This committee normally consists of five members of the UCI Academic Senate or per\u00ad sons with equivalent qualifications, and will include at least one member who does not hold a faculty appointment in Comparative Culture. The committee recommends advance\u00ad ment to candidacy for the Ph.D. if the candidate successfully completes the qualifying examination. Students who fail the qualifying examination may, upon peti\u00ad tion, take it a second time. Two failures result in academic disqualification. The Dissertation The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is completion of a dissertation which is approved by the doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council.

Lilien: Macroeconomics, Labor Economics and Applied Econometrics Julius Margolis: Economic Analysis of Government Behavior: Posi\u00ad tive and Normative Kenneth Small: Urban Economics, Econometrics, Transportation Economics Carole Uhlaner: Comparative Political Participation, Formal Models of Political Behavior The Economics and Public Policy group, drawing upon the School's strong quantitative tradition, specializes in econo\u00ad metric techniques applied to government behavior, labor eco\u00ad nomics, transportation economics, and urban economics. Admission is limited to students whose interests mesh closely with those of the faculty. By requiring a high degree of over\u00ad lap between faculty and student research interests, the pro\u00ad gram offers extensive faculty contact within a tutorial framework. Motivated and well-qualified students find the UCI graduate program in economics highly attractive because of its great flexibility. Self-discipline and an inquiring mind are prerequisites. Requirements All students must show competence in microeconomic the\u00ad ory, macroeconomics, and econometrics. Normally this is done by taking a three-course sequence in each of these areas. Students also must master two fields of applied eco\u00ad nomics by taking a two-course sequence (possibly including independent reading courses) and writing a research paper in each. Students also must enroll for at least four quarters in the graduate colloquium, in which attendance at regular Eco\u00ad nomics faculty research colloquia is supplemented by discus\u00ad sion of the papers presented and additional reading. Students are encouraged to become conversant with areas of current economic research early on in their graduate careers, in order to facilitate a timely transition from meeting course and field requirements to thinking through a dissertation research plan. After meeting the above requirements, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon completion of an oral exami\u00ad nation on a written dissertation proposal. The School of Social Sciences has strengths in formal social analysis which are valuable adjuncts to economic theorizing about the public sector. Faculty members are affiliated with two Organized Research Units, the Institute of Transporta\u00ad tion Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization. Public policy and economics are central issues of both organi\u00ad zations, which provide funding for some graduate students who select public policy or transportation as a specialized field. The existing academic programs in medicine and social ecology also provide intellectual support. Research Facilities UCI is a major research university and has an excellent library with a collection of more than one million volumes, as well as special interlibrary loan arrangements with other UC libraries. The School of Social Sciences provides a computer room, conference rooms, and offices for graduate students. StudeQts have access to several campus computers, in addi\u00ad tion to smaller facilities\u00b7 within the School. Two organized research units-the Institute of Transportation Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization-provide research opportunities and financial support for several graduate stu\u00ad dents with interests in those fields. Students may also partic\u00ad ipate in many individual faculty research projects. Admission Deadlines for application for admission are March I for fall quarter, October IS for winter quarter, and January IS for spring quarter. Late applications for fall admission will be considered until July I on a space-available basis. All appli\u00ad cants must take the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) prior to the application deadlines. Verbal, quantitative, and the Eco\u00ad nomics Subject Test scores are required.

Smith: Urbanization, Comparative/Historical Sociology, Political Sociology, World-System Analysis Christian Werner: Mathematical Social Science Douglas R. White: Anthropology, Social Networks and Relations, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Mathematical Models of Social Constraints, Decision-Making Networks, and Social Processes The group in Mathematical Social Science group offers a graduate concentration in Social Networks. Social Networks embodies parts of the traditional foci associated with sociol\u00ad ogy, anthropology, social psychology, political science, and human geography and draws heavily on new techniques that are being developed in applied discrete combinatorics and in applied statistics. Social Networks is not, however, coincident with any of these disciplines. Rather, it stresses the develop\u00ad ment of a perspective that focuses on the patterns or forms of the structures of relations that link persons or other social actors together into coherent wholes. Thus, Social Networks has abstracted out the sfrucfurnl parts of each of these fields. It is concerned with problems of representing such structures, both statistically and dynami\u00ad cally, and with exploring the implications of structural form for individual and collective behavior. In addition, the net\u00ad works perspective has important applications in the study of international relations, organizational behavior, health and mental health, and human communications research. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Admission The graduate concentration in Social Networks seeks quali\u00ad fied graduate students who are well-trained in either (a) a structural approach in some traditional social science disci\u00ad pline and willing to learn the appropriate mathematical skills to do research in social networks, or (b) mathematics and will\u00ad ing to learn a set of social science orientations and models. Students normally are expected to have a grade point average above 3.0 and scores on the two parts of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test which total more than 1,100. Decisions on admission are strongly influenced by letters of recommendation and the statement of student interest. International students will be evaluated primarily on the basis of letters of recommendation and completed seminar or research papers, but GRE scores are required in all cases. Requirements Students are encouraged to develop their own research foci and specializations within the general social networks per\u00ad spective. All students are expected to become acquainted with the general perspective and to develop a minimum set of formal and methodological skills. A set of core courses has been developed that is aimed at acquainting incoming students with theoretical, mathemati\u00ad cal, and methodological tools for the study of social networks. Selection of other course will be by agreement between the student and their advisor. In addition to relevant courses offered throughout the School, courses specifically tailored for students in Social Networks are offered by the Mathe\u00ad matical Social Science Group faculty cin a regular basis. Reviews and Examinations Students enrolled in the concentration are expected to meet the requirements of UCI and the School as well as those of the concentration. In addition, each student is reviewed three times to ascertain progress. The first review is conducted by Mathematical Social Science Group faculty on the basis of each student's first-year per\u00ad formance. The review results in a faculty-student conference in which a recommendation is made for continuation or withdrawal. The second review concerns the student's qualification for advancement to candidacy and is conducted by a committee consisting of at least three faculty from the Mathematical Social Science Group along with two others from the campus or one from the campus and one from another University of California campus. The examination is designed to assess the likelihood of the student's successfully completing the Ph.D. dissertation and is based on the student's dissertation research proposal as well as on the progress in course work. Students are expected to complete this examination on or before the end of their third year of residence. The third review is a dissertation defense. The defense will be in the form of a public colloquium presentation. The faculty may recommendrevisions, after which the disserta\u00ad tion may be submitted for the doctoral degree in Social Science.

Members are committed to studies involving the appli\u00ad cation of social science theory to the analysis of political and social behavior and structures and to the solution of social issues. The Ph.D. is granted in Political Science. The group places special emphasis on recruiting students who propose to pursue research in the following areas: (a) authority, power, and value allocations relating to public policy, to organization, to participation, and to relationships within and between social and political units; (b) change and structure of cultures and of social and political units; and (c) empirical theory, mathematical models, and quantitative analysis of political phenomena. Faculty are currently conducting research on authority rela\u00ad tions, organizational theory, and bureaucratic behavior; sys\u00ad tems theory; structure; psychology and politics; economic models of political behavior; mass media and society; democracy and participation; public policy; political thought; quantitative political science; foreign policy and international relations; and comparative politics with an emphasis on Europe and Latin America. Two organized research units are affiliated with the group: the Institute of Transportation Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization. Both sponsor theoretical and applied research on social issues. The Focused Research Program in Authority Studies also offers research opportunities for graduate students in political science. Admissions Students are normally expected to have a grade point average above 3.0 and scores on the two parts of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test which total over 1,100. Decisions on admission are strongly influenced by let\u00ad ters of recommendation and the statement of student inter\u00ad est. International students will be evaluated primarily on the basis of letters of recommendation and completed seminar or research papers, but GRE scores are required in all cases. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986I 212 Social Sciences Requirements The following are in addition to the general School and cam\u00ad pus requirements. Each year a core program, focusing on major substantive areas as well as research methods, will be outlined for entering graduate students. Those who have not already taken college mathematics are required to take at least three quarters of approved mathematics or statistics courses. At the completion of the first year, the performance of each student is reviewed and the faculty will indicate whether the student should continue. Attendance in a collo\u00ad quium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. Reviews and Examinations Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. At the completion of the first year a review of performance in the core program will be conducted for each student by the Politics and Society faculty. At that time, an advisory committee of three faculty will be identified to supervise the examinations leading to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. By June I of each year, the approval of the advisory committee must be obtained for the student to be eligible for financial support during the subsequent aca\u00ad demic year. A set of written examinations, normally taken at the end of the second year of study, tests competency in a set of major domains of intellectual inquiry determined by the student and the advisory committee. Upon successful completion of these comprehensive examinations and demonstration of competence in mathematics and a foreign language, a formal candidacy committee is appointed to oversee the final qualify\u00ad ing examination and formal advancement to candidacy. Stu\u00ad dents are expected to advance to candidacy by the ninth quarter of graduate study. After the student advances to candidacy, the doctoral com\u00ad mittee, usually composed of three members of the candidacy committee, supervises work toward completion of the dissertation.

Smith: Urbanization, Comparative/Historical Sociology, Political Sociology, World-System Analysis Douglas R. White: Anthropology, Social Networks and Relations, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Mathematical Models of Social Constraints, Decision-Making Networks and Social Processes The faculty in Social Relations shares with traditional anthro\u00ad pology an interest in whole systems and a willingness to con\u00ad sider long-as well as short-run sociocultural effects. It has a commitment to include the meaning and content of the actions, events, and phenomena it studies, from the micro-to the macro-level. The faculty also is concerned about similari\u00ad ties and differences amongpeople living at different times and in different places. Unlike the main interests of tradi\u00ad tional anthropology, however, those of the Social Relations faculty.are not limited to small communities or to traditional forms of data collection or analysis. In addition, the program leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science with emphasis in anthropology is distinct from more traditional anthropology programs in that it includes no requirements in archaeology or physical anthropology. Admissions The faculty welcomes students from diverse educational and social backgrounds. Students who have research interests corresponding to those of specific faculty members are espe\u00ad cially encouraged to apply to this apprenticeship-type pro\u00ad gram. They should familiarize themselves with the publica\u00ad tions of the faculty before applying. Requirements Students are admitted by the entire Social Relations faculty. Each new student is assigned an advisor who serves until a three-person committee is formed, which occurs by the mid\u00ad dle of the second year of residence. The committee oversees the student's academic work and ordinarily is chaired by the faculty member with whom the student plans to work most closely. A core seminar which meets weekly throughout the year is required of first-year graduate students. Students are expected to attend the Social Relations Colloquium Series throughout their graduate careers. In addition, two quarters of statistics, mathematics, computer science, or other appro\u00ad priate'analytical methods are required. Normally these will be completed during the first two years of study. Reviews During the first year each student will prepare an original paper under the committee's direction. The paper will be presented by the student at a meeting of the Colloquium Ser\u00ad ies, normally during the spring quarter of the first year. The student's committee members will provide the student with a detailed written critique of the paper as part of the first-year evaluation of the student's overall progress. The second review takes the form of an advancement-to\u00ad candidacy examination. This ordinarily is conducted by the student's committee and two additional faculty members from the campus. Students are expected to take this exami\u00ad nation no later than the spring quarter of their third year. Satisfactory completion of the dissertation is the final requirement in completing the Ph.D. Foreign Language A speaking or reading knowledge of one foreign language is required. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Courses in Social Sciences Courses in the School do not invariably resemble conven\u00ad tional university courses either in content or in format. Stu\u00ad dents at any level are encouraged to suggest areas of individ\u00ad ual study and may (with faculty approval) pursue any intel\u00ad lectually challenging area within the social sciences. Such courses may include special seminars, study projects, individ\u00ad ual papers, or any other useful educational activity. The faculty encourages students to present evidence that they have done interesting and original work and to receive offi\u00ad cial credit for that work by enrolling in an individual study course. Such courses are numbered 198 and 199 (undergrad\u00ad uate) and 299 (graduate). Students from other schools are encouraged to take courses and talk with faculty within the School. In addition to the introductory courses, many of the upper-division courses are open to students without previous work in social science. Since many of the courses touch on several areas of social science, a list of major areas of concentration or 'emphases' is often included in the description of a course. The classifica\u00ad tion terms used for this purpose are anthropology, compara\u00ad tive culture, economics, geography, political science, psychol\u00ad ogy, and sociology. Most upper-division courses are arranged in modules in order to provide continuity over individual courses, to facilitate long-range planning by students, and to encourage the pursuit of interdisciplinary programs of study. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the module concept to acquire experience in several integrated sets of courses. It is not necessary, however, for students to take all courses listed in a module; module courses may be taken individually, as long as course prerequisites have been met. Social Sciences 213 The specific courses offered in module form may vary from year to\u00b7year, but the structure of the curriculum will remain stable. Ordinarily, a student can expect to find at least one module offered in each broad area each year. By observing the content area of courses and by making effective use of module sequences, a student can assemble an individual pro\u00ad gram of study in a particular discipline or in an interdiscipli\u00ad nary area. Listed below are course descriptions of some of the proposed courses to be offered during 1985-86. A final listing of the courses offered will be available prior to the beginning of each quarter in 122 Social Science Tower. Students who are interested in obtaining this material may receive copies by visiting or writing to the School of Social Sciences. NOTE: Students who entered UCI before fall quarter, 1985, should refer to the 1984-85 UCI General Catalogue and previous editions for information on the course numbering and lettering sys\u00ad tem prior to fall 1985.

These prob\u00ad lems include predicting the orbit of a satellite, simulating the economy, keeping track of inventories, and sending mail elec\u00ad tronically. Such problems are solved by having the computer execute a procedure-a sequence of information processing operations including, but not limited to, arithmetic opera\u00ad tions, testing and comparing numbers and representations of alphabetic information, and changing the sequence of opera\u00ad tions within the computer. Information and computer science is concerned with the development of procedures which are effective and efficient, languages suitable for stating these procedures, systems for executing procedures, and with the study of the social setting in which procedures are used. The implications of research in informaton and computer sci\u00ad ence extend beyond direct applications of the modern digital computer. Many animate and inanimate systems can be use\u00ad fully viewed as information processing systems and analyzed in terms of the way they represent, store, and process infor\u00ad mation. Thus, information and computer science provides a point of view, an approach, for studying phenomena in many sciences. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Information and Computer Science 235 UC IRVINE - 1985-1986236 Information and Computer Science Computing resources available on the campus include inter\u00ad active access to the systems in the UCI Computing Facility\u00ad a Honeywell DPS8/49C (CP6) and a DEC VAX 11/780 (VMS). Departmental computing resources for instruction include a DEC VAX 11/750 (UNIX), two computer labora\u00ad tories (one with Corona Personal Computers and one with Toshiba TIOO's), two Hewlett-Packard 9836 color graphics work stations, and two HP 9000 systems. Departmental computing resources for research include four DEC VAX 11/750's (UNIX), two Sun work stations, and a number of Integrated Solutions machines. Transfer students are required to have the following: a min\u00ad imum of 56 semester units/84 quarter; two years of transfer\u00ad able college mathematics, including one year of calculus; completion of one year of computer science courses, includ\u00ad ing the equivalent of ICS IA or IB; sufficient transferable credits to satisfy the majority of breadth requirements, and satisfaction of the lower-division writing requirement (one year of college English composition), and a competitive grade point average (since only a limited number of applicants can be accepted into the program). Alternately, fall 1985 lower-division elig.ible transfer students can come to the campus without declaring a major, take the courses necessary to meet the ICS change-of-major require\u00ad ments, and then apply for a change of major. On the basis of our experience over the past several years, we anticipate that the number of incoming freshmen and advanced-standing students who elect ICS as a major in the fall of 1986 will exceed the number of positions available. In the fall of 1985 less than half of the incoming applicants who elected ICS were admitted to the major. To ensure that their application is considered for the fall of 1986, students should be sure to file their application so it arrives on campus before November 30, 1985. The selection criteria will include grades, test scores, and affirmative action considerations. Students interested in using computers as an adjunct to their major field of study may enroll in the introductory pro-\u00b7 gramming sequence (ICS IB, 2, 2L, and 3). Degrees Information and Computer Science ....... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Honors at magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded on the basis of grade point average and the student's performance on research. Approx\u00ad imately 12 percent of the graduating seniors are selected for honors. To be eligible for honors, a general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Careers for the ICS Major Students with undergraduate degrees in Information and Computer Science have been successful in \"finding career opportunities in recent years. Employment is available in computer programming, systems analysis, project control administration, and marketing. A Bachelor's degree in Information and Computer Science can be part of a preparatory program for graduate work in computer science or a related field. Undergraduate Program The undergraduate program in Information and Computer Science (ICS) is designed for students preparing for profes\u00ad sional careers and for students preparing for graduate study in information and computer science. It is designed to acquaint the student with the currently available methods of information and computer science which are useful in solving problems of science, industry, and government; to prepare the student for the additional formal and self-education required in this rapidly developing field; and to foster and extend the student's abilities to solve the kinds of problems en!=ountered in information and computer science. The use of the computer as a problem-solving tool and the effects of its adoption on procedure and data representation are the under\u00ad lying themes of the program. Note: The award of a B.S. degree in ICS requires that stu\u00ad dents complete the course requirements for the degree and that they be enrolled in the ICS major. Although many stu\u00ad dents would like to change their major to the ICS major, there are insufficient spaces to accommodate all such peti\u00ad tions. Students who would like to change their major to ICS must contact the ICS Undergraduate Advisor's Office to dis\u00ad cuss their plans. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are inter\u00ad ested in digital computer programming will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving I (ICS IB) and continue in the programming se\u00ad quence with Programming and Problem Solving II (ICS 2, 2L) and Programming and Problem Solving III (ICS 3) as far as their interests require and their programs permit. Students who are doing, or planning to do, extensive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numer\u00ad ical analysis. Students interested in courses in computer engineering and digital systems should consult the list of Engineering courses. Students can declare a double major in Engineering and ICS; early consultation on such a double major is advisable. Students are advised on academic matters by faculty and staff. Advising of undergraduate students is coordinated by the departmental counselors who also provide information on vocational and counseling services available on the campus. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. Departmental Requirements Information and Computer Science IB, 2, 2L, 3.

This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in either Business Administration (M.B.A.), in Public Adminis\u00ad tration (M.P.A.), or Business and Public Administration (M.B.P.A.), along with the bachlor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Completion of either the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Program. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's degree will be awarded after completion of all the require\u00ad ments for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Graduate School of Management section and contact the GSM counseling office. Graduate Program Ph.D. Program Information and Computer Science 237 The graduate program in Information and Computer Science leads to a Ph.D. degree. The program is research-oriented and encourages students to work together with faculty to solve advanced problems in computer science. Current \u00b7 research activities include analysis of algorithms, artificial intelligence, machine architecture, programming environ\u00ad ments, software engineering, computer-aided instruction, and the study of the interrelation of computing, organiza\u00ad tions, policy, and society. The Department receives substan\u00ad tial extramural funding. The Ph.D. program is designed for full-time study, and can be completed in four to five years, depending upon the focus of research. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986238 Information and Computer Science Admission Applications are evaluated on the basis of the student's prior academic record and potential for creative professional con\u00ad tributions. Applicants are expected to have good skills in com\u00ad puter programming and skills in mathematics equivalent to those obtained by students who complete college-level courses in logic and set theory, analysis, linear algebra, and modern algebra or probability and statistics. Computer sci\u00ad ence undergraduate training is not required, but some famil\u00ad iarity with machine organization, data structures, software systems, and formal models is helpful. Applicants should take both the GRE General Test and the GRE Subject Test in Computer Science. Personal interviews are desirable but not required. Additional information about the graduate program in Information and Computer Science and application forms may be obtained by writing to the Graduate Counselor in the Department. Financial Assistance Financial assistance is available to students in the form of teaching and research assistantships. Stipends vary, depend\u00ad ing on the duties involved, and range up to $7,800 for the academic year. Students who also teach or assist with faculty research during the summer may earn an additional $2,000 to $4,000 per year. More than half of the doctoral students in residence receive financial assistance. General Requirements for the Ph.D. The Ph.D. program has three phases. Phase I. Breadth: The purpose of the breadth phase is to develop the student's understanding of broad areas in com\u00ad puter science. Students must complete Phase I by the. end of their second year. Phase II. Depth: The purpose of the depth phase is to develop research skills and creative problem solving ability. The stu\u00ad dent must select an area of specialization and 1. demonstrate deep understanding of that area by satisfac\u00ad tory performance in two advanced courses and on a written comprehensive examination 2. pass one other advanced course of the student's choice 3. demonstrate research ability by preparing a survey paper and a research paper of publishable or near-publishable quality 4. present a research colloquium 5. receive approval from the faculty to take a Candidacy Oral Examination 6. pass the Candidacy Oral Examination conducted by a for\u00ad mal candidacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. The area of specialization is normally one of the Depart\u00ad ment's five concentrations: architecture and operating sys\u00ad of algorithms and d_ata structures; artificial intelligence; computing, organizations, policy, and society (CORPS). However, an area of specialization other than one of the above concentrations may be chosen with the approval of the graduate advisor. All students in the Ph.D. program are eligible to be awarded an M.S. degree upon completion of all requirements of Phases I and II of the Ph.D. program except for the Candi\u00ad dacy Examination. Phase III. Dissertation: This phase is devoted almost ex\u00ad clusively to the dissertation. When the student has passed the formal qualifying examination and advanced to candidacy, a doctoral committee is appointed to supervise the dissertation and approve it on behalf of the Graduate Council. Teaching Requirement: All ICS doctoral students are re\u00ad quired to participate in teaching activities before being ad\u00ad vanced to candidacy. Teaching activities in summer or night school, service at other universities, etc., may be accepted as fulfillment of the requirement. \u00b7 Programming Competence Requirement: A computer scien\u00ad tist must be able to read and write programs in assembly, algebraic, and nonnumericallanguages.

Harvard University, Professor of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy and Social Sciences (moral development, educational environ\u00ad ments, late adolescent to early adult development) The Program in Social Ecology applies interdisciplinary scien\u00ad tific methods to the study of a wide range of recurring social and environmental problems. Among the issues of longstand\u00ad ing interest to the Program are violence in society, social influences on normal and atypical human development over the life span, and aspects of the physical environment which have an impact on human health and behavior. The faculty of Social Ecology is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists who have specialized in developmental, envi\u00ad ronmental, community, and social environmental health scien\u00ad tists; and lawyers. While faculty members are firmly grounded in these parent disciplines and teach basic courses \u00b7 in them, they concentrate their efforts on teaching and research with a problem orientation. In these problem\u00ad oriented courses, they integrate concepts and perspectives of several disciplines. This focus arises from commitment to the :'iew ~h~t !he analysis of complex societal problems requires mlerdrscrplmary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). Another feature of instruction in Social Ecology is the use of lecturers from the community, individuals whose academic qualifications are complemented by their experiences with practical applica\u00ad tions. For example, a judge, an architect, a counseling psy\u00ad chologist, and a former police officer are among those who teach courses in the Program. A number of social ecologists UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Social Ecology 243 UC IRVINE - 1985-1986I 244 Social Ecology are involved in interventions directed toward improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and communities function; a number of others are involved in interventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment. Research Facilities The new Social Ecology Building opened in spring 1984 and features several facilities for experimental research, including wet laboratories for research and teaching in the environ\u00ad mental health sciences; behavioral assessment laboratories for research in human development, social relations, criminal justice, and legal studies; and health and performance effects of environmental conditions. Specially designed observation laboratories are available for study of parent-child interac\u00ad tion, cooperation among children, sibling rivalry, and hyper\u00ad activity. The Environmental Simulation Laboratory (ESL) permits full-scale, realistic simulations of interior environ\u00ad ments such as offices, classrooms, and apartments. Within these settings, several physical conditions (e.g., ambient light\u00ad ing and color patterns, music and noise, spatial arrangements and physical density) and social processes (e.g., group com\u00ad munication patterns) can be varied experimentally so that researchers can assess the separate and joint effects of the conditions and processes upon occupants' performance and well-being. Degrees Social Ecology .......................... B.A., M.A., Ph.D. Applied Ecology (offered jointly with the School of Biological Sciences) .............. B.A. Honors Honors at graduation will be awarded to about 12 percent of the graduating seniors. Initial eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in resi\u00ad dence at a University of California campus. Final decisions concerning the awards of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude are the responsibility of a committee chaired by the Associate Director for Undergraduate Studies. Honors Program in Social Ecology Upper-division students in Social Ecology have the opportun\u00ad ity to participate in supervised independent work on an empirical study in their chosen area of interest: psychology and social behavior; criminology, criminal justice, and legal studies; or environmental health and planning. This program of study includes the development of a rationale and concep\u00ad tual framework, design of a study, data collection and analy\u00ad sis, and report preparation over the span of three quarters, and culminates in an honors thesis. Students must have a minimum 3.5 grade point average in course work within their area of interest and have the recommendation of a faculty member to participate in the honors program. Career Opportunities Graduates of the Program in Social Ecology bring a distinc\u00ad tive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job market. The Program provides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in planning departments, mental health settings, educational institutions, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training is also useful for careers in management and personnel. The Program also provides sound preparation for students who. wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administration, public health, social welfare, psychology, sociology, criminology, and urban planning. Undergraduate Program in Social Ecology The Social Ecology major offers either a general interdiscipli\u00ad nary degree in Social Ecology or a more focused experience through one of three specializations: Psychology and Social Behavior; Criminology, Criminal Justice, and Legal Studies; and Environmental Health and Planning. The specialization designation will be noted on the student's transcript upon graduation. A minor in Social Ecology is offered for students who wish to be exposed to an interdisciplinary, scientific orientation toward environmental, social, and criminal justice problems while pursuing other disciplines. The Social Ecology faculty believes that an exposure to the components of the Pro\u00ad gram's curriculum is valuable to the educated individual. Pro\u00ad gram components include an integrative theoretical frame\u00ad work, an understanding of the research world, and familiar\u00ad ity with the use of scientific information in problem solving and policy making. Field Study An important characteristic of the undergraduate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is open only to Social Ecology majors. Field Study is designed to pro\u00ad vide students with an opportunity to examine social\u00ad environmental problems as they occur in community set\u00ad tings; to evaluate the merit of ideas presented in \u00b7the class\u00ad ,room; and to conduct naturalistic observations and investiga\u00ad tions. Under the supervision of a Social Ecology faculty sponsor, students are encouraged to evaluate procedures and problem-solving strategies used in the work place and to observe the links between community practices and academic ideas arid issues. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of problem-oriented institutions and agencies, e.g., Orange County Public Defender's Office, Orange County Social Ser\u00ad vices and Health Services Agency, city planning departments, and police departments. Other field study placements may be generated by faculty and students to fit their particular inter\u00ad ests. All field studies are taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis. Further information on field study, including information about sign-up procedures, may be obtained from the Social Ecology Counseling Office. Environmental Health and Planning The Environmental Health and Planning specialization is con\u00ad cerned with the impact of the physical environment on human health and behavior. Students begin with basic courses in human ecology, environmental quality, environ\u00ad mental psychology, urban sociology, and planning and public policy. Subsequent course work moves toward problem\u00ad oriented courses in these areas, enriched by ongoing faculty and student research on such topics as the effects of envi\u00ad ronmental stressors (e.g., crowding, smog, noise); the biology and politics of water pollution; compliance with environmen\u00ad tal regulations; the way in which economic changes in a community affect the health and well-being of its residents; the psychological determinants of the decision to have chil\u00ad dren; the effects of stress on health; and the social effects of urbanization. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986In addition to providing basic knowledge for students in other areas, courses are relevant to professional careers in the areas of administration, environmental quality and health, environmental impact assessment, and community environmental education. Graduate and professional oppor\u00ad tunities related to environmental analysis include urban and regional planning, architecture, environmental psychology, ecology, public health, and urban sociology. Special emphasis is placed upon the roles of individual citizens and community organizations, both governmental and private, in maintaining and enhancing the quality of the human environment. Field study is done in 10 California city planning departments, the \u00b7offices of private architectural firms, environmental informa\u00ad tion centers, pollution control agencies, and health agencies. Specialization in Environmental Health and Planning Following the completion of Social Ecology E8 (Introduction tci Environmental Analysis), students must complete six courses from the following list: SUO Human Stress E111 Survey Analysis of Urban Residents E113 Technology and Public Policy E119 Urban and Regional Analysis E120 Topics in Applied Ecology E121 Topics in Environmental Health E124 Toxic Substances E125 Microbial Ecology of Natural and Polluted Waters E130 Contemporary Urban Issues, Policy, and Theory E132 Urban Sociology E136 Social Ecology of the Borderlands E139 Urbanization and Social Change 145 Introduction to Program Evaluation E149 Life in Space E153 Chronological Dating Techniques in Environmental Reconstruction E158 Community Health: An Epidemiological Approach 5159 The Family E162 Environmental Law E167A History of Water Pollution E171 Dynamics of Human Populations E172 Social Planning E173 Human Ecology E175 Environmental Reconstruction E187 Environmental Psychology E188 Advanced Environmental Psychology E189 Environmental Design Research Methods The following lower-division courses are recommended: Es Introduction to Environmental Quality E7 Planning and Public Policy Psychology and Social Behavior The Psychology and Social Behavior specialization is con\u00ad cerned with human behavior in social contexts. A major objective is to study variations in social environments (e.g., the family, school, workplace) that affect development over the life cycle. Stud-ents begin with basic course work in human development, social psychology, community psychol\u00ad ogy, and abnormal psychology. Subsequent course work examines such topics as psychosocial development in chil\u00ad dren, adolescents, and adults; gerontology; sex differences; attitude change; the evaluation of social programs; psychol\u00ad ogy and the law; the effects of stress on health and psycho\u00ad logical adjustment; counseling and psychotherapy. Opportun\u00ad ities also are available to work with faculty on research in these and other areas. Students are given a foundation which will enable them to work after graduation from UCI in the private or public sec\u00ad tors or to do graduate work in psychology, human develop-Social Ecology 245 ment, social work, counseling, or education. Approximately 50 agencies are available for field study in this specialization, including schools, child care facilities, community clinics, counseling centers, hospital settings, and social service agencies. Specialization in Psychology and Social Behavior Following the completion of 59 (Introduction to Human Behavior), students must complete six upper-division courses, at least three and no more than four of which must be in one of the following groups: Developmental Psychol\u00ad ogy, Social Psychology, Clinical and Community Psychology, Health Psychology, or Psychology and Social Problems.

Basic courses cover forms of criminal behavior and introduce the student to the workings of the American legal system. Subsequent course work is comple\u00ad mented by ongoing faculty and student research on such top\u00ad ics as the determinants of police decisions to shoot; character\u00ad istics o\u00a3 persons of situations which promote Samaritans\" at the scene of crimes; interper\u00ad sonal violence; the control of delinquency through family counseling and crisis intervention; jury decision making; pro\u00ad secutorial decision making; the analysis of court decisions; the deterrence of criminal behavior; white collar and corporate crime; and organized crime and corruption. This specialization provides students with opportunities to examine critical issues in regard to criminal and delinquent behavior and official reactions toward violators. The course of study prepares students for careers in justice system administration, probation and parole, law enforcement, and formal corrections, as well as for law school and other gradu\u00ad ate programs including criminology, criminal justice, legal studies, and sociology. Offerings examine social problems that involve crime and society's reactions to these problems, and assess the organization and operation of the criminal jus\u00ad tice system as it now functions. Field study placements are available in police departments, public defenders' offices, pro\u00ad bation and parole agencies, consumer affairs agencies, the State juvenile detention system, Victim/Witness Assistance \u00b7 programs, the Orange County Legal Services Program, the UCI College Legal Clinic, and in private legal firms. Specialization in Criminology, Criminal Justice, and Legal Studies Following the completion of ]4 (Introduction to Criminal Jus\u00ad tice), students must complete six of the following courses: 5108 Child Abuse and Neglect J114 Organized Crime and American Society 5120 Violence in Society ]132 Juvenile Delinquency J133 Deviance Jl34 Victimless Crime JI38 Victims of Crime Jl40 Prisons, Punishment and Corrections JI41 Seminar in Criminal Justice Jl42 White Collar Crime JI43 Theories of Punishment JI44 Criminal Law Jl45 Government Crime Jl47 Law and Social Change Jl48 Criminological Theory 5161 Family Law El62 Environmental Law JI81 Contemporary Legal Issues Jl82 Legal Sanctions and Social Control Jl90 Psychology and the Law The following courses are especially recommended to stu\u00ad dents who desire exposure to legal reasoning and analysis in order to help decide whether to pursue a career in law, and to students who wish to learn how to \"think like J190. These courses are taught by members of the Social Ecology faculty who are lawyers. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. Social Ecology Major Requirements Lower-Division Requirements Social Ecology 1 (Principles of Social Ecology), 10 (Research Design); J4 (introduction to Criminal Justice); E8 (introduc\u00ad tion to Environmental Analysis); and 59 (Introduction to Human Behavior). Upper-Division Requirements Ten upper-division Social Ecology courses (numbered 100-196), 197 A (Studies in Field Settings); 197 (Field Study), two quarters (eight units) taken during the junior and senior years; students must complete required prerequisite courses prior to field study enrollments; open only to Social Ecology majors. In order to remain in good standing and be eligible for grad\u00ad uation from the Program in Social Ecology, a student must attain the following: a minimum grade point average of 2.0 in all required lower-division Social Ecology courses (10, 1, J4, E8, 59), a minimum grade point average of 2.0 in all required upper-division courses, 10 chosen from courses numbered 100-196, 197A, and eight units of field study. Planning a Program of Study Students who major in Social Ecology, although they may be specializing in a single area of interest, are encouraged to develop an appreciation of a wide array of person\u00ad environment problems. The strongest program of study also includes basic course work in at least one of the social, biolog\u00ad ical, or physical sciences. Students who enter the major as freshmen should plan to complete the required lower-division courses by the end of the junior year. Transfer students and students who declare a major in Social Ecology after entering UCI should work with the Social Ecology Counseling Office to develop a plan for meeting the requirements of the major in an orderly fashion. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986The Social Ecology Counseling Office is prepared to help all students in planning a program of study. Contact with this Office is important so that students will develop a broad, yet coherent, series of courses. Students who expect to pursue graduate study should consult also with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation. Undergraduate Major in Applied Ecology The Program in Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sciences offer a program of undergraduate instruction lead\u00ad ing to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology. The interdisciplinary curriculum furnishes a strong undergraduate foundation for students interested in advanced study in environmental plan\u00ad ning and resource management. An Applied Ecology major receives' the basic science training of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology background contributed by the School of Biological Sciences and a general science back\u00ad ground contributed by the School of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdiscipli\u00ad nary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very structured, leaving the last year open for stu\u00ad dents to specialize in an area of their choice. Careers in Applied Ecology Careers in the fields of environmental and resource man\u00ad agement and planning are particularly suited to an Applied Ecology background. Many graduates hold technical or admin\u00ad istrative positions in, for example, the United States Envi\u00ad ronmental Protection Agency; or in California's Regional Water Quality Control Board, Air Resources Board, Depart\u00ad ment of Fish and Game, and Department of Health and Human Services; or in various county and city agencies. A variety of firms in the private sector employ Applied Ecology graduates to prepare environmental impact reports, labora\u00ad tory analyses, and planning studies. Industrial health profes\u00ad sionals are in demand to help determine the safety or work\u00ad place environments for the labor. force. The Applied Ecology major also provides a strong academic foundation for gradu\u00ad ate or professional study in areas such as conservation and natural resources, environmental health science, microbiol\u00ad ogy, public health, law, planning, and administration. The Applied Ecology major provides students with a compre\u00ad hensive treatment of basic ecological principles and their relevance to human needs. As an alternate pathway, students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in Environmental Engineering offered by the School of Engineering. Also, students are encouraged to explore the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, offered by the School of Biological Sciences. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Applied Ecology University Requirements: See pages 49-52; the Applied Ecol\u00ad ogy degree combines breadth and major requirements. Applied Ecology Requirements The Universify breadth requirements are incorporated within the Applied Ecology curriculum; no additional coursework is required to complete the breadth (general education) require\u00ad ments. All of the Applied Ecology requirements must be Social Ecology 2-47 taken for a grade (except field study).

Graduate Program in Social Ecology The Program in Social Ecology offers graduate education leading to the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Students desiring a Ph.D. should apply directly for the Ph.D. program. Only individuals interested in the M.A. as their final degree in Social Ecology should apply for admis\u00ad sion at the Master's level. The emphasis in Social Ecology graduate study is primarily upon theory and research which have implications for policy and social action. Clinical training is not offered. All applicants for either the M.A. or Ph.D. should submit undergraduate transcripts, three letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination General Test scores, and a formal application before February I. Interested persons may call the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor, Jan Martin (714) 856-5917, for further information. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986The Program in Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in the social and physical envi\u00ad ronment. Problems are researched from the diversified view\u00ad points of a multidisciplinary faculty, including specialists in community, environmental, social, developmental, and health psychology; planning; urban sociology; law; criminology; and environmental health. Graduate education emphasizes this multidisciplinary orientation rather than the focused perspec\u00ad tive of a single discipline. Social Ecology is committed to an empirical approach. Pro\u00ad gram evaluation, legal research, questionnaire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic observation, and quasi\u00ad experimental techniques are emphasized as much as labora\u00ad tory experimentation. A sampling of faculty research and teaching interests includes, but i~ not limited to, human stress, psychosocial aspects of physical and emotional health, program evaluation, economic change and behavioral disorders, atypical child development, effects of employment on adolescent social and cognitive development and adult well-being, police use of deadly force, legal sanctions and deterrence, white collar crime, effects of the physical environment upon social behav\u00ad ior and health, childbearing decisions, effects of social envi\u00ad ronments on early child development, urban decentralization, social support systems among the elderly, water quality, air quality, the use of scientific information in public policy for\u00ad mation, the performance and health impacts of work envi\u00ad ronments, and environmental regulatory processes. A pre\u00ad doctoral and postdoctoral training program, sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health, emphasizing the rela\u00ad tions among environmental demands, human development, and health, commenced in \u00b7fall 1981. Collaborative research with faculty members is an important component of graduate education in Social Ecology. Prospec\u00ad tive graduate students should contact the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor for more detailed information concern\u00ad ing the current research interests of Social Ecology faculty members. M.A. Program Each incoming Master's student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student discusses an individual program of graduate education. The program leading to the M.A. degree requires a thesis and satisfactory completion of seven approved courses (28 units), including the Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), and at least one addi\u00ad tional approved course in statistics or methodology. Other courses should be selected with regard to the student's aca\u00ad demic and career objectives, and must be approved by the faculty advisor. The seven required courses must include at least five graduate courses and must be exclusive of any directed study, independent study, or thesis courses (298, 299, or 295). One four-unit field study (297) course may be counted as one of the seven required courses. A grade of B or better must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee appointed, after a review of their graduate work and thesis plans by a faculty committee. All M.A. ?tudents who have not advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each academic year. At that time the faculty may recommend that the student con\u00ad tinue toward the M.A. or cease study in the Program. Eval\u00ad uation of M.A. students who have advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's Master's thesis committee. One year of academic residence is required, but completion of all M.A. requirements, including a thesis approved by the student's committee, ordinarily takes about two years. Social Ecology 249 The M.A. degree in. Social Ecology may be useful in obtaining a variety of positions. Many recent M.A. graduates are now employed in federal, state, county, city, and private agencies in such areas as planning, mental health and welfare, and probation and parole. A number of students with the Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Social Ecology have entered Ph.D. programs at other universities. Ph.D. Program The doctoral program offers advanced training that prepares students for research and teaching positions. Graduates also may be particularly qualified for positions with private or governmental agencies where they can bring advanced aca\u00ad demic training, insight, and expertise to bear in such areas as environmental quality, environmental design research and urban planning, criminal justice, community health, func\u00ad tional and dysfunctional social development, and program evaluation. Students who enter with the normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinar\u00ad ily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree in five years of study beyond the baccalaureate. Each incoming Ph.D. student will be assigned a faculty advi\u00ad sor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to discuss an individualized program of graduate edu\u00ad cation. Required for all Ph.D. students are: Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), two approved quar\u00ad ters of graduate-level statistics, Program Evaluation (291) or Social Epidemiology (224), and Issues in Social Interventions (213). In addition to these six required core courses, doctoral stu\u00ad dents must also complete a minimum of six other approved graduate level courses before advancement to candidacy. These six additional required courses are exclusive of any field study, directed study, independent study, or dissertation research courses (297, 298, 299, or 296). Students may take each of their electives within a different substantive area or may take clusters of courses within fewer subareas. Among the substantive areas in which multiple electives are offered are: Environmental Sociology (SE202, Several specialized courses on surv~y research, theory development, statistics, and teaching are offered (SE214, SE260, SE261, SE264A-B, SE290A-B). In addition, courses which may be applicable to a student's sub\u00ad area are offered by other academic units on the campus (e.g., Graduate School of Management, School of Social Sciences, School of Biological Sciences). UC IRVINE - 1985-1986250 Social Ecology All Ph.D. students who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the Ph.D., complete the M.A. degree only, or cease graduate studies in the Program. Evaluation of Ph.D. students advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's doctoral dissertation commit\u00ad tee. Prior to the award of the Ph.D., each doctoral student must serve as a Teaching Assistant under faculty supervision for at least two quarters. All Ph.D. students are required to complete a research project before advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The method of research may include experiments, questionnaire and sur\u00ad vey studies, systematic field observation, computer simula\u00ad tion, etc. It is expected that students will begin this project during their first year in residence and that it will be com\u00ad pleted during the second year. The written report of the proj\u00ad ect may be equivalent to a Master's thesis and may be sub\u00ad mitted as such if the student has been advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree. Also, before being officially advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., doctoral students must demonstrate mastery of one or more research areas within Soda) Ecology. Accordingly, stu\u00ad dents are required to submit a written analysis of a social/en\u00ad vironmental problem relevant to one or more disciplines within Social Ecology. The prequalifying requirement can be completed through alternative written formats including a comprehensive examination or the submission of a manu\u00ad script (or series of papers) which intensively examines specific research issues. Preferably, the perspective taken should be interdisciplinary, but a unidisciplinary approach is acceptable if it is more congruent with the student's educational goals and is acceptable to the student's committee. Each student's plans for completing the breadth requirement are developed in collaboration with a committee of three Social Ecology faculty members. Students are encouraged to assemble and meet with this committee as early as possible during their graduate career and are required to do so by no later than the third quarter of their second year. Once the student's plans have been approved and implemented, the examining com\u00ad mittee will meet with the individual to determine his or her success in meeting the breadth requirement, and to recom\u00ad mend additional academic work if it is deemed necessary. A student may be formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. when the student's dissertation plan has been approved by the candidacy committee appointed by the Graduate Dean on behalf of the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examinatiqn. The disserta\u00ad tion plan will include a thorough examination of the history of the problem being proposed for investigation; its current status; the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge; a detailed specification of the proposed method of approach to the problem; and a description of the planned methods for analyzing research findings. Formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. wlll be made by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon recom\u00ad mendation by a unanimous vote of the student's candidacy committee. Alternatively, the committee may recommend a course of action to strengthen the student for advancement to candidacy at a future date. When the student is advanced to candidacy, a doctoral committee will be appointed on behalf of the Graduate Council. The doctoral committee, ordinarily consisting of three members of the faculty, will supervise the preparation and completion of the doctoral dis\u00ad sertation. The dissertation should be completed and accepted within one to two years, and no later than three calendar years after the student's advancement to candidacy.

Sirignano Dean The School of Engineering comprises three Departments: Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering. Each Depart\u00ad ment offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs of study for men and women who will engage in the profes\u00ad sional practice of engineering as it relates to design, develop\u00ad ment, research, other engineering functions, and teaching in industry, government, or a university. Programs at all levels emphasize the fundamentals underlying engineering, thus enabling the graduates to continue professional development through formal or informal study. Thus, the degree pro\u00ad grams in the School of Engineering endeavor to provide UCI graduates with adequate intellectual tools for entrance into the profession and for continued renewal of their technical knowledge. At the undergraduate level, a Bachelor of Science degree pro\u00ad gram in Engineering, with options in Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering, is offered respectively through the Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Departments. Each of these options is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (formerly the Engineers' Coun\u00ad cil for Professional Development). Although in past years an undergraduate combined program of Environmental Engineering has been offered in conjunc\u00ad tion with either the Civil Engineering or the Mechanical Engineering option, effective fall 1985 the School has closed that option to entering students Courses in computer engineering and digital systems are offered within the Electrical Engineering option. Courses in computer science are offered not by the School of Engineer\u00ad ing but rather by the Department of Information and Com\u00ad puter Science (ICS). Students with high achievement can declare a double major in Engineering (with the Electrical Engineering option) and ICS. Early consultation with the School on this and other double-major programs, such as the one with Biological Sciences, is advisable. The undergraduate Engineering curriculum provides a firm background in the basic sciences through courses in physics, mathematics, and chemistry; a fundamental understanding of the engineering sciences through required basic engineering courses; and specialization via technical electives. The breadth requirement must be taken in the areas of Humanistic Inquiry, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Writing. It is not uncommon for engineering students to need more than four years to obtain their B.S. degree, particularly if part\u00ad time employment or major extracurricular activities make heavy demands on their time. Occasionally students can catch up by enrolling in summer sessions at UCI or, with prior permission, at other institutions. Each of the three Departments offers graduate-level options leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering. The M.S. program requires 36 units to be completed; the exact selection of the courses is formulated through consultation between the student and a faculty advisor. Thesis and non\u00ad thesis programs are available. The Ph.D. program is still less structured but more specialized than at the M.S. level. There is no set course requirement; rather, students must demon\u00ad strate various competencies as they progress toward the completion of their doctoral programs. Engineering students may join any of a number of student organizations. Most of these organizations are professionally oriented and in many instances are local chapters of national engineering societies. A primary function of these groups is to provide regular technical and social meetings for students with common interests. Most of them also participate in the annual Engineering Week activities, held each February, and in other School functions. There are student chapters of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Society of Mechani\u00ad cal Engineers (ASME), the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the Mexican-American Engineering Society (MAES), the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and the honorary engi\u00ad neering societies Tau Beta Pi and Eta Kappa Nu. Faculty and committee meetings (except those involving per\u00ad sonnel considerations) are open meetings; in addition to designated student representatives, all students are encour\u00ad aged and expected to participate in the development of School policy. Student evaluation of the quality of instruction is made each quarter. Degrees Engineering ............................ B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Undergraduate honors at graduation in the School of Engi\u00ad neering are awarded on the basis of grade point average, and service to the School, service to the University, service to the community, or achievement in research projects. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Approximately I percent of the graduating class shall be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude, with no more than 12 percent being awarded honors. Additional awards in other categories are made throughout the academic year. Undergraduate Program NOTE: Revisions to the undergraduate Engineering pro\u00ad gram's curricular, course schedule, and degree requirements were in progress when the 1985-86 UCI General Catalogue went to press. The new requirements will apply to students entering fall quarter, 1985. Students must consult the School's Undergraduate Affairs Office for updated details. The undergraduate program leads to a B.S. degree in Engi\u00ad neering, with accredited options in Civil Engineering, Electri\u00ad cal Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering. Admissions Students should plan to enter the Engineering program at UCI as freshmen or as juniors. The sequential nature of the Engineering program and the fact that many courses are offered only once a year also make it imperative that students begin their studies in a fall quarter. Applicants wishing to be admitted for the fall quarter, 1986 must have submitted their completed application forms by November 30, 1985. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Engineering 261 UC IRVINE - 1985-1986262 Engineering High school students wishing to enter the UCI Engineering program are advised to have completed four years of English, four years of mathematics, and one year each of physics and chemistry. That preparation is fundamental to success in the Engine!\"riri.g program and is vital to receiving first considera\u00ad tion for admittance to the Engineering major during periods of restricted enrollments, as are honors courses and advanced placement courses. Special attention will also be given to applicants who have submitted their SAT scores and three Achievement Test Scores by January 2, 1986. All applicants for the School of Engineering must apply for admission to a specific Engineering department. These departments are Civil Engineering (CE), Electrical Engineering (EE), and Mechanical Engineering (ME). If enrollment limitations make it necessary, unaccommodated Engineering applicants will be offered alternative majors at UCI. Or they may choose to be redirected to another Univer\u00ad sity of California campus that can still accommodate fresh\u00ad man applicants in majors other than Engineering. As an option, freshman applicants subject to redirection can ask for admission to the two-year UCR-UCI Joint Engineering Pro\u00ad gram offered by the Physics Department at UC Riverside. Students admitted to this program complete their first two years of study at UCR. They then can apply for a limited number of placesin the UCI School of Engineering at the junior level. A summer session at UCI also is required between the sophomore and junior years. Further informa\u00ad tion is available from the Office of the UCR-UCI Joint Engi\u00ad neering Program, Department of Physics, University of Cali\u00ad fornia, Riverside, California 92521; telephone (714) 787-1012. Transfer students can be admitted to the School of Engineering upon completion of a lower-division program in another major at UCI or at another college, including community col\u00ad leges. Students seeking admission to the School of Engineer\u00ad ing from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University requirements for admission to advanced stand\u00ad ing and must have completed appropriate prerequisites for the junior-level courses to be undertaken in the School. These include courses equivalent to English and Comparative Literature WR39A-B; Mathematics 2A-B-C and 3A-B-D; Engineering 10; Physics 5A-B-C-D-E, Chemistry 61A-B (or Chemistry lA-B-C) (students should review the program-of\u00ad study charts for the Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engi\u00ad neering options to determine what level of physics and chem\u00ad istry courses are required; the typical equivalent at most col\u00ad leges is a three-or four-semester physics sequence plus a two-semester chemistry sequence, each for majors in those fields). Students planning to study electrical engineering at UCI need a course in modern physics that is equivalent to UCI Physics 50. If the student's physics preparation did not include such a course, Physics 50 can, subsequently, be taken at UCI.) Completion of these minimum requirements does not guarantee admission to the UCI Engineering program, because enrollment limitations in various categories of Engi\u00ad neering may dictate selection based on ranking by academic proficiency. For instance, transfer applicants planning to begin their junior year at UCI in the fall of 1985 were required to have grade point averages ranging from near 3.0 to 4.0, depending on whether they asked to be admitted into the Civil, Mechanical, or Electrical Engineering Department, in order of increasing program impaction. Transfer students satisfying .the Statewide Articulation Agreement on Lower-Division Engineering Requirements (California Community Colleges-California State Universi\u00ad ties-University of California) may complete the remaining requirements for the B.S. degree in six quarters at UCI, pro\u00ad vided one or two designated courses are taken in summer session prior to entry. All transfer students should arrange for early consultation with the School's Undergraduate Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office so that a smooth transition can be planned. Recall the earlier note that it is not uncommon for engineering students-even those who have started as fresh\u00ad men at UCI-to spend more than four years to obtain the B.S. degree. Advising Academic advising is available from faculty advisors, aca\u00ad demic counselors, and peer advisors. Freshmen and sopho\u00ad mores will find that most of their questions can be answered by the counselors, who also approve their programs of study, and by the peer advisors in the School's Office of Under\u00ad graduate Student Affairs. All Engineering students must consult at least once every quarter with the academic counse\u00ad lors in the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office. Students also are encouraged to consult with their faculty advisors, especially for career guidance; Mechanical Engineer\u00ad ing students are required to do so. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: Credit for at least ElO, E80, ElOl. See departmental requirements for additional specified core courses and electives. Basic Science Courses: Physics 5A-B-C, Physics 5LA-LB-LC, Chemistry 61A, and Chemistry 61LA. See departmental requirements for additional specified science courses. Breadth Courses: Thirty-six units-approved three-course clusters in (a) Humanistic Inquiry, (b) Social and Behavioral Sciences; and (c) Writing. At least one Writing course, such as Engineering 190, must be taken at the upper-division level. See pages 13-14 for the list of other approved courses. Note that the remaining breadth requirements stated there are sat\u00ad isfied by the courses in Mathematics and Basic Sciences speci\u00ad fied above. Breadth courses must include at least two lower-division courses in writing beyond the Subject A requirement and one upper-division course in writing. Free Electives: Six units in any university-level academic courses. An exception is made with physical education and remedial courses which, while counting as part of a student's quarterly work load, are not applied to the 180 units required for the B.S. degree in Engineering. Duplication of Subject Material: Students who take courses which involve considerable duplication of subject material may not receive full graduation credit for all units thus completed. Residence Requirement: In addition to the University resi\u00ad dence requirement, at least 36 upper-division engineering units specified by each option must be completed successfully at the University of California. Variations: Variations from the degree requirements may be made subject to the approval of the faculty of the School. Students wishing to obtain variances should submit petitions to the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Programs of Study A student who wishes to graduate from one of the accredited Department options-Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engi\u00ad neering-should select the engineering and basic science courses listed in the respective program of study. Additional information on opportunities within each option is available from faculty advisors and academic counselors, who will also advise students on selection of courses. Students must realize, however, that they alone are responsible for the planning of their own programs and for satisfactory completion of the graduation requirements. Students may substitute courses of their choosing for those required if they can substantiate the merits of the program of study and obtain prior approval from faculty of the School. Students are cautioned about the structure of prerequisites which underlies most Engineering courses. The sample pro\u00ad grams shown in each departmental description constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. Students must complete all of the required lower-division courses in the freshman and sophomore years in order to qualify for enrollment in any upper-division Engineering course. Qualified undergraduate students who have high academic standing, who have completed the necessary prerequisites, and who have obtained permission from the School's Under\u00ad graduate Study Committee may take certain graduate-level courses. Students are required to complete Engineering 10 during the freshman year and WR30A-B-C during the first two years. Thereafter, proficiency in computing (using FOR\u00ad TRAN) and writing is expected in all Engineering courses, whether explicitly stated so as a prerequisite or not. Students in the School of Engineering, in accordance with general campus policy, are permitted to take courses in cer\u00ad tain areas ori a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in Engineering, such areas are the breadth courses, except for courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI Writing Requirement; any free electives; and any courses not submitted as fulfilling the graduation requirement (including technical electives beyond the number required). Proficiency Examinations A student may take a course by examination with the ap\u00ad proval of the faculty member in charge of the course and the Dean of the School. Normally, ability will be demonstrated by a .written or oral examination; if a portion of the capability involves laboratory exercises, the student may be required to perform experiments as well as to take a written examina\u00ad tion. The proficiency examination is not available for any course a student has taken before (or has audited) at UCI. Double Options for Environmental Engineering Effective fall 1985 entering students will not be admitted to the Environmental Engineering option. Students who entered the School of Engineering prior to fall 1985 and elected this option must meet the following course require\u00ad ments and should refer to\u00b7the 1984-85 edition of the UCI General Catalogue for further information and discuss their program with an academic counselor in the School's Office of Undergraduate Student Affairs. Civil and Environmental Engineering In addition to the requirements in the Civil Engineering option, the student must complete six environmental courses approved by the faculty advisor and the Civil Engineering Undergraduate Coordinator. Engineering 263 Mechanical and Environmental Engineering In addition to the requirements in the Mechanical Engineer\u00ad ing option, the student must complete six environmental courses approved by the faculty advisor and the Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate Coordinator. Undergraduate Acceleration toward the M.S. Degree in Engineering Exceptionally promising seniors may, with permission of the Undergraduate Study Committee, take graduate-level Engi\u00ad neering courses in addition to the \u00b7undergraduate degree requirements. After attaining the B.S. degree and upon acceptance to the M.S. program in Engineering, the student may petition for application of up to eight units of excess credit toward the M.S. degree. If the petition is approved by the School and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, the student could complete the M.S. degree in three quarters of residence as a graduate student even while serving as a teaching or research assistant. Graduate Program Graduate study is offered leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering. The graduate program has concen\u00ad trations in Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, and Environmental Engineering. Civil Engineering focuses upon structural mechanics; transportation, planning, and urban systems; water resources; arid environmental eng.ineering. The con\u00ad centration in electronics, electro-acoustics and electro-optics, digital systems, telecom\u00ad munications, control systems, and electric energy systems. Mechanical Engineering specialties include heat transfer, fluid dynamics, materials, combustion, environmental engineering, solar energy, and atmospheric processes. Studies in opera\u00ad tions research can be carried out through interdisciplinary courses offered by several academic units. Admissions For information on requirements for admission to graduate study at UCI, see page 70. Admission to graduate standing in the School of Engineering is generally accorded those pos\u00ad sessing a B.S. degree in Engineering or an allied field obtained with an acceptable level of scholarship from an institution of recognized standing. Those seeking admission without the prerequisite scholarship record may, in some cases, undertake remedial work; if completed at the stipulated academic !\\'vel, they will be admitted to full graduate standing. Those ad\u00ad mitted from an allied field may be required to take supple\u00ad mentary upper-division courses in basic engineering subjects. The Graduate Record Examination General Test is required of all applicants. Master of Science in Engineering The M.S. degree is normally attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis, or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. For the M.S. degree with thesis, a minimum of 36 approved units is required, of which at least 20 must be nonresearch grad\u00ad uate units (courses numbered 200-289). A maximum of eight M.S. thesis research units (296) may be submitted. The M.S. thesis must demonstrate the student's capability of undertak\u00ad ing an original study and carrying it through to a conclusion satisfactory toat least three members of the faculty. For the M.S. degree with comprehensive examination, a minimum of 36 approved units are required, of which at least 24 must be UC IRVINE - 1985-1986264 Engineering nonresearch graduate units (numbered 200-289). In Electrical Engineering the comprehensive examination takes i:he form of a core course program (see Graduate Courses in Electrical Engineering). The detailed program of study for each M.S. student is formulated in consultation with an advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate and the specific requirements of the School. Stu\u00ad dents should acquaint themselves with core course require\u00ad ments in the various concentrations of the M.S. program. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. Full-time students should be able to complete the requirements for the M.S. degree in three to four quarters. Further details of the M.S. program in the Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Departments are presented in the individual departmental descriptions. Part-Time Study Those students who are employed may pursue the M.S. degree on a part-time basis, carrying fewer units per quarter. Since University residence requirements necessitate the suc\u00ad cessful completion of a minimum number of units in gradu\u00ad ate or upper-division work in each of at least three regular University quarters, the part-time student should seek the advice of the graduate student counselor in the School of Engineering and the approval of the chair of the appropriate program (CE, EE, or ME). M.S. programs must be completed in four calendar years from the date of admission. Students taking courses in University Extension should consult the section on Transfer of Courses below. Transfer of Courses Upon petition a limited number of graduate-level courses taken through University Extension, on another campus of the University, or in another accredited university may be credited toward the M.S. degree after admission. With the exception of work undertaken in another Graduate Division of the University, transfer credit will not be applied to the minimum required units in 200-series courses. For further information, see page 76. Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory committee which takes into consideration the objec\u00ad tives and preparation of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. There are no specific course requirements, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty of the School; passage of the preliminary examination assess\u00ad ing the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral program; satisfaction of the teaching requirements required of all doctoral students; research preparation; formal advancement to candidacy; completion of a significant research investigation; and preparation and defense of an acceptable dissertation. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Financial aid, such as research and teaching as\u00ad sistantships, is available. Further details of the Ph.D. program in the Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Departments are presented in the individual departmental descriptions.

Tohoku University, Japan, Visiting Lecturer in Electrical Engineering (solid state devices) Electrical engineering is a broad field which has its founda\u00ad tions in electrical phenomena and with devices that use elec\u00ad tricity. Knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences, gained by study, experience, and practice, is applied with judgment to develop ways to use the materials and forces of nature economically for the benefit of mankind. Some electri\u00ad cal engineers concentrate on making electrical energy avail\u00ad able and utilizing it properly. Others specialize in the tiny electronic devices, circuits, and systems that are used exten\u00ad sively in communications, computers, medicine, entertain\u00ad ment, automation, and control. Most electrical engineers begin work in a corporate environ\u00ad ment, where they are part of an engineering team. They obtain satisfaction from solving meaningful problems and seeing culmination in tangible results. The primary criteria for advancement are the ability to communicate effectively, to reason clearly, to apply expertise and experience, and to accomplish assignments. Many electrical engineering graduates are practicing engi\u00ad neers throughout their careers, being interested in and enjoy\u00ad ing the sense of achievement from technical and scientific accomplishment. About an equal number enter other lines of endeavor. Many become company executives, some establish their own companies, and some use their knowledge, train\u00ad ing, and logical, goal-oriented thinking to advantage in such fields as medicine, law, or public administration. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986270 Engineering Focused Research Program on Image Engineering Image engineering is a new way of thinking about today's technology. Spanning the growing industrial-scientific spec\u00ad trum of technologies which utilize visual images at every step of the process from data acquisition to the design and display of the images themselves, image engineering synthesizes cur\u00ad rent research in a comprehensive way which may have far\u00ad reaching effects on such di;verse fields as manufacturing, fluid mechanics, structural vibrations, chemistry, cardiology, and radiology. This new concept in engineering could impact a range of industries from radar to pharmaceuticals, from medical imaging to computer-aided manufacturing, from vehicular guidance and inspection to electronic cameras. The potential of image engineering in science and industry is being developed in the high-tech industrial environment of Orange County through the Focused Research Program on Image Engineering, a program funded by the campus Divi\u00ad sion of Graduate Studies and Research. The program partici\u00ad pants include more than 20 engineering firms in Orange County and elsewhere in the United States and more than a dozen academic disciplines at UCI and the California State University campuses at Long Beach, Fullerton, and San Luis Obispo, who are invalued in high-quality, industrially rele\u00ad vant research on image engineering. Further information is available from Professor Jack Sklansky, Department of Elec\u00ad trical Engineering, School of Engineering. University of Cali\u00ad fornia, Irvine, CA 92717. Undergraduate Option in Electrical Engineering Bachelor of Science Degree The undergraduate Electrical Engineering curriculum is built around a basic core of humanities, mathematics, natural and engineering science courses. It is arranged to provide the fundamentals of synthesis and design that will enable gradu\u00ad ates to begin careers in industry or to go on to graduate study. Electrical engineering students at UCI receive special training in network analysis, electronic system design, signal processing, control systems, electromagnetics, and com\u00ad puters. They learn to design circuits and systems to meet specific needs and to use modern computers in problem anal\u00ad ysis and solution. The electrical engineering faculty have special interest and expertise in the following fields: communications theory; computer engineering; control systems; digital electronic system design; integrated electro-optics and electro-acoustics; medical imaging and automatic pattern clas\u00ad sification; power systems and electromechanics; and quantum electronics and optics.

School Requirements: See page 262. Departmental Requirements: At least 84 units of School and departmentally required Engineering Core Courses and techni\u00ad cal electives and at least six units of free electives. The Core Courses are: Physics 50, SLD, Physics SE, SLE, Engineering E70,EE75,EE75L,EE110A,EE110LA,EE110B,EE110LB, EE113,EE120A,EE120B,EE131,EE131L,EE140A,EE140LA, EE170, EE180, and EE186. Program of Study Students must complete all required freshman and sophomore courses before they enroll in any junior or senior Electrical Engineering courses. Furthermore, the selected technical elec\u00ad tives must satisfy the requirements of engineering design. (The Undergraduate Student Affairs Office can provide neces\u00ad sary guidance for satisfying the design requirement.) The sample program of study chart is typical for the accredited option in Electrical Engineering. Students should keep in mind that this program is based upon a rigid set of prerequisites, beginning with adequate preparation in high school mathemat\u00ad ics, physics, and chemistry. Therefore, the course sequence should not be changed except for the most compelling reasons. Students who are not adequately prepared, or who wish to make changes in the sequence for other reasons, must have their programs approved by the appropriate advisor. Graduate Concentration in Electrical Engineering Master of Science Degree The Electrical Engineering Department offers two routes to the M.S. degree: a comprehensive examination option and a thesis option. The comprehensive examination option is a n~;,thesis pro\u00ad gram designed for practicing electrical engineers in industry who will probably not go on to the Ph.D. Candidates take the five Electrical Engineering core courses (EE 210A, 235, 240A, 279, and 287 A) and a coherent set of courses in a specializa\u00ad tion approved by their faculty advisor. In addition to the Uni\u00ad versity's grade-point-average requirements, each of the core courses must be completed with a grade of B or better. It is possible to meet these degree requirements on a part-time basis. The thesis option is intended for full-time students who are likely to continue on to the Ph.D. Although students consid\u00ad ering the Ph.D. may also elect the comprehensive examina\u00ad tion option, the Electrical Engineering faculty feels that the Junior Senior El01 EE 131, 131L EE 113 EE 140A, 140LA EE 180 Technical Elective Breadth Breadth EE 170 Technical Elective EE llOA, llOLA Technical Elective EE 120A Technical Elective Breadth or Free Elective Breadth EE 186 Technical Elective EE llOB, llOLB Technical Elective Breadth Free Elective (Chern. 61B, 61LB) EE 120B Technical Elective Breadth E 80 Free Elective Breadth UC IRVINE - 1985-1986research, writing, and oral examination experience to be gained via the thesis route is highly beneficial training for more advanced work. For the thesis option, students, during the first quarter of the program and in consultation with their faculty advisor, are required to develop and obtain approval of a complete program of study. A committee of three full-time faculty members is appointed to guide devel\u00ad opment of the thesis and, when the thesis is approved, to administer an oral examination on basic principles and the thesis contents. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Ph.D. program in Electrical Engineering requires com\u00ad mitment to the years of dedicated study and collaboration necessary to develop a qualified student's knowledge, ability, and capability for expression to the doctoral level. Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents are selected from applicants with appropriate degrees from institutions of recognized high standing on the basis of outstanding demonstrated scholarship and potential. After substantial \u00b7preparation, Ph.D. candidates work as under\u00ad studies to faculty advisors. The process involves extended immersion in a research atmosphere and culminates in the production of original research results presented in a dissertation. Milestones to be passed in the Ph.D. program include the fol\u00ad lowing: acceptance into a research group by the faculty ad\u00ad visor during the student's first quarter of study; passing the Preliminary Examination, which is a screening examination to let students know at an early stage whether or not the faculty feel that they are likely to successfully complete the degree; preparation for doing research, completion of the School of Engineering teaching requirements, and the devel\u00ad opment of a research proposal; passing the Qualifying Exam\u00ad ination to assess the candidate's preparation for research and to evaluate the proposed research; successful completion of the research; development and approval of the dissertation; presentation of the dissertation and final examination on its contents. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doc\u00ad toral Committee and the School's Associate Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research. Doctoral programs must be com\u00ad pleted within seven calendar years of the date of admission. Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Courses EE75 Network Analysis II (4) W, Summer.

Lehigh University, Visiting Lecturer in Mechan\u00ad iml Engineering (computer aided design and engineering) UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Mechanical engineering is concerned with energy conversion and transfer, forces and motions, and material behavior in the design of systems. Knowledge of mathematics, physics, and chemistry lies at the core of the field, but application of this knowledge to design uses engineering technology-a dis\u00ad ciplined way of thinking, modeling, and testing that enables design to proceed despite incomplete information and uncertainty. . Fundamental areas in mechanical engineering include statics, kinematics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, solid mechanics, mechanical behavior of materials, controls, and experimental methods. Application areas include combustion, heat engines, propul\u00ad sion, refrigeration, terrestrial and aerospace vehicles. Since mechanical engineering covers a wide spectrum of sub\u00ad jects, many students use the undergraduate curriculum as preparation for further studies in areas such as environmen\u00ad tal engineering, medicine, law, and management. Undergraduate Option in Mechanical Engineering Bachelor of Science Degree The undergraduate Mechanical Engineering curriculum includes a core of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Elec\u00ad tives in the humanities are required for intellectual develop\u00ad ment. Engineering courses in fundamental areas fill much of the remaining curriculum; a few electives allow the under\u00ad graduate student to specialize somewhat or to pursue broader areas. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree with the Mechanical Engineering Option University Requirements: See pages 49-52. School Requirements: See page 262. Departmental Requirements: At least 95 unifs of Engineering and technical subjects including a minimum of 34 units of design. The Core Courses are: advisors and the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office can provide necessary guidance for satisfying the design requirements. Selection of elective courses must be approved by the assigned faculty advisor and the departmental under\u00ad graduate advisor. Program of Study Students planning to graduate in June 1986 must complete Physics SA-B-C-D, Physics SLA-LB-LC-LD, Chemistry 61A-B, and Che~istry 61LA-LB. Students planning to graduate in Sample Program of Study-Mechanical Engineering Freshman Sophomore Fall Math 2A Math 3A Free Elective/Writing Physics SC, SLC ME 52A Breadth Breadth Free Elective Winter Math 2B Math 3B Physics SA, SLA E 30 E 10 Chemistry 6IA, 6ILA Breadth Breadth Spring Math 2C Math 3D Physics SB, SLB ME 54 ME 52B Chemistry 61B, 61LB Breadth E 80 Engineering 275 June 1987, 1988, or 1989 must complete Physics SA-B-C, Phys\u00ad ics SLA-LB-LC, Chemistry 61A-B, and Chemistry 61LA-LB. The sample program of study chart is typical for the accre\u00ad dited option in Mechanical Engineering. Students should keep in mind that this program is based upon a rigid set of prereq\u00ad uisites, beginning with adequate preparation in high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Therefore, the course sequence should not be changed except for the most compell\u00ad ing reasons. Students who are not adequately prepared, or who wish to make changes in the sequence for other reasons\u00b7, must have their programs approved by the appropriate advisor. Graduate Concentration in Mechanical Engineering Master of Science Degree Two options are available to pursue study for the M.S. degree. The comprehensive examination option requires completion of 36 units of study, execution and documenta\u00ad tion of a design project (which can count for up to eight of the 36 required units), and completing an examination on the course work and project. This plan is available for those who wish to emphasize professional practice. The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study (eight of which can be taken for study in conjunction with the thesis research topic); the completion of an original research project; the writing of the thesis describing it; and approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. This plan is available for those who wish to gain research experience or as preparation for study for the doctoral degree. Doctor of Philosophy Degree An applicant for admission to the Ph.D. concentration in Mechanical Engineering normally will have completed an M.S. program with distinction from an institution of recog\u00ad nized high standing. Evidence of superior scholarship and potential for original creative work are necessary for admis\u00ad sion to the program. Before seeking admission an applicant should communicate directly and in some detail with a pro\u00ad spective faculty sponsor. The student's objectives and finan\u00ad cial resources must mesh with a faculty sponsor's research interests and research support. Financial aid in the form of a Teaching- Assistantship or Fellowship will ordinarily support only one year of the period of several years required to com\u00ad plete the program. During the balance of the period the stu\u00ad dent will be in close collaboration with the faculty research director, will be employed as a Research Assistant through the faculty member's research grants, and will use laboratory supplies, equipment, and computer facilities purchased through these extramural funds. Admission to the concentra\u00ad tion requires demonstration of educational preparation, intel\u00ad lectual capacity, dedication, and sufficient financial support.

(Master of Public Administration), M.B.P.A. (Masfer of Business and Public Administration), and to the Ph.D. degree in Administration. The undergraduate minor is designed for those who wish to gain some insight into issues of modern management, as well as those who anticipate future graduate work in Management. The Master's degrees are professional in nature; the Ph.D. in Administration is for those who wish to pursue a career in scholarly research. The Master's programs are intended to provide future man\u00ad agers with a firm foundation in the basic disciplines and in management tools and techniques. Each student in the Mas\u00ad ter's program focuses upon an institutional area and may develop expertise in one or more functional specializations. The Ph.D. program for the field of administration has aca\u00ad demic and research objectives. General Admission Requirements Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission to the Mas\u00ad ter's and Ph.D. degree programs will consist of an integrated assessment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of pre\u00ad vious academic work, statements of purpose, and letters of recommendation). The University admission standard of a 3.0 or better undergraduate grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) is required. The minimum TOEFL (Test of English as a For\u00ad eign Language) score acceptable for study at GSM is 570. Requests for application material should be addressed to the Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, \u00b7california 92717. Master's Degrees GSM admits students for study leading to the Master's degrees in the fall quarter. The deadline for completion of all phases of the application procedure is June 1. In addition to the general University rules governing admission to graduate study, GSM normally requires the following: 1. Those applicants seeking to be admitted to the M.B.A. program are required to take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). Applicants interested in pursuing the M.P.A. or M.B.P.A. degrees are also encouraged to take the GMAT, but may substitute the Graduate Record Exami\u00ad nation (GRE) for GMAT. 2. College-level mathematics including calculus and a course in probability theory. Applicants without adequate mathemat\u00ad ical preparation may be admitted with the condition that they complete preliminary courses with a grade of B or better. These courses should be completed by fall quarter, but no later than the end of the second quarter in residence. Under\u00ad graduate courses in both the social sciences (e.g., economics, political science, psychology, sociology) and information and computer sciences are strongly recommended. The Ph.D. Degree GSM admits students for the Ph.D. in the fall quarter only. Deadline for application is April 1. The Ph.D. program re\u00ad quires a commitment to full-time study. In addition to the other requirements, Ph.D. applicants are encouraged to sub\u00ad mit a previously prepared paper (research report, Master's thesis, essay, case study) which may be indicative generally of the applicant's interests and capabilities. Educational Objectives Three basic premises underlie the School's philosophy of graduate education. First, there are significant phenomena and problems common to business, educational, and govern\u00ad mental organizations; second, a common set of disciplines, concepts, techniques, and technologies exist which are appropriate to a wide range of organizational or scholarly roles; third, many administrators in the future will work in more than one of the three arenas during their careers. Regardless of the content of particular courses, it is expected that all degree candidates will be exposed to and have the ability to use the following: General Knowledge. The broad context of organizations and management; the late twentieth century (significant trends, conditions, and problems); history of science, scientific inquiry, and the philosophy of science; economic, political, and social analysis. Conceptual and Empirical Knowledge of Organizations. Basic concepts of management; the structure and functions of organizations, including comparative analysis and inter\u00ad organizational relations; levels and units of decision making; individual behavior and group norms; operating environ\u00ad ments 6f organizations. Specific Knowledge of Particular Arenas of Administration. In-depth study of specific institutional environments for administrative practice, such as governmental and business organizations, and other types of organizations. Mathematics and Statistics. As tools of precise reasoning, as languages which will tend more and more to dominate pro\u00ad fessional and scholarly literature, and above all, as founda\u00ad tions for relevant quantitative methods. Technical Bases of Management. Decision processes; opera\u00ad tions research; systems and policy analysis; budgeting and accounting techniques; personnel policies; techniques for measuring and affecting attitudes and behavior; research design and strategies. Management Information Systems. Computer technology, information sciences, and basic computer applications. General Skills. Political skills, effective management of inter\u00ad personal relations, leadership strategies and tactics, and com\u00ad petence in oral, graphic, and written expression. Professional Orientations. Identification of factors, values, and policies which might bear on successful, responsible, and intellectually honest performance of organizational roles. Recognition of the administrator's potential contributions to society and of ethical and moral problems which arise from social research and the management of human enterprises. Undergraduate Minor in Management The GSM faculty and the Dean of Undergraduate Studies offer an undergraduate minor in Management. The minor consists of seven courses: one lower-division introductory course and six upper-division courses. Students are eligible to minor in Management if they have completed all prerequisite courses prior to the enrolling in upper-division management courses. A grade point average of 2.0 or better is required in all prerequisite courses. Inter\u00ad ested students may obtain further information from the Graduate School of Management Office, 323 Social Science Tower. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Prerequisite Courses The following are prerequisite for enrolling in the upper\u00ad division undergraduate minor courses: Social Sciences 12A and 12B (Basic Economic Theory); Mathematics 2A (Calculus) or equivalent; Mathematics 7 (Basic Statistics with probability or equivalent). A one-quarter course selected from Social Sciences 6A, 6B, or 6C (Introduction to Political Science); 7 (introduction toPsy\u00ad chology); 8 (introduction to Sociology); or Social Ecology 59 (introduction to Human Behavior) Transfer students should check with their college counselor for established equivalencies for these prerequisite courses. Courses Satisfying the Undergraduate Minor Management 5 (Managing in Contemporary Organizations) Management 181 (Managing in Organizational Behavior) . Management 183 (Managerial Decision-Making) Management 160 (introduction to Public Management) Management 185 (Introduction to Managerial Accounting) Management 186 (Introduction to Managerial Finance) Management 187 (Introduction to Marketing) In establishing the GSM undergraduate minor in Manage\u00ad ment, the faculty anticipated three types of students to be drawn to courses in administration: (1) students who wish to learn about the administration of organizations as a way of gaining appreciation for a significant aspect of the culture, (2) students preparing for careers in other fields that require some knowledge of administration but not a high concentra\u00ad tion in the field, and (3) students who expect to go on to graduate work in administration and who wish early gui\u00ad dance and undergraduate work appropriate to this career objective. The 3-2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the two-year Master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree from the Uni\u00ad versity of California or another institution, outstanding UCI undergraduate students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram with GSM and most other campus units. Acceptance into the 3-2 Program constitutes advance admission to the graduate program. Such students complete their undergrad\u00ad uate major requirements by the end of the junior year. Dur\u00ad ing their senior year, they take graduate courses in GSM. These courses are used to satisfy their undergraduate unit requirements, and at the same time apply toward their grad\u00ad uate degrees. Successful completion of the requirements in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the cooperating discipline after the fourth year, and an M.B.A., M.B.P.A., or M.P.A. degree after the fifth year. The ability to complete both degrees in five years may vary by academic program. Students should consult with their academic coun\u00ad selor in their major School for further information about completing undergraduate requirements in three years. Stu\u00ad dents contemplating entering such a program should contact the Graduate School of Management prior to, or early in, the start of the junior year, for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no undergradu\u00ad ates will be enrolled in GSM graduate-level courses. Master's Degree Programs The Graduate School of Management offers three Master's degrees: the M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration), the M.P.A. (Master of Public Administration), and the M.B.P.A. (Master of Business and Public Administration). All three require a minimum of 23 quarter courses (92 units) with a Management 283 minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 in the Core and overall. The Master's degree programs normally take two full aca\u00ad demic years or their equivalent in part-time registration. Students with substantial personal or professional commit\u00ad ments normally take two courses per quarter and are required to complete the Master's degree in no more than four years. To accommodate the needs of these students, GSM offers a number of courses each quarter during the late afternoon and evening hours (after 4:00p.m.). There is no thesis required. The courses in the Master's degree programs are divided into three groups, each group designed to achieve specific educational objectives. The courses are divided as fol\u00ad lows: Tier I, Common Core Courses, which are required of all Master's degree students; Tier II B courses, which are required for the M.B.A. degree; and Tier II P courses, which are required for the M.P.A. degree. For the M.B.P.A. degree, the student is required to take all of Tier II B and II P courses. The balance of the minimum required 23 courses will consist of electives. Master's students select electives to emphasize educational and career goals and interests. Tier I Common Core Courses The first group consists of 10 Core courses (Tier I) taken by all Master's degree students. The Core has two fundamental aims: (1) to develop skills needed to select and use effectively the appropriate means, methods, and techniques for diagnos\u00ad ing and solving organizational problems; (2) to identify the significant concepts and phenomena associated with the study of complex organizations, and to bring to bear the rele\u00ad vant contributions of the core disciplines on the analysis of organizations and the adm_inistrative processes. Tier I Common Core Courses, each of which is four \u00b7units, are: Management of Complex Organizations, Statistics for Management, Operations Research for Management, Organ\u00ad izational Analysis for Management, Accounting Information for Management, Microeconomics for Management, Macro\u00ad economics for Management, Political Analysis for Manage\u00ad ment, Computer and Information Systems for Management, Public/Private Interactions. Specialization in Business Management, Public Management, or Business and Public Management Students pursuing the M.B.A. are required to take all four Tier II B courses: Business Strategy, Marketing for Manage\u00ad ment, Corporate Finance, and Operations Management. Stu\u00ad dents pursuing the M.P.A. are required to take all four Tier II P courses: Public Policy Making, Public Policy Analysis, Public Financial Management, and Public Productivity Management. Students pursuing the M.B.P.A. are required to take all eight of the Tier II courses. Elective Courses The remaining coursework for the Master's degrees will con\u00ad sist of either nine additional electives for the M.B.A. or M.P.A. degrees, or five electives for the M.B.P.A. degree. The major emphasis in the elective courses will be to develop additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a particular set of tech\u00ad nical tools and methods. The student will select the electives in light of the student's educational and career goals and interests. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986284 Management Executive M.B.A. Program The Executive M.B.A. Program is designed for managers who are highly motivated toward a career in management of organizations and for those currently in executive positions. It enables participants to enhance their management skills while obtaining a high-quality advanced education. Students may continue in their full-time professional roles while enrolled in the program. Limited class sizes are maintained, and all participants gain extensive work and managerial experience. The program consists of a 92-unit course of study completed on alternating Fridays and Saturdays, with three five-day residential sessions held during the 21-month sequence. Emphasis is placed on organizational and interpersonal skills; increased competence in specific management techniques; overall management training; and developing an understand\u00ad ing of the integration of business and the environment. Further information may be obtained by contacting the Director, Executive M.B.A. Program, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, California 92717. Management Internship Program To complement the academic curriculum of GSM, a Man\u00ad agement Internship Program provides practical application and work experience to selected GSM Master's students. Student interns are employed in administrative positions by local organizations. Course credit is available for participants in the Internship Program through the course \"Management Internship Seminar.\" GSM faculty and organizational repre\u00ad sentatives as well as student interns participate in this seminar which deals with specific topics and projects encoun\u00ad tered by the interns in their positions. Special Opportunities Opportunities for students to take part in ongoing research exist through two University-wide research units based on the Irvine campus. Through the Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) a student may participate in research on significant public policy issues. Current projects include a nationwide study of local government information systems. The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) conducts research in the areas of urban transportation policy and planning, transit management and labor relations, and trans\u00ad portation system evaluation. Students interested in these areas may have an opportunity to work on an ITS project. Doctor of Philosophy in Administration GSM offers the Ph.D. in Administration to students with backgrounds in a variety of disciplines. While a master's degree is preferred, students may be admitted to the doctoral program directly from the baccalaureate degree. There are many appropriate undergraduate majors, including (but not limited to) psychology, political science, business or public administration, mathematics, computer sciences, economics, sociology, and so forth. Students with academic strengths in disciplines not usually considered as precursors for manage\u00ad ment (e.g., natural sciences, humanities, and the arts) are encouraged to apply. The Ph.D. program is designed to pre\u00ad pare students for academic careers in a number of the fields of management, e.g., organizational behavior, operations research, marketing, public policy, finance, business policy, or management information systems. Requirements of the Ph.D. program include a broad knowledge of core disciplines as represented by the 10 common core courses of the Mas\u00ad ter's degree program. In addition, the Ph.D. student must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a disserta-tion demonstrating these skills. There are no foreign lan\u00ad guage requirements in the GSM Ph.D. program. Although there is considerable variation in the length of time beyond a Master's degree needed to complete the Ph.D., a realistic range is three to five years. The Ph.D. program is divided into three phases: preliminary, qualification, and dissertation. In the qualification phase the student prepares for disserta\u00ad tion research in an area of specialization. This phase is com\u00ad pleted when an oral qualifying examination is passed and the candidacy committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The dissertation phase involves a significant original research project which demonstrates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of research.

The Office offers programs which lead to credentials required by those who teach, counsel, or administer in the public and private schools of California. A second activity of the Office is described below under Project Radius. Faculty associated with the Office of Teacher Education include distinguished scholars, researchers, and authors of national or international reputation. Most faculty have them\u00ad selves taught or served as administrators in public or private schools, and all have shown commitment to the continued improvement of education through the processes of profes\u00ad sional study, the development of new approaches to teaching, -and the design or publication of innovative and scholarly courses of study. The Office of Teacher Education is organized around the credential programs it offers. Faculty members generally are associated with the credential program representing their areas of expertise and interest. The program provides oppor\u00ad tunities for interaction among students and faculty who share common interests. Project Radius The purpose of Project Radius is to foster a climate of exchange and collegiality among administrators and faculty from UC Irvine and Orange County schools; to address issues, problems, and mutual concerns about curriculum, student preparation, and the professional development of teachers; and to work cooperatively to promote academic excellence at all levels of education. Coordinated by the Office of Teacher Education, Project Radius offers informa\u00ad tion and referral regarding various campus/school outreach activities and resources; conferences, workshops, courses, and summer institutes in specific curricular areas; assistance with curriculum review, design, and implementation; cooper\u00ad ation with university/school-based fund-raising efforts. Credential Programs The Office of Teacher Education offers programs which lead to California teaching credentials as established by the Teacher Preparation and Licensing Law of 1970, known gen\u00ad erally as the Ryan Act. In addition, programs leading to two nonteaching credentials, the Pupil Personnel Services Cre\u00ad dential and the Administrative Services Credential, are offered. It is possible for a student concurrently to complete the requirements for a credential and to earn a graduate aca\u00ad demic degree. This requires admission to the Teacher Educa\u00ad tion program and the graduate program in which the degree will be sought. There are two basic teaching credentials in California: the Single Subject Credential and the Multiple Subject Creden\u00ad tial. They are called basic because all other teaching and most nonteaching credentials have one of these two credentials as prerequisites. Teaching credentials authorized by the 1970 credential law are not determined by grade level (i.e., elementary and secondary) but by the type of instructional situation (multiple or single subject). Each credential carries K-12 authorization. These credentials are awarded by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing upon recommendation of the UCI Office of Teacher Education and are required in order to teach or serve in a professional capacity in any public school in California. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Teacher Education 289 UC IRVINE - 1985-1986290 Teacher Education Single Subject Instruction Credential \"Single subject instruction\" means the practice of assignment of teachers to specified subject matter courses, as is com\u00ad monly practiced in California high schools and junior high schools. Teachers who are authorized for single subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach any subject in the authorized fields, at any grade level, but nor\u00ad mally in a departmentalized secondary school. UCI is approved for this credential. Single Subject Instruction Cre\u00ad dentials are authorized by the State of California in art, Eng\u00ad lish, foreign languages, history, life science, mathematics, music, physical science, social science, as well as agriculture, business, government, health science, home economics, \u00b7 indusJrial arts, and physical education. Candidates who enroll in the Single Subject Credential pro\u00ad gram at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Education 101; Education 102A-H (students enroll in the section of their major); Education 105B; Education 105LB; Education 162 (usually taken 380. Sample Fifth-Year Program-Single Subject Credential Fall Ed 101 Winter Ed 173* Spring Ed 173 Ed 102 Ed 320A,B Ed 320C,D,E Ed 105B/LB Ed 380 Ed 360 Ed 174 *In winter quarter, Ed 175 may be substituted for Ed 173. Multiple Subject Instruction Credential \"Multiple subject instruction\" means the practice of assign\u00ad ment of teachers to multiple subject matter instruction, as is commonly practiced in California elementary schools. Teach\u00ad ers who are authorized for multiple subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach in any self-contained classroom: preschool, kindergarten, and grades 1-12 inclusive, but normally the assignment is in the elementary school. UCI is approved for this credential. Candidates who enroll in the Multiple Subject Credential program at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Education 105A; Education 105LA; Education llOA\u00ad B; 380. Sample Fifth-Year Program-Multiple Subject Credential Fall Ed 105A Winter Ed 105LA Spring Ed 300D,E,F Ed noB Ed llOA Ed 360 Ed 173 Ed 174 Ed 300A Ed 300B,C Candidates desiring both Single and Multiple Subject Cre\u00ad dentials may apply the basic professional courses of Educa\u00ad tion 105A, 105LA, 173, 174, 360, 380, and 162 toward both credentials, but must complete Education 101, 102, llOA-B, do student teaching in both areas, demonstrate competence by passing appropriate State-mandated subject field examina\u00ad tions where needed, and pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). Intern Teaching Credential Program Through the intern program, a student may earn a stipend for one year of teaching while completing either the Multiple or Single Subject Credential. T() serve as an intern in a school district, the student must be enrolled as a postbaccalaureate student in the Office of Teacher Education. Intern candidates are selected by participating schools and the University based on the background and experience of the teacher candidate, the needs of the particular school, and the candidate's eligibil\u00ad ity for the University's Teacher Education program. The sti\u00ad pend is paid by the school district. The number of internships varies from year to year. For further information see the intern secretary in the Office of Teacher Education. For the Special Education Intern Teaching Credential, see Specialist Credentials. Specialist Credentials The Specialist Credential authorizes teaching in the speciali\u00ad zation area at any grade level from preschool through grade 12. In order to qualify for this credential, the applicant must have a valid basic teaching credential (either the Single Sub\u00ad ject or Multiple Subject Credential) and complete a special\u00ad ized program of professional preparation in an approved pro\u00ad gram. In the State of California there are seven specialist credential categories: early childhood, bilingual/cross-cultural, mathematics, reading, agriculture, health science, and special education. UCI offers preparation for Specialist Credentials in early childhood education and in the special education areas of the learning handicapped, the physically handi\u00ad capped, and the severely handicapped. Students interested in the details about Specialist Credentials should make an appointment for program counseling with the academic ad\u00ad visor in the Office of Teacher Education. Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential. The Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential is a specialization beyond the basic Multiple Subject Instruction ~redential. If the student can complete all the work, the student can obtain a preliminary teaching credential and an Early Childhood Specialist Credential with the B.A., but it is not likely. In nearly every instance it will be obtained as a result of the fifth-year program. Special Education Specialist Credentials. UCI is approved for three areas of the Special Education Specialist Credential: Learning Handicapped, Physically Handicapped, and Severely Handicapped. Special Education Intern Specialist Credential. UCI offers an intern teaching credential in each of its three approved areas in special education. The intern teacher becomes a teacher\u00b7of record if the following requirements can be met: The student must be enrolled in the UCI credential program for an entire academic year, and must hold a basic teaching credential. The student must have completed the generic courses required for either the Learning Handicapped, Physically Handicapped, or Severely Handicapped Specialist Credential which includes Education 160, 161, 162, 163, and 184B (equivalency credit may be used for certain of these generic requirements). Finally, the student must have a contract offer from a public school district. The Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence. The Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence requires pos\u00ad session of a valid Special Education Credential, and three or more years of teaching experience, including both regular and special education teaching experience. A clear Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence authorizes service only if a valid Special Education Credential, other than an emer\u00ad gency credential, is held concurrently. The UCI program lead\u00ad ing to the clear Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence is a 16 quarter-unit program divided into four courses, and followed by an exit assessment. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis The Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis is a specialization in addition to a regular teaching credential. This means that a candidate must fulfill all the necessary requirements for a basic teaching credential whether this be with a Single Sub\u00ad ject orientation for high school or a Multiple Subject orienta\u00ad tion for elementary school. The Irvine program is limited to the development of a bilingual capacity in Spanish only as the second language. At UCI the Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a B.A. with a Bilingualism and English as a Second Language Emphasis. By acquiring this undergraduate major, the stu\u00ad dent will complete a significant part of the specific require\u00ad ments for a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. This is the best kind of preparation for going into the program leading to a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. Entry and exit exam\u00ad inations are required for this program. Services Credential The Ryan Act provides for five categories of nonteaching credentials which authorize their holders to provide specific nonclassroom services to public schools. Services Credentials are issued by the State in pupil personnel services, adminis\u00ad trative services, health services, library services, and clinical\u00ad rehabilitative services. UCI offers programs which lead to the Administrative Services Credential, generally required by school administrators, and the Pupil Personnel Services Cre\u00ad dential, sought by school counselors. Both credentials are effective for grades K-12. At UCI the Pupil Personnel Ser\u00ad vices Credential requires a basic teaching credential or a Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Social Ecology. The Administrative Services Credential is a two-stage cre\u00ad dential which requires completion of 36 quarter units for a Preliminary Administrative Services Credential and comple\u00ad tion of an additional 36 quarter units for the Professional Administrative Services Credential. Prerequisites for the Pre\u00ad liminary Administative Services Credential include a basic teaching credential, three years of acceptable full-time teach\u00ad ing experience, completion of Education 162 (or its equiv\u00ad alent), and a passing score on the California Basic Educational Skills Test. Applicants for the Professional Administrative Services Credential are required to have completed three years of administrative services under the preliminary cre\u00ad dential. The preliminary credential is valid for five years while the candidate studies for the professional credential. Planning a Program of Study One of the above patterns will prevail for all candidates. The primary option will be the status of the candidate (under\u00ad graduate or postbaccalaureate) at entry. Any program can be completed with one year of full-time postbaccalaureate study, but only a few can be pursued in an undergraduate program. Field experience, including student teaching, is offered in the regular four-year undergraduate program or during the fifth-year program. Field experience may be started in the freshman or sophomore year. The Office of Teacher Education program recommends two field experiences prior to entering into student teaching. One such experience might be a tutoring assignment during the freshman or sophomore year and another might be serving as a teacher's aide in the junior year. There are numerous options for this field experience. Each field experience pro\u00ad gram is a cooperative arrangement between the University and the public school districts to help provide UCI students with experience that will prepare them for their future work as teachers. The field experience can come from any one of Teacher Education 291 several academic areas in which students work in public schools under supervision of an experienced teacher in the school and with a University supervisor. As a tutor, the col\u00ad lege student usually works with the public school student on a one-to-one basis. As a teacher's aide, the student typically works for a block of time per week for one quarter with a teacher in the classroom. During this time, students are given a variety of opportunities to help the experienced teacher enrich the course of study and to participate within the classroom. Ultimately it is in the classroom where the problems of teaching are either solved or ignored; hence here is where teacher preparation begins. This experience will assist the UCI student in making a more realistic vocational choice. It also involves the public school in the selection of future student teachers. Admission to the Teacher Education Program All students are welcome to apply for admission to the Teacher Education program. Students are usually admitted twice a year, in the fall and spring quarters. Information and an application for admission are available from the Office of Teacher Education, 431 Social Science Tower. Admission is based on a broad index: Academic Achievement. Completion of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and a grade point aver\u00ad age of 3.0 will support admission to the Teacher Education program at UCI. (Undergraduates who enroll in courses lead\u00ad ing to credentials still must be admitted to a fifth year of study-to be described later.) Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. All students are required by law to obtain a certificate of clearance from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing prior to beginning student teaching. This process is primarily a fingerprint check to determine that the student is clear of criminal conviction. See a coun\u00ad selor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice on how to handle this process. Interview. An Admissions Committee is available to meet with prospective students. All admitted to the program will have a personal interview with a member or members of the Committee. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommendation for admission are required.

The applicant's record is reviewed first by the academic department and then by the Admissions Committee of the Office of Teacher Education. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986292 Teacher Education Minimum Requirements for the Basic Teaching Credential The minimum requirements for the teaching credential in California are established by California state law. Require\u00ad ments include: 1. A baccalaureate or higher degree, in an area other than professional education, from an approved institution. 2. A 45-quarter unit approved program of professional prep\u00ad aration. This means a sequence of education courses, includ\u00ad ing an ali-day, full-time assignment of a semester's duration (or the equivalent) in student teaching. 3. Passage of a subject matter examination or its waiver via an approved academic program. UCI academic programs are approved for most examination waivers; but students should seek counsel from Teacher Education to ensure that they are enrolled in an approved waiver program. 4. Under certain conditions the passage of the College Level Examination Program is required. See a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice. 5. Demonstration of a knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading as validated by successful completion of a program of study. (Industrial arts, physical education, music, art, and home economics are exempt from this requirement.) 6. A course or an examination covering the U.S. Constitution. 7. A fifth year of study (45 quarter units) is still required, even though a ~tudent may elect to start or complete the approved program of professional preparation as an undergraduate. \u00b7 8. Successful completion of the California Basic Educational Skills Test. Applicants are required to take this test prior to application for admission. The Approved Program of Professional Preparation The \"Approved Program\" refers to the minimum number of education courses required for the teaching credential. UCI defines the approved program as consisting of 19 quarter units, plus student teaching. Six quarter units of this instruc\u00ad tion are required in the teaching of reading. The Office of Teacher Education at UCI also offers a pro\u00ad gram for students who want more than the minimum requirements for teacher preparation. In addition to the 45- quarter-unit minimum requirements for a Multiple Subject (elementary) credential, students are offered a UCI\u00ad recommended group of courses that provide candidates with special preparation in writing and critical thinking, mathemat\u00ad ics, science, computer applications, and fine arts. (See below.) The UCI-recommended program, which includes the 45- quarter-unit minimum requirements and 20 quarter units of special preparation, can be completed in five quarters, or a sequence of summer, fall, winter, spring, and summer.

California requires all students to pass the National Teachers Examination (NTE) in the area of their teaching majors except where particular institutions have developed an approved major which waives the NTE. All UCI academic majors which are commonly taught in the public schools have been waived in lieu of the National Teachers Examination. However, in some majors there are certain requirements that a student must complete while ful\u00ad filling the major in order to receive this waiver. Students should consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for detailed information. Supplementary Authorization. Teaching minors by that name no longer exist, but it is possible to add further teach\u00ad ing authorizations beyond the single subject major. Students deciding to be credentialed in more than one subject area may qualify to do so in either of two ways: 1. Students may complete 30 quarter units (15 units if they are upper-division) in collegiate-level course work to be used to develop a supplementary authorization to teach in areas differing from the single subject major. Consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for details. 2. Students may pass the National Teachers Examination in any area of their choice and thus qualify for the additional authorization in that subject. Multiple Subject Examinations. A general subject matter examination authorizing teaching multiple subjects includes an examination of the candidate's knowledge of the following areas: English, social science, fine arts, science, and mathe\u00ad matics. The UCI program for the Multiple Subject Teaching Credential is approved for waiver of the examination if the student completes the required diversified program. The examination can be taken as often as necessary but should not be taken prior to the junior year. Requirements in Academic Areas for Waiver of Examination in the Multiple Subject Examinations. Of the student's total undergraduate program, 128 quarter hours are required to be divided as follows: Nine courses (36 quarter units) in two of the following areas and seven courses (28 quarter units) in the other two: a. English (including grammar, literature, advanced com\u00ad position, and speech) b. Social science and history (must have courses in each) c. Mathematics and science (must have courses in each with a minimum of three approved courses in mathematics) d. Fine arts, foreign language, and philosophy Since the academic major on the UCI campus will normally fulfill one of the four areas above and the UCI breadth requirement applies to the others, meeting the four require\u00ad ments is possible if planned early in the student's career.

In each instance the fifth year will consist of a program, indi\u00ad vidually determined and based upon the assessed needs of the student, and where applicable (for example, in the Intern Program), by the hiring school district. Regardless of courses completed prior to the bachelor's degree, students must complete a fifth year to obtain a clear teaching credentiaL In addition to the approved program listed above for the Multiple or Single Subject Instruction Credentials, the fifth year must include the following: I. Completion of 45 quarter units 2. Completion of the following courses: a. Education 162, Psychology and Education of the Excep\u00ad tional Child b. Education 360, Synthesis of the Professional Commitment c. Education 380, Health Education for Teachers Provision for a Student Teaching Experience Student teaching is defined as a full-day, five-day-per-week assignment, for 18 weeks (or its equivalent) in the appro\u00ad priate classroom training environment. Regular seminars are held as part of the total student teaching program. Evaluation is based on performance, excellence in instruction, and pro\u00ad fessional maturity, factors which are assessed by the resident teacher, the University supervisor, and the candidate. If competence has been demonstrated by the conclusion of the student teaching program and all other requirements are met, the student qualifies for recommendation for credential certification by UCL Multiple Subject Instruction candidates are assigned to teach in grades K-8. The assignment is split to include two levels within this range. Student teaching for Multiple Subject can\u00ad didates consists of assignments with increasing levels of responsibility in each of three quarters. Single Subject Instruction candidates are assigned in grades 7-12. This assignment may be split to include two levels within this range. The student teaching situation requires the student to be in the school the full day for a full semester (or its equivalent), the same as is required of the regular teacher; student teach\u00ad ing experience includes faculty meetings, parent conferences, and sponsorship of events. It is a joint responsibility of UCI and the school districts to guarantee that each student will have student teaching expe\u00ad rience in a multi-or cross-cultural situation. Clearances for student teaching are processed by the Office of Teacher Education and are contingent upon the certificate of clearance, a current health clearance, and academic prepa\u00ad ration clearances. A student must apply for a student teach\u00ad ing assignment the quarter before student teaching. Students are to consult the Office of Teacher Education for approp\u00ad riate information. Preliminary, Clear, and Life Credentials Multiple and Single Subject Credentials are of three types: The Preliminary Credential. The Preliminary Credential is awarded by the State upon completion of the baccalaureate, the professional education sequence, a course in the teaching Teacher Education 293 of reading, student teaching, completion of the Applied Technology in Education requirements, a course or examina\u00ad tion covering the U.S. Constitution, a passing score on the California Basic Educational Skills Test, and where necessary, by passing the National Teachers Examination as required by the Ryan Act. Under the present program, a student can be authorized to teach in California prior to the completion of the fifth year. However, the fifth year must be completed within five years after the preliminary credential is issued. The Clear Credential. The Clear Credential cannot be awarded by the State until the completion of (a) a baccalau\u00ad r.eate degree, (b) an approved program, and (c) a fifth year. The Life Credential.

The College is dedicated to advancing the knowledge and practice of medicine for the benefit of society. This mission is being achieved through the accomplishment of the following complementary and syner\u00ad gistic objectives: Scholarly research of the highest quality to further the understanding of human biology and the diagnosis, treat\u00ad ment, and prevention of disease. Education of physicians who meet the highest standards of professional competence and achievement. Development of scholars in the clinical and basic sciences who will assume leadership roles in medical practice, educa\u00ad tion, and research. Provision of high-quality medical care to patients through the UCI Clinical Services System that will serve as a model of excellence. Dissemination of the results of advances in medical research and practice. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986306 College of Medicine Facilities Facilities on the Irvine campus provide space for teaching and research as well as offices for departmental administration. The basic sciences instructional programs are located in mod\u00ad ern, well-equipped, medical sciences buildings. These units provide space for first-and second-year classes, lecture halls, offices and laboratories for various basic and clinical depart\u00ad ments, and a student center. Other buildings house UCI\u00ad CCM's administration, laboratories, and the Biomedical Sci\u00ad ences Library. 'In addition, faculty from the Departments of Pharmacology, Biological Chemistry, and Psychiatry and Human Behavior share laboratory space with corporate researchers in a build\u00ad ing adjacent to the College that was recently completed by the Nelson Research and Development Company, a private pharmaceutical development research firm. A second University-industry cooperative project, under construction, is the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic, also adja\u00ad cent to the College, which will house basic and medical treatment research on utilization of lasers. Medical services offered by UCI-CCM are provided through the UCI Clinical Services System. This System is comprised of the UCI Medical Center (UCIMC) in Orange, one com\u00ad munity clinic in Santa Ana, and another in Anaheim, and numerous affiliated hospitals and clinics located in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Kern Counties. It incor\u00ad porates the talents and broad range of medical expertise of more than 400 full-time clinical faculty of the College as well as nearly 1,600 community physicians who serve as volun\u00ad tary faculty.

The M.D. program is composed of 18 quintiles, 17 of which are instruc\u00ad tional and one in the senior year is a vacation period. Each quintile lasts 9 to 11 weeks and includes 8 to 10 weeks of instruction with one week for final and/or midcourse examinations. The basic science quintiles (1-5) include gross anatomy, his\u00ad tology, embryology, biochemistry, physiology, neuroanatomy, behavioral sciences, microbiology, and preventive medicine. The preclinical sciences (quintiles 6-8) involve pathology, din-College of Medicine 309 ical pathology, pharmacology, examination of the patient, studies of the mechanisms of disease, and introductory courses in medicine, surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. The clinical science quintiles (9-17) are spent in clerkships in medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, surgery, anes\u00ad thesiology, ophthalmology, psychiatry and human behavior, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurosciences, primary care, and radiology. Students are also provided ample oppor\u00ad tunity to participate in clinical and research elective courses of their choosing. During their first two years, students have approximately 13 weeks of vacation interspersed between the quintiles. This \u00b7 period includes three weeks between quintiles eight and nine to study for Part I of the National Boards. In the fourth year, up to 12 weeks may be taken as vacation. To satisfy the requirements for the M.D. degree, each medi\u00ad cal student must successfully complete the full curriculum (basic science, preclinical, clinical, and elective course work) with at least a 2.0 grade point average, and fulfill the National Board Examination requirement. After the second year, all students are required to pass Part I of the National Board Examination before continuing their clinical clerkships. Students must also pass Part II of the Boards prior to graduation. Curricular Policies The curricular policies of the UCI-California College of Med\u00ad icine are the responsibility of faculty committees. A listing of these policies is contained in the Medical Student Handbook, which is available from the Office of Student and Curricular Affairs and is distributed along with other policy statements to all students upon matriculation. The grading system at the College utilizes letter grades A through F. New M.D. Curriculum Effective Fall 1986 Students entering the College in fall 1986 or after will partic\u00ad ipate in a new set of requirements. The first and second years will be scheduled on a modified quarter system instead of the quintile system. There will be a 10-week vacation period between the first and second years; students may use that time for elective or research work in place of vacation. Between the second and third years there will be a four-week vacation, within the last week of which the National Board Examination Part I will be administered. During the fourth year, up to 12 weeks of vacation is allowed.

Gross Anatomy; Embryology; Histology; Neuroanatomy The language of medicine is taught in gross human anatomy, embryology, microscopic anatomy, and human neuroanat\u00ad omy. Gross anatomy is taught through a regional approach with heavy emphasis on laboratory dissection augmented by. lectures, demonstrations (radiographic films), and teaching aids. Embryology is a lecture course that brings forth human development from the union of sperm and ovum to parturi\u00ad tion. Microscopic anatomy is designed to provide students with knowledge of cellular morphology and function in prep\u00ad aration for studies in pathology. Neuroanatomy is function\u00ad ally oriented and emphasizes laboratory, clinical, and lecture material. All courses in anatomy are given a clinical orientation. Biochemistry The fundamentals of classical and molec~lar biochemistry are covered, including the structure, function, and biosynthesis. of macromolecules and metabolic interrelations. The molecu\u00ad lar at the transcrip\u00ad tional, translational, posttranslational, and enzymatic levels are emphasized. Behavioral Sciences I and II The ultimate goal of the curriculum is for the student to learn the behavioral aspects of medicine as they apply to gen\u00ad eral medicine and surgical practice. The areas covered are the basic science of neurobiology, somatopsychic issues, interper\u00ad sonal (doctor-patient) relationships, and psychopathology. Behavioral Sciences I covers normal human development, the basics of the doctor-patient relationship, basic interviewing techniques, and behavioral neuroanatomy and neurochemis\u00ad try. Behavioral Sciences II covers human sexuality, psy\u00ad chopathology, alcoholism, and drug abuse. It also covers psy\u00ad chosocial aspects of medical and surgical disease. The course consists of readings, lectures, and small group discussions. Students also have their first exposure to patients and learn the basics of the interview. In Behavioral Sciences I, the emphasis is on interviewing \"normal\" people; in Behavioral Sciences II the student learns how to assess pathology. Physiology The course consists of lecture, small-group discussion, and audiovisual presentations of the classical concepts of verte\u00ad brate physiology, with emphasis on the function of normal tissues in man. Specific topics related to neurological, cardio\u00ad vascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine; exer\u00ad cise, and temperature regulation are presented. Microbiology This course deals with the biochemical and genetic properties of infectious agents, activities of toxins, chemotherapy, and the biochemistry and genetics of antibiotic resistance. A con\u00ad siderable portion of the course deals with the humoral and cellular basis of immunity and the genetic control of the immune response. The course also includes an in-depth study of the biology of parasites and the structure and activity of viruses. Preventive Medicine This course consists of five main sections: biostatistics, epidemiology, preventive medicine, legal medicine, and envi\u00ad ronmental and occupational mediCine. The main segment, epidemiology, is presented in formal lectures and laboratory sessions. Methods are given for evaluating the distribution and possible causation of acute and chronic diseases, includ\u00ad ing infectious and noninfectious diseases, in human populations. Preclinical Sciences (Quintiles 6-8) During quintiles 6-8, no more than seven hours of instruc\u00ad tion will be scheduled each day, and of these no more than four are formal lectures. Pharmacology This course deals with drugs of various classifications which are used for specific or symptomatic therapies of disease states. Emphasis is on the mechanisms of action of drugs at the organ or system level and on their use in medical therapy. The course includes lectures that illustrate pharmacologic principles, supplemented by small group discussion sessions. Pathology Theoretical aspects of pathological processes are presented to provide an orientation to disease mechanisms which are correlated with practical laboratory work. Disease is pre\u00ad sented as a dynamic process that affects the organism at molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels.

Clinical Pathology This course consists of lectures and laboratories covering the areas of hematology, blood bank, clinical chemistry, and microbiology. Examination of the Patient Basic instruction and experience are offered in the elements of physical diagnosis and patient interviews. Mechanisms of Disease An organ system approach is utilized in presenting the basic mechanisms and manifestations of disease. Introduction to Medicine This course introduces students to comprehensive workups of their own patients, including history, complete physical examination of all organ systems, and differential diagnostic analysis and interpretation. Introduction to Surgery This lecture, laboratory, and study course provides a back\u00ad ground of knowledge of pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of surgical diseases, as well as basic technical skills. Introduction to Obstetrics and Gynecology This course introduces students to the basic essentials of obstetrics and gynecology. Students will learn the reproduc\u00ad tive physiology in the nonpregnant and pregnant woman. They will be introduced to many of the pathological changes that occur in the female reproductive system. Following this course, the student will be prepared to commence practical work at the beginning of their clinical clerkship in obstetrics and gynecology. Clinical Sciences (Quintiles 9-17) The clinical experience is composed of (a) core clerkship rota\u00ad tions, with a specific allotment of time in each d.epartment and (b) electives. Sequencing of clerkships is determined by a student lottery conducted by the Office of Student and Cur\u00ad ricular Affairs. Clerkships Anesthesiology During the anesthesiology clerkship, students receive instruction in the basic principles of general and regional anesthesia, including the pharmacology of anesthetic drugs, airway management, preoperative evaluation of patients, surgical anesthesia, fluid balance, hazards of anesthesia, resuscitation, and the management of respiratory emergen\u00ad cies. A two-week elective is offered in which students gain familiarity with the technical aspects of anesthesia by spend\u00ad ing each day in'the operating room, participating in super\u00ad vised \"hands-on\" patient care. Students attend departmental clinical conferences which are devoted to presentation and discussions of interesting cases and complications. Special rotations through the VAMCLB Surgical Care Unit are also offered. UC IRVINE - 1985-1986I 312 College of Medicine Junior Medicine Students are taught the appropriate diagnostic and therapeu\u00ad tic approach to commonly encountered medical illnesses. The intent is that, in addition to scientific aspects of medical diag\u00ad nosis and therapy, students will develop an appreciation for the importance of psychosocial-economic factors in the care of the patient. Experience is provided with common medical procedures such as lumbar puncture, insertion of catheters, and thoracentesis. The student is expected to assume increas\u00ad ing responsibility for hospitalized patients and to develop an approach to patients' problems which includes references to the appropriate medical literature. Senior Medicine Students spend five weeks as subinterns during which time they carry the full ward responsibility of an intern on one\u00ad half the number of patients usually carried by an intern. A second five weeks is spent on medically related electives. Neurosciences The clinical neurosciences clerkship emphasizes the develop\u00ad ment of student skills in neurological examination as well as the medical and surgical management of patients with brain, nerve, and muscle disease. Obstetrics and Gynecology During this clerkship, students are taught the scientific basis of gynecology and obstetrics, including reproductive physiol\u00ad ogy, anatomy, fetal physiology, and pathology. Practical expe\u00ad rience is offered in the management of normal and abnormal pregnancy and delivery. Instruction is given in office and .sur\u00ad gical gynecology. Students who have completed an introduc\u00ad tory clerkship may then apply for an advanced elective that \u00b7allows a progression of clinical responsibility both in opera\u00ad tive obstetrics and office gynecology. This advanced period also may be devoted to an in-depth study of a subspecialty area such as gynecologic oncology, maternal-fetal medicine, reproductive endocrinology and infertility, or human sexuality. Ophthalmology The core clerkship provides instruction in the basis of oph\u00ad thalmoscopy, slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, visual func\u00ad tion testing, and management of emergency eye problems. Electives from one to four weeks may be taken in clinical suites, with exposure to ophthalmic surgery and emergency eye care. Pediatrics/Nursery The pediatricclerkship introduces studen_ts to the special health needs of children and their families in both hospital and outpatient settings. Emphasis on growth and develop\u00ad ment highlights variations among healthy children and offers insight into the natural history of disease entities as well as patterns of illness throughout childhood. Students are expected to advance their skills in physical examination of children, communicate with families, and become competent in the development of diagnostic and treatment plans for common pediatric conditions. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation During the physical medicine and rehabilitation rotation, stu\u00ad dents are assigned patients who are in an active rehabilitation program. Emphasis is placed on the rehabilitation of the total . patient. The medical aspects of the patient's care are dis\u00ad cussed in detail. Instruction is provided in the various physi\u00ad cal techniques of rehabilitation and in the psychosocial factors which permanently affect this process. Primary Care Students attend an assigned primary care clinic one-half day per week for five consecutive quintiles during the junior year in either family medicine, internal medicine, or pediatrics. Each student becomes the primary care provider for a num\u00ad ber of patients in an ambulatory setting and continues as their primary care provider throughout the clerkship. Under the supervision of primary care faculty, students gain specific primary care skills. This experience in continuous care should provide a basis for a student's selection or rejection of a career in a primary care specialty. \u00b7 Psychiatry The eight-week clinical clerkship is the culmination of the process of learning human behavior as it relates to general medicine. The student elects two four-week clinical rotations participating fully in patient care, clinical teaching, and con\u00ad ferences. Choices include adult inpatient psychiatry, alcoho\u00ad lism, child psychiatry, consultation psychiatry, and emergency room psychiatry. A wide variety of clinical settings and patient populations is available. Radiology The role of radiological sciences (both diagnostic and thera\u00ad peutic) in relation to medicine and surgery is taught to stu\u00ad dents through exposure to clinical specialists in subspecialty areas such as nuclear medicine, ultrasound, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance, chest, bone, gastrointes\u00ad tinal, etc.; daily clinical film conferences with staff and resi\u00ad dents; the American College of Radiology film learning labor\u00ad atory; and daily seminars interrelating general medicine and radiology. Emphasis is given to all forms of imaging (includ\u00ad ing ionizing radiation, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance) for diagnosis and treatment, understanding the risk/benefit ratios involved, and the clinical indications for various radio\u00ad logical procedures. Surgery The surgical clerkship provides students with an opportunity to study surgical patients in outpatient and hospital settings as members of the surgical team. Emphasis is placed on the clinical evaluation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of surgical diseases. Electives A total of 25 weeks in the medical curriculum are allotted for elective time. Fifteen of those weeks are nondesignated elec\u00ad tives, and a student, depending upon their particular inter\u00ad ests, needs, and goals, may take a variety of elective courses consisting of at least 30 contact-hours per week beginning in quintile 14. In addition, five weeks are devoted to a medically related elective which may include pediatrics or family medi\u00ad cine, and five weeks are devoted to surgically related electives which may include anesthesiology or obstetrics and gynecology. Electives must be approved by the student's advisor and Department chair. Students may take up to 12 weeks of elec\u00ad tives at institutions other than UCI. A listing of elective courses and descriptions can be found in the Electives Handbook, which is available from the Office of Curricular Affairs (on campus), and the Office of Student and Curricular Affairs at the UCI Medical Center.

Student and Curricular Affairs has two broad goals: the first of these is to support the academic mission of UCI-CCM by facilitating the admissions, record keeping, and financial aid processes and by providing academic support services to help students gain the most from their medical education. The second goal is to assist students in their personal and profes\u00ad sional development by identifying and responding to issues and problems they encounter while pursuing their medical education. This is accomplished through student support ser\u00ad vices and student development workshops. Among the many student support services offered by the Office of Student and Curricular Affairs are: Academic Counseling Academic Monitoring Assignment of Faculty Advisors Big Brother-Big Sister Programs Cross-Cultural Medical Alliance Series Liaison with the UCI Affirmative Action Office Liaison with General Campus Support Services National Board Review Course Peer Counseling Personal Counseling Student Development Workshops Study Skills. Workshops Support to Medical Student Organizations Tutoring The student development workshops are designed to enhance personal and academic growth, addressing such top\u00ad ics as stress management, interpersonal relations, conflict resolution, test anxiety, note-taking, and a variety of other medical school related subjects. In addition to providing general services to all students, the Office of Student and Curricular Affairs is responsive to the unique concerns of minority, women, disadvantaged, and nontraditional students. Such services include the following programs: The Summer Preentry Program, which introduces ne~ly accepted minority and/or nontraditional students to the type and volume of study materials they must be able to deal with in medical school. The Progra~ is intended to help students adjust to the pro\u00ad fessional school setting, meet new classmates, become acquainted with the surrounding communities, and get situ\u00ad ated with living accommodations. The rigorous, highly sche\u00ad duled, seven-week summer program is designed to prepare entering students to succeed in the regular medical school curriculum, which begins in September. On-campus housing is provided to all students who participate. The Summer Premedical Program, which seeks to increase the number of minority and/or disad:vantaged students who are accepted into medical school and who successfully com\u00ad plete their medical education. The Program attempts to . achieve this goal by providing participants with the special . skills and prerequisites needed to obtain an M.D. degree. The Program is conducted on the UCI campus from late June to College of Medicine 313 early August, and all participants outside the Orange County area are housed in student residence halls, with room and board paid by a grant from the Federal Health Careers Opportunity Program. Undergraduate students completing their second year in colleges and universities throughout California are encouraged to apply. Postgraduate Educational Programs Residency Programs The UCI-California College of Medicine and its affiliated hospitals offer more than 600 residency positions in almost all areas of medicine.

Students in the Department of Anatomy have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge necessary to con\u00ad duct innovative and fundamental research. The second goal is to become knowledgeable scientists with the ability to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anat\u00ad omy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a flexible academic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of gross, cellular, and subcellular anatomy; physiology; and biochemistry. In the first year, stu\u00ad dents will be required to take neuroanatomy, microscopic anatomy, techniques in the neural sciences, biochemistry, and physiology. Over the usual four-year training period the stu\u00ad dent will be required to complete a practical course in statis\u00ad tics, four departmental seminar courses, four laboratory tutorials, and a total of 50 credit hours of research in anat\u00ad omy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy or other departments on campus may also be taken; examples include pharmacology, psychobiology, cell biology, genetics, computer science, pathology, and physiology. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Only a minimum of the third year is spent taking courses. Following the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in one major anatomy core course. When a student is accepted into the graduate program, the student and the Graduate Committee decide to which labora\u00ad tories the student will be assigned the first year. During the first year the student will spend approximately 25 percent of the time doing research. At the beginning of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. A Qual\u00ad ifying Examination at the end of the summer of the second year is given to the student by a Candidacy Committee. The examination covers basic neuroscience and focuses on the candidate's field of specialization. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Graduate Committee. The majority of the second, third, and fourth year is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written disserta\u00ad tion suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the stu\u00ad dent's advisor and Doctoral Committee constitutes the final examination. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded following completion of all the requirements, a pro\u00ad cess that normally will take four years to complete. Information on faculty research and specific course descrip\u00ad tions in anatomy can be found in the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences section.

The faculty's research interests include structure and synthe\u00ad sis of nucleic acids and proteins, regulation of cell growth and metabolism, biochemical genetics and gene organization, and immunology. The first-year student is required to take a core of advanced courses (203 through 209), to become associated with the laboratories of at least three different investigators, and to attend the 201A-B-C seminar series. Upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the first year, students are is given a comprehensive oral examination to test their general knowledge. Although further supplemental work may be recommended, the stu\u00ad dent normally begins a specific research project with a faculty member in the second year. By passing an oral examination on the proposed thesis work at the beginning of the third year, the student may advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Students normally com\u00ad plete their degree programs after a total of five years of graduate study. Participation in the seminar series (201A-B.\u00ad C) and completion of at least one satellite course per year (210-279) are expected of all continuing students. Regular teaching of undergraduates is part of the training of graduate students at all levels. The graduate committee may waive some of the above requirements for candidates for the Mas\u00ad ter's degree. Applicants should have adequate undergraduate preparation in calculus, physics, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. Students who have not had an adequate physical chemistry course are expected to take Chemistry 130A-B-C during their first year.

Physiology and Biophysics Graduate instruction and research in physiology and biophys\u00ad ics leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences is offered by the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, College of Medi\u00ad cine. The Depaftment provides research opportunities in the molecular biophysics of membranes and proteins; endocrinol\u00ad ogy; cellular physiology; developmental neurobiology; and the pulmonary and exercise physiology. The faculty research is generally oriented toward molecular and cellular physiology, but opportunities for research in organ physiology also exist. The curriculum provides the student with a broad back\u00ad ground in physiology and biophysics and the closely related fields of anatomy and biochemistry. Elective courses permit in-depth exploration of particular areas. Interdisciplinary dis\u00ad sertation research involving the research of more than one faculty member is encouraged. Prerequisites for admission normally include a bachelor's degree in one of the biological sciences, physics, chemistry, mathematics, or engineering, as well as undergraduate courses in calculus, organic and physical chemistry, biochem\u00ad istry, and advanced biology (e.g., neurophysiology, cell biol\u00ad ogy, neurobiology, psychobiology). Up to two prerequisites may be fulfilled as first-year electives. GRE General Test scores are required. Preference will be given to those stu\u00ad dents who have prior research experience. The Depa.rtment admits about three highly qualified students each fall. The program emphasizes original research, and stu\u00ad dents are expected to become involved in the research of the Department as early as possible. The core program includes graduate courses in physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, and cell biology. After the first year, training will follow the classical tutorial pattern in which a small number of students are tutored by the faculty in all informal setting. Students also will participate in a program of laboratory rotations and attend the weekly colloquium in physiology. The third and fourth years will be spent primarily in research, with some participation in teaching physiology to medical students. Each student must submit a written dissertation on an original research project and successfully defend this dissertation in an oral examination. Incoming students will receive academic advising from the Department Graduate Advisor until such time. as they choose a thesis advisor. The faculty conducts quarterly reviews of all continuing students to ensure that they are maintaining satisfactory progress within their particular academic pro\u00ad gram. Students who have completed all necessary prerequi\u00ad sites should be able to complete the Ph.D. within five years. A comprehensive examination will be administered in June at the end of the second year. The examination is based upon the tutorials in advanced physiology and is designed to test the student's ability to organize a body of knowledge and to think critically. Some time during the third year, the student UC IRVINE - 1985-1986320 College of Medicine will present a seminar on a topic approved by the formal can\u00ad didacy committee. Following the seminar, the committee will critically examine the student's qualifications for the success\u00ad ful conduct of the doctoral dissertation. Advancement to can\u00ad didacy for the Ph.D. is recommended to the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research upon the unanimous vote of the committee. Information on faculty research areas and course descriptions may be found in the School of Biological Sciences section. Some faculty from the Department are members of an inter\u00ad disciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group; see page 91 for a description of the program. Radiological Sciences The Department of Radiological Sciences offers graduate programs of advanced study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. Both programs are oriented toward the education and training of the superior student who has the potential and desire to become a creative and productive member of the medical or medical-related communities. A broad-based, interdisciplinary curriculum places heavy emphasis on research and is designed to provide the student with a comprehensive knowledge of the field in addition to an exceptionally high level of competence in one or more subspecialties. By utilizing the training received in medical imaging, medical physics, bioengineering, radiobiology, and radiological engineering, the student should be prepared for a wide range of career opportunities in university, hospital, or industrial settings upon completion of this program. Prospec\u00ad tive students are cautioned that the program is extremely demanding and requires a broad base of knowledge in a vari\u00ad ety of the conventional disciplines. The Department of Radiological Sciences has well-equipped research laboratories in imaging physics, radiation biology, radiation physics, radio-pharmacy, and radiological engineer\u00ad ing located on campus and at the hospitals associated with the University of California, Irvine. The core program plus additional courses as may be required by the Graduate Committee normally will require two years to complete. To receive either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree, the student must successfully complete the core courses or their equivalents. Requirements for the M.S. degree may be satisfied in one of two ways. Under Plan I, the student completes the Radiologi\u00ad cal Sciences core program with an average grade of B or above and under the direction of a faculty advisor also pre\u00ad pares a thesis that is acceptable to the thesis committee. Under Plan II, the student completes the core program plus a minimum of eight additional credits (all with an average grade of B or above) in a given area of specialization and satisfactorily passes a comprehensive written examination. Requirements for 'the Ph.D. degree may be divided into four stages. First, the student must complete the core program and take additional course work as recommended by the Graduate Committee, all with an average grade of B or above. Second~ the student must pass a written and oral qual\u00ad ifying examination given at the end of the second full year of study. A student who fails the preliminary qualifying exami\u00ad nation can, with approval from the Graduate Committee, repeat the examination the following year. Third, within a year after passing the preliminary examination, the student must pass the final oral qualifying examination covering the proposed field of research and be advanced to candidacy. Finally, a dissertation representing original research in the student's principal field of study must be prepared and defended. The dissertation, conducted under the direction of the doctoral committee, represents the major element in the doctoral program; it must be a significant contribution to the field and is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intel\u00ad lectual synthesis, and creativity. During the final quarter of graduate study the student is required to defend the disserta\u00ad tion in an oral examination conducted by the doctoral committee. Admission to the graduate program is by the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research upon recommendation of the Department and is based upon letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, previous scholarship, and other qualifications. Applicants should have a broad undergraduate background in both the physical and the bio\u00ad logical sciences as well as in mathematics. Since most stu\u00ad dents will need some additional work in one or more disci\u00ad plines, the graduate program allows for the correction of minor deficiencies during the first year, as determined by departmental review. Although the program is rigorous, it is also sufficiently flexible to allow for a wide range of interests and objectives. Individual programs of study may be arranged within the three general areas of concentration: imaging physics, radiation biology, and radiation physics. Application deadline for the fall quarter is June 1 of each year. However, to receive full consideration for financial assistance, fall quarter applications should be completed by February 1. Applications for the winter and spring quarters will be accepted only under special circumstances.

A handbook is avail\u00ad able which sets forth standards of conduct expected of UCI stu\u00ad dents. This booklet, \"Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organ\u00ad izations, and Students,\" gives rules concerning conduct and related matters, as established by the policies of the Regents and the Presi\u00ad dent of the\u00b7 University. The booklet incorporates campus regulations also. Copies are available from the Ombudsman, who is located in 260 Administration Building, and from the Student Activities Office, located in University Center. UCI Officers/Student Conduct/Student Records 325 Student Records The University of California campuses maintain various types of records pertaining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as hospital and employment records, are maintained for other specific purposes. Student records-that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students_:_include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large measure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, by the State of California Education Code, and by Uni\u00ad versity policy and procedures implementing these laws which pro\u00ad tect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the con\u00ad fidentiality of student records, and permit students access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: 1. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; 2. to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of per\u00ad sonally identifiable information from their student records; 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. to file complaints with the Department of Health and Human Services regarding alleged violations of the rights accorded them by the Act; and 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. NOTE: There are instances in which information can be disclosed without prior wrillen consent of the student. University officials may require aaess to student records in the course of the performance of their assigned duties. Further, (a) in connection with conditions of cer\u00ad tain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a iudicial order or subpoena; and (c) when authorized federal or Stale officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supported educational programs, confidential information can be disclosed with\u00ad out prior written consent of the student. There are also other situations in which the University is required to disclose information. See Poli\u00ad cies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, Part B, Section 10.7 21 for a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will release the following as personally iden\u00ad tifiable information which can be made public: Student's name; Address (campus, local, and/or permanent) and telephone numbers; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, degrees and honors received; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercol- legiate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate Univer\u00ad sity athletic teams. However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these categories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implicatiqns of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from dis\u00ad closure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the cam\u00ad pus cannot release for publication information on any honors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus UC IRVINE - 1985-1986326 Student Records/Salary and Employment Information Student Records commencement program without the written consent of the stu\u00ad dent. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a stu\u00ad dent cannot be verified for potential employers without the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruction to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that student and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in con\u00ad nection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. Types and locations of major student records maintained by the campus are listed in the following table; consult the Campus Direc\u00ad tory or building directories for room numbers. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should contact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regarding the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the Vice Chancel\u00ad lor Student Affairs or that person's designate, 260 Administration. A Personal Data Sheet is included in each quarter's registration packet which allows students to examine and update their personal data. Furthermore, during the eighth week of classes, every student is provided with a record of current term enrollment as part of his or her registration materials for the next quarter to ensure the accuracy of official enrollment. Students are urged to report offi\u00ad cially to the Registrar's Office all changes in personal data and en\u00ad rollment data. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office currently informed as changes occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the Univer\u00ad sity's student records policies and the federal Act. Copies of the Act and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Main Library. In addition, University policies are published in the booklet \"Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students-Part B,\" copies of which are available in the Student Activities Office. Complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded stu\u00ad dents by the federal Act may be filed with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA), Department of Education, 4511 Switzer Building, Washington, D.C. 20202.
