Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine, sterile needles, into specific points along these meridians. In a positive state of health, Qi flows smoothly. AYURVEDA Ayurveda is more than a complete medical system. It's a way of life. Ayurveda is the oldest continuously practiced health-care system in the world, and has its roots in India. Ayurveda is derived from the Sanskrit words: ayus (meaning life) and veda, (meaning science), or \"science of life.\" HERBAL MEDICINE Herbal medicine is a complex science and important facet of Traditional Chinese Medicine. For over 2,000 years, it has proven to be an effective form of treatment. Similar to Acupuncture, herbal medicine works by rebalancing and stimulating the body's own natural healing ability. "}
