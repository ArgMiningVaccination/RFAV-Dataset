Risk Factors Acupuncture and herbal treatments can be risky if not done by a professional. There are several risk factors that cannot be overlooked when it comes to acupuncture and these include the following things: allergies, bleeding disorders, heart disease or high [blood pressure](https://mantracare.org/hypertension/guide/blood-pressure/), pregnancy, cancerous tumors in the area of treatment such as breast cancer, an infection in the area of treatment, and previous surgery. Herbal treatments also pose many risks for patients, including the following: allergies to various ingredients of herbal remedies; interactions between herbs and other medications; side effects due to dangerous chemicals found in some plants (such as cancer-causing agents); ingestion of toxic substances contained in poisonous plant extracts like cyanide compounds). As you can see, the risks associated with acupuncture and herbal treatments are very serious. If not done by a professional or even if you do it yourself at home without consulting a doctor first, there is always that risk of death due to an allergic reaction. Before undergoing any kind of treatment involving needles, you must eradicate allergies. This is so because this could result in serious effects. Allergies to various ingredients of herbal remedies can also occur. One example is the allergy that may occur due to certain substances found in garlic. It could produce an itchy rash on the skin or face. It can also cause swelling beneath the surface of your eyes and lips, itchiness or pain within your mouth, difficulty breathing, nausea, and vomiting. Just like with acupuncture, herbal treatments should always be done under the supervision of a doctor. You can also consult professionals in the field so that you can avoid these risks brought about by allergies. You can do this especially if you have certain health problems such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. Results of Acupuncture A study showed that acupuncture was effective in treating allergies and migraines.

Conclusion Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine that doctors practice for thousands of years. Acupuncturists believe the physical and emotional health problems people experience are related to energy pathways, called meridians, in our bodies. The acupuncturist will place needles along these paths at specific points. They will insert the needle where they feel there may be a blockage or imbalance in this flow of energy. When the needle inserts into the skin it stimulates nerves which sends signals to your brain telling you how much pain you're feeling on a scale from 1-10. This process can help reset your body's natural healing abilities by balancing out its systems so they work better together again.
