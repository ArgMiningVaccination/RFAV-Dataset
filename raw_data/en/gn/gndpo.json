Introduction: Both the 1st-and 4th-pandemic outbreaks by SARS-CoV-2/3 causing COVID-19, starts in Wuhan, China, badly affecting human civilization with sever-post-COVID-diseases weakening the ability of COVID-19-vaccines to prevent-SARS-CoV-2/3-infection-or-reinfection with side effects. So, it will require proper COVID-booster-community-vaccines-doses to prevent 'Omicron' like any-'A-to-Z'-diseases as early-as-possible, fulfilling the main objectives of the current 'Community-Case-Study-Reports' are to find out the most suitable 'Biomedicines-Vaccine'. Methods: he 'community-treatments' were done with the mixture-extract of spices; Ginger, Garlic, and Turmeric forming the high-diluted 'Spices-Community-Biomedicines' dissolving @ 5-10 drops / 50ml-100ml (a half to a full cup) of moderately hot drinking water, orally administered @ 3-5 times/day at an interval of 1- 2hrs, against naturally occurring coronavirus-infections-or re-infections, for 45-60 days, before-symptom-onset illness-onset of 'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Physiology' are very-much-effective in controlling-diseases-by-boosting-natural-immunity-against coronavirus-2/3 with no side effects among the students and their parent's-community. Conclusion: The present \"Community-Treatments-Case-Study-Reports of Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Physiology Act as Archives of Preventive-Booster-Community-Vaccines Against Omicron-Like-Any-'A-to-Z'-Diseases By Immunizing Public-Health-Socio-Economy-Environment-Wildlife-Biodiversity-Conservation-Science-Technology-Communication-Applications-Ecology-Retaining-the-World-in-Old-Forms\". And only 'Archives-community-biomedicines-physiology' may save the world. Both the 1st-and 4th-pandemic outbreaks by different mutant-virus-pathogens SARS-CoV-2/3 causing COVID-19, start in Wuhan, China, badly affecting human civilization, our lives, our activity, behavior, food habits, etc. It causes globally more than 500 million coronavirus infections, and over 6.2 million mortality with emerging many-sever-post-COVID-diseases, and it affects long-term-serious-global-public-health-problems that weaken the 'ability of COVID-19-vaccines' to prevent-SARS-CoV-2/3-infection-or-reinfection, and it arises the three key questions about what's after Omicron next variant with the efficacy of the fourth dose of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine against Omicron. And on 23 May 2022, BBC News, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), warned that the world is facing \"formidable\" challenges, including Covid, the war in Ukraine, and monkeypox. It is known, that it's a less-lethal relative of smallpox, Monkeypox, that has spread in many populations around the world (in 13 countries on 4 continents), and the scientists are trying to understand why the monkeypox virus, a rare viral disease seldom detected in at least 11 non-African countries in the past week. After the outbreak was first identified in the UK, the virus began to be seen across Europe - with public health agencies in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden all confirming cases [1a,1c-3]. The Covid-19 pandemic is not over yet, but some researchers are already worrying about monkey-pox also. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the COVID-19 vaccine treatment first time for young children under five, which has already begun in June, and the pediatric patients are 28 days of age and older weighing at least 3 kilograms. Currently, 'The Guardian reports that South Africa may be entering its 'Fifth Covid wave' earlier than expected (Plate 1; In The New York Times, May 20, 2022). And globally, more than 11 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have already been administered in April 2022, but it has some side effects of vaccination like myopericarditis, and the scientist already been found that the heart inflammation risk after a COVID-19 vaccine is no different than after other shots [4,5]. To tackle these worst situations, it has already been reported that the physiology of different forms of traditional biomedicines, prepared from; ginger (Allium sativum L.) (Plate 2), are effective against COVID-19 or other viral infections or other diseases by boosting immunity [1a,6-27a]. So, the present 'Community-Treatments-Case-Study-Reports'(CTCSR) will require confirming proper COVID-booster-community-vaccines-doses to prevent 'Omicron' like any-future-'A-to-Z'-diseases as early-as-possible, and it fulfills the main objectives of the current 'Community-Treatments-Case-Study-Reports' are to find out the most suitable 'Biomedicines-Vaccine'. Now the main objectives of the current 'Community-Treatments-Case-Study' show some typical individual-preventive-and-therapeutic measures of 'CTCSR' of COVID 19 patients treated with high-diluted 'Spices-Biomedicines-Extract', prepared by mixing; ginger, turmeric, and garlic. Here, the manuscript entitled: Whole tumor volume based histogram analysis of ADC for differentiating between WHO grade II and III glioma focuses on the central idea of the manuscript [27b]. So, it will be more interesting if the author has taken care of ethical considerations while developing the manuscript as well as better understanding, and has suggested justifying the questionnaires given below: This is not considered to be a 'Clinical Case Presentation'. It is only a 'Community-Treatments-Case-Reports-Study' following the \"Integrating Research into Community Practice -Toward Increased Diversity\" [7-22,28-31]. It is the 'Community-Treatments-Case-Reports-Study' only because the \"Clinical trials of drugs are usually described based on their phase, and the FDA typically requires Phase I, II, and III trials to be conducted to determine if the drug can be approved for use (vide https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-drug-and-device-approvals/drug-development-process). It is notified in the \"Drug Target Review-COVID-19 research hub, and NIH Clinical Alerts and Advisories / Disclaimer (vide https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies#four), the U.S. National Library of Medicine, ClinicalTrials.gov\" [28-31]. This 'Community-Treatments-Case-Reports-Study'article aimed to explain the reasons why Asian spices including ginger etc., were considered special and valuable drugs with curative powers in Medieval Europe, and the spices are most widely and frequently used as medicine according to medieval medical textbooks, where the system fundamentally based on the humoral theory invented by Hippocrates and Galen, and this theory was modified by Arab physicians and imported to Europe during the Middle Ages. Asian spices with hot and dry qualities were used to balance the cold and wet European diet, and dry qualities were employed to cure diverse diseases, particularly those caused by coldness and humidity. Europeans mystified oriental spices, with the belief that they have marvelous and mysterious healing powers. Such mystification was related to the terrestrial Paradise. They believed that the oriental spices were grown in Paradise which was located in the Far East and were brought to the Earthly world along the four rivers flowing from the Paradise [6]. The questions may arise regarding \"There is no mention of the approval from an ethics committee and taking signed informed consents from participants before study initiation\". So it is necessary to provide this information. It is reported, \"In India over 3,000 years ago, Ginger, Garlic, and Turmeric formed the high-diluted 'Spices-Community-Biomedicines', primarily used as a culinary spice and traditional Indian ayurvedic medicine\". The most important active ingredient in the case of 'Turmeric' is curcuminoids with effective doses is 500-2,000 mg of turmeric per day, often in the form of an extract with a curcumin concentration that is much higher than the amounts naturally occurring in foods, and the average Indian regular diet provides around 2,000-2,500 mg of turmeric (60-100 mg of curcumin) per day, and the same amount in extract form may pack up to 1,900-2,375 mg of curcumin [6,21,31]. And turmeric and conventionally formulated curcumin products are probably safe when taken orally or applied to the skin in the recommended amounts, and it's safe to use turmeric in amounts greater than those commonly found in food while breastfeeding also [21,31,32]. Here, the High-Diluted-Turmeric Extract (TE) or turmeric MT, prepared from the turmeric-rhizome, Curcuma longa L., or 'Spices-Community-Biomedicines' is used as communitybiomedicine@1-2mg in10-20 drops are mixed in cup (100ml-150ml) of drinking-water per candidate, administered orally every-day in the early morning @once/day for thirty-days, in the 11-slam-area of Purba Bardhaman District. And the used doses are below the recommended doses. So, automatically it is no need for ethical approval or consideration for the permissible doses and safety concerns or any ethics committee and taking signed informed consent from participants before study initiation [6-22,31,32]. So, it is required \"No consent form & IRB form (https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/forms/irb-registration-form/index.html), as the study was conducted on humans\" [7-22,28-32]. Community-Treatments-Drug Preparation, based on what? Is there any community trial of these-mixture? Is there any method of validation and development? Please see the specifying below-mentioned updated study reports for doubt-clearance as follows: And recently another community case study reported 'Abstract' entitled \"Traditional-High-Diluted-Spices-Community-Bio-Medicines-Physiology Prevent Future-'X'-Diseases Improving Herbal-Medicine-Natural-Therapies-Wildlife-Biodiversity-Conservations\", has been accepted for the 'Key Note Presentation' in Scientific Webinar on \"Evidence-Based Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Scientific Sessions of Herbal Medicine, held on May 30, 2022\". It is also noted, \"In a Comparison of the Antioxidative and Anti-Diabetic Potential of Thermally Treated Garlic, Turmeric, and bio-satiation and Tapan Teacher in L.Sc., Ramnagar High School (HS), Purba Bardhaman, West Bengal, India, has followed here, the two ways of statistical analysis by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with S.E. (Standard Error), critical analyzing the significant level P<0.01 (https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/articles/one-way-vs-two-way-anova-definition-differences-assumptions-and-hypotheses-306553) were done [7-22,33-36]. The oral-community-drugs-treatments were done with the fresh 10g mixture of spices @ ratios; (Ginger + Garlic + Turmeric= 7:2:1) forming 'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Extract' (SCBE) dissolving @ 5-10 drops in the 50ml-100ml (a half to a full cup) of moderately hot sterile-distilled-or pure-drinking-water, preparing high-diluted-'Spices-Community-Biomedicines'[7-22]. The high-diluted-'Spices-Community-Biomedicines' were orally administered 3-5 times/day at an interval of 1- 2hrs, against naturally occurring coronavirus-2/3-infections-or re-infections, for 45-60 days, before-symptom-onset OR illness-onset (as a vaccine) OR onset-of-symptoms where patients in hospital-associated COVID-19 infections have been reported (clinical treatments), and the dose may be increased depending on the intensity of diseases in case of treatment advised by family-doctors [7-22]. The community samples (Plate 2) were the different close related family members as samples of COVID-19 infected or reinfected of the Burdwan Municipality, Purba Bardhaman District, West Bengal, India, with ethical consideration and permission [7-22]. The duration of oral community treatments for all age groups was 1st-December 2021 to 1st-April Ex-District Coordinator of Sishu Sathi Scheme at Department of Health and Family Welfare, Purba Bardhaman, Burdwan-713102, West Bengal, India, and his recent designation: M. O., MHT, H. O. D., Cardiac care, RTC, Reader ( Pathology), MKHMCH (JKD), and Dr. Subhas Chandra Datta, team leader, and the assistance of the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital and Chief Medical Officer of the Hospital (BMCH and CMOH) who supplied rapid antigen kits and examined (Table 1). All the information was counted for statistical analysis by the analysis of variance (ANOVA, P < 0.01). The 'Person' infected with 'Omicron' for long time, the combined-named is coined or termed as 'Personicrom' (Person + Omicron = Personicron) following the name 'Deltacron' (Delta + Omicron = Deltacron). So, Family Futurecron, 'X' + Omicron= 'X'-crone, and Nil (without infection) + Omicron = Nilocron, etc. are the combined-names [15-22]. The students, NGOs, and different volunteers organized many COVID-awareness virtual camps (VC) among the communities in different ways; using masks mandate (Plate 2), cleaning hands with soap, maintaining physical distance, and avoiding touching eyes-nose-mouth, etc. [37-39]. All the community-study samples were collected by Dr. S. C. Datta from the Hon'ble treating doctors with the help of students, communities, and NGOs, and all the data were also tried to clarify Dr. Datta [37-39]. The different students, NGO-Burdwan Green Haunter, and Students' Goal with the different communities, scholars, researchers, artists, teachers, staff, community, photographers, different scientists, academicians, clinicians, administrators, institutions, farmers, media personnel, visitors making the news and published in different medical journals [7-22,37-40] Table 1 showed the presentation of community-case-study- reports from high-diluted-biomedicines-'Spices-Community-Biomedicines'treatments in the Burdwan Municipality (Plate 1). In the Burdwan Municipality, the 20 healthy families with 108 members from 1 year to 99 years, did not follow the high-diluted 'Spices-Community-Biomedicines' schedule, with mask mandate, and they were considered as 'Control Family' for the 'Control Clinical Case Report', where 10% were symptomatic COVID-19 with 2% mortality of the comorbidity-patients, and the 32% were suffering mild, and the rest 58% were asymptomatic with Long-COVID-19. And 98% were cured after taking antibiotics with cover doses advised by specialist doctors (Table 1). The combined present-oral-community-treatments-case-study-reports of 'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Physiology' are very-much-effective in controlling-diseases-by-boosting-natural-immunity-against coronavirus-2/3 with no side effects among the students and their parent's-community (Table 1). In the recent oral community-treatments-case-study-reports, all the 6-clinical treated-family (Plate 2) of all the ages with -community-treatments-case-study-reports from high-diluted-biomedicines-'Spices-Community-Biomedicines' treatments in the Burdwan Municipality against COVID-19 showed us a 'preventive biomedicines' or were the absolute recovery only in-home quarantine (Table 1) due to treatment with the preventive--'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Exrract' on family against COVID-19, because the high-diluted-biomedicines-'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Extract' contains many different bioactive effective phytoconstituents or compounds that provided booster immunity or innate immunity preventing many diseases also like analgesic, diuretic, antifungal, vermifuge, antiulcer, laxative, antiviral, asthma, ulcers, diarrhea, swelling of the mouth or throat, and high cholesterol and hypertension, hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities [2,6-27a,30-36,41]. And these were the main reasons that all the clinically treated treatments age groups, 1year to 90 years' showed absolute recovery only in-home isolation or home quarantines where they were active or passive infection or reinfection occurred after preventive\u2014'Spices-Community-Biomedicines' (Table 1). And it may develop the blueprint with the help of 'Students-NGO-Model etc., for potential diagnostics, booster-'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Extract'-vaccines, and therapeutics against novel coronavirus-2 or omicron or any kinds of future 'X'-disease [30-40]. For these reasons, the family, ages range from one year to eight-four years suffering from COVID-19 with mild cold and cough, and were started to use the high-diluted-'Spices-Community-Biomedicines--Extract' (Table 1)-drug schedule with the 'Mask mandate', all were cured of COVID-19 within 5-15 days only [30-36]. Whereas the total-study-reports 'Control Family' for the 'Non- total-case-study-reports-presentations'(Table 1), where 10% were symptomatic COVID-19 with 2% mortality of the comorbidity-patients, and the 32% were suffering mild, and the rest 58% were asymptomatic with Long-COVID-19. And 98% were cured after taking antibiotics within 7-14 days after taking the 'antibiotic cover dose' (Table 1) advised by specialist clinical physicians and doctors [7-22, 30-36]. And low doses, \"From Vaccine-Nationalism-to-Vaccine-Equity\u2014 Finding a Path-Forward\", and it will resist COVID vaccine hesitancy against new variants, the 'Omicron' that has long been recognized as a problem in high- and middle-income nations of the world's poorest countries, lack of access to vaccines [1-3,7-22,30-36,42]. And the high-diluted -'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Extract' will be the 'Universal Future Diseases Model' like \"Only wildlife conservation may be future omicron-like-preventive-epidemic-covid-19-model enriched forestry-horticulture-agriculture-environment-health-biodiversity science-technology-communication-application-issues\" [30-36,40], and OR it was confirmed once again from the \"'Community-Case-Study-Reports' of 'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Physiology' Act as Archives of 'Preventive-Booster-Community-Vaccines' Against 'Any-'A-to-Z'-Diseases' By Immunizing Public-Health-Socio-Economy-Environment-Wildlife-Biodiversity-Conservation-Science-Technology-Communication-Applications-Ecology\". And the researchers or scientists should not fear growing COVID vaccine hesitancy in developing nations for the \"Vaccine equity: there is no time to waste, and immediately apply against Monkeypox-disease\" [1a-1c,42,43]. Very negligible limitations were seen during this \"'Community-Case-Study-Reports' of high-diluted-'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Physiology' regarding biomedicine-extract availability, preparation, consumption, and data collection. It should be noted for more success; study design, skills- procedures, sampling, availability of more population, community- trial and error, missing-data-records, statistical-data-limitations, missing-findings, all-time observations, collection of good quality data, and at last good humanity for all. It is already found the 'Omicron or other viral diseases' from this 'Community-Case-Study-Reports' with the high-diluted-'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Extract-Physiology', should be focused on the novel and significant ideas for the 'Future Research' distributing equally and preventing shortfalls and global crisis, and oath ourselves \"Vaccine equity and there is no time to waste\" [43]. Soon, it may be used as different ultra-high-diluted forms of 'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Physiology' for the 'Future-Universal-Preventive-Emergency-Pandemic-Vaccine' against any future diseases, including the recent 'Monkeypox outbreak' with all-round development [1a,1c,7-22,30-36]. In the present \"Community-Treatments-Case-Study-Reports of the Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Physiology\" were done with the mixture of spices; Ginger, Garlic, and Turmeric forming the high-diluted 'Spices-Community-Biomedicines' dissolving @ 5-10 drops / 50ml-100ml (a half to a full cup) of moderately hot drinking water, orally administered @ 3-5 times/day at an interval of 1- 2hrs, against naturally occurring coronavirus-infections-or re-infections, for 45-60 days, before-symptom-onset OR illness-onset (as a vaccine). The high-diluted-'Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Physiology' is very-much-effective again in controlling diseases by boosting natural immunity against coronavirus-2/3 with no side effects among the students and their parent's community. And the present \"present \"Community-Treatments-Case-Study-Reports of Spices-Community-Biomedicines-Physiology Act as Archives of Preventive-Booster-Community-Vaccines Against Omicron-Like-Any-'A-to-Z'-Diseases By Immunizing Public-Health-Socio-Economy-Environment-Wildlife-Biodiversity-Conservation-Science-Technology-Communication-Applications-Ecology-Retaining-the-World-in-Old-Forms Again\". And only 'Archives-community-biomedicines-physiology' may save the world even recent 'Monkeypox-diseases' also. I am thankful to the; eminent bio-satiation and biologist cum educationalist, Dr. Tapan Mondal, Teacher in L.Sc., Ramnagar High School (HS), Purba Bardhaman, West Bengal, India, for statistic calculation, and eminent educationist Sri Tapaprakash Bhattacharya for inspiration and guidance. I express my deep gratitude to Mr. Rakesh Khan, M.A., B.Ed., (Gold Medalist), Secretary, and Mr. Subhendu Bose, President with all Young Green-Members of the International NGO named Burdwan Green Haunter and Students' Goal for arranging several awareness programmed on COVID-19 with Health Care, Biomedicines, Nutritious Food, Vaccination, Agriculture, Biodiversity Conservation and Enriching Science and Technology Communication Economy Application Issues. Last but not the least; I am thankful to the eminent Senior Consultant Physician, Dr. Ranjan Mukherjee, M.B.B.S., M.D., Ex-District Coordinator, and his recent designation: M. O., MHT, H. O.
