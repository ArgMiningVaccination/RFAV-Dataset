This relatively rapid increase in obesity rates will have lasting impacts on the health and quality of life of Alaskans, as well as on the healthcare system long into the future. Two out of 3 Alaska adults are overweigh t or obese, and many of these adults are already or will soon be dealing with obesity -related health issues, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and high blood pressure. Alaska's youth are affected by obesity as well, and they too will be facing signif icant obesity -related chronic diseases in their future. The Burden of Overweight and Obesity in Alaska provides a comprehensive review of existing data that describe the extent of overweight and obesity in Alaska, and related nutrition and physical activit y factors. The following are key findings from the report. Between 1991 and 2007, the percentage of adults above a normal weight (i.e., overweight or obese) went from about half (49%) to nearly two -thirds (66%) of the adult population. During this time obe sity rates doubled (from 13% to 27%); rates of overweight remained relatively flat. 27% of high school youth are above a normal weight, with 11% obese. 36% of K -12 students in the largest school district in Alaska are above a normal weight, including 33% o f Kindergartners and first graders. Overweight and obesity are seen in all demographic subgroups in Alaska; however, disparities do exist. Adults with the highest rates of obesity are: o American Indians/Alaska Natives (31%) compared to White Alaskans (25%) o Older Alaskans (e.g., 55 - to 64 -year-olds (33%) compared to 18 - to 24 -year- olds (13%)) o Women with low household incomes (less than $15,000 annually; 39%) compared to women with incomes over $75,000 (22%) o Women with little educational attainment (less than high school; 33%) compared to women who have graduated from college (22%) o Alaskans living in rural Alaska (30%) compared to all other regions (25% - 26%) Obesity is associated with a number of poor health outcomes among Alaska adults. For example, compared t o those who are normal weight or underweight, obese Alaskans are: o twice as likely to report their health status as fair or poor (21% vs.10%) o more than twice as likely to have high blood pressure (37% vs. 15%) o 6 times more likely to have diabetes (13% vs. 2 %) Obesity and its contributors are linked to poor academic performance among Alaska high school youth. For example, 72% of normal weight students report getting mostly A's and B's, compared to only 56% of obese students. 27% of Alaska adults are not getti ng the recommended levels of physical activity. There are many disparities associated with meeting these recommendations, and the most common reason cited for not getting more physical activity is not enough time. Only 19% of high school students are get ting the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity daily. Almost half (46%) of boys and 61% of girls reported having no PE class in the previous week. One-third of adults and half of high school students have 3 or more hours of screen time (television ti me plus computer time not for work or school) daily. 75% of adults and 84% of high school students eat less than the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables daily. 22% of high school youth drink 1 or more non -diet soda per day; American Indian/ Alaska Native girls are significantly more likely to do so (35%) than are White girls (11%). Consumption of soda and other sugar -sweetened beverages is even common among 2 -year-olds\u201429% of toddlers statewide and 58% in the northern and southwest parts of Alaska consumed some in the previous day. Awareness of the recommendations regarding fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with sex, race, income, education, and region of the state. Access to healthy food in local stores is judged to be difficult or impo ssible for 15% of Alaska adults; 30% rate access to healthy food in local restaurants as difficult or impossible. Breastfeeding initiation and duration have increased significantly in Alaska over the past 15 years. Many adults have an inaccurate perception of their weight status. For example, 55% of those who are overweight identify themselves as such, and only 20% of those who are obese see themselves that way. Most adults (75%) and high school youth (63%) are trying to lose weight or maintain their curren t weight. Exercise is the most commonly reported strategy for weight management among both adults (76%) and youth (81%), followed closely by changes to diet (adults, 69%; youth, 53%). Over 90% of adults believe that parents and individuals have some or a l ot of responsibility for addressing obesity; 62% believe government has some responsibility. A majority of Alaska adults support school policies that would limit the availability of unhealthy foods in schools. In addition, 79% of Alaska adults support or strongly support a government -funded obesity prevention media campaign, and 55% support a law requiring restaurants to include nutrition information on their menus. Reversing the increasing trend of obesity will require time and a comprehensive obesity prevention program model that combines educational, clinical, environmental, and social strategies. This is the only approach that will help Alaskans address the many factors that contribute to overweight and obesity, chronic illness and even premature death. Intervention efforts must help children, adolescents and adults develop lifelong healthy habits and also ensure that the environments in which they live, attend school, work and play support healthy activity and eating choices.In the United States, the increase in overweight and obesity has been so substantial and dramatic that it is commonly described as epidemic.1 The epidemic has sprea d through all 50 states, within all racial and ethnic subgroups, and among all socioeconomic and age groups. According to the Institute of Medicine, ...we have learned that excess weight has significant and troublesome health consequences, yet we neverth eless see our population, in general, and our children, in particular, gaining weight to a dangerous degree and at an alarming rate.2 As is the case nationally, overweight and obesity are on the rise in Alaska, affecting individuals of all ages, from all areas of the state, of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, and with all levels of education and income. Increases in obesity have occurred rapidly, and the changes in weight that have occurred over the past 15 years will have lasting impacts on the health of individuals and of the healthcare system for decades to come. Nationally, between 1980 and 2002, obesity prevalence doubled in adults aged 20 years or older and overweight prevalence tripled in children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years.3,4 Recent prevalence estimates show that rates of obesity remain high but may be leveling off.5,6 Figure 1. Obesity Trends* Among U.S. Adults ,7 BRFSS, 1990, 1998, 2007 about 30 lbs. overweight for 5'4\" person Adults who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of premature death than those with a normal weight. Obesity and overweight are also associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, sleep apnea, asthma, and psychological disorders, as well as cancer of the endometrium, colon, kidney, gallbladder, and breast (postmenopausal).1 Children and adolescents who are overweight are more likely to be overweight or obese as adults, while high blood pressure, high cholesterol, orthopedic disorders, type 2 diabetes, and psychosocial disorders are more common among overweight youth than among those with a healthy body weight.1 The economic costs of treating the medical conditions associated with overweight and obesity are substantial. Direct medical expenditures alone for obesity are estimated to total $147 billion each year in the United States, or rough ly 9% of total spending on health care.8 Applying this fraction to total health care costs in Alaska9 yields an estimate of $477 million spent annually in Alaska for direct medical expenditures related to obesity (Eric Finkelstein, personal communication, 7/9/2009). This is surely an underestimate of the true economic costs of obesity in Alaska, as obesity also contributes to reduced life -expectancy, lost productivity, and reduced earning potential, each of which have significant economic ramifications beyo nd just direct medical costs. Individual body weight is determined by a variety of inter -related genetic, physiological, behavioral, cultural, environmental, and socioeconomic factors.1 An imbalance between energy (calori c) intake and energy expenditure is the underlying cause of overweight and obesity in most individuals. On a societal level, poor diet and physical inactivity accounted for approximately 365,000 U.S. deaths in 2000, up from 300,000 in 1990.10 If this t rend continues, physical inactivity and poor diet are likely to overtake tobacco as the leading causes of preventable death in the United States.10 The Burden of Overweight & Obesity in Alaska report is a comprehensive co llection of existing data from a variety of sources that provides the best estimates we have currently of the burden of overweight and obesity in the state. This report contains data on the extent of overweight and obesity in children, adolescents and adul ts, as well as the impact overweight and obesity has in Alaska. Data are presented on key physical activity and nutrition behaviors identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that contribute to obesity, such as sugar -sweetened bever age consumption, energy -dense foods consumption, and screen (television and computer) time; and behaviors that contribute to obesity prevention, such as breastfeeding, fruit and vegetable consumption, and physical activity.11,12 A companion brief report, The Burden of Overweight and Obesity in Alaska: Summary Report , can be found at: http://www.hss.state.ak.us/dph/chronic/obesity/pubs/obesityburden_2009.pdf . The body mass index (BMI) is used to estimate a person's risk of weight -related health problems and is calculated using weight and height (BMI = weight [kg]/height [m]2).13 Although BMI does not me asure body fat directly, research has shown that BMI is correlated with directly measured body fat.13 The BMI is used as a screening tool to identify possible weight problems for adults, but it is important to remember that BMI is only one factor related to risk for disease. Body mass index surveillance data are a reliable tool used to describe trends in weight status over time among populations and subpopulations. The BMI is the most widely used measure because it is relatively easy, inexpensive, noninvas ive, and quick to obtain. Table 1. BMI Classification for Adults 20 Years of Age and Older13 Because children and adolescents, ages 2 to 20 years, are still growing and have differences in body composition, their BMI is compared to the BMI's of other youth of the same sex and age in a reference population. T he BMI's for children and adolescents are plotted by age on a sex -specific growth chart14 to find percentile for sex and age.15 It is important to note that BMI should not be used alone to diagnose an individual child as overweight or obese. Rather, BMI sh ould be used to identify children and adolescents who need to be examined further by a medical care provider to obtain an informed diagnosis.16 BMI Weight Status Below 18.5 Underweight 18.5 -24.9 Normal 25.0 -29.9 Overweight 30.0 and Above ObeseTable 2. BMI Classification for Children 2-20 Years Old In March 2007, the Expert Committee on the Assessment, Prevention, and Treatment of Child and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity recommended the use of the terms overweight and obese in place of the terms at -risk for overweight and ove rweight used for children and adolescents (Table 2).16 The cutoff points remain the same; however, the committee changed the terms to reflect more appropriate clinical descriptions, provide continuity with adult definitions, and avoid the vagueness of at -risk for overweight. The new terminology, overweight and obese, is used for consistency in this report. For the purposes of this report, adult BMI data are derived from self -reported height and weight measurements taken from the Behavioral Risk Facto r Surveillance System (BRFSS). Alaska BRFSS also provides data on demographics, consequences of obesity \u2014such as chronic disease prevalence, and the factors that contribute to overweight and obesity among Alaska adults. Details on this data source are inclu ded in the appendix. Data on youth BMI are derived from multiple sources, including self -reported height and weight data from the Alaska Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), and objectively measured height and weight data from school district, patient encounter, and other assistance program records. The Alaska YRBS also provides data on demographics and factors that contribute to overweight and obesity among Alaskan youth. Details on these data sources are included in the append ix.

Statewide, representative data for children younger than high school age are not available, as there is no survey or data collection system for these younger populations. Howe ver, several different programs or organizations in the state maintain or collect height and weight records for children served by their programs. Data from many of these programs were analyzed and the results are presented according to data source. One source of height and weight information is the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program, a supplemental food and nutrition program for pregnant and breastfeeding women and their children from birth to age 5. Records for Federal fiscal year 2007 (10/2006 - 9/2007) show that 22% of children ages 2 to 4 enrolled in WIC are obese.18 Rates of obesity are similar for boys and girls, and across age. The Alaska WIC program does not monitor youth overweight. An additional data source that maintains height and weight records for youth is the Resource Patient Management System (RPMS).19 Data in this system come from medical records of children who visit public health centers, regi onal Alaska Native hospitals, community health centers, and village clinics. Height and weight data for children ages 3 to 19 in 2008 were analyzed for inclusion in this report. Figure 2 7. Weight Status, Alaska Youth (3 to 19 Years), 2008 Analyzed data show that 61% of all children 3 to 19 years of age are at a normal weight.

Source: Anchorage School District health records Although statewide, representative data for children younger than high school age are not available, existing data on a variety of youth populations indicate that there is reason to be concerned about overweight among young children. In 20 07-2008, one -third of children in the Anchorage School District, the largest district in the state, entered school above a normal weight. More than 1 in 5 (22%) young children enrolled in WIC in 2007 were obese, and 37% of children seen by a public health nurse during visits to public health centers, regional Alaska Native hospitals, community health centers, or village clinics in 2008 were either overweight or obese. Trends in these data should be monitored closely, and efforts should be made to obtain sta tewide representative data for young childre n. Underweight 2% Normal weight 65%Overweight 18%Obese 15%Obesity is an important health concern because it increases the risk of numerous debilitating health conditions. BRFSS data indicate that adults who are overweight and/or obese are also more likely to report an array of other health problems than are adul ts who are at a normal weight. Figure 33.

In the 2005 BRFSS respondents were asked whether overweight and obesity were li nked with a series of health outcomes.

Prevalence of Getting Mostly A's or B's, by Select Risk Factor Groups, Alaska High School Youth, 2007 Data from the 2007 Alaska YRBS show that, compared to their normal weight peers, obese students are significantly less likely to report receiving mostly A's and B's. Higher grades are reported by students who watch fewer than 3 hours of TV, spend fewer than 3 hours on the computer or playing video games, play on at least 1 team sport, and do not drink soda. While these associations do not prove causation, the data do suggest an important link between healthy behaviors and academic achievement. hours/day 3+ hours/day team sports Any soda3+ hours/dayAlthough individual weight status is determined by many factors, the primary causes of overweight and obesity in most individuals is an imbalance between nutrition and phy sical activity.1 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity recommends that efforts to prevent and control obesity target the following areas based on the best available evidence:11,12 increas e physical activity decrease television viewing increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables decrease the consumption of sugar -sweetened beverages reduce the consumption of high energy -dense foods (high calorie foods) increase breastfeeding initiation , duration and exclusivity Each person's physical activity and nutrition behaviors are influenced by a variety of personal, social and environmental factors. An individual's food choices, for example, are shaped by a) personal preference, b) family, cultu ral, and community norms, c) cost, d) knowledge and concern about nutritional content, and e) what is available in grocery stores, restaurants, worksite ca feterias, or vending machines. Similar factors affect individual decisions about physical activity. The BRFSS and YRBS surveys collect information on adult and high school student nutrition and physical activity behaviors, while the BRFSS provides information on some of the social and environmental factors that contribute to physical inactivity and poor n utrition. On the BRFSS survey, adults are asked whether they participate in leisure time physical activity, as well as a series of questions about the duration and intensity of physical activity they participate in. Figure 41. Trend in Prevalence of No Leisure Time Physical Activity, Alaska Adults, 1991 -2007 (for years available) Although data are not available for all years since the BRFSS began in 1991, throughout the years in which data have been collected on this question, consistently one -fifth of adults have reported that they participa te in no physical activity in their spare time.

Fruits and vegetables are promoted for the prevention of obesity because of their high water and fiber content, low fat content and low energy density, all effectively reducing energy (caloric) intake.33 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2005 recommends at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day.34 Figure 94.

When asked to name the number one health issue facing Alaskans today, obesity was the number one response (26% of Alaska adults; 2005 BRFSS). When responses for lack of exercise and poor diet are added in, that figure increases to 40%. As noted by the Surgeon General, the Institute of Medicine, and other prominent health and science organizations, reducing obesity will require action on the part of individuals, organizations, and policy -makers in a wide variety of settings.1,31 The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity states that successful efforts [to prevent over weight and obesity], must focus not only on individual behavioral change, but also on group influences, institutional and community influences, and public policy.1 The BRFSS and YRBS collect information on what individuals are doing to manage their own weight, and also on support for more broad -based strategies.

The informati on presented in this report reveals disparities related to sex, age, region, race, and socioeconomic status. The high and increasing rate of obesity in Alaska, coupled with alarming data on disparities, calls for a comprehensive obesity prevention approach containing both population -wide and more targeted components. Obesity is a public health problem. To address it effectively, l ocal and statewide public and private partners must collaboratively implement public health strategies, such as: Monitor the sta tus of obesity through data collection and community health assessments. Identify populations who are the most at -risk for developing obesity. o Direct resources to increase qualitative and quantitative data collection, interpretation and evaluation of obesi ty and obesity risk behaviors in disparate populations, and for those population subgroups (i.e., school -aged children) for whom representative data are scarce. Inform, educate, and empower people about obesity issues. o Design and implement culturally appr opriate educational campaigns based on the social marketing model to include multiple components, such as community events, health screenings and mass media, to raise individual and community awareness and knowledge among disparate populations. Mobilize community partnerships to identify and address obesity issues through local organizations, systems and networks. o Partner with and support disparate communities to develop, implement, and maintain effective programs to prevent and reduce obesity. o Strengthen and increase partnerships in multiple settings (school, healthcare systems, workplace, governments), organizations not usually associated with health (faith -based organizations, labor unions), all age groups (youth, adults, and seniors), and no n-traditional partner organizations to maximize the impact of stakeholder efforts to prevent and reduce obesity and obesity risk behaviors in disparate populations. Develop policies and plans based on current best practices that support individual and community efforts to address obesity. Identify and provide funding for communities to organize, develop and implement their plans. o Secure funding that will adequately address obesity disparities within a comprehensive obesity prevention plan. Advocate for state and local policy and environmental change strategies that promote good nutrition and increased physical activity. o Engage disparate populations to promote obesity prevention policy, environmental, and systems change. Link people to needed obesity pr evention and control services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable. Assure a competent public health and personal health workforce that is trained in the current prevention, diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Evaluate effect iveness of intervention efforts, including within disparate populations, to determine what works and merits further resources and efforts. Conduct and/or support research on new evidence -based obesity prevention interventions and innovative solutions to o besity. Numerous obesity prevention strategies for worksites, schools, healthcare, and communities can be found in Alaska in Action: Statewide Physical Activity and Nutrition Plan43, which was developed by a statewide coalition of state, municipal, educational, tribal and community health organizations concerned about Alaska's growing obesity crisis. To achieve the desired population -wide impact an d reduce disparities, Alaskans must work together to address the many factors that contribute to overweight and obesity. These efforts must help children, adolescents and adults develop lifelong healthy habits and also ensure that the environments in which they live, attend school, work and play support healthy activity and eating choices.The Anchorage School District and the Alaska Division of Public Health collaborated to assess the prevalence o f overweight among children in the Anchorage School District. Height and weight measurements are routinely collected by school nurses for students in grades K - 12. The data were used to classify student weight status using BMI -for-age values within each gender according to categories defined by the National Center for Health Statistics. These data were summarized in a jointly released State of Alaska Epidemiology Bulletin in 2004 entitled, Prevalence of Overweight Among Anchorage Children: A Study of Anchor age School District Data: 1998 -2003. These data were augmented by measurements through the 2005 - 2006 academic year. The BRFSS is an anonymous telephone survey conducted by the Alaska Division of Public Health in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It aims to estimate the prevalence of behavioral risk factors in the general population that are known to be associated with the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in ad ults. The BRFSS has operated continuously in Alaska since it began in 1991. The BRFSS uses a probability (or random) sample in which all Alaska households have a known, nonzero chance of selection. The sample is stratified into 5 geographic regions, with roughly equal numbers of interviews conducted in each region. This method deliberately over - samples rural areas of the state. Respondents are randomly selected from among the adult (age 18 and older) members of each household reached through a series of ran dom telephone calls. Those living in institutions (i.e., nursing homes, dormitories) are not surveyed. The BRFSS questionnaire covers such topics as general health status, health care access, nutrition, physical activity, tobacco use, diabetes, alcohol use , women's health, injury prevention, HIV/AIDS awareness. There are also questions on the demographic characteristics of respondents. Alaska presently conducts 2 BRFSS surveys: the standard BRFSS (sponsored by the CDC) and a modified BRFSS (sponsored by the State of Alaska). Both surveys are conducted throughout the year, using separate samples drawn using the same methodology. Both the standard and modified BRFSS are weighted (separately) to compensate for the over - representation or under -representation of persons in various subgroups. The data are further weighted to adjust the distribution of the sample data so that it reflects the total population of the sampled area. The CUBS provides population -based data on preschool aged children in Alaska. During 2006, data were collected on 2 -year-olds (however starting in 2008, data collection switched to focus on 3 -year-olds). The CUBS uses the methodology of re -interviewing mothers who responded to the Alaska Pregna ncy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey soon after their child was born. Although PRAMS is conducted in almost 37 states, Alaska is 1 of only 4 states that have a follow -up survey to PRAMS. The purpose of CUBS is to provide information on heal th conditions, health care utilization, child development and other health - related behaviors of young children and to evaluate the association between prenatal and immediate postnatal factors with early childhood health and welfare. The CUBS asks questions about both the mother and her child. About 115 mothers are sent a CUBS survey in the mail every month. In 2006, the response rate was 2006. The PRAMS is a population -based survey of Alaska women who have recently delivered a live-born infant. Administered since 1990 by the Alaska Division of Public Health, PRAMS is conducted in collaboration with the CDC in 37 states to gather information on the health risk behaviors and circumstances of pregnant and post partum women. A systematic stratified sample is drawn each month from the state's live birth records for infants between 2 and 6 months of age. Sampled mothers receive a series of mailed questionnaires, and since 1997 telephone follow -up has been initiated among those who do not respond to the third mailed request. The PRAMS questionnaire addresses such topics as access to prenatal care, obstetric history, maternal use of alcohol, maternal tobacco use, nutrition, economic status, maternal stress, and early infant development and health status. Survey responses are weighted so that reported prevalences accurately describe Alaska women delivering a live -born infant during the year of the survey. In recent years the survey has had a response rate of approximate ly 77%. The RPMS is the statewide information system used by the Section of Public Health Nursing, Alaska Division of Public Health for patient services data. This is a medical database of selected patient visi t information originating from visits to public health centers, regional Alaska Native hospitals, community health centers, and village clinics. Management information taken from the data can be used for program planning and evaluation. Height and weight a re measured and recorded during clinic visits. The system includes demographic and patient health encounter data. The RPMS is located at 23 public health nursing sites and is shared by the Indian Health Service. The YRBS is a systematic survey of high school students investigating behaviors related to the leading causes of mortality, morbidity and social problems among youth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sponsors national and state surveys every 2 years i n odd years. Alaska first participated in the YRBS in 1995. The statewide survey obtained a statistically valid, representative sample in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007. Alaska was unsuccessful in its attempt to obtain a statewide representative sample in 2001 and 2005. The Alaska YRBS is conducted using a 2 -stage sampling design. Schools are selected first with a probability of inclusion proportional to the size of their enrollment. Once a school is chosen, classes are selected, with each student having an equ al opportunity for inclusion. Since 2003, active parental consent was required for each student participating in the YRBS. On the appointed survey day students completed written questionnaires and returned them in class in unmarked, sealed envelopes. Data were weighted to reflect the true distribution of Alaska high school students by sex and grade level. Following CDC guidelines for YRBS data reporting, data are suppressed in subgroup analyses for which the actual number of respondents is fewer than 100. WIC is a supplemental food and nutrition program for pregnant and breastfeeding women and their children from birth to age 5. Alaska WIC provides nutrition information, counsel ing, breastfeeding support, and periodic health screening, along with supplemental food vouchers for infant formula and healthy foods. Children's height and weight are measured and recorded at clinics as part of the application and renewal process.1. US Depa rtment of Health and Human Services.
