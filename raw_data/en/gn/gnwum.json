[recent data show](/Blog/growing-trend-increased-vaccine-confidence#_ftn1) public willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 is increasing, there is more that can be done. To increase vaccine confidence, the biopharmaceutical industry is committed to sharing open and honest information with all stakeholders so that people feel confident in getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Since the start of the pandemic PhRMA has provided regular updates about industry progress toward researching and developing potential treatments and vaccines. You can see more at [phrma.org/coronavirus](https://phrma.org/coronavirus). The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) recently kicked off its [#TeamVaccines](https://teamvaccines.ifpma.org/) digital campaign, to help build global public confidence in COVID-19 vaccines by telling the stories of the people behind them. These biopharmaceutical workers have been affected by the pandemic in similar ways to us all \u2014 by balancing work and homeschooling, supporting family members and friends in unexpected ways, or dealing with illness and loss \u2014 all while working to help bring safe and effective vaccines to the world. \"At every step [of vaccine development], the work goes through rigorous research and development processes,\" [says Rita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcWj-NEWnwo&list=PLlH2Lx7y4WvLvs1r5Qv_OkHH6_7C6Je_3&index=3), a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical researcher who is part of the #TeamVaccines campaign. \"This work is so important, for me, for my family and for us all.\" In December 2020, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) launched [COVIDVaccineFacts.org](https://www.covidvaccinefacts.org/), an educational tool that links health care providers and the public to evidenced-based information about vaccines, including vaccine safety, efficacy, availability and affordability. Amid the current pandemic, the biopharmaceutical industry has embraced its leadership role and remains committed to enhancing confidence and trust in the COVID-19 vaccines that our industry has worked tirelessly to develop, manufacturer and get to people around the world.
