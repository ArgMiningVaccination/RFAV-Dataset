II. UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY AND COLLEGE OF PHARMACY GENERAL INFORMATION A. Confidentiality and Disclosure FERPA, the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (or the Buckley Amendment), provides basic privacy rights to students in regard to their academic transcript. Under FERPA provisions, a student has the right to have his or her academic record kept separate and confidential unless he or she con - sents in writing to have it released. However, FERPA also affords that the College of Pharmacy may disclose (to University personnel) the student's academic record without the student's consent when the infor - mation is used under the following disclosure guidelines with the: 1 \"Good science\" implies having the following characteristics: evidence-based, logical, convincing, explanatory, honest, testable, and systematic. testable, and systematic.21. purpose of academic advising; 2. purpose of writing a recommendation; 3. purpose of selecting students for honorary organizations; 4. purpose of informing community-based faculty members serving as preceptors in order to improve the quality benefit to each rotation; 5. purpose pursuant to law or court order. Under this law, students have the right to have access to the academic record, which means that students have a legal right to review their academic record that includes completed examinations and course work. FERPA provides that access to the academic record must be provided within 45 days. Questions concerning this law and the University policy concerning release of academic information may be directed to the Registrar's Office at 257-8729. B. Disabilities (Physical, Mental and/or Learning) The University of Kentucky is committed to meeting its obligations pursuant to Section 504 of the Re - habilitation Act of 1973, as amended; and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 2008, as amended. An individual with a disability is defined as someone who has \" a physical or mental impairment that sub - stantially limits one or more major life activities,\" including \"caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, read - ing, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.\" Any student who has such a disability and seeks special accommodations from the University must notify the Director of Student Success and Career Development in the Office of Academic Programs of the College of Pharmacy of that disability, in writing, preferably before the beginning of the school year, but in no case later than the third day of classes for the fall semester. If a disability develops during the school year for which accommodations are requested, the student must notify Academic Affairs, in writing, as soon as he/she becomes aware of the disability. The student must also notify the coordinator of each course he/she is enrolled in of his or her anticipated accommodation in the same time frame. The student will be required to provide current documentation of the condition for which they require accommodation to the University Disability Resource Center: http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/Dis - abilityResourceCenter/ (257-2754) before any accommodations can be instituted (contact David T. Beach [dtbeac1@uky.edu]). The Disability Resource Center is located on the 4th Floor of the Multidisciplinary Science Building on the corner of Rose Street and Huguelet Drive (725 Rose Street, Suite 407 Lexington, KY 40536-0082). Notification of the condition and request for special accommodation will be referred to the same office. The Disability Resource Center will base provision of services to accommodate disabilities upon a review of current medical or psychological documentation and an assessment of current needs and appropriate services. For further information, contact the Disability Resource Center within the Office of the Dean of Students of the University at 257-2754. In order to ensure that each applicant understands this situa - tion before he or she accepts admission, the College requires each applicant to sign a document to that effect. In addition to the student's notification, request for accommodation and documentation will be kept confidential, but will be disclosed in the provision of accommodation. Students having the same accom - modation may be tested together. C. Drug Free Institution The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendment of 1989 set a standard of behavior that affects students who are on University of Kentucky property, on Uni - versity business, and or at University-sponsored events. These laws, and University policy, from which this policy is derived, define conduct related to the unlawful possession, use, dispensation, distribu - tion or manufacture of alcohol or illicit drugs. Students found in violation are subject to disciplinary action up to and including suspension or termination. The Drug-Free Institution Policy can be found in the University Bulletin. D. Drug Testing and Criminal Background Checks - CURRENTLY ENROLLED STUDENTS Drug tests (urine screens) and criminal background checks are common requirements for health care 3employment. Such requirements are also often in place for students who rotate through health care facil - ities as part of required educational experiences. Students can expect and should be prepared for them. Their completion is required for experiential education courses in the PharmD program. In addition, drug tests and/or criminal background checks may be required prior to granting of certain licenses or permits for practice by regulatory boards, some of which are required for participation in required pharmacy experiential courses. For example, Introductory and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Ex - perience courses require students to be registered as an \"intern\" with the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy. Students must be aware that: 1. Since a drug test and a criminal background check is required for enrollment and or participation in any course, and for the granting of any permit or license required for participation in a course, the expense for the test and/or check will be included in the UK College of Pharmacy annual fees. Drug tests may cost $40 - $75 and background checks may cost an additional $10 - $75. The particular tests and checks required, and related costs, are subject to change and beyond the control of the University or the College of Pharmacy. 2. If a student fails to pass a drug test and/or a criminal background check he/she may be ineligible for enrollment in experiential courses, ineligible for graduation and therefore ineligible to continue in the College of Pharmacy. Additionally, he/she may be ineligible for registration as a pharmacy intern or for licensure as a pharmacist. 3. The College of Pharmacy does not accept responsibility for any student being ineligible for coursework, continued enrollment in the College, or subsequent licensure as a pharmacist for any reason, including failure to pass a drug test or criminal background check. 4. Students who provide any false information regarding drug use or criminal offenses in any documents relating to their attendance at the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy are subject to immediate dismissal from the College. Failure to disclose correct information at any time also may be the basis for professional discipline and/or denial of licensure. 5. Any student convicted of a felony of any type or of a drug/alcohol offense while a student at the College of Pharmacy must report that offense to the Office of Academic Programs in writing within 10 days of conviction. Students failing to report misconduct/issues within the 10-day window will be subject to the Health Care College Behavioral Code: https://www.uky.edu/regs/sites/www.uky.edu.regs/files/files/HCCcode.pdf 6. Additional information regarding drug screening is provided in the \"Impaired Student Policy.\" E. Impaired Student Policy 1. Responsibilities and Assumptions It is the responsibility of the health professions to protect the safety of patients as well as promote the wellbeing of practitioners. In this context, the health care colleges extend this responsibility to health care college students. A student with a substance abuse or addiction problem may have impaired judg - ment and skills, be compromised in their learning and be unable to provide safe and competent care for his/her patients. Therefore, all members of the academic community must address abuse and addiction as it affects students in the health care colleges. This policy is based on the following assumptions: Students impaired by substance abuse or addiction compromise their educational experi - ence, the safety of patients, and the integrity of their profession. Students impaired by substance abuse or addiction compromise their health but can be successfully treated and can return to a productive level of functioning. The health care colleges are committed to the identification of abuse, intervention, refer - ral for treatment, and monitoring of recovering individuals. Students impaired by substance abuse or addiction should receive an opportunity for treatment in lieu of, before, or in concert with disciplinary action.42. Purpose The purpose of this policy is to provide a procedure to assist health care college students who are im - paired, or whose actions and/or performance provide concern for the possibility of being impaired, due to substance abuse or addiction. The role of the health care colleges is to identify students with these problems and refer them for intervention, assessment, and treatment by knowledgeable and experienced substance abuse and/or mental health professionals. All costs for assessment and treatment are the re - sponsibility of the student. 3. Procedures Each case will be addressed on an individual basis and coordinated by the Director of Student Success and Career Development or other appropriate individual, in the health care college of the student con - cerned. Students may voluntarily indicate they are impaired and will be referred for treatment. Students whose actions and/or performance provide concern for the possibility of being impaired may be required to submit to random drug tests, at the expense of the student. Examples of reasons for concern include, but are not limited to, a pattern of abnormal or erratic behavior, a marked unexpected decrease in aca - demic performance and irregular attendance or unusual absence. Upon assessment, depending on the degree of impairment and the impact on performance, a treatment plan/contract will be developed by the health care college which may impact the student's participation in the academic program. A student who is identified early and addresses the problem on an outpatient basis may have no interruption in his/her education while another student may need significant inpa - tient treatment requiring a period of time away from the academic setting. Time frames for completion of student academic programs may be adjusted depending on the treatment plan. All students must sign and follow a treatment plan/contract indicating they will remain in compliance with the recommended treatment plan. The administration and faculty of the health care college will provide support for the recovering student by accommodating the recommendations made by the treatment provider. Every effort will be made to reduce stigma that the recovering person may experience due to any necessary restriction or actions that may be instituted. Standards of confidentiality will apply to all phases of the process. If a student does not consent to participate, declines the request for a random drug test, or once evaluated does not fully comply with the terms of the student treatment plan/ contract, the student may be dismissed from the health care college after appropriate due process by the Dean of that college. F. Complaint Policy and ACPE Policies Related to Complaints Procedures below are regarding student complaints in general and those relating to the standards of ACPE policies and procedures. 1. General Concerns/Complaints Students who have concerns or complaints about any aspect of their education at the College of Pharmacy are strongly encouraged to bring them to the attention of the proper individuals at the College. Students may provide input, opinions and suggestions themselves or through their class officers. For suggestions or inquiries about specific pharmacy courses, students should consult individuals in the following order: (1) the faculty member, (2) the relevant course coordinator, (3) the Department Chair to whom the faculty member or course coordinator reports, (4) the Of - fice of Academic Programs, (5) the Office of the Dean of the College of Pharmacy. Student input is routinely solicited at Student Liaison Committee meetings held periodically throughout the semester and Student Advisory Council meetings held twice a month. In addition, student repre - sentatives serve as members of many college committees. Input is requested directly from each student through course evaluations during and at the end of each semester, year- end assess - ments at the end of each academic year, and program assessments near graduation. All sugges - tions, complaints or concerns are considered carefully. 2. Complaints Related to ACPE Standards The College of Pharmacy is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) against a set of standards, policies and procedures published by the Council and available 5at www.acpe-accredit.org. Any student may lodge a complaint against the College or the pharma - cy program related to those standards, policies and procedures. Complaints should be in writing and sent directly to the Dean of the College of Pharmacy. The student shall have the right to meet with the Dean to discuss his/her complaint within 15 working days. The Dean will consider the complaint, may discuss it with the appropriate individual or office and may request a meet - ing with the student. The Dean will respond to the student in writing within 15 working days of receipt of the complaint or the personal meeting, whichever comes later. If a student is not satisfied with the response from the Dean, the student may address his/her complaint to the entire faculty through the Faculty Secretary in writing and additionally in person if he/she chooses, within 15 working days of receiving the initial response from the Dean. The faculty will hear the student and/or consider the complaint within 30 working days of receipt and respond through the Faculty Secretary within 10 working days of consideration. A complainant may request of the Dean and/or the Faculty Secretary that his/her identity be kept confidential. This request will be honored as much as possible within the constraints of resolving the com - plaint itself. 3. Protection of Complainant All complaints, concerns and suggestions made by students and the reaction to them by the College are handled in the spirit of continuous quality improvement. No retribution against any individual complainant may be taken by any faculty member, staff member, College committee or the faculty as a whole because of the complaint. A file will be maintained for inspection by ACPE of all complaints and responses related to ACPE standards and the procedures involved to ensure the complainant's fundamental procedural due process. Students may also directly submit com - plaints on-line to ACPE. G. Speak Up We derive our strength from the pooled efforts of an inclusive community of individuals who all contrib - ute their time and talents to support the mission of the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy. We are strong because we work from a base of respect for others and shared values including integrity, professionalism, academic freedom and excellence, and personal and institutional responsibility and accountability. The UK College of Pharmacy is committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for all individ - uals that work and study at this institution. The UK College of Pharmacy is also committed to serving as a good steward of the resources that have been entrusted to it. If you witness any act that is not aligned with these values, we ask that you report the incident immediately using one of the University's many reporting methods found on the following website http://pharmacy.uky.edu/speakup . H. Discrimination and Harassment In an effort to foster an environment of respect for the dignity and worth or all members of the Universi - ty community, the University of Kentucky is committed to maintaining an environment free of prohibited discrimination. Any member of the University of Kentucky community who believes he/she has experi - enced discrimination, harassment, or retaliation may bring those concerns to the Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity (IEEO). A staff member of IEEO is available to provide information on the investigative and resolution process. More information about this process can be found at the UK (IEE0) homepage: http://www.uky.edu/eeo/ A staff member of IEEO is available to provide information on the investigative and resolution process. If you have questions related to possible discrimination and harassment issues students are also encour - aged to consult with any one of these individuals within the College: Frank Romanelli, Associate Dean for Academic Programs/Chief Academic Officer Trenika Mitchell, Assistant Dean, Diversity and Inclusion Nicole Keenan, Director of Student Success and Career Development Jason Mitchell, Director of Enrollment Management I. Diversity and Inclusion The College of Pharmacy and University of Kentucky strive to develop an environment where the value of 6diversity among students, faculty and staff is accepted, encouraged and embraced. Diversity encompass - es differences in age, ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background and unique individual style. The individual characteristics, talents and contributions of all people are valued and recognized for the unique contribution they make to our College. You should never feel unsafe, maliciously treated, or devalued. \"A bias incident is an activity or action against a person's or group's actual or perceived race, color, national origin, ethnic origin, religion, creed, age, physical or mental disability, veteran status, uniformed service, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, marital status, genetic information, social or economic status, or whether the person is a nonsmoker, as long as the person complies with University policy concerning smoking.\" The Bias Incident Support Services (BISS) website is linked HERE . J. Equal Educational and Employment Opportunities All applicants to the University of Kentucky meeting the appropriate academic requirements and tech - nical standards shall be considered for admission to any academic program thereof regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age or disability. The University is an Equal Opportunity Employer, and no applicant or employee will be discriminated against because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. K. BLS Certification All pharmacy students must obtain certification in the American Heart Association's Basic Life Support (BLS) Providers program by September 30 of the first professional year in the College of Pharmacy, and maintain certification throughout their enrollment. There are several programs available which provide training, certification and re-certification. However, the College of Pharmacy requires the BLS for Health Care Providers certification endorsed by the American Heart Association. This certification requires class - room time for hands on training and demonstration of skills. Students are required to maintain an updat - ed certification. A copy of the certification card must be kept current and on file in the Office of Academ - ic & Student Affairs while students are enrolled in pharmacy school. All BLS certifications and updates are at the expense of the student. L. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) All Medical Center students are required to complete HIPAA training that can be accomplished and ver - ified online. Conditionally accepted complete HIPAA training prior to the mandatory Orientation held in August. HIPAA requirements are federal regulations. All students are required to comply with all HIPAA requirements throughout their professional training, paying special attention to patient confidentiality. A violation of HIPAA is, at a minimum, considered a violation of the Health Care College Behavioral Code. M. Immunization Requirements As a prerequisite for Introductory and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE and APPE) in the College of Pharmacy, students are expected to have appropriate immunizations for protection of the students and the patients they may see. First year pharmacy students MUST complete all required vac - cinations by the first day of Spring Semester classes of their first professional year. Requirements not met at that time may require repeated vaccinations and may result in registration cancellation in courses for which immunizations are required. All pharmacy students MUST complete an annual TB screening. Failure to complete the TB screening and required immunizations by the deadlines stated may result in cancellation of registration and scheduling of IPPE or APPE. Pharmacy students must meet the following requirements: 1. Incoming Students Vaccine-preventable diseases continue to occur on American college campuses. In order to ensure the safest possible environment for University of Kentucky students, the University has pre-ma - triculation immunization recommendations. These are based upon recommendations and guidelines issued by the American College Health Association (ACHA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). More information on current immunization guidelines can be found at https://www.cdc. gov/vaccines/index.html which is the CDC Immunization website. The University of Kentucky strongly recommends that all incoming students be immunized before 7enrollment (either through vaccination or naturally acquired immunity). Immunization Require - ments for UK Pharmacy students with clinical responsibilities can be found at https://ukhealth - care.uky.edu/university-health-service/student-health/compliance * Students are encouraged to have all immunizations prior to initial enrollment and as a prereq - uisite for experiential education rotations. Immunizations are also available for students through the University Health Service upon enrollment. Appointments are necessary and may be made by calling 859-323-2778 . Entering PY1 students are advised not to complete a TB skin test prior to August 15, due to its likely expiration prior to their enrollment in IPPE. All immunizations are at the expense of the student. If you have questions regarding the immunization requirements, please call 859-323-INFO (4636). 2. Immunization Requirements for Students with Clinical Responsibilities An inability to comply with a specific vaccine mandate (including COVID-19) and parameters surrounding authorized exemptions may limit the placements that the Office of External Studies can reasonably or possibly accommodate given accreditation and graduation requirements as well as the sheer number of available sites. This is turn can effect a student's ability to graduate on-time. University Health Service (UHS) supports the immunization requirements for pharmacy stu - dents. More information on the UHS can be found at https://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/universi - ty-health-service/student-health/compliance These requirements have been established to help protect health care providers and their patients during encounters with one another in clinical settings. We suggest that the only exclusion to these requirements be for medical contraindica - tions. Some health systems or pharmacies outside UK HealthCare may require student pharma - cists who are assigned to experiential courses in their facilities to obtain or provide documenta - tion for immunizations or screenings in addition to the core UHS requirements below. Student pharmacists are responsible for communicating with sites as directed by the experiential educa - tion office in advance of their assigned rotation to determine any pre-rotation requirements. The compliance policies website can be found at https://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/university-health-ser - vice/student-health/compliance . 3. Annual Immunization Record Form submission Please check for updated compliance information directly on the University Health Service web - site http://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/uhs/student-health/compliance/ Students must upload their TB screening and Vaccine documents to University Health Ser - vices through the UK Healthcare MyChart Health Portal. Students may make an appointment with a nurse to receive TB screening or vaccines. Please call 859-323-APPT( 2778) for your first appointmnet at UHS. (After your first ap - pointment you should be able to schedule future appointments via MyChart), Bring paper copies of all immunization records and TB testing to University Health Service for verifica - tion at the scheduled appointment. It is very important that you inform the nurse that you are a College of Pharmacy student. Student Immunization compliance appointments are on the second floor of the University Health Service building at 830 South Limestone. Once all requirements are met, you will receive a letter in MyChart that will state that you are \"compliant.\" Download and submit a .pdf copy of your letter of compliance to COPCompliance@uky. edu. Entering Students: University Health Service (UHS) Immunization Record is due into the Academic & Student Affairs Office by the first day of spring semester classes. Download the Immunization Record issued by UHS from UK MyChart Health Portal. Entering students will be requested to submit their Immu - nization Record as an assignment to the Canvas Platform established during orientation for each incoming class. 8All Students: PY2 and PY3 students must maintain a current annual TB skin test and influenza immunization. An updated UHS issued Immunization Record must be submitted to COPCompliance@uky.edu . Once a TB test has been obtained and uploaded through the MyChart health portal, a staff nurse will complete the compliance form and provide copies to the MyChart health portal download and for submission of a digital .pdf copy to the Office of Academic Programs. N. Bloodborne Pathogens - University Health Service Educational Exposure Protocol If you come in contact with another person's blood or body fluid (e.g., through a needle stick injury or mucous membrane splash), consult the UHS Bloodborne Pathogen Occupational Exposure Protocol and the UK COP Experiential Education General Information and Course Policies. 1. Perform basic first aid: Clean the wound, skin, or mucous membrane IMMEDIATELY with soap and running water. Allow blood to flow freely from the wound. Do not attempt to squeeze or milk blood from the wound. If exposure is to the eyes, flush eyes with water or normal saline solution for several min - utes or use an eye wash station. 2. If you are located in Chandler Medical Center, locate a \"red exposure packet\" in your patient care area, this contains the Reportable Occurrence form and the Occupational Exposure form. If you are located in UK HealthCare Good Samaritan, page the nursing House Supervisor. 3. At any training site (UK or off-site) IMMEDIATELY contact University Health Services (UHS) at 859-323- APPT (2778). UHS is responsible for your overall care. To the degree possible, know if your source patient has risk factors for HIV or Hepatitis. If prophylactic treatment is recommended, it should be instituted as soon as possible after the exposure. If UHS is not open, contact the on-call UHS physician immediately by calling 859-323-5321 and ask the operator to page the University Health Service on-call physician immediately. When the physician returns your call, inform him/her that you have had a blood borne pathogen exposure. Have source patient health information at hand. Source patient testing will be organized by UHS for source patients at Chandler Medical Center by the nursing House Supervisor if at UK Good Samaritan, or by the course direc - tor for off-site students. Do not attempt to have your own blood drawn. Proper lab tests will be ordered for you by UHS personnel at the time of your visit OR you will be advised where to have your blood drawn by your course director. 4. Students on rotation within 50 miles of campus will receive ALL care at UHS. Students more than 50 miles from campus may, or may not, have care initiated at their rotation site. Contact your course di - rector. ALL STUDENTS will have ALL follow-up care at UHS. Appointments can be made with University Health Service at 859-323-APPT (2778). When reporting to UHS, the student must take a completed Re - portable Occurrence form and a completed Occupational Exposure form. For students on rotation at UK, these forms are available at the nursing units. Off-site students may obtain these forms from the course director. 5. If the UHS physician prescribes prophylactic medication, he/she will advise you of the dispensing loca - tion. For on-site students and students in the immediate Lexington area, this will usually be through the UK Pharmacy. For students more than 50 miles from UK campus, pharmacies have been identified in coordination with the AHEC site coordinators. You will be informed of this pharmacy site at clerkship orientation. 6. At the time of exposure, the student must also report the exposure to the attending physician or resi - dent. Off-site students must also notify the course director. See a complete list of Pharmacy locations and AHEC Site Coordinators (PDF) O. Smoke-Free Environment The University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center is a leader in the local and regional health care en - vironment and, as a result, has a special obligation to promote healthy activities. In fulfilling its health care mission, the Chandler Medical Center must reflect its research and education roles in its public services 9and internal operations. Since active and passive smoking have been determined by the Surgeon Gen - eral to be causes of preventable diseases, the Chandler Medical Center has established policies related to smoking and other tobacco products. Policy: The tobacco-free policy, which prohibits the use of all tobacco products on all grounds and parking areas (traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, chew, pipes, cigars, hookah or waterpipe smoking, snus, snuff, etc.), applies to all areas of the contiguous UK campus in Lexington, indoors and out. Additional information can be found at Tobacco Free Policy . 1. Inside Buildings: There are no approved smoking areas inside any Medical Center or campus building. 2. Employees: The University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center does not discriminate in hiring practices on the basis of being a smoker or a non-smoker. Applicants are informed that smoking or use of tobacco products is not allowed inside or outside of any Medical Center or campus building. 3. Sanctions: Students who violate this policy will be subject to disciplinary action under the Health Scienc - es Student Professional Behavior Code. 4. Enforcement: If an employee, visitor, patient, or student does not comply with the policy, the Medical Center Security division should be called at 323-6156. Security personnel will also assist with compliance as security rounds are made or posts are maintained. This policy has been developed to promote the health, well-being, and safety of the patients, visitors, and employees while at the Medical Center or on campus. All employees are responsible for understand - ing and enforcing this policy. Students who desire help in kicking the nicotine habit may contact the University Wellness Program at 257-3955 for information on their self-help, stop-smoking program, or contact a health care professional at University Health Service, 323-5823, for information on smoking-cessation programs in the area. P. Student Commitment, Employment and Special Considerations Success in the Doctor of Pharmacy program requires a full-time commitment. Pharmacy courses can av - erage up to seven hours per day of required classes, laboratories and other activities outside the class - room. This figure does not include the necessary study time for each course. Because of the demands of the Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum upon acceptance to the program of study, students are expected to devote their energies to the academic program. The college actively discourages employment while courses are in session and cannot take outside employment or activities into account when scheduling classes, examinations, reviews, field trips or individual course functions or special projects. Due to cur - ricular requirements course functions and/or examinations outside the normal Monday through Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM business hour time frame may occur. Clinical responsibilities include evening and weekend work. It is vital that students with external commitments of at least 20 hours each week meet with the Director of Student Success and Career Development. Director of Student Success and Career Development will discuss the rigor of the College of Pharmacy program, current course schedule, and assist the student in creating a structured study plan to support the student with his/her personal academic success. Q. Office of Academic Programs The Office of Academic Programs works closely with faculty and students to ensure that the professional curriculum is contemporary, in compliance with accreditation standards, and relevant for training phar - macists for the 21st century. OASA staff includes the Chief Academic Officer (Dr. Frank Romanelli), the Director of Education Technology (Dr. Jeff Cain), Director of Professional Studies (Dr. Penni Black), Data Management Coordinator (Ms. Kendra Harvey), and the Academic Coordinator Senior, Pedagogy Special - ist (Ms. Danielle R. Wilson). Staff provide the following services: serves as the central contact point for all issues related to curriculum assistance in development and implementation of active learning techniques and incorpo - ration of new instructional technology methods in the classroom faculty development related to pedagogy and pedagogic research10 assistance with formative and summative curricular assessment(s) coordination and oversight of faculty and course evaluations coordination and integration of curriculum content (Master Calendar--what is taught and when); support for small-group assignments and scheduling assistance to students in management of Student Liaison Committees (a forum for gather - ing student feedback about instructional effectiveness) Staff provides data and consultation support for the admissions, curriculum, and assessment commit - tees and coordinates overall assessment of College of Pharmacy educational programs for continuous quality improvement. R. Facilities 1. Building Safety and Security Building safety is a number one priority for the college and the Building Emergency Action Plan (posted on the Intranet Site ) is a guideline for occupants to follow in case of a building wide emergency. It contains important information on procedures for several emergency scenarios and provides diagrams detailing evacuation exits, meeting locations, and severe weather shelter loca - tions for the Lee T. Todd Jr. building. Notable highlights from that plan include: All students must adhere to and follow emergency response and evacuation procedures, even if an examination is being administered during the relevant period. Severe weather shelters are located in the basement and in the public restrooms on each floor. In the case of a building evacuation, students must utilize the stairways found at each end of the building to access the ground floor, and then proceed immediately to the parking lot on Limestone Street across from Lee T. Todd Jr. BLDG and neighboring Speedway. Safety and Security Reminders: In the event of an emergency, building occupants should contact 911 from a campus phone or from your personal cellphone. If possible, provide a room number to expedite the reporting of emergency personnel. Cats Path (http://www.uky.edu/Police/catspath/) - information on safe walking paths on campus. SafeCats (http://www.uky.edu/Police/escort.html; 257-SAFE) - safety escort service avail - able to UK students and their guests Sunday - Thursday from 8:30pm to 1:30am except during official University holidays, breaks or during the summer. Healthcare Security (http://www.uky.edu/Police/healthcare-security.html; 323-6152) for safety escorts during after-hour times when in the Medical Center area (please call with at least 10 minutes of advanced notice) **please note faculty, staff, and students can use this** Students should register with UK Alert at http://www.uky.edu/EM/UKAlert/ . The system will send alerts to your cell phone or home numbers about emergency information from the university. Fire and emergency evacuation route maps are posted near the entrance/exit of each classroom, as well as throughout other areas of the building LiveSafe Mobile App is available to download from http://www.uky.edu/EM/LiveSafe.html This app provides reporting a crime tips, emergency response options, and a safety map of campus at all times. 2. Classroom and Building Monitoring Student images may be captured during class time by the lecture recording system present in classrooms 124, 152 and 234. In addition, the building is outfitted with video surveillance camer - as. This system is not actively monitored but can be used to view past events in case of emergen - cy and/or other security issues.113. Building Access and Hours of Occupancy In order to balance the desire to provide pharmacy students sufficient opportunities to utilize small gathering and study spaces in the Lee T. Todd Jr. Building (College of Pharmacy), along with the need to ensure adequate safety and security precautions are in place, the following rules have been developed in order to gain access to the building with a medical center ID badge or UK Wildcard. Student Access Professional Year 1, 2 and 3 students have badge access to perimeter doors and group learning rooms (GLRs; 121, 125, 131, 135, 141, 145, 151, 157 and 236) from 6:00am until midnight each weekday and weekend. Student after-hour access for informal activities (e.g., study sessions) is limited to Pharma - cy students only. Students may not occupy the building alone after hours. Pharmacy students must be accompanied by at least one other pharmacy student, pharmacy faculty or pharmacy staff member. When entering the building after hours, each student must badge-in, even though they are to be accompanied by another pharmacy badge holder (e.g., student, faculty, staff mem - ber). Each student is to exit the building before midnight. If a student exits the building, the accompanying party must also exit, if the accompanying individual is a student or a non-pharmacy badge holder. Pharmacy students may request permission for after-hours access to the building for offi - cial activities (e.g., student organization events). Such activities must be approved by the Office of Academic Programs , and security arrangements must be made accordingly. Pharmacy students must wear their ID badges and UK Wildcards at all times. If they do not wear their badges, they may be asked to exit the building. An ID badge is an original form of identification, and may not be loaned to any other individuals, including fellow pharma - cy students. In the event of a University announced cancellation of classes, the University policy is to close all buildings to student access. As such, the Todd building will be closed to student access if classes are cancelled. Any student resistant to cooperation with these occupancy rules will be reported to the Office of Academic Programs. 4. Room Reservations and Etiquette Classrooms (124, 152, 170 & 234) in the Lee T. Todd Jr. Building should be reserved by contacting the Academic and Student Affairs Office. Group Learning Rooms (GLRs) are open study spaces for students. In-room furnishings must be returned to their original layout immediately upon the conclusion of a reservation. Any additional furniture brought in for the classroom reservation must be removed before vacating. 5. Single User Restrooms Restrooms in the Lee T. Todd Jr. Building that are identified as single user restrooms are located in suite 114, suite 214, and the basement near the service elevator. 6. Lost and Found Items found in the classrooms and Group Learning Rooms will be taken to the Academic and Student Affairs suite (114) for safe keeping. At the end of each term, all unclaimed items will be donated to a non-profit organization or destroyed. III. ACADEMIC EXPECTATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS Course Bulletin 12A. Student Rights and Responsibilities All College of Pharmacy students are subject to the rights, rules and regulations governing University of Kentucky students in all matters not specifically covered in Medical Center and College documents. These rules and expectations bind students enrolled in the College of Pharmacy and are designed to pro - tect them: 1. University Students Rights and Responsibilities 2. Health Care Colleges Code of Student Professional Conduct 3. UK Behavioral Standards in Patient Care 4. Code of Student Conduct Students are also important members of the academic community at the College of Pharmacy and are expected to maintain a standard of behavior appropriately reflective of the College and the professional practice of pharmacy. B. Social Media Use Guidelines Students should avoid any activity on social media sites that could portray them, the College, the faculty and/or preceptors, the University or the pharmacy profession negatively. Some of the strongly discour - aged actions include, but are not limited to: display of vulgarity through written comments, photos, and/ or affiliations; display of language that is disrespectful to an individual or group because of age, race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation; display of photos or language that may reasonably be interpreted as condoning substance abuse; and display of any language that degrades patients. Those actions may be interpreted as violations of the Health Care Colleges Code of Student Professional Conduct. Furthermore, per HIPAA regulations, patient privacy must be maintained at all times regardless of the communication medium. C. Academic Programs Office The Office of Academic Programs is responsible for all academic aspects relating to student life and sub - sequent graduation. This includes admission, course registration, approval of elective options, require - ments and certifications, classroom scheduling, regulatory reporting requirements, and implementation of recommendations from the Academic Performance Committee. Located in Suite 114 of the Lee T. Todd Jr. Bldg., students can also reach the office by calling 859-257-5304. D. Academic Performance Students are expected to pass all courses, maintain both a semester and cumulative pharmacy GPA 2.0, successfully pass each Mile Marker examination, and fully participate in the interprofessional Collabo - ration And Team Skills (iCATS) curriculum. Individual faculty coordinators shall determine the minimum requirements needed to earn a passing score in a respective Doctor of Pharmacy degree course. Specific requirements may differ from course to course and appear in course syllabi. Failure to earn a minimum of \"C\" in any one course or failure to meet the academic standards above will prompt a review by the College of Pharmacy Academic Performance Committee. Academic rules and the function of the Academ - ic Performance Committee are explained in the UK College of Pharmacy Rules of Shared Governance . A student who believes his/her grade in a course is inappropriate or erroneous should first contact the course coordinator for an explanation. If the answer from the course coordinator is unsatisfactory, the student should then contact the Chair of the Department responsible for the course. If the student still believes the grade received in a course is inappropriate, the student may contact the University Academic Ombud for potential appeal to the University Appeals Board. E. Academic Performance, Progress and Guidelines [US: 11/13/95; US: 4/12/2004; US: 9/2019] The Academic Performance Committee (APC) is charged with monitoring students' progress through the curriculum. The committee regularly reviews (during and at the end of each semester) the performance of each student, based on course grades and written comments regarding each student's academic per - formance and professionalism - - both of which are shared with the student and are part of the student record. The APC for each professional year consists of the course coordinators for that academic year, 13plus a standing core group of faculty. The APC will recommend an action appropriate to the particular student standing and record (i.e., proceed to the next series of courses, promotion to the next year, graduation, probation, probation with remedial action, removal from probation, academic leave, suspen - sion or other action). Recommendations for graduation are made through the Dean for approval by the Faculty. All other recommendations are made to the Dean. Students must be promoted to subsequent year standing by action of the APC. Promotion is not automatic but must be earned based on appropriate academic and professional performance and satisfactory completion of coursework. The APC may also recommend other sanctions, including but not limited to adjustment of academic load, repetition of cur - riculum segments, and referrals to appropriate services. Although the APC considers the overall record of the student in making decisions, the committee will rely on the following guiding principles: Academic Policy for Professional Students in the College of Pharmacy All students must maintain a minimum Pharmacy GPA of 2.0, pass each Mile Marker exam, fully partic - ipate in the interprofessional Collaboration And Team Skills (iCATS) curriculum, and pass each course taken during the time they are students in the College of Pharmacy. This includes all coursework, includ - ing PHR and non-PHR electives, which comprise the first through fourth professional years of the Doctor of Pharmacy degree program. Failure to earn a minimum of a \"C\" in any one course or failure to meet the academic standards outlined above will prompt a review by the APC. Repeat Options are not recognized by the College of Pharmacy for courses taken by students after enroll - ing in the College. The original grade received in each course will remain on the transcript, be averaged into the cumulative GPA, and be considered in discussions of probation and suspension regardless of any grades earned in repeated courses. [US: 5/7/2007] Further: 1. Any student with a GPA less than 2.0 in a single semester or with a cumulative GPA less than 2.0 will be placed on probation or may be suspended from the College. 2. Students who fail to earn a minimum of \"C\" in any one course may be placed on probation. The APC will determine the remediation required. 3. Students who fail to earn a minimum of \"C\" in two courses will be placed on probation and remediation may be required. The APC will determine the level of remediation required. 4. Students who fail to earn a minimum of \"C\" in three or more courses will be suspended from the College of Pharmacy, regardless of GPA. 5. Students who satisfactorily complete remediation requirements for probation will be removed from probation. 6. Students who are on probation and fail to meet the requirements for remediation or fail to meet the requirements needed to remove them from probation will be suspended. 7. Students eligible for probation on a second occasion may be suspended from the College. Probation Students who are on academic probation may not: 1. Serve as officers or committee members in any campus organization. 2. Participate in any University extracurricular activities or in the activities of any University organization if the participation involves the expenditures of any appreciable amount of time. Students on probation may have a restricted academic schedule as dictated by the APC. Students placed on probation must meet the requirements dictated by the APC before being removed from probation. If the student is judged after 2 semesters to be performing satisfactorily by the APC while taking normal academic course loads, his/her probation status may be revoked. Suspension Students suspended from the college may petition the APC for reconsideration of their case and for per - mission to re-take College of Pharmacy courses to correct their academic deficiencies (see appendix page 51 for process). That permission may or may not be granted by the APC. If a student is allowed to re-take required Doctor of Pharmacy degree courses, and the academic deficiencies have been satisfactorily ad -14dressed, these students may re-enter the College of Pharmacy but will do so on probation status. Special Considerations 1. Because of the demands of the Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum, students are expected to devote their energies to the academic program. The College cannot take outside employment or activities into account when scheduling classes, examinations, reviews, field trips, or individual course functions or special projects. 2. Due to curricular requirements, course functions and/or examinations may occur outside the normal business hours of Monday through Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM. 3. Clinical responsibilities will include evening and weekend work. 4. All College of Pharmacy students are subject to the rights, rules, and regulations governing University students in all matters not specifically covered in College of Pharmacy documents. F. UK Academic Ombud The UK Ombud is responsible for assisting students and instructors to work through and resolve academ - ic problems and conflicts. The Academic Ombud is a neutral party working as an advocate for fairness and quality. The UK Academic Ombud changes from year to year and is located at 109 Bradley Hall (257- 3737). www.uky.edu/ombud G. Graduation with Honors The Dean's Office compiles an honor roll of students who have demonstrated academic excellence by achieving at least a 3.5 grade point average while enrolled as full-time students with at least eight hours taken for a letter grade. The University confers three distinctions at graduation: Summa Cum Laude : Students graduating with a pharmacy GPA of 3.8 to 4.0 Magna Cum Laude : Students graduating with a pharmacy GPA of 3.6 to 3.79 Cum Laude : Students graduating with a pharmacy GPA of 3.4 to 3.59 H. Application for the Graduation Recognition Program and Attendance Students must apply for the graduation recognition program in the Office of Academic Programs , Room 114 Lee T. Todd Jr. Building, during the beginning of the semester in which they will be graduating. Dead - line dates for filing graduation applications are published by the University Registrar. The College conducts a graduation recognition program for PharmD, Ph.D., and MS graduates separate from UK's commencement Ceremony. All UK College of Pharmacy graduates, their families, friends, and faculty are encouraged to attend this ceremony. Information about the graduate recognition program is communicated through the Office of Academic Programs. I. Professional Outcomes and Abilities (What should you be able to do when you graduate from this program?) An institution must document how it measures the performance of its graduates in achieving specific outcomes developed by each program. Essentially this means each program must describe what its grad - uates are able to do (abilities/outcomes) and provide evidence that they have demonstrated this ability (assessment). The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), the accrediting agency for the UK College of Pharmacy, expects each College or School of Pharmacy to demonstrate that it systematically obtains out - come information and that it applies this information to bring about program improvements and enhance student achievement. Research in measuring effectiveness of instruction reveals that assessment is one method to determine if a program's expectations are being met. Assessment can measure if individuals completing a program have attained the expected outcomes of the program. If it is completed properly, assessment can provide information about what and how students learn, and it can serve as a tool to collect and utilize informa - tion for continuous improvement in the educational process. The following Outcome Statements describe 15activities and related standards of performance that are the basis for fulfilling the educational mandates in the UK College of Pharmacy, according to the College's assessment plan. General Abilities Outcomes The UKCOP student learning outcomes are derived directly from the ACPE 2016 Standards of Accredi - tation for all Colleges and Schools of Pharmacy as well as the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) Outcomes. ACPE accreditation has aligned the education outcomes standards directly to CAPE outcomes. Standard 1: Foundational Knowledge CAPE 1.1: Develop, integrate, and apply knowledge from the foundational sciences (i.e., pharma - ceutical, social/behavioral/administrative, and clinical sciences) to evaluate the scientific litera - ture, explain drug action, solve therapeutic problems, and advance population health and patient centered care. Standard 2: Essentials for Practice and Care The graduate uses knowledge, skills abilities, behaviors, and attitudes to: provide patient-centered care, manage medication use systems, promote health and wellness, and describe the influence of popula - tion-based care on patient-centered care. CAPE 2.1: Provide patient-centered care as the medication expert (collect and interpret evidence, prioritize, formulate assessments and recommendations, implement, monitor and adjust plans, and document activities). CAPE 2.2: Manage patient healthcare needs using human, financial, technological, and physical resources to optimize the safety and efficacy of medication use systems. CAPE 2.3: Design prevention, intervention, and educational strategies for individuals and com - munities to manage chronic disease and improve health and wellness. CAPE 2.4: Describe how population-based care influences patient centered care and influences the development of practice guidelines and evidence-based best practices. Standard 3: Approach to Practice and Care The graduate uses knowledge, skills abilities, behaviors, and attitudes to: educate, advocate, and col - laborate, working with a broad range of people; recognize social determinants of health; and effectively communicate verbally and nonverbally. CAPE 3.1: Identify problems; explore and prioritize potential strategies; and design, implement, and evaluate a viable solution. CAPE 3.2: Educate all audiences by determining the most effective and enduring ways to impart information and assess understanding. CAPE 3.3: Assure that patients' best interests are represented. CAPE 3.4: Actively participate and engage as a healthcare team member by demonstrating mutu - al respect, understanding, and values to meet patient care needs. CAPE 3.5: Recognize social determinants of health to diminish disparities and inequities in access to quality care. CAPE 3.6: Effectively communicate verbally and nonverbally when interacting with an individual, group, or organization. Standard 4: Personal and Professional Development The graduate uses knowledge, skills abilities, behaviors, and attitudes to: demonstrate self-awareness, leadership, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and professionalism. CAPE 4.1: Examine and reflect on personal knowledge, skills, abilities, beliefs, biases, motivation, and emotions that could enhance or limit personal and professional growth. CAPE 4.2: Demonstrate responsibility for creating and achieving shared goals, regardless of posi - tion. CAPE 4.3: Engage in innovative activities by using creative thinking to envision better ways of accomplishing professional goals. CAPE 4.4: Exhibit behaviors and values that are consistent with the trust given to the profession 16by patients, other healthcare providers, and society. J. Technical Standards The goal of the College of Pharmacy is to prepare students broadly to practice pharmacy with special emphasis on practicing in primary care settings. Regardless of eventual type of practice (e.g., commu - nity, clinic, health care system), students must demonstrate competence in those intellectual, physical and social tasks that together represent the fundamentals of being able to provide contemporary phar - maceutical care. Students will be judged by their respective program faculty not only on their scholastic achievement and ability, but also on their intellectual, physical and emotional capacities to meet the full requirements of the college's curriculum. As an advisory committee to the Dean, the Admissions Com - mittee is instructed to exercise judgment on behalf of the faculty to recommend the entering class, and to consider character, extracurricular achievement, and overall suitability for the pharmacy profession based upon information in the application, letters of recommendation, and personal interviews. The Accreditation Council on Pharmacy Education, the accrediting body for colleges and schools of phar - macy, requires that the curriculum provide a general professional education, enabling each student to eventually practice as a pharmacy generalist. This requires the development of broad knowledge, skills, behaviors, ongoing self-directed learning, and the eventual ability to deliver competent pharmaceutical care within a reasonable time frame and within the context of the legal and ethical framework of the pro - fession. The basic science curriculum includes the study of biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, molecular biology, immunology, physiology, pharmaceutics, pathology and pharmacology; all within the context of application to solving clinical problems. The practice skill curriculum includes the behavioral, adminis - trative, supervisory, economic, legal, ethical, analytical, integrative, historical and contextual aspects of practice. The basic sciences and practice skills curricula are interwoven and are designed to establish a core of knowledge necessary for understanding pharmacotherapeutics and undergoing advanced clinical training. The clinical curriculum includes diverse experience in primary care, in ambulatory and inpatient setting, and in specialized environments such as long term care, and managed care or home infusion practices. The basic science, practice skills and clinical experiences develop the ability to practice phar - macy with the goal of providing cost-effective improvement in patient outcomes, independently or with a team of other health care professionals, regardless of the future choice of practice site. The faculty requires each student to pass each required course and all of the experiential rotations to graduate. The following technical standards specify those attributes the faculty considers necessary for completing pharmacy training, enabling each graduate to subsequently enter clinical practice, residency or fellow - ship training. These standards describe the essential functions students must demonstrate in order to fulfill the requirements of a general pharmacy education, and thus, are prerequisites for entrance, con - tinuation, and graduation from the College of Pharmacy. The University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy will consider for admission any applicant who demon - strates the ability to perform or to learn to perform the skills listed in this document. Applicants are not required to disclose the nature of their disability(ies), if any, to the Admissions Committee. However, any applicant with questions about these technical standards is strongly encouraged to discuss the issue with the Chair of the Admissions Committee prior to the interview process. If appropriate, and upon the request of the applicant/student, reasonable accommodations will be provided. Certain chronic or recurrent illnesses and problems that interfere with patient care or safety may be incompatible with pharmacy training or practice. Other conditions that may lead to a high likelihood of student illness should be carefully considered. Deficiencies in knowledge base, judgment, integrity, character, or professional attitude or demeanor, which may jeopardize patient care, may be grounds for course/rotation failure and possible dismissal. A student must possess aptitude, abilities, and skills in five areas: 1) observation; 2) communication; 3) sensory and motor coordination and function; 4) conceptualization, integration and quantitative evalu - ation; and 5) behavioral and social skills, abilities and aptitude. These are described in detail below. The program faculty will monitor maintenance of these standards. Students must be able to independently perform the described functions. 1. Observation Students must be able to observe demonstrations and conduct exercises in a variety of areas related to contemporary pharmacy practice, including but not limited to, monitoring of drug 17response and preparation of specialty dosage forms. A student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand, noting nonverbal as well as verbal signals. Specific vision-related requirements include, but are not limited to the following abilities: visualizing and discriminating findings on drug or fluid monitoring tests; reading written and illustrated material; observing demonstrations in the classroom or laboratory, including projected slides and over - heads; observing and differentiating changes in body movement; observing anatomic structures; discriminating numbers and patterns associated with diagnostic and monitoring instruments and tests, and competently using instruments for monitoring drug response. 2. Communication Students must be able to relate effectively and sensitively with patients and their caregivers and or partners, and convey a sense of compassion and empathy. A student must be able to com - municate clearly with, and observe patients in order to elicit information, accurately describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive verbal as well as nonverbal communication. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. Students must be able to communicate quickly, effectively and efficiently in oral and written English with all members of the health care team. Specific requirements include but are not limited to the following abilities: communicating rapidly and clearly with the health care team on rounds; eliciting a thorough history from patients; and communicating complex findings in appropriate terms to patients and their caregivers, partners and various members of the health care team (fellow students, phy - sicians, nurses, aides, therapists, social workers, and others). Students must learn to recognize and promptly respond to emotional communication such as sadness, worry, agitation, and lack of comprehension of communication. Each student must be able to read and record observations and care plans legibly, efficiently and accurately. Students must be able to prepare and communi - cate concise but complete summaries of individual encounters and complex, prolonged encoun - ters with patients. Students must be able to complete forms or appropriately document activities according to directions in a complete and timely fashion. 3. Sensory and Motor Coordination or Function Students must have sufficient sensory and motor function to monitor drug response and to pre - pare and or dispense pharmaceuticals. A student should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to participate in the general care and emergency treatment of patients. They must be able to respond promptly to urgencies within the practice setting and must not hinder the ability of their coworkers to provide prompt care. Examples of such emergency treatment reasonably required of pharmacists include arriving quickly when called, participating in the initiation of appropriate procedures, and rapidly and accurately preparing appropriate emergency medication. 4. Intellectual-conceptual Integrative and Qualitative Abilities These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, judgment, numerical rec - ognition and synthesis. Especially important is the appropriate and rapid calculation of dosages in a variety of conditions such as renal or hepatic failure, obesity, cardiac or respiratory arrest, etc. Additionally, calculations involving appropriate dilution or reconstitution of drug products, electrolytes, etc. must be made accurately and quickly. Problem solving, a critical skill demanded of all pharmacists, requires all of these intellectual abilities and must be performed quickly, espe - cially in emergency situations. Students must be able to identify significant findings from history, physical assessment, and laboratory data; provide a reasonable explanation and analysis of the problem; determine when additional information is required; suggest appropriate medications and therapy; develop appropriate treatment plans to improve patient outcomes; develop patient counseling information at a complexity level appropriate to a particular situation; and retain and recall information in an efficient and timely manner. The ability to incorporate new information from peers or teachers, and to locate and evaluate new information from the literature to be used appropriately in formulating assessments and pharmaceutical care plans is essential, as is good judgment in patient assessment and therapeutic planning for disease management. Stu - dents must be able to identify and communicate the limits of their knowledge to others when appropriate and be able to recognize when the limits of their knowledge indicate further study or investigation is essential before participating in decision making. Students must be able to inter - pret graphs or charts describing biologic, economic or outcome relationships.5. Behavioral Attributes Empathy, integrity, honesty, concern for others, good interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that are required. Students must possess the emotional health required for full use of their intellectual abilities; the exercise of good judgment; the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the care of patients; and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients and their caregivers and partners. At times this requires the ability to be aware of and ap - propriately react to one's own immediate emotional responses and environment. For example, students must maintain a professional demeanor and organization in the face of long hours and personal fatigue, dissatisfied patients, and tired colleagues. Students must be able to develop professional relationships with patients and their caregivers and partners, providing comfort and reassurance when appropriate while protecting patient confidentiality. Students must possess adequate endurance to tolerate physical - ly taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress or with distractions. All students are at times required to work for extended periods, occasionally with rotating shifts. Students must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Students must also develop the skills necessary to in - struct and supervise technical personnel assisting with the delivery of pharmaceutical services. Students are expected to accept appropriate suggestions and criticism and if necessary, respond quickly, appropri - ately and cooperatively by modification of behavior. Effective for the Class of 2023 and beyond Revised Technical Standards - Doctor of Pharmacy Program University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy Effective for Students Entering Fall 2018 (Approved by Faculty - December 18, 2017; approved by Senate vote - May 7, 2018) The University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy (UKCOP) has a responsibility to educate competent pharmacists and prepare them to be \"practice-ready.\" In this regard graduates must be able to directly contribute to patient care and be \"team ready\" in order to work in collaboration with other healthcare providers.2 Strong foundation - al knowledge, astute clinical decision-making, and well-developed professional practice skills are the underpin - nings of pharmacist competency. Accordingly, the UKCOP has established academic and technical standards that must be met by students to successfully progress in, and graduate from, its doctor of pharmacy degree program. The UKCOP provides the following descriptions/examples to inform prospective and enrolled students of the technical standards required to complete the doctor of pharmacy curriculum and to achieve the educational outcomes deemed essential to the contemporary practice of pharmacy. The technical standards and example competencies described herein reflect the performance abilities and characteristics necessary to successfully complete the requirements of the UKCOP program and should not be viewed as all inclusive. Individuals interest - ed in applying to the UKCOP should review the technical standards in order to develop a better understanding of the skills, abilities, and behaviors required to successfully complete the doctor of pharmacy degree program. Technical standards in pharmacy at the UKCOP are derived from the 2016 Standards and Key Elements for profes - sional programs in pharmacy leading to the doctor of pharmacy degree as put forth by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education 3 and include abilities and skills in the following areas: 1. Acquiring foundational knowledge. (Standard 1) 2. Developing communication skills. (Standards 2-3) 3. Interpreting complex data in the context of patient-centered and population-based care. (Standards 2-3) 4. Integrating knowledge to establish and refine clinical judgement and professional practice skills. (Standards 2-3) 5. Incorporating appropriate professional attitudes and behaviors into pharmacy practice capabilities. (Standard 4) The UKCOP wishes to ensure that access to its facilities, programs, and services is available to all students, including students with disabilities (as defined by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008). The UKCOP provides reasonable ac - 2 ACPE standards 2016, philosophy and emphasis. 3 ACPE Standards 2016, standards and key elementscommodations to all students on a nondiscriminatory basis consistent with these legal requirements. A reason - able accommodation is a modification or adjustment to an instructional activity, equipment, facility, program or service that enables a qualified student with a disability to have an equal opportunity to fulfill the requirements necessary for graduation. To be eligible for accommodations, a student must have a documented disability of (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (2) a record of such impairment; or, (3) be regarded as having such a condition. To be qualified for admission to and on-going progression within the UKCOP doctor of pharmacy program, indi - viduals must be able to meet both our academic and technical standards, with or without reasonable accommo - dations. For further information regarding services and resources for students with disabilities and/or to request accommodations, please review the UKCOP Disability Accommodation Policy or contact the Director of Student Success and Career Development (Nicole Keenan nicole.keenan@uky.edu or 859-257-5266) in the Office of Aca - demic and Student Affairs.

Elective Courses Students must successfully complete a minimum of 8 elective credit hours as part of the PharmD grad - uation requirements. Elective coursework should not be pursued until the completion of the first pro - fessional year. A roster of approved elective courses is maintained by the Office of Academic Programs. Students may petition to have a course approved as an elective by contacting Rene Maldonado ( a.rene@ uky.edu ) to learn about the process to petition to have a course added. The first 8 credit hours of COP , or COP-approved, electives completed are used to calculate GPA within the PharmD program. Students are free to enroll in additional electives but elective hours beyond the first eight will not affect the official PharmD program GPA. 1. Electives taken at UK Pharmacy students taking elective courses should be aware that these courses do not adhere to the block exam schedule currently in place for the required core sequences. Elective course in - structors (both in the College of Pharmacy and in other departments in the university) will sched - ule exams (including finals) at their convenience. In addition, the College of Pharmacy semester schedule may differ from that in the University. It is not uncommon for the College to begin or end a semester before the general University schedule, have final exams at a time different from the general University, or have Spring Break at a time different from the University. Students should be aware of these potential scheduling conflicts when registering for electives outside of the College of Pharmacy. In addition, some electives in the University are offered by departments outside the College. Students interested in registering for such courses should be aware that there is a possibility your registration will be restricted. This means that the department or college offering the course is limiting enrollment in that course to their students only. 2. Electives NOT taken at UK Non-UK electives must be listed on the UK transcript to count toward the credit hour require - ment for graduation. To have the course listed on the UK transcript, the student should request 21a transcript from the registrar's office at the issuing institution. The transcript should be sent directly to the UK College of Pharmacy, 789 S. Limestone, Lexington, KY 40536-0596, ATTENTION: Academic Programs. Students should check their UK transcript about the middle of the next semester to make sure the process was completed. Credit for the course will transfer, but not the grade. L. Dual Degree Programs: Several dual-degree programs are available through the College of Pharmacy: PharmD/Master of Business Administration PharmD/Master of Public Administration PharmD/Master of Public Health PharmD/Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences The dual-degree programs allow students to earn both degrees in a total time period less than if the degrees were earned independently and sequentially. For example, with judicious use of electives it may be possible to complete a dual-degree program, at the same time when a PharmD alone would be earned. Admission requirements for the dual-degree programs are separate from admission to the College of Pharmacy, and a separate admission procedure must be completed, some including a GRE requirement. Admission to a dual degree program is a competitive process; not all pharmacy student applicants are guaranteed admission. Students apply to the dual-degree programs during the conclusion of their first (MBA, MPA, MPH) or second (MSPS) professional year; a prior bachelor's degree is not required. Ad - ditional information is available at http://pharmacy.uky.edu/pharmd-professional-program/dual-de - grees-and-certificates M. Pharmacy Practice Experiences/Internship Credit Academic practice experiences are called Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPEs) and Ad - vanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs). IPPEs and APPEs occur in various pharmacy practice settings including, but not limited to, ambulatory and acute care settings such as community pharmacies, hospitals and health-systems. They are provided throughout the curriculum and are graded academic experiences. PharmD students complete a minimum of 300 hours of IPPE and 42 weeks of APPE during the PharmD curriculum. Internship refers to time spent working directly with a licensed pharmacist after receiving Pharmacist Intern registration from the Board of Pharmacy. Internship in Kentucky may be acquired only under the supervision of a preceptor certified by the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy. In Ken - tucky, a minimum of 1500 hours Internship are required before a student may take the licensing exam. The Kentucky Board of Pharmacy allows IPPE and APPE hours to count as Internship hours provided students register as a Pharmacist Intern with the Board. Internship forms for the hours obtained as part of the student's academic experience will be provided and submitted to the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy by the Office of External Studies. The Kentucky Board of Pharmacy determines all internship rules and regulations independent of the College of Pharmacy. Address all questions on internship requirements directly to the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy. N. Off-Campus Course Requirement The College of Pharmacy has standards and practice requirements set forth by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education and the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy. In accordance with these mandates, the College of Pharmacy enrolls students in experiential courses (PaCE 1-6, IPPE - Community, IPPE - Institu - tional, and APPE). PaCE is an integrated course with both simulated and experiential components called Longitudinal Experiential Education in Pharmacy (LEEP). The PaCE experiential components will be con - ducted each semester during the PY1-PY3 years, primarily in locations in the Lexington and surrounding area. In addition, an immersion multi-week experiential rotation (IPPE I- Community) is required in a community-based ambulatory setting and an immersion multi-week experiential rotation (IPPE - Institu - tional) is required in an institutional/hospital setting. Students may be assigned to IPPE experiences in locations throughout the state of Kentucky. The PY4 year is composed of 8 six-week blocks with 7 six- week experiential rotations (APPE) required for graduation. Many pharmacy practice experiences are offered in sites off campus. As such, students will be required to complete one or more of these expe - riences in practice sites away from Lexington. The College of Pharmacy has a Clinical Education Center (CEC) in Louisville, KY for APPE rotations. Students admitted to the college may be assigned to a CEC for 22all APPE rotations or students may be assigned statewide to complete their APPEs. For students assigned to a CEC, this center will serve as the home base while on APPE rotations. Limited financial assistance for housing and travel is available for some sites outside of the greater Lexington area through the statewide Area Health Education Center (AHEC) system. However, students should be prepared to incur additional expenses and inconvenience while assigned to sites outside the greater Lexington area, or at sites within the CEC. Students should also be prepared to provide their own transportation to/from rotation sites. As - signments will be made as early as possible, giving students time to work with local AHEC coordinators to secure housing and make plans for off-campus experiences. Enrollment in experiential education courses (PaCE 1-6, IPPE - Community, IPPE - Institutional and APPE) requires appropriate immunization status and verification of such status, as well as an updated criminal background check and urine drug screen. To en - sure that each applicant understands this before he or she accepts admission, the College requires each applicant to sign the Statement of Acceptance. O. Application for Registration as a Pharmacist Intern/Obtaining Internship Credit The Pharmacist Intern application (Form I) must be submitted to the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy, re - questing registration as a pharmacy intern and accompanied by the fee. Intern registration is required for obtaining internship credit for experiential coursework, it must be obtained before the coursework is initiated, it lasts for six years, and it must be renewed if the student has not completed all Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) requirements by that time (the form is available from the KY Board of Pharmacy at http://pharmacy.ky.gov/). Please note: PY1 students MUST obtain their Kentucky Board of Pharmacy Internship Registration by April of their PY1 year or they may not be eligible to register for the IPPE courses. Licensure as a pharmacist in Kentucky requires a minimum of 1500 internship hours. (Please note: Other states have varied requirements, please consult the Board of Pharmacy for these states in which you plan to become licensed.) The internship requirement for licen - sure in Kentucky is met through completion of the IPPE and APPE component of the required Pharm.D. curricular core. Students who wish to receive internship credit for work experiences outside those in the curricular core should contact the Board of Pharmacy for additional information. Note: Students in the College of Pharmacy should address all questions concerning internship requirements to the Board of Pharmacy directly. The Board of Pharmacy is separate from the College of Pharmacy, and it reserves the right to change internship requirements at any time. All pharmacist interns are required to notify the Board of any changes in address within 30 days of moving. Address changes may be made electronically. Use the 'Contact Us' option on the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy web-page to submit address, employment or email changes to the Board. Please provide your license number with your in - formation. The Kentucky Board of Pharmacy has started sending important information by email. This mailing involves a 'mass email program'. Some email settings do not allow mass email messages. They will interpret these emails as spam. Please check your settings to allow emails from the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy. KENTUCKY BOARD OF PHARMACY State Office Building Annex, Suite 300 125 Holmes Street Frankfort, V. GENERAL COURSE POLICIES Unless otherwise specified in a course syllabus, the following policies will be in effect for all College of Pharmacy courses: A. Minimum Examination and Quiz Guidelines All examinations and quizzes are given in accordance with the College of Pharmacy Honor Code. 23Students are expected to behave in a manner such that no doubt could possibly exist about their academic integrity and must follow guidelines imposed by the faculty member. Generally, students should: Space themselves evenly in the exam room or sit in pre-assigned seats Place all books, papers, coats, purses, etc. in their lockers, or for exams outside the College, in the front of the room, unless exams are open-book Wear Medical Center ID badge Not wear hats Not share calculators (if calculators are allowed) Turn off cell phones, keep them off during the entire exam and not turn them back on until after hav - ing left the room Put all pens and pencils away before getting up to turn in papers Wear appropriate attire (as defined in the Personal Appearance Standards, Section III). Quietly move seats if requested to do so before or during the exam Examinations are given in a \"block\" or \"cluster\" format. Rather than being spread out during the semes - ter, exams are given over a period of several days, and may be given outside of regular class hours, in the evening or on weekends. B. Teacher/Course Evaluations The University policy on faculty performance review requires student evaluation of teaching for every course every semester (didactic and experiential). Evaluations of instructors are important to the College of Pharmacy. The College strives to continually improve and uplift its curriculum and teaching. Construc - tive criticism is valued. Course evaluations are used as part of the information for faculty evaluations, assignments for courses and curricular changes. Information is collected from students near the end of each semester, compiled and shared with individual faculty members, department chairs and the dean. Students failing to complete a course evaluation may receive an incomplete in the course until the eval - uation is received. Students should take this opportunity to provide serious input worded in an adult, professional and constructive manner. All student comments, or a summary of them, will be forwarded to faculty after grades are turned in and the Academic Performance Committee has met. C. Personal Appearance Standards As part of their development as professionals, students are expected to dress appropriately. The fol - lowing minimum standards for personal appearance have been set for students within specific settings. Additional requirements will be in effect for particular courses and experiences in the College. 1. General Statements: All students must take adequate measures to maintain good personal hygiene and a clean, neat appearance at all times. A student's attire should be commensurate with the activ - ities in which the student will participate during that day and be clean and pressed, if appropriate. Student pharmacists are required to wear their University of Kentucky ID badge at all times in addition to site-specific identification. Name badges will be worn clipped on the pocket of shirts or jackets or worn around the neck. Name badges shall NOT be worn at the waist level or in other inappropriate locations. T-shirts and sweatshirts may be worn, but they must be clean and in good condition. Garments with words or illustrations which are obscene, offensive, or unprofessional are not allowed. Tank tops, muscle shirts and bare midriffs are also not allowed. Jeans, sweatpants, and jogging suits may be worn; but garments which are dirty, torn or patched, are not allowed. Students may wear shorts, but cut-off shorts and \"short\" shorts are not allowed. Shoes should be neat, clean, and in good condition. Wearing hats during exams is not allowed. A faculty member may set forth additional standards of attire in his or her course. 242. Practice Settings and Patient Care (PaCE): Student pharmacists are expected to abide by the dress and appearance code of the participating experiential site for which they are assigned. If no policy is in place, student pharmacists should defer to the UK HealthCare standards as outlined in the Observation and Learning Experience (OLE) orientation packet . That standard states (pg. 7), \"UK HealthCare requires individuals to dress in a manner that presents a professional image to our patients, visitors, industry represen - tatives and to each other. The standards should be followed for PaCE, IDD OSCEs, MileMarker 2 and other simulated patient care experiences. 3. Parenteral Compounding Activities in the Patient Care Lab: Clean scrubs will be worn during lab manipulations of parenteral products. Closed cuff gowns may also be worn over scrubs. No jewelry of any kind, including wedding rings and watches (potential for introduction of bacteria into the work area) may be worn on any visible areas of the body during actual compounding procedures. This also includes earrings, nose rings, eyebrow rings and other visible piercings. You might consider wearing your wedding rings on a chain that can be placed inside your scrubs or using a safety pin to attach rings to an inside pocket on your scrubs. No nail polish - this includes clear polish - or artificial nails may be worn. It is also expect - ed that nails will be kept at a reasonable length. No makeup will be permitted due to the potential for flaking and contamination of sterile products. Hair coverings will be worn during all preparation activities. Masks will be worn during manipulations. Masks must cover facial hair Gloves will be worn during all manipulations. Latex-free gloves will be available for those with a latex allergy. Sterile gowns will be worn during all preparation activities. This policy is designed to provide a reasonable standard of dress and appearance for College of Pharmacy students. If a faculty member of the College deems a particular attire of any student inappropriate according to the guidelines above or according to the class syllabus, he or she may notify the student privately at any time to request that the student correct the problem. D. Class Attendance Every student is expected to attend all class sessions, including laboratories and other activities outside the classroom as deemed necessary by the course instructor, and to take all examinations . All instruc - tors determine their individual policy for class attendance, completion of assigned work, absences at announced and unannounced examinations and excused absences limited to one-fifth of class contact hours. A student has the right to expect this policy to be in the course syllabus and given to him or her by the first or second meeting of the class. Failure to comply with these rules may result in lowered grades. Faculty are required to note in the syllabus if they wish to account for class attendance when determin - ing a student's grade with specific parameters identified. The following are defined as excused absences by the University Senate Rules and general College guide - lines: Student illness or illness of a student's immediate family. (Instructors have the right to request appro - priate verification of family member's illness.) Many students will rely upon UHS when they suffer from significant illness or injury during the semester. UHS has prepared a statement about class attendance and student illnesses that is useful for students and faculty. http://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/uhs/student-health/attendance/ Needs a new site... Tier 1 documented absences are left to the discretion of the professor in the syllabus to deem acceptable or not. Tier 2 document confirms visit to UHS and can be verified. Tier 3 document is emailed to the student explaining restrictions based on illness or injury (i.e. absent from class for x number of days). Faculty should include in the syllabus a statement that a Tier 2 or Tier 3 document provided to the student by UHS is appropriate verification for an excused 25absence for illness. All excuses (UHS or outside healthcare providers) will have appropriate steps taken to ensure authenticity. Death of a member of a student's immediate family. (Instructors have the right to request appropriate verification.) A student must submit any written documentation supporting an excused absence within one week after the period of absence. Reasonable time for travel for participation in intercollegiate athletic events; travel to professional meetings for members of student professional organizations (e.g., APhA-ASP , ASHP , SNPhA or NCPA) of Pharmacy; travel for COP classes; or travel by individual students rep - resenting the College of Pharmacy in special circumstances. Consultation with instructors is highly recommended, and instructors may request documentation from appropriate College of Pharmacy personnel to verify the student's participation in the event. Major religious holidays: Students are responsible for notifying the instructor in writing of anticipated absences for their personal religious holidays before the last day to add a class at the beginning of the semester. In all cases, the student bears the responsibility for notifying the instructor before the absence and for making up any missed work. If feasible, the instructor will give the student an opportunity to make up the missed work or examination due to an excused absence during the semester in which the absence occurred. If the instructor feels that the nature of the course is such that classroom participation by the student is essential for evaluation, the instructor, if feasible, gives the student an opportunity to make up the work missed during the semester in which the absence occurred. Exceptions are made in cases of hospitalization or death of an immediate family member. In these cases, students may call 323-6163 to inform the Office of Academic Programs, which will notify the faculty of the initial absence. Experiential education absences should be reported to the preceptor at the site and to the course coordinator. How - ever, students must make arrangements to complete all missed assignments and notify their instructors of additional days of absence. For experiential education courses, internship hours must also be made up to receive full internship hours for the course. One-tenth rule: If, in the opinion of the instructor, an excused absence in excess of one-tenth of the class contact hours or the timing of the excused absences prevents the student from satisfactorily completing work for the course, the instructor counsels the students about the options of an \"I\" grade or withdrawal from the course that semester. E. Use of Digital Devices in the Classroom Beginning with the Class of 2020, students are issued an iPad for use throughout the PharmD program. The use of digital devices for purposes outside of educational use is not allowed in the classroom or prac - tice laboratory settings. In keeping with standards of the pharmacy profession, all cell phones and audio devices should be turned off or placed in silent mode while the student is in the classroom. Each instruc - tor may set a course policy pertaining to the use of certain tools (e.g., calculators, smartphones, smart watches, mobile computers) for specific uses within the classroom. F. Class Cancellations/Severe Weather Policy PharmD program operations may be temporarily suspended or altered in response to severe weather conditions. 1. Types of Alterations: Cancellation - weather conditions are sufficiently extreme to cancel ALL academic operations that day. Delayed Opening - weather conditions warrant a delayed start to academic operations. This is most often a two-hour delay (i.e., 10:00 am beginning of academic day). Mid-Day Cancellation - weather conditions arising throughout the day warrant cancelling the remain - der of that day's academic operations. 2. Impact on Course and Exam Schedules: A. Cancellation26 Courses will not meet during the period of cancellation. The course instructor may choose to reschedule the course meeting for a future day, in consultation with the Office of Aca - demic Programs. Laboratory examinations (e.g., practicals, standardized patients) will be rescheduled for a future day, in consultation with the Office of Academic Programs. Block examinations will not be held during the period of cancellation. Block examinations that were scheduled to be held during the period of cancellation will be \"shifted\" to the same time on Tuesday immediately following normally scheduled block exams. B. Delayed Opening Courses will not meet during the period of delay. The course instructor may choose to reschedule the course for a future day, in consultation with the Office of Academic Pro - grams. Laboratory course sessions that are scheduled to meet during any portion of the delay will not be held. One of two plans is likely to be invoked based upon the circumstances. When a delay is announced by the university, the course coordinator will email the class by 7:00am the day of the activity, or within 1 hour of the announcement if it occurs after 7:00am, to specify which of the following plans will be deployed. a. Plan 1: Retain schedule for all UNAFFECTED sessions, and reschedule the affected (e.g., first AM) lab to either later that day or another time. \"Another time\" could be one of the follow - ing: Pre-scheduled \"Severe Weather Lab make-up day\" A continuous 2-hour block of time in which students do not have other course work scheduled. This activity will be scheduled in consultation with Academic and Student Affairs. b. Plan 2: Retain schedule for all UNAFFECTED sessions that day and integrate the students who are affected by the delay (e.g., first AM) lab into other sessions that day. Students affected will be notified directly by the course coordinator. Block examinations will not be held during the period of a delay. All block examinations on the affected day will be \"shifted\" to later that same day according to the delayed start (e.g., for a 2-hour delay, 8:00am exam start will be shifted to 10:00am start time, 1:00pm will be shifted to 3:00pm). Should the period of the delay exceed 2 hours, examinations that were scheduled to be held during the period the delay will be \"shifted\" to the same time on Tuesday immediately following normally scheduled block exams. C. Mid-Day Cancellation Courses scheduled to meet following a mid-day cancellation will not be held. The course instructor may choose to reschedule the course meeting on a future day, in consultation with the Office of Academic and Student Affairs. Laboratory course sessions will not be conducted following a mid-day cancellation. The affected sessions will be rescheduled on a future day, in consultation with the Office of Academic and Student Affairs. Laboratory examinations (e.g., practicals, standardized patients) affected by a mid-day cancellation will be rescheduled for a future day, in consultation with the Office of Aca - demic and Student Affairs. Block examinations will not be administered following a mid-day cancellation. The Office of Academic Programs will consult with the instructors of affected courses to reschedule the examinations. D. Decision to Alter Operations Made by the University In the event of severe weather conditions during the normal business week, the College of Phar - macy professional degree (PharmD) program curriculum operates according to the University of Kentucky's Severe Weather Procedure. E. Alterations Made by the College of Pharmacy27a. The University may not announce alterations to academic operations (e.g., courses) on week - ends. Because the College of Pharmacy has required curricular elements that are delivered on weekends (e.g., block exams administered on Saturday), a decision regarding alterations on weekends will be made by the Chief Academic Officer, following consultation with the Dean or Chief Operations Officer. b. Road conditions, weather reports, local transit service, and area business and industry re - sponse will be evaluated when determining the College's plan. F. Communication about Alterations a. Alterations Made by the University Delays or cancellations made by the University will be normally made by 6 a.m. through UK Alert, the local media, UK Infoline at (859) 257-5684, UK TV Cable Channel 16, Digital Cable Channel 219, or the UK websites at www.uky.edu/uknow and www.uky.edu. Announcements reinforcing the impact of the University's alteration on pharmacy aca - demic operations will be made by the Office of Academic Programs through the official pharmacy class listservs. Mid-day cancellations will be announced by the Office of Academic and Student Affairs in classes and through posts on official pharmacy class listservs. b. Alterations Made by the College of Pharmacy Delays or cancellations made by the College of Pharmacy will be normally made by 6:00 a.m. by the Office of Academic Programs through the official pharmacy class listservs. G. Communication Considerations Reminders of this procedure may be sent by the Office of Academic Programs to course coordina - tors and class listservs prior to the administration of block exams. The communication sequence for rescheduling events (notably, block exams) is: a. The Office of Academic Programs will first communicate alterations about examination admin - istration to the course coordinators and collaborate to revise the schedule, as needed. b. Once the revisions have been made, a confirmatory email will be sent to course coordinators and examination teaching assistants (exam proctor and learning accommodations proctor). c. A final announcement of the revised schedule will be sent to course coordinators, examination teaching assistants and students. H. Impact on Testing Accommodations The same general approaches will be used to schedule examinations for students with testing accommodations, with the added considerations of suitable testing environments (e.g., class - rooms or conference rooms) and proctor availability. For example, in the case of a delay, all block examinations on the affected day will be \"shifted back\" according to the delayed start (e.g., for a 2-hour delay, 8:00am will be shifted back to 10:00am start time, 1:00pm will be shifted back to 3:00pm). If there are any accommodation schedule issues, Julianne Kravetz, Coordinator of Student Admin - istration will send an email to affected students outlining the revised plan. I. Experiential Education Courses Campus closure or schedule alteration does not apply to experiential education courses due to location variability and student travel abilities. Experiential education course attendance is con - sidered on a one-on-one basis with the preceptor and course coordinator. Any time missed due to weather for experiential courses will need to be made up due to internship requirements. G. Class & Exam Schedule Change Requests (Student-Initiated) This policy is designed for the rare occasion where a student or class wishes to change an exam or class meeting time. These steps must be followed:281. President/Class Representative (PY1 prior to officer elections): Checks academic calendar with the Office of Academic Programs to ensure no other par - ties will be affected by the change A room (s) is available; 2. President/Class Representative: Contacts the course director for approval to proceed. 3. Course Director: Approves or disapproves proceeding with the request. 4. President/Class Representative: Communicates proposal to class via the official class listserv; Email to include class course director's email address, phone number, and office number; Email to instruct any student who is opposed to the proposed change to lodge that opposi - tion with the course director within 24 hours. 5. Course Director: Allows 24 hours (or time of his/her discretion) from announcement for students to respond to the faculty member. (Not the president or representative.) There must be 100% of class support for the move; i.e. if one person does not want to change, the class cannot be moved unless the faculty member overrules. The faculty mem - ber may choose to independently accommodate students opposed to the move if he or she chooses to do so. 6. Course Director: Informs class president/representative of the decision. 7. President/Class Representative: Sends confirmed change to class via email with a copy to the course director. 8. President/Class Representative: Contacts Academic & Student Affairs Office to make arrangements (e.g., classroom reser - vation, update academic calendar) to reflect the class or exam schedule change. V. HONOR CODE (UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF PHARMACY) Students are required to adhere to the College of Pharmacy Honor Code and University regulations. Honor codes undergo periodic revision. When an existing honor code is revised and the revision(s) are accepted by the appropriate University governing council, students will be notified of the revision(s) and will be held to them. A. Introduction Students of the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy recognize that members of the pharmacy profession should subscribe to a set of ethical standards that recognize our primary obligation to the pa - tient and which foster integrity and honor within our profession. We recognize our responsibility to our patients, society, other health professionals, and self. Furthermore, we recognize the great trust society bestows on us as we serve the health care needs of our patients. Because of this responsibility, we do here - by affirm and undertake to live within the privileges and duties accorded us and required by this Code.29B. Principles 1. The purpose of the Honor Code is to promote and embrace the ideals of honesty and integrity. Furthermore, if each student and each faculty member fulfill their responsibilities to maintain these ideals, the culture promoted by the Honor Code will be maintained. 2. The Honor Code is based on the principle that a student, when placed on his or her honor, will not vio - late that trust. 3. Both students and faculty have an ethical and professional obligation to report any suspected violation. a. Student Responsibilities: Understand the definition of academic misconduct Refrain from committing any acts of academic misconduct Understand the instructions for each assignment, quiz, or examination Engage in appropriate classroom and laboratory conduct Take appropriate actions when acts of academic misconduct are observed b. Faculty Responsibilities Communicate clearly in writing the instructions for each assignment Design and administer examinations that minimize the opportunity for scholastic dis - honesty Actively and consistently promote a classroom environment conducive to learning Evaluate assignments on the basis of reasonable expectations given the difficulty of the assignment Support the Honor Code C. Prohibited Conduct 1. Lying A pharmacy student must not deliberately misrepresent the truth. Lying includes gross disregard for the truth or intentional misrepresentation within the academic setting. Students must deal honestly with patients and colleagues, and report those pharmacy students deficient in character or competence, or who engage in fraud or deception. If an individual lies concerning some matter but, later on his or her own initiative, tells the truth concerning the same matter before the individual is confronted with committing a breach of hon - or, this will be considered a mitigating factor in the case. 2. Cheating A pharmacy student must not cheat. Cheating is defined, but not limited to, the wrongful giving, taking or presenting of any information or material by a student with intent of aiding the student or another in any academic work. Cheating can also include a student intentionally listening to or participating in a discussion of any graded activity (referred to collectively hereafter as examination), which the student has yet to take. It is understood that because of the nature of the pharmacy curriculum at the UK College of Pharmacy, a certain amount of teamwork and sharing of information is necessary for completion of assignments; however , these situations will be clearly identified by the course instructor. Cheating in the context of an assignment or examination can take a variety of forms, including but not limited to: a) discussing the examination with anyone who has not taken the exam; b) giving, receiving, or soliciting unauthorized aid during any examination, take-home exam, or make-up exam before or after the regularly scheduled exam has been administered; c) using materials in any examination except those that are specifically authorized by the instructor; d) exchanging materials with another student during the examination unless authorized to do so by the written exam instructions; e) use of previous examination materials, without the consent of the instruc - tor, that would give a student a perceived unfair advantage; or e) violating any rules that the instructor has established for an examination period.303. Plagiarism All academic work, written or otherwise, submitted by students to their instructors or other academic supervisors, is expected to be the result of their own thought, research, or self- expres - sion. In cases where students feel unsure about a question of plagiarism involving their work, they are obliged to consult their instructors on the matter before submission. When students submit work purporting to be their own, but which in any way borrows ideas, or - ganization, wording or anything else from another source without appropriate acknowledgment of the facts, the students are guilty of plagiarism. Plagiarism includes reproducing someone else's work, whether it is a published article, chapter of a book, a paper from a friend or some file, or wherever. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work that a student submits as his/ her own, whoever that other person may be. Students may discuss assignments among them - selves or with an instructor or tutor, but when the actual work is done, it must be done by the student, and the student alone. When a student's assignment involves research in outside sources or information, the student must carefully acknowledge exactly what, where and how he/she has employed them. If the words of someone else are used, the student must put quotation marks around the passage in question and add an appropriate indication of its origin. Making simple changes while leaving the organization, content and phraseology intact is plagiaristic. However, nothing in these Rules shall apply to those ideas that are so generally and freely circulated as to be a part of the public domain. 4. Failure to Report an Honor Code Violation Failing to report a suspected Honor Code Violation to the Honor Code Committee (HCC) is itself a violation of the Honor Code. D. Reporting Process Students, faculty or staff shall report any suspected violation of the Honor Code directly to the Chair. E. Honor Code Committee 1. Function The HCC serves to advise the Dean of the College of Pharmacy in suspected cases of academic misconduct. Specific committee charges include: a. Administering the student inquiry process as defined by the College of Pharmacy Honor Code. b. Influencing the culture of the institution by regularly reviewing the Code and educating incoming students about the Code and regularly re-educating students, faculty and staff about the Code. c. Developing materials and fair procedures as necessary. 2. Composition, Member Selection and Roles a. There will be a standing College of Pharmacy Honor Code Committee (HCC). The HCC will consist of one Pharmacy First Year (PY1) student, two Pharmacy Second Year (PY2) students, three Pharmacy Third Year (PY3) students, four Pharmacy Fourth Year (PY4) students, one administrative staff secre - tary, and one faculty advisor from each department in the College of Pharmacy. 2022-23 Honor Code Committee Members PS Faculty Advisor, Dr. Oleg Tsodikov PPS Faculty Advisor, Dr. Holly Divine Admin Staff Secretary, Mrs. Julianne Kravetz Chair, Robby Larson (PY3) Vice elected in spring semester) b. The first PY1 student will be elected from their class in January. Each April, the PY1, PY2 and PY3 classes will each elect one additional student from their respective classes to serve on the HCC. Once elected, students will remain on the HCC until graduation, resignation by the student, removal of the student from the HCC by majority vote of the HCC, or removal of the student by the Dean for failure to maintain good academic or professional standing. A new student representative shall be elected by the class affected. c. An administrative staff member will be appointed annually by the Dean to serve as Committee Secre - tary. This member will not have voting privileges. d. Faculty advisors will be nominated by the Faculty Council and appointed by the Dean. Each term will be two years and each year new faculty advisor(s) will be appointed to replace the outgoing faculty from that department. A faculty advisor may not serve more than two consecutive terms on the HCC. Faculty advisors will not have voting privileges. e. Elections will be held annually in April by the student members of the HCC to select a Chair and Vice Chair. The term of office for each position will begin on graduation day of the year they are elected and conclude on graduation day the following year. The Chair of the HCC will be a PY3 student during the year they serve. The Chair must have at least one year of experience on the HCC to be eligible to serve. The Chair will coordinate all business of the committee, facilitate preliminary inquiries, facilitate inquiries of the HCC, and provide all official committee communications. The Vice Chair will be a PY3 student with at least one year of experience on the HCC. The Vice Chair shall serve in the absence of the Chair, or in cases in which the Chair shall recuse him/herself from participating. F. Committee Procedures (See Figure 1) 1. When a Pharmacy student, faculty member or staff member knows or suspects an Honor Code viola - tion, he/she shall report the violation to the chair of the HCC. 2. A complaint or concern shall be forwarded to the HCC chair by a student, faculty or administrator in writing or by appearance at the committee meeting. 3. When a complaint or concern is received by the HCC chair, the following shall occur within ten (10) working days: a. A preliminary inquiry panel shall be empaneled to determine if there is sufficient evidence that an Honor Code violation has occurred. b. This preliminary inquiry shall be conducted by the HCC Chair, advised by one HCC faculty advisor, and assisted by the Secretary. Two HCC student members, who are at least in their third professional year, shall be named as voting members of the panel. The HCC members in their first and second professional years may observe the inquiry but will not be voting members of the panel. c. The preliminary inquiry shall include the following: A meeting with the person who allegedly violated the Honor Code; A meeting with the person(s) who reported the alleged violation; A meeting with other witnesses with direct knowledge of the alleged violation; and A review of any other relevant evidence and the applicable policies, standards, and rules. d. A simple majority vote of the preliminary inquiry panel shall be sufficient to determine if there is sufficient evidence that an Honor Code violation occurred, or that the charges should be dis - missed. The Chair shall cast a vote only in the case of a tie. e. The preliminary inquiry panel shall complete its investigation and vote on the matter within fifteen (15) business days after being empaneled. If after the preliminary inquiry it is determined that there is not sufficient evidence that an Honor Code violation occurred, the Chair shall send official communication of the outcome of the preliminary inquiry to the alleged violator, the course instructor, the chair of the department for the corresponding course, the Academic and Student Affairs Dean, and the Dean. f. If after the preliminary inquiry it is determined that there is sufficient evidence that an Honor Code violation occurred, the HCC Chair shall notify the Dean of the preliminary inquiry panel's findings. The accused student shall receive written notice via first class mail and by email within 32the UK email system from the Dean informing him/her of (1) the charge; (2) the policies or regula - tions the student is charged with violating; and (3) the possible penalties if found responsible for the charge. g. Within fifteen (15) business days of the date the written notice is mailed to the student, the Dean shall schedule an informational meeting with the student during which the accused student shall be asked to state whether he/she is \"responsible\" or \"not responsible\" for the alleged violation of the Honor Code. The Dean shall counsel the student and outline the proposed disciplinary sanction, following a consultation with the faculty coordinator of the course in which the violation occurred, that will be imposed on the student. If the student denies responsibility for the alleged violation or refuses to comply with the proposed sanction, the Dean shall refer the matter to the Chair of the HCC for consideration by the HCC members in their fourth professional year (PY4). If the student fails to respond to the letter or fails to attend the informational meeting within the specified time period, the Dean will deem that the student has denied responsibility for the pending charges and refer the matter to the Chair of the HCC for consideration by the PY4 members of the HCC. The Chair shall: Convene the HCC, comprised of four PY4 HCC members within fifteen (15) working days of the Dean's referral of the matter. If the four members are unable to attend the hearing, the Associate Dean for Academic Programs will appoint additional students in their third or fourth professional year; Cast a vote only in the case of a tie; h. The Chair must be present for the HCC to conduct its business. i. The following procedures shall be followed by the HCC: i.

A simple majority of the voting members of the HCC shall constitute a quorum; iv. The HCC inquiry shall include the following: A meeting with the person who allegedly violated the Honor Code; A meeting with the person(s) who reported the alleged violation; A meeting with other witnesses with direct knowledge of the alleged violation; and A review of any other relevant evidence and the applicable policies, standards, and rules. The information discussed by the HCC shall be treated confidentially and shall not be discussed with those not involved with the inquiry; The standard of proof that shall apply is that a finding of responsibility is to be established by a preponderance of the evidence. A preponderance of the evidence means that there is evi - dence that it is more probable than not that the violation occurred; v. After considering all the evidence, the HCC shall reconvene without the student present to discuss and determine whether a violation of the Honor Code has occurred and, if so, to recommend a sanction to the Dean; vi. At the conclusion of its deliberations, the HCC shall provide a written report to the Dean within seven (7) business days that summarizes whether or not a violation of the Honor Code has occurred. If yes, the HCC shall recommend an appropriate sanction to the Dean in the written report. vii. If after the deliberations it is determined that an Honor Code violation did not occur, the Chair shall send official communication of the outcome of the committee's deliberations to the alleged violator, the course instructor, the chair of the department for the corre - sponding course, the Associate Dean for Academic Programs, and the Dean. j. When the Dean refers an alleged Honor Code violation for consideration by the full HCC, The Chair shall: i. Convene the HCC within fifteen (15) working days of the Dean's referral of the matter;33ii. Cast a vote only in the case of a tie; iii. The Chair must be present for the HCC to conduct its business. k. The following procedures shall be followed by the HCC: i.

The student may request that any member of the HCC be disqualified on the ground of personal bias. The Chair shall make the determination either to retain or disqualify a mem - ber; iii. A simple majority of the voting members of the HCC shall constitute a quorum; iv. The HCC inquiry shall include the following: A meeting with the person who allegedly violated the Honor Code; A meeting with the person(s) who reported the alleged violation; A meeting with other witnesses with direct knowledge of the alleged violation; and A review of any other relevant evidence and the applicable policies, standards, and rules. The information discussed by the HCC shall be treated confidentially and shall not be dis - cussed with those not involved with the inquiry; The standard of proof that shall apply is that a finding of responsibility is to be established by a preponderance of the evidence. A preponderance of the evidence means that there is evidence that it is more probable than not that the violation occurred; v. After considering all the evidence, the HCC shall reconvene without the student present to discuss and determine whether a violation of the Honor Code has occurred and, if so, to recommend a sanction to the Dean; vi. At the conclusion of its deliberations, the HCC shall provide a written report to the Dean within seven (7) business days that summarizes whether or not a violation of the Honor Code has occurred. If yes, the HCC shall recommend an appropriate sanction to the Dean in the written report. vii.

The Dean shall notify the student in writing by first class mail of the decision within seven (7) business days following the receipt of the HCC's report. The Dean shall also inform the Chair of the HCC, the course instructor, the chair of the department for the corresponding course, and the Associate Dean for Academic Programs. The Dean's decision shall be final. 2. All disciplinary sanctions imposed on a student are cumulative in nature. All prior disciplinary actions noted in a student's file may be used in the punishment phase of subsequent cases of Honor Code violations committed by that student, and may result in more severe consequences than would other - wise have been the case. 3. Sanctions imposed by the Dean for violation(s) under the Honor Code shall include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a. A written warning, including statements on expectations for future conduct and consequences if a subsequent violation of the Honor Code occurs; b. A requirement that the student perform extra academic work (failure to complete the extra work will result in a grade of E); c. A failing grade for an assignment or examination; d. A reduction in the final grade in the course by a specified number of levels; e. A final grade of E for the course; f. A final grade of XE (representing failure in a course due to an academic offense) or XF (representing 34failure in a pass\u2014fail course due to an academic offense) for the course, as defined by University Senate Rules. g. Dismissal from the College with possible readmission under conditions specified at the time of dis - missal and upon successful petition of the Dean; and h. Termination as a student without the possibility of readmission to the College. 4. The record of disciplinary cases shall be maintained in the College of Pharmacy Office Academic Pro - grams. 5. All actions of the HCC must be kept in complete confidence to ensure the protection of all participants. Any member breaching confidentiality may be subject to removal from the HCC. H.

Honor Code Case Flow VI. HEALTH CARE COLLEGES CODE OF STUDENT PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT This Code provides the standards and procedures to be used where questions of character, to be defined in terms of professional conduct, arise regarding a student enrolled in courses or programs, including clinical programs, in the health care colleges. The purpose of the HCC Code is to provide a professional behavior code that applies uniformly to all students enrolled in a degree program offered by any of the health care colleges (Dentistry, Health Sciences, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health). The full version is available online at http://www.uky.edu/regs/sites/www.uky.edu.regs/files/files/HCCcode.pdf . VII. STUDENT SUPPORT - OFFICE OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS The education of students in the College of Pharmacy is not limited to the classroom; students in the PharmD program find a world of opportunity for personal and professional development available out - side of formal classes. The choice of activities, organizations and programs found in the College and at the University of Kentucky is as diverse as the variety of coursework found in the curriculum. The Office of Academic Programs offers learning-skills training, career development and placement guidance, as - sessment and referral services, and assistance with personal issues. PharmD students may call 257-5266 to arrange appointments. This office also lends special assistance and academic advising to pre-pharmacy students. Pre-Pharmacy students should call 323-2130. In addition, Academic and Student Affairs is responsible for the coordination of special events and 36programming, including new student orientation sessions, formal academic ceremonies (e.g., Gradu - ation, employment interview fair), and student recruitment and admissions activities (e.g., Pharmacy Preview Day, admissions interviews). Ms. Nicole Keenan is the Director of Student Success and Career Development; Mr. Jason Mitchell is the Director of Enrollment Management. A. Academic & Interpersonal Services/Resources 1. Personal Counseling Pharmacy students may experience personal difficulty such as family problems, relationship issues, stress and anxiety and are highly encouraged to seek assistance or support when needed. The Office of Academic and Student Affairs provides individual help and, where appropriate, referral for a variety of academic and personal problems. Students should visit the Director of Student Success and Career Development or call 257-5266 to arrange an appointment to discuss their situation. Students are always welcome, and in most cases, a student can be seen the same day. Students also may self- refer to the Counseling Center in Frazee Hall on central campus (257- 8701) or Behavioral Health Service, located in the University Health Medical Plaza (323-5511). 2. Library Resources UK has one of the nation's major research library systems, which includes the Medical Center Li - brary, William T. Young Library, and 7 other specialized subject libraries. Collections and informa - tion resources available from UK Libraries include 4,023,142 volumes, 588,428 electronic books, and over 400 commercial databases. Services offered by the Medical Center Library include an online catalog of holdings, reference assistance, consultations, online research resources, library instruction and tours, individual and group study space, and interlibrary loans. The nearest library location for College of Pharmacy students is the Medical Center Library, MS135 Medical Science Building, which contains an electronic computer lab and full wireless access. For more informa - tion about the Medical Center Library, see libraries.uky.edu/mcl or http://libguides.uky.edu/pharma - cy or contact the College of Pharmacy liaison at 859-323-3983. 3. Academic Assistance Getting the most out of academic course work requires a great amount of effort and involves skills in time management, note taking, test taking and general organization. The Doctor of Phar - macy curriculum is rigorous and challenging. Students seeking academic assistance, study skill development, or other academic support, should contact the Office of Academic Programs at 257-5266. In addition, there are special study-skills classes offered through the University of Kentucky Thomas D. Clark Study, located in the W.T. Young Library (www.uky.edu/UGS/study/). Call 257-1356 for a listing of these classes or for an appointment with a study-skills specialist. Students dealing with test anxiety or other personal issues may seek assistance through the Uni - versity of Kentucky Counseling Center, located in Frazee Hall by calling 257-8701 to schedule an appointment. 4. Tutoring Tutoring may be provided by faculty or graduate teaching assistants. Students should seek assistance as soon as the need for additional help is apparent. Students should first request assistance from faculty. If more intensive help is required than the faculty can provide, a teaching assis - tant for the course may be assigned by the faculty member to further help. B. Tuition, Financial Aid & Payment Information Current information on tuition and fees is provided by the University of Kentucky Office of the Registrar at http://www.uky.edu/registrar . Pharmacy students are considered professional students. This has implications for financial aid, in that students who are considered professional students are not eligible for federal and state grants (Federal Pell Grant, Kentucky CAP grants and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant). This pro - fessional classification does, however, allow pharmacy students to be considered \"independent\" from their parents for most federal aid programs (the only exceptions being the Health Professions S t u - d e n t Loan Program and the Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students Program, which still requires parental income tax information on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid). This professional clas -37sification also raised the yearly and aggregate loan limit that students may borrow under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. In order to apply for any of the federal aid programs, a student must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and indicate the University of Kentucky as the college he or she plans to at - tend (Title IV code 001989). UK's priority date to complete the FAFSA is February 15 to be considered for all types of aid. Students may submit the FAFSA after February 15; however, funding for some programs may no longer be available. UK's Financial Aid office will notify pharmacy students in mid-June with the amount of aid for which they qualify. The FAFSA may be obtained on the web at www.fafsa.ed.gov. In completing the FAFSA, pharmacy stu - dents must answer \"yes\" to question 48 in Step 3 (\"will you be working on a master's or doctorate program?\"). Also, the answer to question 29 (\"Grade level during the 2019-20 school year.\") is 1st-year graduate/professional. Students who would like to be considered for the Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students Program and the Health Professions Student Loan Program MUST complete the areas of the FAFSA to include parental financial data and make sure at least one parent signs the form. Please contact the University of Kentucky Student Financial Aid Office at 859-257-3172 if you have any questions about the FAFSA or the financial aid process. The Pharmacy student contact in the UK Financial Aid Office is Ms. Robin Gray. Ms. Gray can be reached at 859-257-3172 x230. For additional information visit: http://www.uky.edu/financialaid/ . Pharmacy students should contact Rene Maldonado in the Office of Academic Programs with general questions regarding financial aid, scholarships, tuition and billing. Filing the FAFSA: In order to apply for any of the federal aid programs a student must submit a FAFSA or Renewal FAFSA online at www.fafsa.ed.gov , or complete a paper FAFSA, available in college financial aid offices. To have your information sent to the University of Kentucky, enter school code: 001989. International Student Finances Students holding an F1 or J1 visa are not eligible to apply for the FAFSA mentioned above. International students must provide proof of 1 year of funding (tuition and cost of living) by method of a bank state - ment or other document to the Director of Enrollment Management by March 15 for an I-20 to be pro - cessed. For Fall 2019, international students must show 1 year of expenses (tuition and cost of living) to total $79,500 ($52,600 - estimated tuition; $26,900 - estimated living expenses). If a student is unable to support this funding through personal funding, the student will be unable to obtain the I-20 to study at UK COP . 1. Loan Assistance With increasing tuition rates and cost-of-living increases, it is not unusual for students to borrow money to pay for some or all of their education. Federal Perkins Loans (once called National Direct Student Loans) and Federal Health Professions S t u d e n t Loans are two such coop - erative loan-funding programs available to enrolled students in need of loans to complete their professional education in the College of Pharmacy. All loans are administered by the UK Finan - cial Aid Office. Students may be eligible to receive a variety of loans through Financial Aid. For more information about the terms of these loans and for information about other loan programs available to College of Pharmacy students, contact the Office of Financial Aid, 128 Funkhouser Building, or call 257-3172, or by website at http://www.uky.edu/FinancialAid . Student Loans: Listed below are some of the loan options that pharmacy students may be eligible to receive. Federal Direct Loans - General Information A Federal Direct Loan is federal assistance which must be repaid. Repayment begins 6 months after a student falls below half-time status. The student must participate in online entrance coun - seling and must sign a promissory note. The maximum annual Federal Direct Loan amount for a professional student is $33,000. The Federal Direct Loan is an Unsubsidized Loan. The interest ac -38crues immediately. The student may either pay the interest quarterly or may request that interest be capitalized (added to the loan principle). Unsubsidized loans are not based on financial need. The annual award is $33,000. Federal Perkins Loan The Perkins Loan is a low interest, long-term federal loan. Award amounts vary depending on when the student applies, level of need, and the funding level of the school. Health Professions Student Loan The HPSL is a federal student loan and is restricted to students seeking professional degrees in pharmacy, dentistry or medicine. Loan amounts will vary according to availability of funds. Appli- cants for this loan must include parental information on the FAFSA each year. Loans for Disadvantaged Students The LDS loan, a federal loan program, is restricted to students from low income and disadvan - taged backgrounds seeking training in the health professions. Loan amount varies according to availability of funds. Applicants for this loan must include parental information on the FAFSA each year. Graduate/Professional Federal Direct PLUS loan A Graduate or Professional student is eligible to borrow up to an amount that does not exceed their cost of attendance minus other financial aid. In addition to completing the FAFSA, the bor - rower must complete the Graduate/Professional Federal Direct PLUS loan application at www. studentloans.gov . Private Student Loans: The cost of attendance is the maximum amount that a student can borrow per academic year. If one's personal need exceeds $33,000, the amount of the Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan, one can borrow additional money but it cannot exceed the cost of attendance. One can use the Graduate Plus Loan or an education loan from a private bank and/or financial services companies. Please take the time to evaluate the market offerings in order to select the best opportunity.

Address Information, Name Changes and Student Rosters The College of Pharmacy does NOT make lists of students, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc. available to anyone other than faculty and staff of the College of Pharmacy. Any group may distribute information to students in their lockers, but lists are not provided. Students are instructed NOT to distribute the lists of their classmates to individuals outside the College. Faculty should not make lists available to anyone outside the College and should instead refer all requests to the Office of Academic Programs. Students are required to make changes in their telephone and/or address listings with the Aca - demic and Student Affairs Office if they move during the semester by calling 323-6163. Students wishing to change their names must contact the Registrar's Office and complete an affidavit form. Name changes should also be reported to the UK IT Customer Service Center (257-1300), so that all computing accounts will reflect the correct name. The same is required by Kentucky Board of Pharmacy. At UK, students are also responsible for maintaining current addresses with the Registrar's Office and may do so online using myUK. Students can also use myUK to access important information, including grades, student schedules and registration information. Web resources offered by UK's colleges, departments and support services are expanding every day. Students can view and update their address, grades, schedule, student profile and other information online at https://41myuk.uky.edu . 2. Record Verification Students that need verification of his/her enrollment, attendance, training certificates, or other official documentation should contact Rene Maldonado a.rene@uky.edu for processing on behalf the of Dean's Office. 3. E-mail and Listservs Students are to use only their university email addresses to receive and distribute College of Phar - macy related material. Forwarding university email to personal email accounts has proven to be inconsistent and resulted in students not receiving pertinent information. It is the responsibility and expectation of each student to check their UK email account on a daily basis. The Office of Academic and Student Affairs operates various Listservs. Each are managed central - ly and include: PharmD student listserv: created for each professional class year (e.g., Class of 2021 = Pharm2021). COP Student Affairs listserv: used to communicate information regarding financial aid, student activities, official announcements from college administration and related infor - mation, college events, course enrollments and registration, examination scheduling and other logistics. COP Student Org Listserv: student organizational events, membership information, SAC newsletters etc. Communication about COP student organizations will be consolidated and coordinated by the Student Advisory Council. Messages about pharmacy coursework are to be disseminated through official course delivery tools (e.g., Canvas). Because posting privileges are limited to staff in the Office of Academic and Student Affairs, requests for listserv posts, including the Faculty listserv should be submitted Official University or College listservs are for the express use of disseminating information and should not be used as an invitation list for private parties, business or political endeavors. The College does NOT provide listserv addresses to individuals outside the College of Pharma - cy. Students may report problems with their email address to IT Customer Service/111 McVey Hall (support for email accounts): 257-1300 or http://www.uky.edu/its 4.

Insurance All University of Kentucky full-time students pay a mandatory Health Fee that covers a variety of services at University Health Service for free or at low cost. The Health Fee is not a health plan and is not meant to replace health coverage. Health insurance is strongly recommended for expenses not covered by the Health Fee, including most diagnostic procedures (laboratory tests, X-rays, MRIs), surgery, hospitalization, and prescription medication. 44University of Kentucky, College of Pharmacy students must maintain personal health insurance from May 1st of their first professional year through graduation in order to participate in expe - riential education. Experiential sites may require that the student pharmacist attest that they maintain personal health insurance and/or demonstrate proof of personal health insurance. UK students are invited to purchase the school-sponsored health insurance plan, the UK Student Health Plan (SHP), which is customized to complement the care provided through the Health Fee at University Health Service. Insurance information and applications will be shared with stu - dents during annual orientation and advising sessions. Additional information can be obtained by contacting Student Services in the College of Pharmacy or visiting the University of Kentucky's Student Health Plan website.

CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTED STUDENTS - ADDITIONAL INFORMATION A. Criminal Background Check / Drug Screen Policy Criminal background checks (CBC) and drug screens (DS) are becoming standard for employment, espe - cially at health care facilities, in order to enhance the safety and well-being of patients. In addition, both may be required prior to granting of licenses or permits to practice by regulatory boards. Such require - ments are in place for students who rotate through health care facilities as part of required educational experiences. The College of Pharmacy is being asked to attest that criminal background checks and drug screens, plus other requirements (e.g., CPR, HIPAA compliance, health insurance, immunizations etc.) have been completed prior to students being allowed in clinical education sites. If students are not eligi - ble for entry to clinical education sites required to complete their degree, they are not eligible for admis -46sion to the college. Some experiential education sites may require site specific background checks and drug screens in addition to those required by the College. Level one admission CBCs and DSs will therefore be performed on conditionally accepted students to the College of Pharmacy. A conditionally accepted student is one who has been given an initial offer of admission, but who has not yet satisfied all of the requirements for full admission. Subsequent CBCs and DSs will be required prior to participation or continuation in experiential education courses if the most recent CBC and DS is more than one year old (See Continuing Students). The presence of a criminal record does not mean automatic denial of admission. Failure to fully truthful - ly disclose the details of a criminal record however, can be a basis for denial. 1. Applicability, Expenses, Policy Statement and Disclosure Conditionally accepted applicants must consent to, and satisfactorily complete a criminal back - ground check and drug screen prior to final acceptance and matriculation into the College of Pharmacy. Enrollment will not be final until the completion of the admission CBC and DS with results deemed acceptable by the College. All expenses associated with admission CBCs and DSs are the responsibility of the applicant. Applicants who do not consent to the required CBC and/or DS, refuse to provide information necessary to conduct either, or provide false or misleading in - formation or samples in regard to the CBC and/or DS, will be subject to disciplinary action up to, and including, refusal of admission or dismissal from the program if the infraction is discovered after admission. By accepting admission to the College of Pharmacy the applicant also gives permission to the Col - lege of Pharmacy to conduct initial (admission) and subsequent CBCs and DSs as needed. If there is ever concern by the College of Pharmacy as to whether a student would be acceptable to any site, he/she may be asked to give permission for the College of Pharmacy to disclose the results of their CBCs and DSs to the sites where the student may do experiential education rotations. Please understand that acceptable CBC and DS by the College of Pharmacy for admission do not guarantee that a student will be eligible to complete the program or obtain a pharmacy license to practice upon graduation. A clinical education site or any licensure board may inter - pret CBC and DS information more severely, or uncover new information not revealed in previous checks and/or screens making the student ineligible to complete the program. 2. Procedures and Conditions As part of the PharmCAS Application and Supplemental Application to the College of Pharma - cy, applicants will be asked questions regarding their criminal background and given the opportu - nity to explain any incidents reported. For the purposes of this policy, a conviction is considered to be a guilty plea, a guilty verdict, an Alford Plea or a Nolo Contendere (No Contest) plea. Answers to such questions do not necessarily disqualify a student from admission, but failure to truthfully disclose information will be grounds for discipline up to and including withdrawal of conditional acceptance or termination from the program. Answers to the above questions are kept as confidential as possible and screened by the Direc - tor of Enrollment Management. Information will be retained by the college separate from other student educational and academic records and are not shared with the admissions committee but evaluated by a CBC/DS Advisory committee separate from the Admissions Committee. The CBC/ DS Advisory committee reports to the Dean as to the potential seriousness of the information disclosed and any explanations provided by the student. The CBC/DS Advisory Committee makes a recommendation as to any stipulations or requirements placed on potential conditional admission. The Dean then makes a decision as to whether this information affects the relative ranking among all applicants to the program. When applicants are given conditional acceptance to the College of Pharmacy they will be provid - ed with information regarding the performance of an admission CBC and DS. Failure to have both the admission CBC and DS performed within the deadlines specified may result in revocation of conditional admission. Information from the CBCs and DSs are also kept as confidential as possible, are not shared with the admissions committee, and are retained in a file separate from 47other educational and academic records. Information from CBCs and DSs is evaluated on a case by case basis by the Director of Enrollment Management. Information disclosed by the criminal background check that was not disclosed by the applicant in the Supplemental Application, as well as information from the drug screen, may also result in revo - cation of conditional acceptance. Applicants have access to the results of the criminal background check and drug screen, and are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information. It is the responsibility of the conditionally accepted applicant to ensure that any misinformation in the initial criminal background check and drug screen report is corrected, and to ensure that a written statement with supporting documentation indicating the correction is submitted to the Director of Enrollment Management within 10 days of results being reported. Conditional admission may be revoked by the Director of Enrollment Management on the basis of information appearing in the CBC that was not disclosed by the applicant in the Supplemental Application, by the absolute bars to admission described below, or by the results of a DS positive for banned substances or psychoactive substances without a prescription (except for medications available without a prescription). If conditional admission is revoked the applicant may appeal the decision to the CBC/DS Advisory committee through the Director of Enrollment Management within 10 working days of notifica - tion, provide any additional information the applicant feels important, and appear in person before the advisory committee if desired. The advisory committee will then make a recommenda - tion to the Dean. Applicants may be admitted, admitted with specific stipulations for continuing in the program, or have admission revoked. The decision of the Dean regarding the revocation of the offer of admission, and any stipulations for admission and continuation, is final and cannot be appealed. Applicants who are admitted with stipulations, but who do not follow those stipula - tions, forfeit their admission and/or are subject to dismissal with due process. 3. Factors affecting decisions from CBCs and DSs Factors in affecting decisions on applicants may include, but are not limited to; a. the nature, circumstances, and frequency of any reported offense(s) b. the length of time since the offense(s) were committed c. whether the pattern of the offenses indicates a continuing behavior pattern d. available information that addresses efforts at rehabilitation e. the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant in their application materials f. the relationship between the responsibilities of a student pharmacist participating in the educa - tional program and the offense(s) committed. Absolute bars to admission from information disclosed in CBCs include a. Crimes involving abuse of a dependent person. b. Child sexual offenses. c. Murder conviction. d. Felony drug trafficking. Absolute bars to admission from DSs include the presence of banned substances or psy - choactive medications without a prescription, except for medications available without a prescription. Reporting of Misdemeanor/Felony Offenses Any conditionally accepted applicant, convicted of a felony of any type, or a misdemeanor involv - ing drugs or alcohol while a conditionally accepted applicant in the College of Pharmacy, must report that offense to the Director of Enrollment Management in writing within 10 days of con - viction. The CBC/DS Advisory committee will review the case and then make recommendations to the Dean regarding possible stipulations for continued enrollment (i.e. participation in treatment 48programs, etc.). Conviction includes plea agreements, guilty pleas, etc. as defined above. Failure to report may result in dismissal from the College with due process. B. Required Assignments Conditionally accepted students will be required to complete multiple assignments by stated deadlines to maintain their seat of admission. Students are required to check their UK email and Canvas accounts for notifications and instructions of these assignments which typically begin in April. Multiple assign - ments will take place between April-August and are expected to be completed by the provided deadlines, without exception, reminders, or delay. Summer Orientation assignments will be available on Canvas, the University of Kentucky's Learning Management System. Failure to successfully complete assignments may result in rescinding of an admission offer. Examples of assignments include: Early Orientation RSVP August Orientation RSVP Orientation Assignment Bloodborne Pathogens Training HIPAA Training American Heart Association Basic Life Support (BLS) for Healthcare Providers Certification Immunization Compliance Math & Medical Terminology Summer Assignments Wildcard ID/Med Center Badge Completion Autonomy Assignment Student Letter & Release Form ExamSoft & SofTest Assignment Student Self-Assessments, Reflections and Success Plans IX. ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE STUDENT HANDBOOK The Handbook will be reviewed by the Chief Academic Officer and the Director of Professional Studies annually and following review, placed on the consent agenda for the April meeting of the Colleges Faculty Council.49Appendix- Process for Disputes of Academic Standing Re-Enrollment Petition Following Suspension (updated 5/6/2019) A student is not guaranteed readmission into the PharmD program following suspension.

University Senate Rule 6.1.7 should be used to determine whether students have the right to continue in the program during the re-evaluation process. Grade disputes for individual courses are not within the purview of the APC. Individual grade disputes should be handled via the process outlined in the Student Handbook (III. Academic Performance - Course Director, then Department Chair, then University Academic Ombud for potential appeal). NOTE: Students should seek guidance from the Coordinator of Student Success pertaining to the steps of the Re-Evaluation process. See flowchart below. Process for Re-Evaluation Request: 1. The student should submit a letter to the Dean, outlining the specifics of their case and why the decision rendered by the APC was inaccurate. 2. The Dean will review the student's letter and may choose to request APC re-evaluation of the case and/or meet with the student to gain additional insight. 3. If an APC re-evaluation is requested, a re-evaluation panel composed of the Core APC members, the APC Chair and the Coordinator of Student Success will meet to re-evaluate the case. a. The student may attend the Re-Evaluation Meeting to speak on his/her own behalf or provide clar - ification prior to panel deliberations. b. During the deliberations, core committee members are eligible to vote, with the chair casting a vote only in the case of a tie. 4. The panel will issue a written recommendation to the Dean to uphold or amend the original APC decision. a.

A recommendation to amend the original decision will include the recommended academic status, coursework considerations, and other related issues. 5. The Dean will review the panel's recommendation and decide to uphold or amend the original APC deci - sion, as communicated in a letter to the student. a.
