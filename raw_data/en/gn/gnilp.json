It's a relatively young branch of energy healing founded by Master Choa Kok Sui from the Philippines in 1988 and now has practitioners worldwide. How does pranic healing work? The underlying philosophy is that the energy body, consisting of the aura and chakras, can get congested. By removing the congestion and infusing the energy body with new, \"clean\" energy, optimal health can be achieved. It's like washing away a stain from a shirt and rinsing it with clean water. Pranic healing can be done in person or at a distance. It differs from other types of energy healing, such as e.g. reiki, in that it doesn't involve physical touch. It's well suited for self-healing too. The healing is done in 3 steps: - Cleansing - Energizing - Stabilizing A difference from many other types of healing is the first and third steps. The cleansing step is performed first on the aura, then on the affected energy centers (there are 11 major energy centers or chakras in pranic healing). So if someone has a sore throat, the cleansing would start with the aura, followed by the throat chakra. - The cleansing step is considered important since it's believed that energizing a weak or congested part can further severe the condition instead of being beneficial. - The energizing step is similar to e.g. reiki in that the practitioner channels prana, or life force, from the universe. This is done without physical touch - when performed in person, the hands of the healer are directed toward the affected body part. - Stabilizing is a way of \"sealing\" the energy and preventing it from leaking. It is believed that the effects will be more long-lasting when stabilizing. A central component in pranic healing is meditation to enter a state of consciousness that facilitates healing. People in the pranic healing community often participate in global online meditations to raise the vibration of the planet and send loving kindness to all beings. Different levels There are different levels of pranic healing. Level 2, or advanced pranic healing, focuses on \"color pranas\", where the practitioner learns to channel prana of different colors for specific ailments. Level 3, psychotherapy, teaches how to work with mental health conditions. In the higher levels, tools such as crystals are used together with the prana to focus the healing energy. The author's mind-blowing experience with pranic healing The author of this article attended a yoga teacher training in Goa, India, when she contracted an infamous Indian infection. She got a fever and flu symptoms, lost appetite, and could barely leave her bed. Fearing she would miss the last few days and the final exam, she turned to one of the other participants, who was also a pranic healer. The healer came by her room with a crystal and told her to sit up on a chair for the treatment, but the author was too exhausted to even sit up. She was told she could lay down on her bed, which she did, and fell asleep almost instantaneously. After what felt like many hours (but was only 45 minutes), she was gently woken up. \"The healing is over.\" To her great surprise, she sat up on her bed - lightly tired but with no signs of the infection. The fever and symptoms she'd had for days were gone in an instant. The following day, she managed to participate in the activities with her fellow students and even passed her final exam. The event may seem too incredible to be true, but the author was convinced and went on to study elementary-level pranic healing. Wrapping it up The beauty of all energy healing methods is that they show us how powerful we are. They show us that the body has an innate intelligence that knows how to heal, without needing foreign substances. Pranic healing is one of many types of energy medicine that hopefully will play a much more central role in mainstream health care. The flip side? It may have people feel content and happy as they realize they have everything they need inside of them. And potentially, steal loyal customers from "}
