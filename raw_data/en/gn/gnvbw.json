Spring 2023 The Country Doctor and Early Medical Practices This presentation includes an introduction of the Country Doctor Museum, some early medical treatments and the use of patented medications. Dangers of some patented medications that contained toxic substances will also be discussed. Some discussion of medical items in the Country Doctor Museum collection. Highlighted will be the development of two scientific instruments used in early study and treatment of diseases, the microscope and stethoscope. Also, presented will be some 19th century doctors' decisions to use surgical intervention in traumatic injuries and amputations. A brief discussion of Joseph Lister and his antiseptic surgery will also be included.

LaFave and her team studied herbal \"remedies\" from ECU's Country Doctor Museum within homeopathic kits and vials, dating from the 1840s to the early 1900s. This presentation will describe how the research was conducted, including using mass spectrometry and spectroscopic techniques to identify the actual components in these remedies. The team completed the chemical research in tandem with historical research, studying historical materials such as medical advertisements and other information, to more fully develop a picture of how the chemical analyses could fit into the atmosphere of debate between traditional allopathic medicines and alternative homeopathic treatments during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Milk pasteurized using steam sterilizers was one of the first ways that the germ theory revolution reached average Americans' homes. One such steam sterilizer is in the Country Doctor Museum, which is part of Laupus Health Sciences Library's history collections. Sterilizing milk also generated a public health controversy: at what point in the process from cow to table should milk be made safe to drink? In this presentation, historian Tegan Kehoe will explore the history behind this question, drawing from the chapter featuring the museum's steam sterilizer in her new book Exploring American Healthcare through 50 Historic Treasures. The book looks at the history of health and medicine through the lens of artifacts in museums and libraries across the country. The presentation will illuminate the important role that milk played in late nineteenth-century debates about safe food and child health, and include other examples of artifacts related to public health controversies of the past.

From the Korean War to the emergence of AIDS, real and alleged biomedical activities were a key aspect of the Cold War propaganda duel. The legacy of such medically-oriented disinformation can still be felt in the spread of falsehoods regarding COVID-19 and alleged \"bioweapons labs\" in Ukraine.

As a result, the government trained medical officers not only to educate troops about venereal disease but to develop techniques to control the spread. One important measure was the venereal prophylactic station (also known as the pro station). Under threat of trial by court martial, soldiers having sex with prostitutes were required to immediately register at a pro station for the purpose of receiving a preventative treatment aimed at reducing the risk of transmission. In the pre-penicillin era the treatments for patients with documented syphilis could last for months. Soldiers receiving these treatments were considered unfit for service and were pulled from the ranks until cured, so preventing the infection was crucial. A great deal of propaganda was designed and printed for the military to remind men of the importance of visiting the pro station after a night on the town. The aim of this presentation is to explore the emergence and disappearance of the pro station and the propaganda material associated with it, both of which were rendered irrelevant by the advent of penicillin.

A number of individuals, among them Dr. Henry S. Plummer of the Mayo Clinic, were early adopters of these methods and applied them to group medical practice. Examples of these applications by Dr. Plummer and others in medicine will be discussed, and the influence of the efficiency doctrine to current medical practice will be emphasized.

After news of the incident spread, the US government argued that it was the result of an accident at a biological warfare research facility. The Soviets claimed it was a result of local residents consuming infected meat. It would be over a decade before the truth of what happened in Sverdlovsk was established. Once it was, the revelations helped unearth one of the Cold War's most terrifying secrets. Presented by David Durant, MLS, MA, Assoc.

Born in 1897 along the Tar River, Dupree was known as \"that little medicine thing\" because of her understanding of herbs at an early age. As an elderly woman, she shared much of her knowledge of the medicinal properties of native plants with physicians and medical anthropologists. Dupree received the Brown-Hudson Award from the North Carolina Folklore Society in 1984 and the North Carolina Heritage Award in 1992. She died just shy of her 100th birthday, in 1996.

Four central benchmarks will be examined: Alfred Donn\u00e9's Cours de microscopie (1844-45) which used daguerreotypes to create etched printing plates; the pioneering psychiatrist Hugh Diamond, who not only photographed his patients but arranged for lithographs of their physiognomies to be printed alongside his articles on their diagnosis and treatment as early as 1850; the work of the pioneering neurologist Guillaume Duchenne du Boulogne, who illustrated his books with hundreds of tipped-in albumen prints; and the Army Surgeon-General's Library (fore-runner of the National Library of Medicine), whose profusely illustrated medical history of the Civil War pushed the existing book arts to their limits. Illustration sources include the NLM's History of Medicine Division, as well as other institutions such as the Royal College of Physicians. Presented by Stephen J.

By the time the epidemic concluded in March 1919, more people died from the \"Spanish\" Influenza than died in the war, including an estimated 13,000 North Carolinians. This lecture will explore the deadly influenza virus strain and its rampage throughout the eastern counties of North Carolina. The impact on eastern North Carolina society, medical care, and public health will also be explored by examining primary sources from the period.

What he found instead in these lands he never understood were \"new\" were plants and animals unknown in the Old World that would provide an unlimited cornucopia of foods and medicines far more valuable than gold or the spices of Asia. Coca, cacao, and chinchona are just three of these marvels from the New World that have had religious, medicinal, and food value for Native Americans and beyond.

This talk will argue instead that the meaning and boundaries of autism have been contested from the beginning. It will explore how debates over autism intertwined with those over schizophrenia and intellectual disability, and how race, class, and education played into the diagnosis in complex ways that would make the diagnosis more visible in some populations than others.

But John Harvey Kellogg was much more than a cereal maker. He crammed the accomplishments of many people into one lifetime. He was a physician, surgeon, dietitian, inventor, educator, administrator, religious leader, public speaker, and author of books, articles, and tracts that profoundly changed personal habits of many Americans and our understanding of preventive medicine, health, treatments of diseases, hygiene, sex education, and diet. In fact, John Harvey Kellogg still influences the health and dietary habits of many all around the world through the many products, such as breakfast cereal and peanut butter, which he developed.

Since techniques such as PCR are highly sensitive to contamination, meticulous laboratory set-ups and protocols are necessary to ensure that false positive results from other materials in the laboratory do not occur. For example, the long-held assumption that bubonic plague was the cause of the Justinian plague and the Black Death has been strongly supported by finding Yersinia pestis DNA in mass graves, whereas another proposed cause, anthrax, was not found.

Several medical schools graduated a number of African-American physicians in the late 19th century. These newly minted physicians then faced the problem of opening viable medical practices among people, white and black, who had never seen black physicians before. This illustrated talk describes the reactions of black patients, white patients, and white physicians to the emergence of black physicians in their communities.

Even in her early twenties, Clara Maass was unaccepting of the current thought regarding the etiology of this mysterious, dreaded disease. She challenged the process by betting her life upon the theory that immunity to yellow fever could be produced by inoculation under controlled circumstances. Carol E.

Confederates suffered from 167 disease deaths/thousand men; disease mortality among black Union troops was 143/1000; white Union troops, on the other hand, reported only 43 disease deaths per 1000 men. This talk explores the ways in which social determinants of health, particularly nutritious food and nursing care, explain much of this differential mortality.

We will examine how modern western medicine's inability to understand the mind-body connection has led to problematic and stigmatizing explanatory narratives. Focusing on PTSD, we will explore how this cultural narrative blamed and stigmatized victims of trauma. From the veteran's perspective, this has meant being injured twice\u2014once in battle, and again by their own community through isolation and stigmatization. Analysis will show that cultural mores surrounding gendered social roles have long shaped our understanding of trauma-related psychological disorders on the battlefield. Beyond that, discussion will make clear that the way victims were discussed in professional literature, and viewed within the social framework confounded harm and paved the way for the future stigmatization of these groups.
