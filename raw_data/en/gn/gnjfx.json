Here is a protocol that can help fight the negative effects and toxicity after the vaccines. But first. Vaccine side effects can range from pruritus and skin rashes to severe inflammation of the heart (myocarditis, pericarditis), neurological problems including face paralysis, body numbness, and uncontrollable body tremors, lymph nodes inflammation, blood coagulation problems, including blood clots, severe hemorrhages, and many more others. For this reason, we have compiled together all the information we know so far on natural remedies, herbs, and supplements that can counteract the side effects of vaccines. In This Article You Will Find: 6 Natural Remedies for Vaccine Side Effects 1. Shikimate Shikimate or shikimic acid is an important biochemical metabolite, used as the base for the popular antiviral drug Tamiflu. The reason is that shikimate has powerful anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, as well as anti-blood clotting, and antithrombotic properties. Yes, not only does it fight viruses and bacteria, but it also prevents and fights blood clots, one of the most frequently encountered vaccine side effects. Skikimate is found in pine needle tea (from green, edible pine needles), fennel tea, and Chinese anise seeds (Illicium verum). When making the pine needle tea, drink the oil/resin at the bottom too. Other herbs that are high in shikimate are: - Triphala (Haritaki and Bibhitaki fruits are loaded with shikimate) - St. John's wort (whole plant) - Comfrey (leaf) - Feverfew (leaves and flowers) - Gingko Biloba (leaf) - Giant hyssop (Agastache urticifolia) Superfoods - Schisandra berry - Wheatgrass and wheatgrass juice (young blades) - Sprouted beans - red kidney beans, moth beans, soybeans, mong beans, and alfalfa. - Carrots & fresh carrot juice These herbs and superfoods are some of the best natural remedies for vaccine side effects. 2. Hesperidin Peppermint and oranges (especially red oranges) have a high content of hesperidin, a chalcone similar to quercetin that deactivates the surface protein of viruses. One possible explanation is that [hesperidin naturally improves blood flow](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/5/E782/2834015) and slows aging, reduces inflammation in veins, reduces the risk of developing varicose veins, and strengthens the walls of capillaries. Normally, in just one teaspoon of organic and dried lemon and orange peels, there is enough hesperidin to feel its benefit. You can also boil the peels of organic [citrus fruit](/health-benefits-of-citrus-fruits-juice/#4_Cardiac_Ischemia_Atherosclerosis) and drink them as tea, alongside peppermint. Other sources of hesperidin are mainly citrus fruit (limes, lemons, oranges, grapefruit) as well as rose hips and bell peppers. Rosehip juice can bind to heavy metals and remove them as well as other toxic products from the body when combined with natural Vitamin C. Yes, citrus fruit peels are working on the vaccine side effects. 3. Dandelion Leaf (Taraxacum officinale) Common dandelion leaf has the ability to efficiently block the interaction between ACE2 cell surface receptor (an enzyme attached to the membrane of cells) and the surface protein D614, and its mutants D614G, N501Y, K417N, and E484K in Dandelion root is one of the most powerful detox herbs for the liver, while dandelion leaf tea is a strong depurative for the kidneys, liver, and the entire body. To make the dandelion leaf tea add 10 g of dried dandelion leaf to a cup of water and bring to a boil. After the tea starts boiling, turn the heat off and leave covered for 10 minutes. Strain and drink as is, or sweetened with honey. Drink two cups a day, one in the morning on an empty stomach, and another one in the evening before bed in a three-week cure or longer in need. Dandelion leaf tea is one of the best herbs for vaccine side effects. 4. Coated Silver Coated silver can block the sulfur-bearing surface protein from entering the body cells. Sulfur-rich amino acids on the surface protein interact with silver causing them to fold incorrectly, making it one of the helpful supplements/remedies for vaccine side effects. The dosage is 1-6 drops/day depending on the severity of the side effects. 5. NAC & Glutathione (N-acetyl cysteine) Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant that can prevent damage caused by free radicals, peroxides, toxins, and [heavy metals](https://www.mynaturaltreatment.com/heavy-metals-detox-how-to/). NAC accelerates detoxification because it restores glutathione levels naturally. More so, NAC has been observed to detoxify SM-102 too, making it a great tool against the vaccine side effects. There are other natural sources of glutathione, and supplements that boost glutathione naturally, that you can read more about [here](/highest-natural-sources-of-glutathione/). 6. Ozone & Oxygen Therapies Ozone is one of the most powerful antibacterial agents in the world. All types of ozone and oxygen therapies are effective for the vaccine side effects because they help degrade the surface protein and other oxides. Drinking ozonated water, and doing ozonated water enemas can all be helpful in counteracting the negative side effects of vaccines. Natural Supplements for Vaccine Side Effects You can use the natural remedies for vaccine side effects alongside natural supplements that boost the immune system and detox potentially harmful chemicals. Use as recommended by a health professional. - Zinc - 30-80 mg/day depending on immunological pressure (read also [natural sources of zinc](/10-best-natural-sources-of-zinc/)) - Vitamin C - 1000mg/day (read also [natural sources of Vitamin C](/highest-natural-sources-of-vitamin-c/)) - Vitamin D3 - 10,000 UI/day (read also [natural sources of Vitamin D](/18-best-natural-sources-of-vitamin-d/)) - Quercetin - 500-1000 mg twice/day (read support - C60 - 1-3 dropper fulls/day (is a rich source of electrons that normalizes electron flow and fights inflammation) - Serrapeptase - 100-200 mg on an empty stomach/day (helps break down proteins into smaller bits, reduces fluid and debris around injured tissue) - Charcoal -2-4 caps/day on an empty stomach (activated charcoal is a natural detoxifier for the intestines and blood) - Resveratrol - prevents destructive oxidation Crystals and Gemstones There are powerful crystals that can be used to neutralize electromagnetism and energetic disturbances caused by vaccines. These crystals are specifically used to counteract radiation, Wi-Fi frequencies, and radiofrequency pollution and can be used to counteract the vaccine side effects. 1. Shungite Shungite stones are extracted from the mines around the Shunga village, in the Karelia region of Russia. These rare black stones are made of up to [99 percent](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/EGU2020-5488.html) carbon (fullerenes, or 60 carbon atoms - C60), and the rest 1% nearly all the minerals on the periodic table. They are known for their ability to [shield you from EMF emissions, ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14968159/)that is electromagnetic radiation. It is highly possible that a piece of shungite stone will counteract the electromagnetism caused by particles found in the vaccines. In addition, this healing stone reduces inflammation and oxidative stress can purify water, and kills bacteria and viruses. Wear a piece of shungite stone around your neck or take it with you in your purse or pocket to enjoy its protection. 2. Black Turmaline Another gemstone for protection from toxic energies and electromagnetic radiation, black tourmaline has the ability to stop EMF in its tracks, forming a protective barrier and soaking up the smog from phones, TVs, laptops, and other electromagnetic devices such as the ones found in the vaccines. Wearing or carrying a piece of black tourmaline in your pocket/purse, can help you tone down vaccine side effects. 3. Hematite A [2016 study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/01/160114113524.htm) showed that anisotropic crystals absorb electromagnetic radiation from the electromagnetic waves. Coincidentally or not, the EMF absorbing hematite pertains to the [class of anisotropic crystals](https://www.classicgems.net/info_anisotropic-gems.htm). We say this because hematite is known for its protective abilities since the times of Ancient Rome when soldiers used it to shield their armor with it for protection in battle. Hematite is also known as The Blood Stone because, in addition to cleansing EMF smog, it also cleanses toxins and debris from the bloodstream. Other EMF protection crystals that may help counteract the vaccine side effects are pyrite, citrine, and rose quartz. 4. Shattuckite This one is a totally different healing crystal from the other three above, it doesn't have the same anti-EMF properties, but what it does is stimulate cell division and regeneration, repair DNA, and healing caused by genetically transmitted diseases, including radiation damage and offers strong support in viral issues. It's a valuable tool at the moment to rid the body of disease and \"cooling\" the body from inflammation, and fight thrombosis and blood clots, because shattuckite is a powerful master healer. To use shattuckite to counteract the adverse reactions of vaccines, hold it in your hand and look at its colors with the green/turquoise/teal and the \"veins\" that run through, and imagine these healing colored patterns flowing through your veins, through you. Healing Foods for Vaccine Side Effects A strong immune system can easily counteract the potential adverse events following vaccines because it enables the body to [naturally flush out toxins](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/nr/c7nr03552g) and prevent inflammation, as human and [animal studies](https://www.materialstoday.com/carbon/news/graphene-oxide-slips-through-the-body/) show. For this, an alkaline, healing diet is key in strengthening the immune system against the inflammatory response and fighting vaccine side effects. For this, we recommend a plant-based diet, a lot of fresh, organic, and raw fruits and vegetables, drinking lots of fresh spring water, enjoying the fresh air, and moving your body for at least 30 minutes a day. - Avoid alcohol, sugar, meat and deli products, junk and highly-processed foods, fast food, fried, refined foods, smoking, caffeine, chocolate, eggs, dairy, wheat, etc. - Instead, eat more raw vegetables and fruits. Herbal phytosterols prevent the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine and hot peppers, onions and garlic are very helpful. Replace sugar with dates, coconut sugar, maple syrup, and raw honey. Replace caffeine with herbal teas (yerba mate). - Reduce fats, even healthy fats such as coconut oil, avocado, and nuts.
