Before you begin, focus on what you would like to achieve. A few examples may be general relaxation, financial abundance, or spiritual awareness. It can even be more specific, like meditations for better parenting, breaking addictions or pain relief.

The conscious mind is busy analyzing and evaluating everything that comes its way. You get stimulus from the outside environment, temperature, sounds, people, etc. You also get messages from internal sources: memories, thoughts, future projections, etc. Your conscious mind is the constant thinker. You go about each day consumed in thoughts. These endless thoughts, especially when they are negative, can be extremely draining. They create stress, anger, anxiety, fear. Many destructive thoughts lead to physical disease and illness. On the other hand, positive thoughts bring you closer to your spiritual nature and help you achieve your dreams. Sweet relief from the conscious mind comes when you sleep. During sleep, your subconscious mind takes charge; it never analyzes. The subconscious has direct access to the Higher Self and the spirit world, which often deliver messages and symbols to you in your dreams.

What is the Goal of Meditation? There is a state of mind that lies between the conscious and subconscious. This is the altered mind. The goal of meditation is to offer you a controlled gateway to the altered meditative state. When you meditate you are still consciously aware of your surroundings, yet simultaneously connected to the subconscious realm. This is a relaxing and natural feeling. Through meditation you increase the vibration of the body and mind. Because it is a different state, your physical body may feel unusual sensations during meditation. Some common occurrences you may feel during meditation are: - The disappearing of feeling in all or parts of the body - Vibration in all or parts of the body - Voices/sounds/messages through the ears - Changes in body temperature - Possible dizziness, out of balance feelings To reduce the feeling of spaciness after meditation, make sure you cling on to your [grounding stones](/collections/grounding-crystals) for awhile. Most sensations are caused by a change of the body vibration. Each person will have a different experience, which may vary from meditation to meditation.
