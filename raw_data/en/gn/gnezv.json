What are the common uses of solar energy? How is solar energy collected? solar energy, [radiation](https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-radiation) from the [Sun](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sun) capable of producing [heat](https://www.britannica.com/science/heat), causing [chemical reactions](https://www.britannica.com/science/chemical-reaction), or generating [electricity](https://www.britannica.com/science/electricity). The total amount of solar energy incident on Earth is vastly in excess of the world's current and anticipated energy requirements. If suitably harnessed, this highly [diffused](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/diffused) source has the potential to satisfy all future energy needs. In the 21st century solar energy is expected to become increasingly attractive as a [renewable energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/renewable-energy) source because of its inexhaustible supply and its nonpolluting character, in stark contrast to the finite [fossil fuels](https://www.britannica.com/science/fossil-fuel) [coal](https://www.britannica.com/science/coal-fossil-fuel), [petroleum](https://www.britannica.com/science/petroleum), and [natural gas](https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-gas). The Sun is an extremely powerful energy source, and [sunlight](https://www.britannica.com/science/sunlight-solar-radiation) is by far the largest source of energy received by [Earth](https://www.britannica.com/place/Earth), but its intensity at Earth's surface is actually quite [low](https://www.britannica.com/science/cyclone-meteorology). This is essentially because of the enormous radial spreading of radiation from the distant Sun. A relatively minor additional loss is due to Earth's [atmosphere](https://www.britannica.com/science/atmosphere) and [clouds](https://www.britannica.com/science/cloud-meteorology), which absorb or scatter as much as 54 percent of the incoming sunlight. The [sunlight](https://www.britannica.com/science/sunlight-solar-radiation) that reaches the ground consists of nearly 50 percent visible [light](https://www.britannica.com/science/light), 45 percent [infrared radiation](https://www.britannica.com/science/infrared-radiation), and smaller amounts of [ultraviolet](https://www.britannica.com/science/ultraviolet-radiation) and other forms of [electromagnetic radiation](https://www.britannica.com/science/electromagnetic-radiation). The potential for solar energy is enormous, since about 200,000 times the world's total daily electric-generating [capacity](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/capacity) is received by Earth every day in the form of solar energy. Unfortunately, though solar energy itself is free, the high cost of its collection, conversion, and storage still limits its exploitation in many places. Solar radiation can be converted either into [thermal energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/thermal-energy) (heat) or into [electrical energy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/electric-power), though the former is easier to accomplish. Thermal energy Among the most common devices used to capture solar energy and convert it to thermal energy are [flat-plate collectors](https://www.britannica.com/technology/flat-plate-collector), which are used for [solar heating](https://www.britannica.com/technology/solar-heating) applications. Because the intensity of [solar radiation](https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-radiation) at Earth's surface is so low, these collectors must be large in area. Even in sunny parts of the world's temperate regions, for instance, a collector must have a surface area of about 40 square metres (430 square feet) to gather enough energy to serve the energy needs of one person. [ Britannica Quiz Weaponry, Energy, and Power Systems Quiz ](/quiz/weaponry-energy-and-power-systems-quiz) The most widely used flat-plate collectors consist of a blackened metal plate, covered with one or two sheets of glass, that is heated by the sunlight falling on it. This heat is then transferred to [air](https://www.britannica.com/science/air) or [water](https://www.britannica.com/science/water), called carrier fluids, that flow past the back of the plate. The heat may be used directly, or it may be transferred to another medium for storage. Flat-plate collectors are commonly used for [solar water heaters](https://www.britannica.com/technology/solar-water-heater) and house heating. The storage of heat for use at night or on cloudy days is commonly accomplished by using insulated tanks to store the water heated during sunny periods. Such a system can supply a home with hot water drawn from the storage tank, or, with the warmed water flowing through tubes in floors and ceilings, it can provide space heating. Flat-plate collectors typically heat carrier fluids to temperatures ranging from 66 to 93 \u00b0C (150 to 200 \u00b0F). The [efficiency](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/efficiency) of such collectors (i.e., the proportion of the energy received that they convert into usable energy) ranges from 20 to 80 percent, depending on the design of the collector. Another method of thermal energy conversion is found in solar ponds, which are bodies of [salt water](https://www.britannica.com/science/seawater) designed to collect and store solar energy. The heat extracted from such ponds enables the production of chemicals, [food](https://www.britannica.com/topic/food), textiles, and other industrial products and can also be used to warm [greenhouses](https://www.britannica.com/topic/greenhouse), swimming pools, and [livestock](https://www.britannica.com/animal/livestock) buildings. Solar ponds are sometimes used to produce electricity through the use of the organic [Rankine cycle](https://www.britannica.com/science/Rankine-cycle) engine, a relatively efficient and economical means of solar energy [conversion](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/conversion), which is especially useful in remote locations. Solar ponds are fairly expensive to install and maintain and are generally limited to warm rural areas. On a smaller scale, the Sun's energy can also be harnessed to cook food in specially designed [solar ovens](https://www.britannica.com/technology/solar-oven). Solar ovens typically concentrate sunlight from over a wide area to a central point, where a black-surfaced vessel converts the sunlight into heat. The ovens are typically portable and require no other fuel inputs. "}
