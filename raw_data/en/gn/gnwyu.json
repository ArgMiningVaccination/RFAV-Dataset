Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, and the U.S. has some of the richest solar resources in the world. Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior environment, and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use. Solar Technologies There are three main ways to harness [solar energy](https://www.energysage.com/solar/?rc=seia): [photovoltaics](https://www.seia.org/policy/solar-technology/photovoltaic-solar-electric), [solar heating & cooling](https://www.seia.org/policy/solar-technology/solar-heating-cooling), and [concentrating solar power](https://www.seia.org/policy/solar-technology/concentrating-solar-power). Photovoltaics generate electricity directly from sunlight via an electronic process and can be used to power anything from small electronics such as calculators and road signs up to homes and large commercial businesses. Solar heating & cooling (SHC) and concentrating solar power (CSP) applications both use the heat generated by the sun to provide space or water heating in the case of SHC systems, or to run traditional electricity-generating turbines in the case of CSP power plants.

Both of these methods can also store the energy they produce for distribution after the sun sets, using cutting edge [solar + storage technologies](/initiatives/solar-plus-storage). Solar exists within a complex and interrelated electricity system in the U.S., working alongside other technologies like wind power to transition the U.S. to a clean energy economy. All of these applications depend on supportive policy frameworks at the local, state and federal level to ensure consumers and businesses have fair access to clean energy technologies like solar. Understand the policies that drive solar growth in the U.S. [Explore](/initiative-topics/solar-policy) IRA: Everything You Need to KnowThe historic Inflation Reduction Act contains numerous provisions to invest in the solar and storage industries in the United States. SEIA has all of the resources you need to understand this complex policy. The solar market today There are more than [155.2 gigawatts (GW) of solar installed](/smi) in the U.S., enough to power 27 million homes. Over the last decade, the solar market in the United States has grown at an average rate of 24% each year. There are more than 4 million individual solar installations in the U.S., ranging from small home rooftop systems to large utility-scale systems that add hundreds of megawatts of clean electricity to the power grid.
