Fewer people would die of colorectal cancer if health care providers adopted a new model of screening that combines better risk assessment, more options for noninvasive testing and more targeted referrals for colonoscopy. That's the course laid out by the [American Gastroenterological Association](https://gastro.org/) in the recently published white paper \" [Roadmap for the Future of Colorectal Cancer Screening in the United States](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356520309174).\" \"If we offered tests that were convenient, accurate and lower cost, and we could help people choose the best option based on their individual cancer risks, we would save more lives,\" said lead author Joshua Melson, MD, MPH, associate professor, Rush Medical College, and a member of the AGA Center for GI Innovation and Technology. The paper sets the target and the steps for scientists and industry partners to take in exploring new biomarkers and developing tests that will turn the tide. At least one in four Americans who should be screened for [colorectal cancer](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/colorectal-cancer) has never been tested. Yet colorectal cancer, the nation's second deadliest cancer, is highly preventable and treatable when found early. That's after years of effort to increase compliance with testing recommendations. The AGA gathered 60 experts in gastroenterology and research to envision how screening could reach its full potential. Their conclusion: To significantly reduce the number of colorectal cancer cases and deaths would require a universal approach to screening that reaches more people and offers alternatives in addition to [colonoscopy](https://www.rush.edu/services/test-treatment/colonoscopy). \"Approximately 67% of eligible Americans are screened for colorectal cancer. We need to improve our strategies to curb the cancer that ranks second for deaths in the U.S.,\" said Sri Komanduri, MD, AGAF, chair of the AGA Center for GI Innovation and Technology. \"AGA is proud to introduce this white paper \u2014 the first step in our mission to develop a more structured screening program that can increase screening rates, catch more colorectal cancers early, and save countless lives.\" Currently, colorectal cancer screening usually begins when a physician recommends a colonoscopy based on the patient's age or other risk factors. The colonoscopy allows the gastroenterologist to fully examine the colon and remove any precancerous polyps that are found. Polyps are found about a quarter of the time. But having a colonoscopy requires scheduling well ahead of time, taking time off work, arranging a ride home and going through a bowel-emptying routine. A new approach would: To make this vision a reality, the authors set a course for development of affordable, highly accurate, easy-to-use noninvasive tests, as well as research into how best to integrate the different types of tests and who would benefit most from each based on individual risk factors. Two noninvasive tests in use today are the stool-based fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and the multi-target stool DNA test (MT-sDNA). FIT, which looks for hidden blood in the stool, is the most readily available. The MT-sDNA has emerged as an alternative to FIT that is more sensitive in detecting colorectal cancer but less specific in its findings. Both tests can identify markers of large colon polyps and cancer. MT-sDNA tests carry a higher price \u2014 more than $500 compared to about $25 for FIT. \"The ideal test needs to be highly sensitive and highly specific, as well as convenient, with low risk and low cost,\" Melson said. \"It would identify lesions that have a high potential to progress to colorectal cancer in the short term.\" To achieve that goal, the AGA initiative defined targets for industry partners and scientists who are developing colorectal cancer screening tests and exploring novel molecular biomarkers, including biochemical, microbiome, genomic, proteomic or epigenomic markers. With input from the major endoscopic and noninvasive testing companies, the authors defined criteria for meaningful endpoints of what are the important lesions a noninvasive marker would be able to detect and at what level of accuracy, in an affordable way. The authors set forth the aspirational goal of developing a minimally invasive, easy-to-use test that will \"detect advanced adenomas and advanced serrated lesions with a one-time sensitivity and specificity of no less than 90%.\" In addition, all types of colorectal cancer screening would benefit from a better understanding and more thorough identification of risk factors to help identify the most appropriate screening for the individual patient. Thanks to advancements in electronic health records, health care providers can share information across institutions that will provide a full picture of the patient's medical history, including screening history and results. This would allow for more accurate risk assessment paradigms that include past colonoscopy polyp data, molecular markers if found, and family history. With a clearer risk assessment, the provider and patient could share in deciding the most appropriate test - colonoscopy for those at high risk, or initial noninvasive testing for those at lower risk. Also, more thorough risk assessment would reduce the number of colonoscopies performed that provide little benefit and flag those patients who would benefit most from colonoscopy. Test rates would benefit from patient buy-in and from easier access. Ultimately, these advances will support the development of organized screening programs that can identify and connect people who need to be screened with the testing best suited for them. The Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force's new name, Equal Hope, reflects the expansion of the non-profit's scope to eliminate cervical cancer deaths in Chicago. A nonprofit organization that helped narrow the racial gap in breast cancer deaths has expanded its scope to eliminating cervical cancer deaths for all women in Chicago. Housed and developed at Rush University Medical Center, the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force was established in 2008 in response to research showing that the city's black women were dying of breast cancer at much higher rates than white women. In November, the task force changed its name to Equal Hope, \"because all women should have equal hope of high quality health care, and anyone facing serious illness should have equal hope for their future,\" said the organization's executive director, Anne Marie Murphy, PhD. \"No woman should ever die of [cervical cancer](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/cervical-cancer), a disease that's almost 100 percent preventable. We know what causes it, we know how to prevent it, and it's time to end it,\" she added. [Dr. Summer Dewdney](https://doctors.rush.edu/Details/1718), who is co-leading Equal Hope's cervical cancer effort, lamented that the promise of being able to prevent cervical cancer has not mattered to the many patients she sees with advanced stages of the disease. \"I see these young women who are in their 30s or 40s with these horrible cervical cancers \u2014 advanced stage 3, 4. These are diseases you should be seeing in Third World countries or where they don't have health care,\" said Dewdney, a gynecologic oncologist at Rush. She was aware of the breast cancer effort being led by [Dr. David Ansell](https://www.rush.edu/about-us/about-rush/leadership/david-ansell-md-mph-about-rush), Rush's senior vice president for community health equity and co-founder of the task force. \"So I just knocked on his door and said, 'Hey, can we do this for cervical cancer?'\" The task force and its hospital and clinical partners have been able to reduce disparities in breast cancer mortality in Chicago from a 62% death gap to a 39% gap over the past decade. They achieved this dramatic, life-saving result by improving the quality of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment for women in underserved communities, helping them navigate the health care system, and advocating for policy change. Dewdney and colleagues from across Chicago are now attempting to apply the lessons learned in breast cancer to cervical cancer. \"Every woman that we see is a missed opportunity and an example that the system has failed,\" Dewdney said. Using data provided by the Chicago Department of Health, Equal Hope researchers from Rush, Northwestern Medicine and University of Chicago Medicine found that cervical cancer racial disparities were shocking, as shown in the following data: Dewdney explained that eradication of the disease is possible because it is almost 100% preventable by vaccination and pre-cancer screening. Australia, for example, recently announced it expects to eradicate cervical cancer by 2028, and Rwanda has succeeded in getting 94% of its adolescents fully vaccinated within three years. Oncologists at Rush University Medical Center are among the first in the country to be able to have results of genomic tests returned directly into the electronic medical record. Rush University Medical Center is the first health care organization to launch medical record company Epic's module for genomic results, giving providers the tools they need to tailor patient care at the molecular level. Rush will use the module as part of its [Precision Oncology Program](https://www.rush.edu/services/precision-oncology-program) to integrate the power of genomic sequencing data into oncologists' daily workflows so they can provide the best care for their patients. \"To really deliver on the promise of precision oncology, providers need to access, interpret and apply this genomic information where and when clinical decisions are made: the EHR,\" said [Dr. Mia Levy](https://www.rush.edu/services/cancer-center/meet-mia-levy-md-phd), the Sheba Foundation Director of the [Rush University Cancer Center](https://www.rush.edu/services/cancer-center) and a national leader in biomedical informatics. \"This new technology makes point-of-care insights and interventions possible.\" The module unlocks critical data and seamlessly weaves structured results of genomic testing into the workflows of the cancer care team. When a Rush physician believes that a patient would benefit from genomic testing, the physician sends a tumor and/or blood sample to Tempus, Rush's [ genomic testing partner](https://www.rush.edu/news/customizing-cancer-care-patients). Tempus' identify a patient's actionable genomic variants and yield therapeutic options \u2014 including matched clinical trials \u2014 associated with the patient's molecular and clinical profile. Tempus' report flows directly into Epic, allowing clinicians to make data-driven decisions customized to each patient. Integrating genomic data into the electronic health record (EHR) provides clinicians with a single view of a patient's genomic and other clinical information. \"Until now, to the best of our knowledge, no other external lab has been able to seamlessly integrate next generation sequencing genomic testing directly into an electronic medical record as structured variant results, and we are thrilled to bring this new functionality to the market and providers with Rush,\" said Ryan Fukushima, Tempus' chief operating officer. \"Epic's new module allows clinicians to order a Tempus test with a click of a button, and merges those test results into a patient's record, arming the care team with all the data needed to make treatment decisions in real time.\" \"Cancer is a disease of the genome,\" Levy said. \"But the tiny changes in our DNA that allow some cells to become cancer cells also provide clues to how we can treat and prevent cancer. Connecting genomic data with the rest of a patient's story provides a more complete picture.\" Levy noted that while the ability to detect and analyze those changes to a person's genome \u2014 the complete set of genetic instructions found in their DNA \u2014 has grown exponentially in the last several years, the ability to translate that information into specific and practical therapies was limited by the structural inability of EHRs make that data part of the clinical workflow. Thus, in 2018, Rush oncologists and technologists began collaborating with Epic developers to design the genomics module. \"When developing new features, we focus on how they'll fit into the overall workflow for clinicians and ultimately provide actionable information to improve patient care,\" said Catherine Procknow, an Epic software developer who works on the genomics module. \"Dr. Levy worked closely with us as a member of our genomics brain trust to provide guidance on how to design our module in a way that was most useful to clinicians and beneficial to patients.\" The module provides a specialized data structure to enable providers - even those without a genomics background - to integrate genomics information into their clinical decision-making process. It turns raw data from gene tests, genetic panels, and complete sequencing into actionable genomic indicators, which are stored in a patient's chart. Researchers will be able to integrate de-identified, structured genomic data into their efforts to discover new methods of predicting cancer risk, prognosis and response to treatment. The ability to compare genomic data with medical histories and other clinical data will accelerate the pace of discovery. \"Cancer care has reached a pivotal moment when the amazing promise of genomic medicine is actually part of the daily practice of medicine,\" said [Dr. Ranga Krishnan](https://www.rush.edu/about-us/about-rush/leadership-biographies/k-ranga-rama-krishnan-mb-chb-rush-system-ceo-about-rush), CEO of [Rush University System for Health](https://www.rush.edu/excellence). \"We've long known that cancer cells contain the clues physicians need to identify treatments precisely designed according to a patient's DNA, but few providers had the expertise to decode that information. Integrating genomic test results into the electronic medical record\u2014where point of care decisions are made - makes the power of cancer genomics part of routine cancer care at Rush.\" Researchers at Rush University Medical Center have found that injecting tumors with influenza vaccines, including some FDA-approved seasonal flu shots, turns cold tumors to hot, a discovery that could lead to an immunotherapy to treat cancer. Researchers at Rush University Medical Center have found that injecting tumors with influenza vaccines, including some FDA-approved seasonal flu shots, turns \"cold\" tumors to \"hot,\" a discovery that could lead to an immunotherapy to treat cancer. The study results were published Dec. 30 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Changing the microenvironment of tumors to increase the immune system's response to them has been the goal of countless research and clinical studies including the most recent use of checkpoint inhibitory antibodies. The majority of patients have tumors that are \"cold\" \u2014 that is, the tumors don't contain many immune cells, or they have cells that suppress the ability of the immune system to fight them. Increasing immune cells within a tumor can change it from \"cold\" to \"hot\" \u2014 more recognizable to the immune system. Hot tumors show higher rates of response to treatment, and patients with such tumors have improved survival rates. Currently, some immunotherapies utilize live pathogens (disease-causing organisms) as cancer treatments, but these treatments only have shown lasting effects in a limited number of patients and cancer types. \"We wanted to understand how our strong immune responses against pathogens like influenza and their components could improve our much weaker immune response against some tumors,\" said [Andrew Zloza, MD, PhD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/andrew-zloza-md-phd), assistant professor in [Rush Medical College's](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/education-and-training) [Department of Internal Medicine](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/rush-medical-college/departments/department-internal-medicine) and senior author of the study. Drawing on a National Cancer Institute database, researchers found that people who had lung cancer and hospitalization for a lung infection from influenza at the same time lived longer than those who had lung cancer with no influenza. They found a similar outcome in mice with tumors and influenza infection in the lung. \"However, there are many factors we do not understand about live infections, and this effect does not repeat in tumors where influenza infections do not naturally occur, like skin,\" Zloza said. To find an alternative to the limitations of live infection, researchers inactivated the influenza virus, essentially creating a flu vaccine. They found that direct injection of this vaccine into the skin melanoma of the mice resulted in the tumors either growing slower or shrinking. The injection made the tumor hot by increasing the proportion of a type of immune-stimulating cells (called dendritic cells) in the tumor, leading to an increase in a type of cells known as CD8+ T cells, which recognize and kill tumor cells. Importantly, injecting a skin melanoma tumor on one side of the body not only resulted in the reduced growth of that tumor, but also in reduced growth of a second skin tumor on the other side of the same mouse that was not injected. The study authors note that they observed similar systemic outcomes in a mouse model of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, in which both primary tumor growth and the natural spread of the breast tumor to the lungs were reduced after injection only into the primary tumor. \"Based on this result, we hope that in patients, injecting one tumor with an influenza vaccine with lead to immune responses in their other tumors as well,\" Zloza said. \"Our successes with a flu vaccine that we created made us wonder if seasonal flu vaccines that are already FDA-approved could be repurposed as treatments for cancer,\" Zloza said. \"Since these have been used in millions of people and have already been shown to be safe, we thought using flu shots to treat cancer could be brought to patients quickly.\" The researchers found that injection of such flu shots also resulted in reduction of tumor growth. To determine if similar results could be obtained with tumors from patients, the researchers developed a mouse model, which they call AIR-PDX. To create this model, they implant a piece of tumor and immune cells from a patient with cancer into a mouse that does not have a functioning immune system of its own - which prevents the mouse from rejecting the implanted cells. \"Such transplant allows us to utilize patient-grade drugs in a living system. This is as close as we can get to testing something ahead of a clinical trial,\" Zloza said. The researchers used a patient's lung tumor and a melanoma metastasis in AIR-PDX models. They found that putting the flu shot in these patient-derived tumors causes them to shrink, while untreated tumors continued to grow. Since new treatments are often compared to or combined with current frontline therapies for cancer, the researchers used immune checkpoint inhibitors in their studies. Immune checkpoint inhibition \"releases the brakes\" on immune cells so that they can fight the tumor. The researchers found that flu vaccines can reduce tumor growth when used alone, whether or not the tumor is responsive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. When they combined the flu vaccine with a checkpoint inhibitor together, an even a greater reduction in tumor growth occurred. \"These results propose that eventually both patients who respond and who do not respond to other immunotherapies might benefit from the injection of influenza vaccines into the tumor, and it may increase the small proportion of patients that are now long-term responders to immunotherapies,\" Zloza said. Five different influenza shots for the 2017-2018 flu season were used in this research. Four were effective in achieving the same results in fighting tumors. One flu shot with a synthetic adjuvant (an immune modifier) had no antitumor effect, and maintained other cells (called regulatory B cells or Bregs) that suppress an immune response. When the adjuvant was removed from the vaccine, it became effective. Similarly, when the B cells were removed, the vaccine also then became effective. That all five vaccines provided protection from flu infection, but one was ineffective in reducing tumor growth \"demonstrates a disconnect between the principals of immune responses needed to fight pathogens versus tumors,\" Zloza said. \"It also highlights the need for additional consideration regarding what adjuvants are included in immunotherapies and which vaccines could be used to treat cancer.\" \"Since humans and mice are about 95% genetically identical, the hope is that this approach will work in patients. The next step planned is to conduct clinical trials to test various factors,\" Zloza said. Clinical trials on average require four phases and can take between eight to 10 years to complete, but because the seasonal influenza vaccine is FDA-approved, the clinical trials for this study might be significantly shorter. \"Although we are currently studying the use of other vaccines as well, the seasonal flu shot is safe and recommended for most people over 6 months of age, including most patients with cancer,\" Zloza said. \"This is why we chose to start with it. \"The flu shot is inexpensive and it has a quick translatability since it is an FDA-approved drug that we are repurposing,\" Zloza continued.

Rush University Medical Center has received a $5 million donation from Chicago philanthropists Robert and Emily King that will accelerate blood cancer immunotherapy research and the development of new treatment options. This transformational gift to the [Rush University Cancer Center](https://www.rush.edu/services/cancer-center) is expected to increase much-needed early-stage clinical trials at Rush over the next five years, the kind of research that is essential in developing lifesaving treatments or even a cure. The Robert E. and Emily H. King Cancer Immunotherapy Research Program will complement current research efforts at Rush aimed at using immunotherapy, a treatment approach at the forefront of a rapidly advancing new era in cancer care. Immunotherapy has been most effective to date in tackling [hematologic cancers](https://www.rush.edu/services/hematologic-cancer-services), such as lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma. Robert King, who is being treated for brain cancer at Rush, and his wife, Emily King, provided the gift because of their long history of positive experiences with clinicians at the Medical Center, as well as the promise that immunotherapy holds. Their gift will boost critical phase I clinical trials, which is the first stage in bringing a new treatment from preliminary laboratory work to testing on humans. \"Our hope is that this gift will contribute to the momentum behind immunotherapy research and will result in a cure for certain kinds of cancers,\" Robert King said. \"That would be terrific and worth every bit of the money.\" \"With nearly 2,000 immunotherapy trials in progress, this treatment form harnesses the body's capability to use its own powerful immune system effectively against cancer, a medical breakthrough recently celebrated with the Nobel Prize. The ability to offer these novel therapies requires capital and knowledge \u2014 infrastructure that the Kings' generosity will help Rush put in place,\" said [Dr. Jochen Reiser](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jochen-reiser-md-phd), the Ralph C. Brown, MD, Professor of Internal Medicine and chair of internal medicine at Rush. Immunotherapy is a relatively new way to treat cancer. It often is more targeted than conventional cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy. Immunotherapy treatments have the potential to work across different cancer types and may be effective against even the most advanced and hard-to-treat cancers, but scientists are still at the beginning stages of tapping its capability. \"The Kings' gift has the potential to have a huge impact,\" said [Dr. Parameswaran Venugopal](https://doctors.rush.edu/details/1263), director of the Section of Hematology at Rush. \"Rush physicians and patients get the benefit of novel therapies, and our research findings will be beneficial to the greater cancer community. Rush will be able to further the conversation with scientists across the globe as we seek to understand the full potential of immunotherapy.\" A portion of the Kings' gift will be used to establish and sustain an endowed professorship to support immunotherapy research at Rush. Once recruited, the Robert E. and Emily H. King Endowed Professor of Cancer Research will serve as the scientific leader of the program, building the hematology arm of Rush's existing immunotherapy research, coordinating efforts among physician-scientists and researchers throughout Rush, and spearheading important collaborations with other leading cancer institutions across the country. The Robert E. and Emily H. King Cancer Immunotherapy Research Program will advance research that will initiate more phase 1 clinical trials to help bring new immunotherapy medicines to patients faster. These kinds of studies not only give patients access to promising new treatments, often before they're widely available, but also provide physicians with invaluable data about the safety and efficacy of emerging treatments. Additionally, the program will facilitate increased laboratory studies \u2014 at Rush and in collaboration with the Medical Center's partners \u2014 aimed at improving understanding of immunotherapy and its prospective impact on patients. Rush's research will focus on uncovering more effective and personalized approaches to immunotherapy by determining which patients will benefit most from new therapies. In addition, researchers at Rush will explore the development of new immunotherapy compounds that are easier to administer, have fewer long-term side effects and increase survival rates. \"Still in early development, immunotherapy is proving very effective even against the most difficult-to-treat cancers. The more we learn, however, about personalizing the dosage and using it in combination with other therapies, the better the treatment options we can provide our patients,\" Venugopal said. \"More clinical trials and translational research will allow us to answer these questions in immunotherapy.\" The Kings' gift comes at a time of great momentum for both Rush and its cancer center, said [Dr. Larry Goodman](https://www.rush.edu/about-us/about-rush/leadership-biographies/larry-j-goodman-md-about-rush), CEO of [the Rush System](https://www.rush.edu/excellence-old) and Rush University Medical Center. \"Throughout Rush, we are creating ways to help expand access to care, continue to advance better outcomes, rapidly adopt emerging treatments and deliver a uniquely personal care experience,\" Goodman said. \"In the cancer program specifically, we're using approaches and partnerships that will help care teams evaluate and quickly implement the best possible treatment plan for each individual patient, including immunotherapy. The establishment of the Robert and Emily King Cancer Immunotherapy Research Program is a critical component of this comprehensive, integrated approach to oncologic care.\" Rush University Cancer Center's expert oncology services are [recognized among the best in the country](https://www.rush.edu/news/press-releases/rush-ranked-among-best-nationwide-seven-specialties-us-news) by U.S. News & World Report and are [fully accredited by the Commission on Cancer](https://www.rush.edu/news/press-releases/fourth-straight-commission-cancer-accreditation) of the American College of Surgeons. Building upon this clinical strength and continued growth in basic research and clinical trials, Rush has made investing in its cancer program a top strategic priority. Rush will maximize the Kings' philanthropic investment through [partnerships with institutions such as Tempus](https://www.rush.edu/news/customizing-cancer-care-patients), a Chicago-based biotechnology company led by Groupon co-founder Eric Lefkofsky that provides genetic analysis to guide treatment plans for cancer patients. Expansion of these kinds of bioinformatics capabilities not only will help clinicians at Rush personalize care, but also will enable researchers to more effectively test and refine new therapies through research and clinical trials. Plans for cancer services at the Medical Center also include the construction of [an 11-story outpatient care center](https://www.rush.edu/news/press-releases/rush-plans-major-new-outpatient-care-center) on the northeast corner of Ashland Avenue and Harrison Street. With a focus on cancer and neuroscience treatment, the new building will bring together clinical services, radiation therapy, infusion therapy, integrative medicine and imaging \u2014 all in one location. The center also will provide convenient amenities for visitors, including a pharmacy, retail space and food options. The Kings' gift will also create a dedicated fund for nursing research and education in hematology. Cancer nurses at Rush play an integral role in patient care and research initiatives, monitoring side effects and helping patients become familiar with the administration of new therapies. To strengthen this vital role, the fund will support an immunotherapy nursing care symposium that will provide specialized training to nurses both at Rush and at other institutions. Rush nurses will be leaders in the field of providing care for patients undergoing immunotherapy treatments, hosting annual training sessions for nursing staff from other health care institutions. \"Nurses and nurse practitioners are the backbone of clinical trials,\" Venugopal said. \"Specialized training in hematology for our nurses will benefit the immunotherapy program as we enroll and treat more patients.\" Funding for nursing education is particularly meaningful to the Kings, who have experienced the difference that [highly trained nurses](https://www.rush.edu/health-care-professionals/career-opportunities/join-rush-nursing/magnet-nurses-quality-care-rush) make in the overall quality of care. \"We did not want to leave out nurses because they're very important not just for treating patients but also for managing clinical trials,\" Emily King said. \"Rush nurses' interpersonal skills and the way they have cared for Bob has been terrific. \"If we can combine nursing education with an increase in clinical trials and move just a little bit forward in the realm of immunotherapy research \u2014 if we have the capacity to do it \u2014 we should offer to help.\" Robert and Emily King are active philanthropists in the Chicago area and beyond.

Rush is testing whether a vaccine can help people's own immune system slow the spread of glioblastomas, a deadly form of brain cancer. Rush University Medical Center is part of a new clinical trial testing whether an experimental vaccine can help patients' immune systems stop the spread of glioblastoma \u2014 an aggressive form of [brain cancer](https://www.rush.edu/services/brain-tumor-services/conditions) with very few current treatment options. Led by neuro-oncologist Clement Pillainayagam, MD, [the phase II clinical trial](https://www.rush.edu/clinical-trials/drug-treatment-study-recurrent-or-progressive-glioblastoma) is testing an investigational vaccine that will be given in conjunction with bevacizumab, an FDA-approved drug that targets the proteins glioblastoma cells need to grow blood vessels. Rush is one of only a few Midwest locations for this international trial, [Drug Treatment Study for Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma](https://www.rush.edu/clinical-trials/drug-treatment-study-recurrent-or-progressive-glioblastoma). Glioblastomas are malignant tumors that begin in the glial, or supportive, tissue of the brain and spread rapidly because they are supported by a large network of blood vessels. There is no known cure for glioblastoma tumors, and median survival is just four months without treatment and 15 to 19 months with treatment. In a stark reminder of the need for better treatments, U.S. Sen. John McCain died from glioblastoma on Aug. 25, one of more than 15,000 people in the United States who succumb to brain cancer each year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Current standard treatments typically involve surgery followed by [chemotherapy](https://www.rush.edu/services/test-treatment/chemotherapy) and [radiation therapy](https://www.rush.edu/services/test-treatment/radiation-therapy). Immunotherapies like those being tested in this trial, which engage the body's immune system to attack tumors, increasingly are becoming part of treatment plans. \"Our immune system would typically put a stop to cancer cells growing, but glioblastoma cells suppress this process,\" Pillainayagam explains. \"Bevacizumab has been shown to help the immune system starve tumors of their blood supply as well as decrease the immunosuppressed state around the tumor. But that just isn't enough,\" he said. Half of the study participants chosen at random will receive bevacizumab, and the other half will be treated with bevacizumab plus the experimental vaccine. The vaccine (DSP-788-201G) is derived from peptides (short chains of amino acids) produced by the WT1gene that is found in many types of cancer cells, including glioblastomas. The vaccine is used by the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) system, cell surface proteins that help regulate the immune system. \"While the bevacizumab helps starve the tumor by blocking formation of blood vessels inside it, we hope the vaccine revs up the immune response by helping the body recognize that these cancer cells are a threat,\" Pillainayagam said. Though the development in recent years of therapies that help people's own immune system target cancer cells has meant new options for many types of cancers, very few immunotherapies for cancers in the brain have shown promise. \"The brain has different types of immune cells that work in unique combinations. Thus, trying to understand how to unleash our own immune systems is a challenge,\" Pillainayagam said. One challenge is actually a barrier: The human body evolved a layer of specialized cells, called the blood-brain barrier, that line the blood vessels in the brain, providing extra security from threats such as viruses and bacteria that circulate in the rest of the bloodstream. That extra layer of protection also prevents many cancer-fighting drugs from working. By [some estimates,](https://www.healthimaging.com/topics/advanced-visualization/focused-us-study-open-blood-brain-barrier-deliver-drugs) 98 percent of current FDA-approved drugs do not enter the brain because of the blood-brain barrier. Along with [Joo Yeon Nam, MD](https://doctors.rush.edu/details/17447), Pillainayagam leads Rush's [Section of works in conjunction with specialists across Rush's [Department of Neurological Sciences](https://www.rush.edu/services/neurology) to treat patients with primary cancers of the brain and spine. \"The brain is sensitive and exquisite real estate. Everything we do and even who we are depends on the brain functioning well, thus even a tiny growth can have an enormous impact,\" Pillainayagam says. He adds that dual training in oncology and neurology usually comes into play several times during a single appointment. \"As an oncologist, my focus is typically at the cellular level, focusing on the chemotherapy, radiation and other tools that keep cancer cells in check. But as a neurologist, I am addressing the neurological impact the cancers have on people's movements, thinking and even personality.\" Nam says that the dual training in oncology and neurology is especially necessary because brain cancers have such deep impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. In addition to causing neurological problems such as weakness, seizures and impaired speech, \"brain cancers like glioblastomas affect the part of the body that makes people who they are,\" she says.
