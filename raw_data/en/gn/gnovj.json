You've been told that an iron filter is the only way to solve your well water iron problems. But, they are not cheap, so you are searching online to see if you can find a less expensive solution. That is exactly what you have found in Crystal Clean. Your water softener is perfectly capable of removing all of the iron from your well water without an iron filter. The problem occurs inside your softener's resin where the iron molecules bond with oxygen to form rust (aka. iron-oxide). Water softener salt, standard iron treatments, and even rust removing salt are too weak to break the iron/oxygen bond that forms the rust. As a result, rust will build up until it chokes your softener's ability to remove iron from your well water, and iron stains appear in your home. Crystal Clean uses advanced technology with a molecular bonding strength 10x stronger than standard iron treatments and rust-removing salt. This easily breaks apart years' worth of rust build-up very quickly, restoring your water softener's ability to remove iron from the well water. A water softener that is kept free of rust build-up with Crystal Clean will prevent all iron staining exactly like an iron filter, at a much lower cost. Crystal Clean is available via local dealers or can be purchased direct from the factory via this website. Our automatic system is designed so the average homeowner can set it up in about 15 minutes without the need for professional installation.
