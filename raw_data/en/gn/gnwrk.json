Shelves full of 'all natural' products, which basically means nothing, leaves the best of us feeling defeated and willing to defer the decision to another day. But today's you're lucky day! It's time to cut to the chase with our 5 best non-toxic products you can purchase and start using right away. Let's see which ones make the grade. All-Purpose Cleaner Products in the home-cleaning department are largely unregulated, so although it might appear to be healthy, chances are it's not. Avoid products with triclosan or 1,4 Dioxane and opt for those with ingredients known to be safe ( [www.ewg.org](http://www.ewg.org)). Our pick: Branch Basics Concentrated All-Purpose Cleaner. Dish Soap Another unregulated industry, dish soap manufacturers are notorious for hiding their ingredients, presenting a more health-conscious face to the consumer. But year after year, our top pick - Method Dish Soap - has maintained full-disclosure of their plant-derived ingredients which makes the choice simple! Laundry Detergent This is a secret hiding place for an untold number of toxic ingredients which can end up being embedded in your clothing and coming into direct contact with your skin. The worst toxic offenders are monoanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, chlorine bleach or sodium borate. Not only are they bad for our skin, but they're also terrible for the environment! Our pick: Seventh Generation Laundry Detergent, Free and Clear. Dryer Balls Using dryer sheets to reduce static cling and make your clothes smell fresh is temptingly deceitful. Another collection of chemicals that contribute to a toxic environment, these can easily be replaced with Wool Dryer Balls. Made from just one ingredient - wool - these dryer balls reduce static cling and help your clothes dry faster! Air Freshener With the resurgence of essential oils in the United States, it's easy to find a wonderful scent that is suitable for everyone in the home. Be sure to purchase organic oils from a reputable source and find a diffuser that will gently deliver your chosen fragrance "}
