Breast Milk Jaundice vs. Breastfeeding Jaundice Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention When to Call a Health Care Provider Getty Images If you're currently expecting, or planning for a family, you've likely heard of jaundice, a condition that affects newborn babies and is marked by a yellowing of the skin. Jaundice is extremely common in infants, with 60% to 80% of term or late-term babies developing this condition to some degree. Jaundice, also known as hyperbilirubinemia, is when the baby's body is not yet processing its blood efficiently enough, resulting in excessive amounts of bilirubin in the bloodstream. This issue usually resolves without intervention, but monitoring is essential as, sometimes, treatments are needed. Approximately 20% to 30% of breastfed babies get a type of jaundice directly related to breastfeeding, known as breast milk jaundice. Ahead, learn more about this condition, including its symptoms, treatment, and when to call a health care provider. Jaundice in Babies and Newborns What Is Breast Milk Jaundice? Jaundice, in general, can occur when there is too much of a yellowish substance called bilirubin in the baby's blood. Bilirubin is a byproduct of red blood cells breaking down. Normally, the liver makes a change to this excess bilirubin to allow it to more easily excrete in the urine or stool; however, in a newborn, their liver is immature and it can take a while for the liver to function efficiently. Babies who are breastfed have a higher chance of having jaundice than babies who are fed formula, resulting in what is known as breast milk jaundice. In the vast majority of cases, jaundice resolves without any negative impact on the baby. However, in the rare instances when complications do occur, this build-up of bilirubin can cause serious brain damage for the baby, which is why early and consistent monitoring is vital to ensure treatment is received if needed. Breast Milk Jaundice vs. Breastfeeding Jaundice It's also key to note the distinction between breast milk jaundice and breastfeeding jaundice as they are not the same. Breastfeeding jaundice and breast milk jaundice sound very similar and are easy to mix up. Breastfeeding jaundice, or suboptimal intake jaundice, happens when a baby who is breastfed isn't getting enough milk and/or is struggling with nursing. This usually happens in the first week of life and is caused by bilirubin building up (and being reabsorbed) in the intestines. This type of jaundice can be treated by improving breastfeeding techniques and increasing feedings to help get rid of excess bilirubin. Breast milk jaundice, on the other hand, happens even when your baby is getting enough milk and has a strong latch, however, they may still develop jaundice due to the breast milk itself. It typically starts when a baby is 2 weeks old and can continue up to 12 weeks. 7 Newborn Vaccines Your Baby Needs Symptoms of Breast Milk Jaundice The tell-tale sign of jaundice is a yellowing of the eyes or skin. Other common symptoms of breast milk jaundice, along with jaundice in general, are: A high-pitched cry Being lethargic or sleepy Not gaining weight The birthing team will monitor your baby for jaundice at the hospital or birthing center, and a health care provider will also keep watch during regular checkups. However, if you notice any of these signs be sure to consult with a pediatrician or health care professional right away. Causes of Breast Milk Jaundice Doctors and researchers don't fully know why breast milk jaundice happens. However, some researchers theorize that it could be related to a substance in breast milk that temporarily prevents your baby's liver from breaking down bilirubin in an efficient manner. This type of jaundice might have a genetic component as well, meaning it can run in families. How Much Should a Newborn Eat? How Is Breast Milk Jaundice Diagnosed? Breast milk jaundice is usually seen in the first several weeks in a breastfed baby and is spotted through the signs and symptoms, along with a diagnosis of exclusion. Your baby will probably be gaining weight as they should, nursing well, and making enough wet diapers, but their bilirubin levels might be elevated. This is typically diagnosed with a blood test. If the levels are high enough, you might see yellowing on your baby's skin or eyes. Once other disorders are ruled out, breast milk jaundice may be diagnosed. How Is Breast Milk Jaundice Treated? Most of the time, no treatment is needed for breast milk jaundice. Phototherapy is often used to treat more severe jaundice. This treatment can be done in the hospital or at home. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sometimes treatment involves supplementing for a certain period with donor milk or formula. In rare instances, you'll be told to temporarily stop nursing in order to diagnose breast milk jaundice. Generally, though, increasing how often you're nursing your baby can help with hydration and ridding their body of excess bilirubin. Can You Prevent Breast Milk Jaundice? There's nothing you can do to prevent breast milk jaundice and you don't usually have to stop nursing your baby. Your baby may still be healthy and feeding well, but could still have jaundice two or three months after birth. This jaundice isn't harmful, and in most cases, goes away on its own\u2014and it's not your fault! Make sure your baby is eating every 2 to 4 hours and seek out help from a lactation consultant or medical provider if you have concerns about breastfeeding. Breastfed Baby Poop: What's Normal? When to Call a Health Care Provider About Breast Milk Jaundice While breast milk jaundice usually resolves on its own and isn't a cause for concern, if left unchecked it can be problematic. Call a pediatrician or health care provider if you notice your baby isn't nursing well or isn't wetting a diaper at least every six hours. It's important to prevent dehydration in your baby, so if you have any concerns, it's best to be on the safe side. If your baby has already been diagnosed, and the yellowing of the skin seems to spread down to their abdomen or legs, or if they appear to be lethargic, let a health care provider know right away. The Bottom Line Breast milk jaundice, for the most part, goes away on its own without any concerns. It's important to keep in mind that you did not do anything wrong, and this condition is not your fault. Be sure to speak with a pediatrician or health care provider with any questions, concerns, or troubling symptoms, in order to find the best course of action for your baby. What Is Colostrum?
