Journal of Behavioral Medicine Yoga is an integrated mind-body practice, originating about 5000 years BC in ancient India. Since then, it has been employed to promote health and well-being across various conditions. The word 'yoga' is derived from Sanskrit and may be translated as 'union' or 'conjunction' , entailing the idea of uniting body, mind, and spirit . Though yoga is in the western world predominantly used as a recreational practice, it is increasingly gaining attention as a clinical intervention. In fact, yoga did not primarily evolve as a system of physical exercises, but also as a healing system ). This healing system is based on the assumptions that a human being is a unique, holistic, and interconnected entity; that yoga can empower a person to become active in his or her own healing; and that a person's state of mind is central to this healing process . Proceeding ICON 3 2017 Background: Yoga is a spiritual therapy originated in India. This therapy is called spiritual because it integrates the mind, body and. Survey of the National Department of Health, United States 2007 said at least 19% of Americans adults do mind-body therapy such as Tai Chi, Qi Gong, meditation and Yoga. Yoga provides benefits complex, including physical postures and body, reduce stress, lower blood pressure, reduce fatigue, reduce asthma, improve circulation and boost the immune system. Many studies have proven the benefits of yoga include arthritis, stress, metabolic syndrome, asthma, pain and depression. The aim of this study was to identify the effectiveness of yoga intervention towards enhancing the immune system Method: Search of journal articles done electronically using several databases such as Pubmed, DOAJ, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov with limitations of publication based on PICOT. Time limitation was used in January 2005 to 2017. There was only 15 articles of 117 articles obtained which match with inclusion criteria. Result: Based on those, the most effective yoga to affect immune system is combination of yoga asanas, pranayama and meditation, within intensity and duration minimum to practice is everyday in 4 weeks. Those 15 literatures had explained that yoga give an effect to increase immune system. Yoga increased amount of antibody that are IgA, salivary cortisol, SOD, leukocyte, sTNF-RII. Conclusions: Yoga give positive support to the person with acute or chronic diseases by maximizing implementation combination of yoga asanas, pranayama and meditation Therefore, yoga can provide many benefits and easy to use at all ages and conditions. We hope this systematic review can give contribution with research related to yoga.

It is now well recognized that chronic stress can alter the physiological cross-talk between brain and biological systems, leading to long-lasting maladaptive effects (allostatic overload) on the nervous, immune, endocrine, and metabolic systems, which compromises stress resiliency and health. Stressful conditions in early life have been associated with profound alterations in cortical and subcortical brain regions involved in emotion regulation and the salience network, showing relevant overlap with different psychiatric conditions. This paper provides a summary of the available literature concerning the notable effects of stress on the brain and immune system.... Frontiers in Human Neuroscience 2017 Endocrines Psychoneuroendocrineimmunology (PNEI) brings together knowledge acquired since 1930s from endocrinology, immunology, neuroscience, and psychology. With PNEI, a model of research and interpretation of health and disease is emerging, which sees the human body as a structured and interconnected unit, where the psychological and biological systems are mutually coordinated. In the PNEI view, many factors could influence mental health, with the endocrine system involved in mediating the effects of environmental stress on mental health and inflammation in the onset and course of psychiatric disorders as a result of individual and collective conditions and behaviors. Among these, nutrition is one way by which the environment impacts physiology: indeed, many pieces of research showed that several elements (e.g., probiotics, fish oil, zinc) have a positive effect on mental disorders thus being potentially augmentation agents in treatment. Still, physical activity can moderate depressive s... Encyclopedia 2021 Historical background THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE NERVOUS AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS Traditionally, two ideas hindered the conceptualization of neuroendocrine-immune relations. The first: the brain is an organ in itself, it is an exception, and it is not an organ like any other. In traditional physiological thinking, the brain was conceived as mainly inaccessible to the immune system. The brain is an immunologically privileged place, protected by the blood-brain barrier: this dogma, which still echoes here and there in medical congresses and some university departments, has been affected by the Clinical Psychology Review 2022 One proposed pathway that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may offer a salutogenic effect on somatic disorders is by enhancing immune function. As such, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials examining the effect of MBIs at post-intervention and follow-up for six nuclear factor-B, telomere length, and telomerase activity. Potential studies were identified by searching ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete, AMED, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, and PsycINFO. Searches returned 1959 studies, of which 48 (70 effects) were included (N = 4683). Pooled effect sizes indicated a reduction in C-reactive protein (SMCD = -.14, 95% [-.05 [.17 - 1.46]) at post-intervention. At follow-up, in interleukin-6 (SMCD = -.13, 95% CI [-.68 .22, 95% CI [-.08 - .52]). Meta-regression results showed that some heterogeneity in effect size could be accounted for by intervention dosage, study population, and study design. Our findings quantify MBIs' potential for improving immune function and thus impacting somatic disorders. EXPLORE 2019 FULLTEXT Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
