Q: Why does caffeine give you energy? And how much is too much? A:There are so many metabolic effects of caf- feine that it has been hard to sort out which, exactly, are responsible for the increase in physical and mental energy that most users experience. Caffeine is known to boost the effects of the neu- rotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and acetylcholine. Dopamine, for example, is known to affect levels of concentration. It blocks adenosine receptors in the basal forebrain, which, when not impeded, are what typically signal the brain when it's time to go to bed. Caffeine also increases the release of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) via the sympathetic nervous system, which, among other things, can make your heart beat faster, send more blood to your muscles and tell your liver to release sugar into the bloodstream for energy.Caffeine can help muscles to contract by encouraging the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle bers to release calcium ions, and it reduces the percentage of maximum exertion that a given exercise requires, to name just a few effects. Increasing circulating and intracellular substrate availability, or fuel for the muscles, occurs in response to changes brought on by caffeine, and may help to explain the perception of reduced exertion during exercise. Research also shows that the amount of caffeine we consume matters. Consumption of 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight (about one to one and a half cups of brewed coffee) appears not to produce some of the energizing effects, and as much as 6 mg/ kg may be needed. That's a lot of coffee, especially for women, considering that high caffeine consumption is linked to greater bone loss, not to mention jitteriness and sleeplessness. On the other hand, depending on your family history, because caffeine consumption is linked to a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, Type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's, it may feel like a bargain that works in your favor. How much caffeine you consume is a personal choice. Research doesn't have all the answers yet, and being aware of the bene ts we get from caffeine and under- standing the potential downsides give us our own best solution.

I applaud Major Jessica McCoy's commitment to improving the welfare of the Iraqi people. However, I worry that the type of indus- trial poultry production being promoted by the State Department and many aid agen- cies is the same system that sustainable agriculture advocates have been ghting for years in the United States and Europe. As students of the Friedman School's Agriculture, Food and Environment Program should be aware, poultry waste in the amounts generated by industrial animal production systems, which typically con ne thousands, if not tens of thousands, of ani- mals indoors, does not simply make good organic fertilizer. Rather, it pollutes the air and water and threatens public health.

Finally, a key element of success is lead- ership. This reminds me of former Tufts President Jean Mayer's statement that nutrition is an agenda, not simply a sci- ence. For the agenda to move forward, lead- ership is critical. The Future of Nutrition project focuses attention on the skills the coming generations of leaders will need and how this will change our emphasis in research and training. The meeting in June will bring together representatives from the U.S. executive and legislative branches of government, United Nations agencies, academia and the public health and anti- hunger communities. A few words about two outstanding members of our faculty. Jos\u00e9 Ordovas has been selected for the 2009 Distinguished Faculty Award. He is not only world- renowned in the area of nutrigenomics, but equally important, he has trained and mentored hundreds of students. Congratulations, Jos\u00e9. Under the direction of Kathleen Merrigan, the Agriculture, Food and Environment Program has grown and fl our- ished. Not surprisingly, given Kathleen's leadership strengths, she is now our nation's Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, oversee- ing the major nutrition programs in the United States and supervising a budget of $95 billion. Good luck, Kathleen! This is a critical position at a critical time, and we wish you well.The Next Steps for Nutrition eileen kennedy, d.sc.the world of nutrition has changed dra- matically over the last 100 years. Less than a century ago much of the nutrition research in the United States focused on the discovery of essential vitamins and minerals. There were no dietary goals or guidelines, and the words nutrigenomics and epigenomics were in no one's lexicon. As the areas of emphasis con- tinue to change, we need to examine the evolving nature of nutrition and its implications for research, training, programs and policies. With this aim, the Friedman School, in collaboration with the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, will sponsor a meeting in Washington, D.C., on June 1 to explore \"Children's Health: The Future of Food and Nutrition Policy.\" Some themes unite this Future of Nutrition effort. First, we need a more compelling link between basic nutrition research and our programs and pol- icies. When I testi ed before a U.S. Senate Committee in December on the implications of the economic downturn for child nutrition, the majority of the questions were about how to more effectively use scienti c research for the public good. This is a particularly critical year for this discussion as the child nutrition legislation\u2014which affects programs such as school lunch and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC)\u2014will be reauthorized in 2009. The Future of Nutrition project seeks to identify how child nutrition programs can focus more on health and wellness, including the prevention of childhood overweight. The Future of Nutrition effort will also emphasize the global face of nutri- tion. The stark contrast between nutrition issues in the United States and in developing countries has blurred in the past 20 years. Nutrition is now more complex. Although research on single nutrients is still important, researchers must look at discovery and application in the con- text of the total diet. Linked to this is the fact that public-private partnerships in food and nutrition are not only becoming more important, they are becom- ing the norm. Nutrition is no longer the exclusive responsibility of the public sector. The project will examine new paradigms of public-private collabora- tion to promote healthy lifestyles. It will also look at how policies around food and nutrition need to be revamped. Public policy has not acknowledged that around the world, food is increasingly not traded as food but as raw material input into consumer product processes. The United States leads the world in this area. This economic and philosophical shift has profound implications for 511846_02_03 3 511846_02_03 3 5/5/09 8:14:57 PM 5/5/09 8:14:57 PMILLUSTRATION: KATIA WISH RESEARCH IN BRIEF Vitamin K Slows Insulin Resistance Elderly men who took vitamin K supplements slowed the progres- sion of their insulin resistance over a three-year trial. Insulin resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes, occurs when the body cannot use insu- lin properly, causing glucose to build up in the blood. The researchers did not see a difference in the women they studied, which they speculate may be because the women in the group tended to be more overweight than the men. \"Vitamin K is stored in fat tissue,\" says Professor Sarah Booth, Ph.D., senior author of the study, which appeared in Diabetes Care, and director of the Vitamin K Laboratory at the HNRCA. \"If there is excess fat, vitamin K may not be readily available to cells that require it to process glucose.\" Although supplements of 500 micrograms were used, the authors say the dosage is attainable by eating a healthy diet. Good sources of vitamin K include Brussels sprouts, broccoli, spinach and collard greens. 4 tufts nutrition spring 2009dding bicarbonate to your diet, which can be done by eating lots of fruits and vegetables, leads to greater bone density, according to a study by Tufts researchers. Diets high in protein and cereal grains tend to increase acidity in the body, which can leach calcium out of the bones, reducing bone mass and increasing the risk for fractures. Bicarbonate, which is created when you eat produce, helps boost alkali levels in the body, neutralizing the acidity and its negative effects on bones, the study says. Participants in the double-blind study\u2014171 men and women ages 50 and older\u2014were divided into groups that received either a placebo or doses of potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate or potassium chloride for three months. The people who took bicar- bonate showed signi cant reductions in calcium excretion and bone resorption. While low levels of calcium and vitamin D are often considered culprits in bone loss, \"there is increasing evidence that the acid/base balance of the diet is also important,\" accord- ing to the report, which was written by Bess Dawson-Hughes, M.D., M75, director of the Bone Metabolism Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts. On average, American diets tend to be slightly acidic. \"Increasing intake of alkali merits further consideration as a safe and low-cost approach to improving skeletal health in older men and women,\" the report concludes. The study was published in the January issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism .

A clue may come from a recent study, which found that people who exercised moderately and consumed nutri- ents called catechins, found in green tea, were more likely to lose abdominal fat while exerc ising than those who didn't take them. The study, published in the Journal of Nutrition , divided 107 healthy but normally sedentary and overweight adults into two groups: those who received beverages with the green tea catechins and those who did not. They were then put on an exercise regime for 12 weeks. Those who consumed the catechins had \"a trend toward greater loss of body weight ... compared with the control group,\" the researchers wrote. Even though the levels of total body fat for the two groups wasn't greatly different at the end of the study, it turned out that the catechin-drinkers showed sig- ni cant losses of abdominal and subcutaneous abdominal fat and in serum triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood that, in high levels, has been linked to heart disease and stroke. The daily dose of catechins in the study was 625 mg. An average cup of green tea has between 150 and 250 mg, depending on how long it is steeped. \"Catechins are widely distributed in plant foods,\" says Professor Jeffrey Blumberg, Ph.D., director of the Antioxidant Research Laboratory at the HNRCA. \"However, the richest dietary source by far is tea\u2014white, green, oolong and black,\" though green tea has the highest concentrations. Reading, 'Riting and RecessG This should make gym teachers jump for joy: A study of children attending public schools found that students who were physically t scored better on standard- ized academic achievement tests than their less- t peers. The study, published in the Journal of School Health , was the work of Virginia Chomitz, Ph.D., N85, N92, a senior scientist at the Institute for Community Health, and her colleagues. The researchers compared the physi- cal tness of 1,500 Cambridge public school students in grades 4 to 8 to the students' scores on the math and English components of assessment tests. The researchers could not say for certain that it was physical tness that caused the students to do better on the exams. The high-scorers could just be motivated students in that they \"strive for achievement in both academics and physical tness or athletics,\" the study said. But the research may give pause to the 14 percent of U.S. school districts that reported cutting gym classes to t in more time for math and English.

BYUN Ide Practical 511846_06_07 6 511846_06_07 6 5/8/09 5:28:25 PM 5/8/09 5:28:25 PM\"Students would come back to me years after they graduated and tell me they were doing jobs they didn't want to do, work-ing for some large private corporation,\" he says. \"Most graduate students want to save the world, but they don't want to be Mother Teresa.\" But how do you achieve that? To help, Hammock and Alissa S. Wilson, F05, now a policy advocate for the American Friends Service Committee, interviewed 50 people who give back through jobs they love and published their advice in the book Practical Idealists: Changing the World and Getting Paid (Harvard University Press). It is a how-to manual for people who want to work on social issues and still earn a living. \"The book doesn't prescribe anything,\" Hammock says. Instead, through questions and exercises, the authors encourage read-ers to examine their values, passions and skills. Money, for example, is a big obstacle to taking a job outside the private sector. Readers, Hammock says, should ask them-selves, \"How much is enough?\" Samantha Yu, who analyzes family social service programs for the city of Los Angeles, relates in the book that accepting a modest salary was not \"a huge adjustment\" for her. \"I grew up in a very typical middle-class family,\" she says. \"My salary will support that. It's not as tough as it might appear.\" To know what you want out of a career, Hammock says, you have to understand your own identity. His own political awareness was fostered by his expatriate childhood in Cuba, where his father, an American, had taken a job at the island's rst Woolworth's store. The overthrow of Batista's dictatorship, which Hammock witnessed at age 14, filled him with ideas of justice and social change. \"The Cuban revolution struck a real chord with me,\" he writes on www.practicalidealists.org, the companion website to the book. Although he recognized the evil perpetuated during the upheaval, \"the rhetoric of equality, of equal access, of racial harmony all made tremendous sense,\" he writes. \"From an early age, I knew I wanted to work with poverty issues, knew I wanted to work in Latin America,\" he says. He went on to serve as executive director of Oxfam America from 1984 to 1995 and to found the Feinstein International Center at Tufts. He is the North American director of the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, a research center at Oxford University. Hammock sees the same idealism that inspired him in his Tufts students. Yet he says the crunchy-granola image of the '60s hippie do-gooder is gone, replaced by a practical approach to working for social change that cuts across many professions. A lawyer or an engineer has just as much potential to save the world as a social worker or a human rights activist. James Forman Jr., a former public defender, refl ects in the book that \"we have so few quality lawyers [as public defenders] and we pay them so little. The results are what we see\u2014a lot of people who don't get due process. So I thought ... let me put myself on the front lines.\" Similarly, Attorney Mel Rodis uses her small law practice in Phoenix, Ariz., to represent immigrants who are vic- tims of slavery, debt bondage and indentured servitude. There are many approaches to making major life decisions, the book notes. Chris Estes, a low-income housing advocate, took part in a vocational retreat, while Josh Dorfman, who specializes in eco-friendly design and green homes, \"drank micro-brews and learned the chords for the 'House of the Rising Sun' \" before settling on how to put his MBA to best use. How you do it doesn't matter, the authors write. \"The crucial actions are to stop and think\u2014to develop a steady habit of refl ection.\" As Hammock puts it, \"Some people need to go on a silent retreat, other people need to buy a six pack of beer, and others need a cold shower.\" Taking the time for refl ection isn't easy, he adds, \"because students are so busy. But you have to. If you don't, all of a sudden you'll be in the job market, and if you haven't taken that time, it's going to be hard.\" It can be even harder to make a transition mid-career. \"You talk to people who are 45, and at that point, they're often locked in,\" Hammock says. He hopes the book will get them when they're young. But that means getting his students' heads out of a book from time to time, too. \"Academia is a lot about ... well, academ- ics,\" Hammock says with a laugh. \"In aca-demia we ll people's heads with theory\u2014which we need. But we don't spend a lot of time talking about who we are. The book talks more to the heart, and gets the heart and the head to move together.\" TN Leslie Macmillan is a writer/editor in Tufts' Of ce of Publications.

But when they get their degree, they may nd themselves saddled with student loans and nurturing the idea of one day getting married, buying a house and eventually sending their own kids to college. Is this vision consistent with tramping across the red dust plains of Africa, doling out rice from a sack? Being an idealist doesn't necessarily mean taking a vow of poverty, says John Hammock, Ph.D., F68, F71, an associate professor of public policy at the Friedman and Fletcher schools. Having taught ethics and its relationship to international humanitarianism since 1996, Hammock is very familiar with the complex dilemma of how to balance altruism with personal needs. dealists 511846_06_07 7 511846_06_07 7 5/5/09 8:31:07 PM 5/5/09 511846_08_09 8 9KATIE CAVUTO, N04, thought her competitive days were over when an injury during college curtailed her ambitions as a gymnast. She turned instead to a culinary career, becoming a regis- tered dietitian, personal chef, entrepreneur and regional television personality. But now Cavuto is dusting off her competitive skills for an entirely different type of agility contest: She's vying to become \"The Next Food Network Star.\" On the Food Network reality show of the same name, Cavuto and nine other cooks will face off this summer for a chance to host a show on the cable network that made Emeril, Alton and Giada into household names\u2014at least in those households that include a Microplane grater. Cavuto is the owner of Healthy Bites (www.healthybitesdeliv- ery.com), a combination cooking and nutrition service based in Philadelphia's center city. She is also a well-known face on local Philly TV stations, where she does snappy, practical segments on topics like \"Cooking on a Budget\" and \"The Fattiest Foods of Summer.\" \"I have so much really important information that I want to share with people, and I wanted to nd the best way to relay this informa- tion to the largest audience possible,\" she says. \"The Next Food Network Star\" is basically a cross between the kitchen wizardry of \"Iron Chef\" and the populist one-upmanship of \"American Idol.\" The nalists take part in high-pressure cooking challenges designed not just to show off their kitchen skills, but to prove they have a personality that millions of foodies could love. Each week, another nalist loses his or her place at the stove. And the challenges go far beyond getting dinner for four on the table after work. This season, for example, the nalists will be asked to cater a party for a roomful of Food Network stars and cook for returning soldiers aboard the aircraft carrier at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. While the judges may not include the acerbic Simon Cowell, neither are they inclined to be particularly merciful. But Cavuto is not one to be deterred. While a student at Penn State, where she was majoring in kinesiology, she suffered an injury that left her unable to continue in competitive gymnastics. \"Being a gymnast was so much a part of my identity that when it was ripped away from me prematurely, it was a pivotal moment in my life,\" she recalls. It wasn't long, however, before a trip to Europe led her to turn her considerable energies toward cooking. \"The relationship with food in Europe is so different than what it is here,\" she says. \"It's almost like a spiritual experience.\" On her return to the United States she enrolled at Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island, which had just started a culinary nutrition program. \"I learned to appreciate food on a level I never had before,\" she says, citing classes like spa cuisine, vegetarian cuisine and sports nutrition. After receiving an associate's degree in culinary arts and a bach- elor's in culinary nutrition, Cavuto came to Tufts for the combined dietetic internship and master's degree program at the Frances Stern Nutrition Center, where she fell in love with clinical nutrition. \"Cooking fell to the back burner,\" she says. While she was working at Graduate Hospital in her native Philadelphia, CNN Headline News called looking for someone to do a segment on healthy grilling for the Fourth of July. She was soon doing spots on Philadelphia's NBC, CBS and FOX af liates. Last year she left clinical practice to open Healthy Bites, where she counsels clients on healthy eating, gives cooking lessons, prepares food in their homes, delivers complete dinners and caters parties and other events. \"I'm coming into their homes and giving them all the tools they need to live a healthy lifestyle,\" she says. Cavuto highlighted her Healthy Bites philosophy in her audition video for \"The Next Food Network Star,\" which was lmed in one take by her husband, Andy Boyle, using their digital camera. \"On the audition tape, I made a dish with whole-wheat pasta, chicken sausage, broccolini, cherry tomatoes and ricotta cheese,\" she says. \"I built the dish around the protein and the vegetables, and I added the pasta at the end to show how you can recreate and rethink a tradi- tional meal to make it healthier and more gure-friendly.\" The trip from that video to the Food Network still surprises Cavuto. \"I'm still pinching myself,\" she says. Season 5 of \"The Next Food Network Star\" will air beginning June 7 at 9 p.m. E.T.; the nale will air August 2.

Yet overall, experts have found little to no evidence that vitamin C prevents or treats the common cold. Studies on using zinc to diminish the severity or duration of cold symptoms are inconclusive. Same goes for Echinacea. \"When I see advertisements on TV calling something an immune booster, I cringe, because most of them, as far as I know, are not based on complete and well-done stud- ies,\" says Simin Nikbin Meydani, D.V.M., Ph.D., director of the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts. That doesn't mean that nutrition isn't crucial to your ability to ght illness. Scientists have known for more than 60 years that a poor diet puts the immune system into free- fall. That is why diarrhea and pneumonia are life-threatening illnesses in parts of the world where malnutrition is prevalent. \"You need all of the essential nutrients. There is no exception for that,\" says Meydani, who also heads the Nutritional Immunology Laboratory at the HNRCA. \"Whether it's lipids, proteins, vitamins, minerals or trace minerals, you need to have them. If you have a de ciency, you can impair the immune response.\"What you need to know about nutrition and immunity 511846_10_13 10 511846_10_13 10 5/5/09 8:57:28 PM 8:57:37 PM 5/5/09 8:57:37 PMThe reason, she says, is that our bodies use specialized cells to fight each of the thou- sands of pathogens we are exposed to. But if our bodies stocked the number of cells we would need for the job, we would be Costco-sized cell warehouses. \"So the way nature dealt with it was to have very few of particular types of immune cells, and when they see a pathogen they recognize, in order to get rid of it, they increase their numbers imme-diately; they expand and prolifer-ate.\" The nutrients we keep in reserve become the building blocks of those antibodies and white blood cells. \"The question people have been asking is, 'Does this mean that if I go and take more of these nutrients I will have a better immune response?' \" As yet, there are no miracle pills, Meydani says, but \"there is some evidence that for some nutrients for some age groups that is the case.\" The elderly, for example, may warrant spe- cial attention. \"When you get older, your immune response does not function as well as a young per-son's,\" Meydani says. In particular, T-cell mediated function, which ghts against viruses, tumors and bacte- rial infection, slows down. Germs also appear to turn more aggressive in an older body. While working on her thesis in the Nutritional Immunology Laboratory, Raina L. Gay, Ph.D., N99, N05, and her colleagues con-ducted a study that showed a benign virus, when put into an old mouse, is more likely to mutate into a virulent form. \"This could be because there is higher oxidative stress in an older host,\" Meydani says, referring to the reactive molecules that damage cells. \"Or it could be because there are differences in the receptors that allow the virus to enter into the old host and proliferate at a higher rate. When viruses proliferate, the chances of mutation increase.\" To nd out if higher doses of vitamins could help older adults maintain their defenses, the immunology lab conducted several studies with Boston-area nursing home residents. They found that when they gave the senior citizens 200 milligram supplements of vitamin E\u2014which is higher than the current Recommended Daily Allowance\u2014they came down with fewer upper respiratory infec-tions, such as colds and sore throats. The researchers did not see any effect on lower respiratory infec- tions, such as pneumonia. But this could be further evidence that when it comes to supplements, one size does not t all. When Sarah Belisle, Ph.D., A03, N05, N08, and her colleagues looked at the genetic backgrounds of the nursing home residents who took the vitamin E, she found that the elderly with a certain form of a par-ticular gene did have fewer lower respiratory infections, while those who had a different version were unaffected. 12 tufts nutrition spring 2009Meydani says the interaction between genes and nutrition could help explain why clinical studies of vitamin E and cardiovascular disease have returned less-than-promising results. In some people, the supplements might work. In their genetic foils, they might not. Tread carefully when it comes to supplements. Fruits and vegeta- bles have phenolic compounds, which can have anti-infl ammatory properties, Meydani says, but people should hesitate about taking a whole lot of puri ed phenolic compounds in supplement form. \"When you have them in fruits and vegetables, you have them in combination with other nutrients, and they could have synergistic or opposing effects with each other,\" she says. For example, Harvard scientists found that people who drank ve cups of tea a day secreted 10 times more interferon, an immunity marker, than those who drank the same amount of placebo. But when Dayong Wu, Ph.D., an assistant professor at the Friedman School and a scientist in the Nutritional Immunology Lab, fed catechins, a type of polyphenol extracted from green tea, to laboratory mice, he found it decreased the ability of their T-cells to proliferate. That doesn't mean there might not one day be a go-to food for immune system health. Wu and his colleagues have been taking a close look at mushrooms, which have been used as a functional food for thousands of years in Asia, where they are used medicinally 511846_10_13 12 511846_10_13 12 5/5/09 8:57:49 PM 5/5/09 8:57:49 PMto ght tumors. Recent studies have indicated that mushrooms do not directly kill tumors, but may inhibit them by enhancing the immune system. Wu fed mice a diet containing white button mushroom powder in doses that would translate to two or ten cups of fresh mushrooms per day for a human. The animals showed enhanced activity in their natural killer cells, components of the innate immune system. \"Natural killer cells' main function is to kill viruses,\" Wu says. \"They also perform surveillance for malignant cells that could potentially form tumors.\" But before you dig out your mushroom stir-fry recipes, you should know that \"there is still a long way to go before we can claim that mushroom consumption can boost the immune function in humans,\" Wu says. IN THE MEANTIME, here are some science-backed immunity boosters: Put on your sneakers Several studies have linked moderate exercise with immune function. When your heart gets pumping, it's easier for your blood to circulate the immune cells that kill off bacteria and viruses. This effect stops a few hours after your gym session ends, but consistent regular exercise seems to have a cumulative effect. In one set of stud- ies, women who walked briskly for 35 to 45 minutes ve days a week reported about half the number of sick days as their seden- tary peers. That said, while some exercise is good for ghting germs, very intensive, sustained aerobic exercise is not necessarily better. \"Studies have shown that when you do a marathon run, you become more susceptible to infections,\" Meydani says. Don't worry, be happy Y our immune system doesn't function as well when you are stressed out. Tests on some under-pressure volunteers\u2014 including medical and den- tal students and caregivers of Alzheimer's patients\u2014found they were more likely to develop colds, were less responsive to vaccines and were slower to heal from wounds than their less-harried counterparts. Why would this be? The nervous system and the immune system, scientists are nding, interconnect. For example, emotional stress causes the body to release cytokines, the same immune system messengers that initiate an infl ammation response against infec- tions. Researchers suspect that when the body churns out high lev- els of these cytokines over a long period of time, it tunes down the immune response.On the fl ip side, calming, meditative exercises, such as tai chi, have been shown to improve immune system activity. Stated posi- tively, \"There is a nice mind-body connection when it comes to immune response,\" Meydani says. \"That is why when college stu- dents are studying for nal exams, they need to have good nutrition rather than eat junk food.\" So much for pulling an all-nighter fueled by a pint of Ben & Jerry's. Getting a good night's sleep, by the way, also boosts active killer cells. Eat your fruits and vegetables You knew this one was coming. Most any colorful produce will help keep immunity thriving through their carotenoids, vitamins C, B6 and folate. News stories about immunity \"superfoods\" tend to rec- ommend gorging on speci c plants, such as garlic, bell peppers, gin- ger or pumpkin during the fl u season. All are healthful and delicious, but there is no need to play favorites. Variety will not only diversify your nutrient portfolio, it will make you more likely to eat the recom- mended ve to nine servings a day. Keep dietary fat down A 2003 Tufts study compared people who ate a typical western diet (38 percent fat) to those on a cholesterol-lowering diet (28 percent fat) and found the low-fat dieters had better T cell function. The kind of fat may matter, too. While you should de nitely limit saturated and trans fat, you might also want to keep an eye on your polyunsat- urated fats. A review by Meydani and Wu concluded that a diet very high in omega-3 fatty acids, including sh oil, can suppress immune function. \"It might be good for your heart, but it is not necessarily good for your immune system,\" Meydani says, emphasizing that she is talking about excessively high con- sumption. \"When you saturate your cells with a whole lot of unsaturated fatty acids, they are susceptible to oxidation.\" Don't go to extremes. If you cut your fat intake too much, you might miss out on vegetable oils and nuts, which are good sources of essential vitamin E. Lose those extra pounds If looking good in a swimsuit for your beach vacation isn't incentive enough, losing extra weight can also keep you healthy on the trip. \"We've done studies with people who are slightly overweight that show when you reduce their caloric intake, you improve their immune response,\" Meydani says. Losing even a few pounds can rev up T cell function. An ongoing caloric restriction study, conducted with Professor Susan Roberts, Ph.D., director of the HNRCA's Energy Metabolism Laboratory, is yielding similar results and revealing clues about why this might be. TN spring 2009 tufts nutrition 13\"When I see advertisements on TV calling something an immune booster, I cringe.\" \u2014simin n. 2009 1414144 t tttuftuftuftuft AMAs grim as the data look, as destined as we seem to pack on more pounds, some experts who follow America's battle with weight say it is more complicated than that. Food prices and dietary habits will play a role, but so will personal priorities. Some Americans will become savvy shop- pers, while others will look at their 401(k) statements and forget everything they knew about portion sizes. \"How people respond will depend a lot on who they are as individuals,\" says Professor Jeanne Goldberg, Ph.D., G59, N86, director of the Nutrition Communication Program at the Friedman School. \"A lot will depend on the importance people place on their personal health and the health of their families.\" If we look to history for clues as to what size jeans we will be wearing in 2011, our past recessions serve as imperfect prec- edents. The Great Depression may be the closest equivalent to the current economic crisis, but the nutritional landscape was very different then. \"There were no televisions; levels of restaurant consumption were vastly lower; processed food consumption was much lower; and levels of physical activity were higher, especially among lower-income people,\" says Parke Wilde, Ph.D., a food economist and an associate professor at the Friedman School. BY JULIE FLAHERTY PHOTOS BY VITO ALUIA Recessionthe What the slumping economy will mean for the American diet he language of a tough economy calls for \" trimming the fat \" and \"downsizing\" for \"lean times.\" If only our bodies went along with the metaphor. For nutrition researchers, the big recession question is not whether we will have to tighten our belts, but whether we'll be able to squeeze into our pants. This very serious concern stems from two facts. First, the United States is struggling with obesity in epidemic proportions. And second, Americans who have low incomes are more likely to be overweight or obese. Logic predicts that shrinking paychecks will only exacerbate the obesity problem. And as weight increases, so will diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. 511846_14_21 15 511846_14_21 15 5/8/09 5:37:29 PM 5/8/09 5:37:29 PMCREDIT_SMALL_FL A better comparison may be 1982, when joblessness reached a high of 10.8 percent. People didn't slow their food spending (it increased by 5 per-cent), and in fact, new-fangled \"health foods,\" including low-fat and low-sodium products, did quite well. But at the time, the percentage of obese adults was only 15 percent. It is now closer to 34 percent. \"Something has happened in the last 30 years that the whole middle of the distribution has shifted in weight upwards,\" Wilde says. \"And so you really need to look at things that are characteristic of the last 30 years.\" One thing we've discovered during that time is that hunger has a relation-ship to obesity. In 2006, Wilde and Friedman School doctoral student Jerusha Peterman, N11, published a study showing that women who have difficulty putting food on the table every day are 58 to 76 percent more likely than other women to be obese or gain weight over time. Other studies have drawn similar conclusions. One found that tod- dlers whose families have gone hungry are three to four times as likely to be obese. The reasons behind this nutritional para- dox are unclear, but it is no secret that junk foods lled with calories, re ned grains and sugars are a cheap and easy way to fill up. This has spurred Wilde to get to the bottom of a question that has plagued public health of cials and shoppers alike: Does it simply cost too much to eat a healthy diet? REAL COST OF FOOD To help answer this, Wilde and two gradu- ate students, Joseph Llobrera, N09, and Flannery Campbell, N08, created a software program called the Thrifty Food Plan calcu-lator. It is based on the data the USDA uses to determine food stamp bene ts. With the disclaimer that the application is geared toward food policy wonks (\"It's an analysis tool rather than a self-help tool,\" he says), Wilde feeds it some information about how much he eats from different types of food groups each month, and it spits out an aver-age daily food cost. He can ask it to follow either My Pyramid personalized eating plan recommendations or the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. But he can add other con-straints, such as how many servings of whole grain he's willing to consume, and how many calories he wants. The calculator also measures how closely the meal plan tracks the typical consumption patterns of low-income Americans. According to the calculator, eating nutri- tiously is not inherently expensive. But the closer one tries to adhere to the typical American diet, with significant amounts of meat and dairy, the more expensive it becomes. Wilde plugs some new variables into the calculator, and presto : If people are willing to get some of their protein from legumes rather than meat, and some of their calcium from vegetables rather than dairy, they can ful ll all their nutritional requirements on less than $5 a day. This mirrors Wilde's experience in his own neighborhood, where he and his family have hosted some com-munity meals in an experi-ment to see how they could spend less without feeling deprived. Some 40 peo-ple attended a dinner in February, where the menu was chicken curry, lentil dal and coconut black-eyed peas over large volumes of white and brown rice, with carrot sticks on the side and fruit salad for dessert. The cost was a mere $1.40 per person. Of course, just because people can cook nutritiously for a buck and half, doesn't mean they will. This leads some researchers to believe that in the United States, price is not necessarily the deciding factor when it comes to food purchases. Taste and convenience seem to be much more infl uential in people's food decisions. Take fruits and vegetables. In September 2008, Wilde gave a brief- ing for House of Representatives staff in Washington, D.C., on the topic of rising food prices, in which he noted that the prices of fruits and vegetables have risen at a higher rate compared to other food categories. And yet, according to the Economic Research Service of the USDA, having more money doesn't necessarily translate into shopping bags full of produce. Nearly all households\u2014not just low-income house-holds\u2014consume low amounts of fruits and vegetables relative to Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations. A household making $10,000 to $15,000 a year spends about $50 a month on fruits and vegetables; a household making ve times that spends only $57 a month, or $7 more, on produce. The poorest Americans, Wilde stresses, are very poor, and he worries that they will suffer during the recession. Yet compared to much of the rest of the world, \"food spend-ing is a small part of our budget,\" ranging from 37 percent of take-home pay for the poorest families to about 9 percent for those making $70,000 or more. He fears families will be more affected by other hard 16 tufts nutrition spring 2009 Whether or not it will change what we eat, the recession has already changed where we eat. 511846_14_21 16 511846_14_21 16 5/5/09 9:44:33 PM 5/5/09 9:44:33 PMCREDIT_SMALL_FL choices, like whether to give up a college education, than by their food decisions. \"We have a national entitlement program for food, which has an automatic recession response component. But there is no similar program for housing in the United States. And there is not really a transportation enti-tlement,\" he notes. LET'S EAT IN, HONEY Whether or not it will change what we eat, the recession has already changed where we eat. A survey conducted in February and March by the consulting rm AlixPartners found that 88 percent of respondents had cut back on eating out. As early as May of 2008, Information Resources Inc., a market researcher, reported that 53 percent of con-sumers said they were cooking from scratch more than they did just six months before. Dining in can be good. On average, the foods people eat while away from home are higher in calories, saturated fat and salt but lower in fiber and micronutrients like calcium than the foods they eat at home, according to the Economic Research Service. Note that this is what people choose to eat: To be sure, many restaurants offer healthful options in their menus, but those are not the foods people pick most often. \"You can splurge on your home cooking and still wind up nutritionally better than you do on prepared foods,\" Wilde says. \"Salt is a big one. Few people realize the problem with salt isn't about salt shakers, it's about processed and restaurant foods,\" which rarely list their sodium contents. How big an effect could cutting back on dining out have on our waistlines? A sub-stantial one, if you consider how much we eat out. Households with annual incomes of $10,000 to $15,000 spend one in four of their food dollars away from home. As income rises, so does the proportion of restaurant spending, with households that make more than $70,000 a year spending nearly half of their food dollars on non-homemade meals. All eyes have turned to the golden arches, the emblem of our super-sized eating hab-its. To be sure, McDonald's posted a better- than-expected third-quarter pro t last year, accompanied by a 7 percent jump in global sales. Wilde is not surprised. \"McDonald's has had essentially a good-quality, low-priced economic strategy for decades, and so they've built up a huge amount of consumer awareness on that strategy.\" McDonald's, it seems, will always survive, but \"restaurants as a whole are not going to do well\" in the recession, he says. \"The overall restaurant sector is going to have hard times.\" COOKING IN DECLINE Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver agrees that home cooking can be a good way to save money. \"If you have knowledge about how to cook, you will know how to buy ef ciently and cheaply,\" he recently told the parlia- mentary committee that oversees the U.K. Department of Health. There's a problem, though. \"This is the first time in British history that we have a large number of people who cannot cook,\" he said. As a result, he predicted, unhealthy eat- ing will probably increase in the recession. The cooking-skills de cit is not yet well studied, in part because we have little data on the kitchen abilities of yesteryear with which to compare. Yet there is no denying we have far fewer home economics classes, and lots more frozen, microwave-ready piz-zas, than we did 50 years ago. Jeanne Goldberg says a decline of cook- ing skills has unfortunate implications for American diets. \"Knowing how to cook in addition to knowing what to cook is really helpful in getting people to continue to eat healthfully,\" she says. Some studies have shown that people who are confident in their cooking skills cook more often than those who aren't. They also suggest that knowing how to cook infl uences food choices. Mothers who improve their cooking skills tend to use a wider variety of foods, and children become more adventurous in what they eat when they take part in cooking. While convenience foods have their place in the kitchen, Goldberg says, she could see as early as the 1970s that a simple thing like frozen orange juice concentrate was mud-dling people's understanding of food. \"I can vividly remember going to my children's preschool and showing the kids how to make fresh-squeezed orange juice,\" she says. \"They were totally amazed that orange juice indeed came from oranges.\" Cooking from scratch doesn't have to be a complicated or time-consuming activity, she says. \"It isn't really labor-intensive to cook dried spring 2009 tufts nutrition 17 511846_14_21 17 511846_14_21 17 5/5/09 9:44:37 PM 5/5/09 9:44:37 nutrition spring 2009beans,\" and there is a signi - cant difference in cost over prepared beans, she says. \"But people have to have handled a dried bean in their lives.\" \"There really is an opportunity to re- educate people about how to cook, and how to shop quickly and make it taste good,\" she says, picturing a show on the Food Network that focuses less on flash and more on the basics. But with job losses mounting and invest- ments tanking, will people even have the emotional and mental energy to cook? Or will we seek solace in chocolate and fried food? Some of the only U.S. companies to do consistently well during the Great Depression were the producers of tobacco, candy, and fats and oils. \"It's not just about comfort food,\" Wilde says. \"A lot of food choices are trade-offs between pleasure now and quality of life in our 70s, and you might make those decisions differently if you are basically hopeless about the future.\" There is some indication that people are thinking ahead, at least by a day or two. A survey by Information Resources Inc. found that 76 percent of people planned to make their purchase deci- sions at home or on the way to the store, rather than in the store. In other words, they are using shopping lists, the anti- dote to nutritionally toxic impulse buys. Some researchers have proposed that the value of time changes during a reces-sion, in some ways for the better. Because time is more lucrative during an up econ- omy, people work harder, suffer more stress and pay less attention to their health. This Lawmakers are debating the role government should have in running the banks it is bailing out. But should the government, some ask, also have some say in the diets it subsidizes? The notion has gotten more attention since the number of Americans on food stamps grew to a record 31.5 million in September 2008. The food stamp program, recently renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), helps many low-income people avoid hunger, but it does not dictate the kinds of foods people purchase. Public health advocates have long sought to align the food stamp program with healthy eating and were pleased when Tom Vilsack, the new agriculture secretary, said he would put \"nutrition at the center of all food-assistance programs.\" Yet Kumar Chandran, N07, a nutrition policy specialist with California Food Policy Advocates (CFPA), says the idea of restricting food stamp purchases to foods deemed healthy is \"controversial and complicated.\" \"People talk about it being too paternalistic, as in 'Who are you to say people shouldn't buy certain foods?' \" Chandran says. \"Aside from the moral standpoints, there is the logistical problem of who is to de ne what is good and what is bad.\" Should a high-fat avocado be forbidden? Does calorie-free soda get the thumbs up as nutritious? Last year, CFPA lobbied for a bill in California to create a pilot program that would take a middle ground. \"It would basically provide incentives for food stamp participants to purchase fruits and vegetables\" by giving consum- ers a produce rebate at the checkout, Chandran says. \"It's not prescribing anyone a diet, but it's a good way to get people to eat healthier.\" The program, which was signed into law but has not yet been funded, got the attention of federal lawmakers. In the 2008 Farm Bill, Congress allocated $20 million for projects that would give SNAP recipients point-of-purchase incentives \"to purchase fruits, vegetables or other healthful foods.\" The issues surrounding nutrition and food stamps are nothing new, but Chandran says that lawmakers are more attentive now that millions more have signed up for food assistance. \"It shines a light on a problem that existed before the downturn,\" he says. \"It draws attention when there is a new face to it.\" Food stamps may already affect nutrition in one way. According to a recent study by Professor Parke Wilde, Ph.D., Lisa Troy, Ph.D., N00, N07, and Professor Beatrice Rogers, Ph.D., published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics , participants in SNAP buy more groceries and eat out less often than non-participants with the same income level. \"One explanation may be that SNAP participants acknowl- edge the program's purpose and feel obligated to increase their food spending substantially, even if their bene t level is small,\" Wilde says. \"Even beyond their program bene ts, these participants tend to spend their own income on store-bought food.\"A NEW ROLE FOR FOOD STAMPS 5:39:31 PM 5/8/09 tufts nutrition 19translates to diet. Who hasn't planned on cooking grilled chicken for dinner, but opted to pick up a hamburger on the way home when they were hungry and running late? Lisa Mancino and Jean Kinsey, of the Economic Research Service, write that \"because of time constraints and the desire for convenience\u2014situational factors\u2014[consumers] sacri ce good intentions for immediate grati cation.\" PASS THE GENERIC-O'S The U.S. obesity rate, which had been rising for a quarter-century, recently appeared to hit a plateau. As Professor James Tillotson, Ph.D., puts it, even if things go horribly wrong, \"How could we eat any more than we do right now?\" Tillotson, who studies the infl uence of social, technological, economic and political factors on food policy, has been watching where shoppers are spending their food dollars. It's true that Wal-Mart has reported stronger than usual sales of peanut butter and spaghetti since the recession began, but \"I don't think people will change much exactly what they are eating,\" Tillotson says. \"The diet is pretty entrenched.\" Restaurants may be suffering, particu- larly white-tablecloth and casual-dining establishments, but supermarkets are doing well, especially Wal-Mart. \"The supermar-kets might come out of this smelling like a rose,\" he says, as they will pick up business from consumers eating out less. In par-ticular, he expects consumers will turn to more store-brand, private-label products, leaving more expensive national brands on the shelves. Over the last year, for example, sales of brand-name cookies and crackers have fallen. \"The problem is, brands are trying to hold onto their profit margins, which are high by historic levels,\" he says, adding that he is stunned that people are expected to pay $4 or more for a box of cereal. But, he says, consumers are catching on that store brands, which cost an average of 30 percent less than national brands, have improved in quality and are often made by the same companies selling national brands. Tillotson points to England, where 60 to 70 percent of the top-selling grocery store products wear major supermarket labels. \"The American chains will be pushing this new opportu-nity,\" he says. Wal-Mart, for example, will have more than 800 of its own store-brand products on the shelves within the next few months. Wilde agrees that consumers' rst cost- cutting measures won't necessarily affect the nutritional value of their diet. \"People are going to buy less food that's marketed as health food,\" he says, drawing a distinction between value-added foods that broadcast their \"right-carb pro le\" and those that are quietly nutritious. \"So you'll get cereals marketed as health food that are more expensive than oatmeal you cook in your kitchen. I don't even know if they are healthier.\" As for organic products, super- markets' private-label organics will gain pop-ularity over manufacturer brands, according to the research rm Organic Monitor. \"The recession is going to shift demand away from organic, but that doesn't neces- sarily mean that much less organic is going to be produced and consumed,\" Wilde pre-dicts. Until recently, demand for organic ingredients was outpacing the supply, which drove prices up. Supply should come more in line with demand, which should bring prices down, Wilde explains. \"It can certainly be good for organic con- sumers,\" Wilde says. The change in supply and demand may also protect the local foods movement and community-supported agriculture (CSA) farms. Jennifer Hashley, director of the New Entry Sustainable Farming Project (nesfp.nutrition.tufts.edu), said it is too early to know the effect the recession will have on sales of its farm shares, but so far, signups for the program, World PEAS CSA, are on par with last year. \"A lot of the CSAs I know have huge waiting lists from prior years,\" she says. \"If returning customers drop out, there are probably enough people on their waiting lists to ll the gaps.\" Aside from the benefits to the environ- ment, buying a farm share, which costs $550 a season, is still a good deal economically, she says. \"Most farmers say their customers are getting 25 percent more in the box than the customer is actually paying for,\" Hashley says. \"It's a risk-sharing agreement; if it's a banner weather year, you may get 10 times the value of tomatoes.\" She points out that because the produce is often picked fresh that morning or the day before, it has a much longer shelf life, which can mean less goes to waste. She thinks the recession has increased the attendance in the project's farm business planning class, which recently graduated 30 students. \"Some of the folks in the class are currently unemployed and looking to do something until they can nd another job,\" she says. In New England, the decline in manu- facturing jobs may help local farmers who typically struggle with finding people to work on their farms. \"I'm predicting that this year, people who may never have oth-erwise looked at farm employment as an alternative may do so,\" she says. \"It isn't really labor-intensive to cook dried beans. But people have to have handled a dried bean in their lives.\" \u2014jeanne goldberg nutrition spring 2009BETWEEN A TWINKIE AND A HARD PLACE Wilde says he is painfully aware that the economy will bring serious hardship to many people. At the same time, he can't help but think that many Americans could stand to spend and waste less. \"I'm worried about the future and about depression, but I think we should have perspective about what our spending level is now,\" he says. \"I tend to not be satis ed with the food system that our prosperity has brought us. And it just focuses my attention on those things where more money hasn't brought us more health. \"I'm wrestling with this because I'm acutely aware of how this seems unsympa- thetic to people who are facing hard times. Nobody would recommend recession and depression as a good way of learning about good environmental resource use.\" Goldberg says she is the last to criticize those families who will turn to inexpen- sive processed foods to get them through tough times. \"Kids like them; they ll them up; you can go to Costco and buy them in giant quantities at cheap prices,\" she says. \"So there is a pull and tug between trying to preserve sound nutrition and at the same time meet the needs of the family. It's tough. I wouldn't for a moment say that having less money for the general population is going to improve the quality of their diets.\" She adds: \"To state it positively, I think it's a challenge that people will meet in different ways, by saying everything from 'I give up' to 'I'm going to use this as an opportunity to pull back and stock my shelves with what we really need to have.' \" TN Julie Flaherty, the editor of this magazine, can be reached at julie.fl aherty@tufts.edu.TAKE-OUT VS.

You'll nd plenty of healthy staples like brown rice, whole-wheat pasta and a variety of beans. Plan \"Meatless Mondays\" of vegetarian chili or rice and beans. According to the USDA, the average cost of a serving of fruits or vegetables is 25 cents. Compare that to a single-serving bag of potato chips, which rings in at 69 cents, or an 80-cent candy bar. Make your own snack mixes and \"100-calorie packs.\" Create trail mix using whole-grain cereal, nuts and dried fruit. Portion out crackers, popcorn and pretzels into small snack bags.

Wash and cut produce yourself\u2014it's cheaper than the pre-prepped stuff. Instead of pre-seasoned pasta or rice mixes, buy whole-wheat pasta and brown rice in bulk and add your own fl avorings. Buy fruits and veggies in season. Get extra to wash and freeze for future use. Also, stock up on frozen veggies and fruit, which are as nutritious as fresh. Don't fear the canned goods. The taste of canned veggies has improved dramatically over the years. Buy low-sodium varieties and give them a rinse before using to reduce sodium content by as much as 40 percent. Also, canned tuna and salmon are inexpensive sources of protein and great sources of heart- healthy omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA).

Snyder President's Lecture Series. \"We hunger for advice to know how to perform this human activity.\" The author of In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto and The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals said that instead of enjoying food, we focus on individual nutrients that are often dubbed good or evil, sending us scurrying off in pursuit of one and avoidance of the other. He described what he called \"the American para- dox,\" namely that we are obsessed with nutrition, yet we have the worst health in the world, with high rates of heart disease and diabetes. \"We have created the one diet that reli- ably makes us sick,\" he said. \"What an achievement for a civilization.\" He blamed what he calls \"nutrition- ism\" for this problem. While it's impor- tant to understand more about the chemistry of food, he said, the public doesn't necessarily need to know about every scienti c nding. He issued this comparison: \"Nutritional science is fascinating,\" he said, \"but sort of where surgery was in 1650. It's interesting and promising, but are you ready to get on the table?\" Underlying nutritionism is the premise that because nutrients are invisible, only experts can explain the hid- den reality of food to us. \"It's a little like religion,\" Pollan said. \"You need a priesthood, because since you can't have your own relationship with this divinity, you need some intermediary. And that is the priesthood of nutri- tionists and journalists and food experts of all kinds.\" Another nutritionism tenet is that the primary func- tion of eating is to advance our health. Instead, he added, it's important to remember there are other reasons peo- ple eat: for pleasure, a sense of community, a sense of identity and as ritual. Nutritionism divides the world into good and evil, leaving us to navigate between them, Pollan said. \"There is always some satanic nutrient we are trying to drive from the food supply, such as trans fat or sodium. At the same time, there is always a blessed nutrient that if we ate enough of, we would live forever, such as omega-3 fatty acids or ber.\" Food manufacturers jump on the bandwagon of the so-called good nutrients, fortifying food with these substances whether they belong there or not, he said, so that omega-3 fatty acids, which occur naturally in some nuts and sh, can now be found in some yogurts. He predicted that the next \"evil\" nutrient will be omega-6 fatty acids and that consumers would soon see packag- ing labeled \"omega-6 free.\" Nutritionism is an old idea, he said, noting that at the turn of the last century, protein was considered evil and carbohydrates good, leading to the invention of breakfast cereals. Pollan said the low-fat campaign of the 1980s was the \"crowning achieve- ment\" of nutritionism and coincided with Americans getting fatter. People avoided fat, but binged on carbohydrates. The thinking was, \"as long as you avoid the evil nutrient, you can eat whatever you want,\" he said. Nutritionism is a fantastic way to sell food, Pollan continued. \"It favors pro- cessed foods, because you can change the formation,\" he said. \"Right now, for example, foods are bragging they are full of sugar instead of high-fruc- tose corn syrup.\" Culture has taught people how to eat for eons, argued Pollan, who is collecting cultural rules about food. \"It turns out what is best for health is also best for agriculture and the environment, namely real food that people can cook and eat,\" Pollan said. \"Our personal health is not a matter of good chemicals and bad chemi- cals but is linked to the entire food chain. Taking back control of food is the best thing we can do for our health and for our families.\" TN Marjorie Howard is a senior writer in Tufts' Of ce of Publications.

Instinct BY JULIE FLAHERTY ILLUSTRATION BY TANYA FEDANDieting BY 511846_p22 2009 tufts nutrition 23She has come up with what she calls our ve food instincts, which researchers agree on and which are borne out by cross-cultur- al comparisons. \"When people get hungry, they want to eat. If there's food there, you eat it. If it's got calories, you like it more. If there is more variety, you eat more,\" she says. \"We keep ourselves safe by eating what we know under circumstances we know.\" Roberts' approach is not to ght those instincts, but to use strategies to deal with them. She's gleaned these approaches from the scienti c literature and from 17 years of studying people's metabolisms, crav- ings, food preferences and responses to different diets as director of the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts. \"People tend to feel bad about lacking willpower, rather than accepting that natu-ral biology is important when it comes to what we like to eat,\" Roberts says. THE SPICE OF LIFE Take the urge for variety, which is supposed to ensure we take in a spectrum of nutri-ents. \"Variety is an enormously underesti-mated component\" of weight gain, she says. In one research study, for example, people who were offered three different shapes of pasta ate 14 percent more than those who were served only one shape. But variety can also work to a dieter's advantage. Her lab has shown that people who choose a greater range of vegetables end up doubling or tripling their vegetable consumption and reducing their calorie in-take. The lesson? Limit yourself to one kind of cookie when you shop, but bring home a half-dozen different vegetables. The desire for calorie-dense foods seems like a given. Who doesn't love a rich dessert? But Roberts says it is not just your taste buds that enjoy that chocolate cake. When those calories get in your bloodstream, your brain releases addictive, feel-good chemicals like dopamine. After a while, your brain learns to \"associate the rush of calories coming into the body with the tastes,\" says Roberts, who is also an adjunct professor of psychia-try at Tufts Medical School. So every time you see a chocolate cake, you desire it. She has seen it in her own lab, where people served two recipes with un- familiar fl avors eat them in equal amounts on the rst day. Nine days later, the fl avors they say they like are the ones associated with the calorie-dense recipe. Roberts' trick is to recalibrate the taste centers in our brains. \"Our enjoyment of calories is relative, \" she says. \"W e like what's at the top end of our calorie scale. If you eat brownies with premium ice cream, and that's the top end of your scale, low-fat salad is pretty unenticing. But if you add some oil to your salad and you serve a low-er-calorie brownie with frozen yogurt, the calorie contents are more similar, so you can like the salad even though you still like the brownie.\" MIDDLE GROUND Then there is hunger. Roberts says that stud- ies point to four ways to keep satiated on fewer calories: eating foods high in volume, high in ber, high in protein or low on the glycemic index, which means they produce only small fl uctuations in blood glucose. But where other diet doctors may tout only one path to your ideal weight, Roberts suggests picking and choosing. A high- ber breakfast of whole-grain cereal, milk and fruit is easy to prepare at home, but it's hard to find high-fiber choices at restaurants, where it's simple to order a high-protein meal of steak and veggies. \"One way doesn't work for everybody,\" she says. \"You can tell people to eat high-protein diets, but they'll get bored. You can tell them to eat low-glycemic-index diets, and they will nd they haven't got the pa- tience to cook wheat berries. You can tell them to eat high volume, and they'll be craving cheesecake. We have to give people options here.\" To that end, The Instinct Diet is filled with recipes, vegetarian options, quick- x emergency meals, a supermarket navigator and a restaurant survival guide. Roberts points out that the feeling of hunger, which is controlled by the hypo-thalamus, and the feeling of reward, which is associated with the ventral striatum, both originate in the evolutionarily primitive center of the brain, where automatic func-tions like body temperature are controlled. That means you can decide with your pre-frontal cortex whether to go into Dunkin' Donuts for coffee, but once inside, the sight and smell of the donuts can activate re-sponses in your unconscious brain. This plays into the instincts of availabil- ity (if the food is right in front of you, you want it) and familiarity (if a cruller with your coffee is a morning tradition, it will be harder to give up). \"Willpower often doesn't work because it happens in the wrong part of the brain,\" says Roberts. \"What we have to do is lead our lives in ways that take willpower out of the equation.\" TN Where other diet doctors may tout only one path to your ideal weight, Roberts suggests picking and choosing.o weight-loss gurus ever agree on anything? the Atkins diet considers steak a slimming food, while the Ornish diet banishes meat. The Skinny Bitch diet dis-parages arti cial sweeteners, while the South Beach diet allows them. Everyone seems to have his own take on taking off the pounds. So a few years ago, Professor Susan B. Roberts, Ph.D., set out to see where the research concurs with the popular diet prescriptions. Her new book, The Instinct Diet (Workman), gets to the heart of what scientists really know about weight loss and puts a new spin on the idea of gut feelings.Don campus FRIEDMAN SCHOOL NEWS 24 tufts nutrition spring 2009Kathleen merrigan, ph.d., an assistant professor at the Friedman School and director of its Agriculture, Food and Environment Program, became deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture on April 7. She was sworn in during a reception at the Jaharis Center on Tufts' Boston campus. The deputy secretary of agriculture, the second-highest post at the depart- ment, oversees day-to-day operations of the USDA, including the development of a $95 billion budget for 26 agencies representing 300 programs and more than 100,000 employees. President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrigan for the post delighted many organic agriculture proponents. Before coming to Tufts in 2001, Merrigan spent two years as head of the Agricultural Marketing Service where she de- veloped the USDA 's organic labeling rules. As a Senate aide, she worked on the Federal Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 that de ned organic farming and organic food. Ferd Hoefner of the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition told Reuters that \"sustainable and organic farmers are excited . . . that someone who has been New deputy secretary pledges to represent all types of farmingNumber 2 at the USDA associated with these issues her whole career is going to be at that level in the department.\" A New York Times article cited Merrigan's appointment as one of several signs that the federal government may be seeking to en- courage a more nutritious and sustainable food supply. At Merrigan's nomination hearing be- fore a Senate committee on April 1, Senator Saxby Chambliss, a Georgia Republican, expressed concern over some of the articles Merrigan has written championing organic agriculture. \"In promoting your passion for organic production and sustainable agriculture, you tear down other types of agriculture with different points of view,\" he said.

The issue might not grab headlines like the economy, health care, terrorism or educa- tion, \"but food and agriculture af- fect all of these other issues very directly,\" he said. Glickman, who was U.S. sec- retary of agriculture from 1995 to 2001, gave the keynote address at the third annual Friedman School Symposium, a meeting for national and international experts to dis- cuss subjects affecting nutrition policy and the food industry. \"The issues of food security, food scarcity, nutrition, global eco- nomic development and food safety are going to be paramount to our national security focus for the next decade,\" he said. \"The world of food economics is changing rapidly,\" Glickman said, noting that the recent spike in food prices is a mere harbinger of things to come. Given climate change, chang- ing patterns of land use, energy costs and increasing standards of living for millions of people in India and China, the U.S. should plan for \"slight food scarcity for the rest of the 21st century,\" he said. \"We have to move away from almost a century of food policy predicated on perpetual surplus.\" America's surplus grain supply is no longer enough to feed the world's hungry, Glickman said, arguing that the United States should engineer a policy shift from sending food aid to fostering development assistance in the form of new farming technologies. The Green Revolution, led by U.S. researchers, allowed poor farmers to wring more food out of each acre of land. But since the end of the Cold War, budget cuts have devastated agricultural development research and aid, said Glickman, who was a U.S. congressman from Kansas for 18 years prior to his appointment as secretary of agriculture. \"The political stability of the developing world relates to food security,\" said Glickman. \"We have to invest as a nation in these priorities.\" Glickman also argued that the Department of Agriculture needs revamping. The place to begin, he said, is by attracting the talented staff, not just people with farm commodi- ties backgrounds. \"We are now seeing the need to attract high-quality people back into government,\" he said. \"Issues of food and agriculture will have as much of an impact on the future of the world as anything else our government will be doing.\" Restoring America's leadership in these areas, he said, will require \"more science and better science. Your job is to get that information out,\" he told more than 300 nutrition scientists and professionals from the United States and Europe who attended the Friedman Symposium. Experts from Tufts, UC Berkeley, the National Institutes of Health, Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT weighed in on topics such as food scarcity and economics, labeling practices and vita- min supplementation during the three-day event last fall. The next Friedman School Symposium will be September 11-12. Visit www.friedmansym- posium.com.Keep the policy focus on world food security, says a former secretary of agriculture by Jacqueline Mitchell Dan GlickmanMerrigan replied, \"I've always been a provocateur; that's part of my personality.\" But she emphasized that as deputy secretary she would represent all kinds of farming. \"Organic is a small slice of the pie,\" she acknowledged, in that it represents only 2 or 3 percent of overall American agriculture. She called it an exciting enterprise that has attracted young, new farmers to a eld that is losing many workers to retirement. \"But there is also the important disappearing middle\u2014those farmers out there who are not making it, and I want to help and nd ways to encourage them, and some of that is going to be through important conserva- tion programs.\" She added, \"Twenty percent of produc- ers are providing 80 percent of the food; I understand that reality.\" Merrigan told the Senate committee that as manager of the $1.2 billion Agricultural Marketing Service she helped with milk marketing orders, check-off programs and the procurement of commodities for do- mestic food programs, including National School Lunch. Senator T om Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry, expressed con dence in Merrigan's ability to deliver. \"She has a strong and diverse background working on many issues in food and agricul- ture, and [working] to improve opportuni- ties for people in agriculture and in rural communities,\" he said. American agriculture, Merrigan told the committee, must remain competitive. \"T o this end, creative and supportive marketing programs and science-based regulations are essential,\" she said. \"Investments in science and research must be made, but these in- vestments will yield greater results if they are targeted, monitored and evaluated. I also believe that a strong farm safety net must be maintained to uphold and honor those men and women who persevere, de- spite the odds, and work hard every day to deliver wholesome safe food to people around the world.\"W PHOTOS: COURTESY MONIQUE STERNINON CAMPUS 26 tufts nutrition spring 2009eter von mertens thought he knew everything there was to know about hiking. Until, that is, he went to Nepal with the Peace Corps in 1966 and met Jerry Sternin. Rather than trudging, Sternin told him, \"lift up your head, observe everything around, nd some interesting people, engage them in conversation, sprinkle lavishly with humor and enthusiasm and eat whenever possible.\" Von Mertens described the tech- nique at a recent memorial celebration of Sternin's life, saying \"Jerry could make those steep hills disappear.\" Opening minds to new ways of doing things was a lifelong pursuit for Sternin, a development practitioner, teacher and men- tor who died in December 2008 at the age of 70. He was perhaps best known at the Friedman School for creating the Positive Deviance Initiative with his wife and col- laborator, Monique, and for the related course they taught. He also leaves a son, Sam, who works for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Sternin was born in Brooklyn and earned a master's degree in Asian studies from Harvard University, where he also served as an assistant dean and adviser to students in the business school. He dedicated eight years to the Peace Corps, as a volunteer in the Philippines, an associate director in Nepal and as a direc- tor in Rwanda and Mauritania. One of the volunteers he worked with in Mauritania was Randa Wilkinson, N85. At one point, Sternin, realizing her morale was low, drove two days from the capital to the remote vil- lage where she was stationed, surprising her with a cooler of fois gras, baguette, cheese, chocolate and a pitcher of frozen cocktails. \"As we sipped our rst daiquiri, he mod- estly, in his no-big-deal Jerry way, admitted leaving Nouakchott at 3 a.m. and driving straight through so that this feast would be served at the right temperature,\" she re- called. \"He came out and listened, saw my world. And he didn't judge, offered no ad- vice ... he nurtured my soul with acceptance and af rmation.\" He worked for 16 years with Save the Children, in Bangladesh, Egypt, the Philippines, Myanmar and Vietnam. But his experience with large non-gov- ernmental organizations with large staffs made him realize that many times, NGOs create dependency, Monique Sternin said. \"Unless you interact with the population, you can actual- ly create more needs that make them less independent,\" his wife said. \"He really saw that as a handicap to development.\" In the 1990s, the Sternins read about a new approach to community development in a book by Marian Zeitlin, a for- mer nutrition professor at Tufts and now a visiting professor at Friends remember the wisdom and humor of a teacher and mentorJerry Sternin's Positive Legacy Jerry Sternin spent nearly half his life working outside the United States, in places such as Vietnam.P PHOTO: MELODY KO spring 2009 tufts nutrition 27imin Nikbin Meydani, D.V.M., Ph.D., has been named director of the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts. She had served as associate director of the HNRCA for the last four years. \"I look forward to working with Dr. Meydani in this expanded leader- ship role,\" said Jamshed Bharucha, provost and senior vice president. \"She is a model colleague, maintaining an impressive research program while excelling as an academic leader.\" Meydani came to Tufts in 1984, and began researching the effects of nutrients on aging, the immune system response and infection at the HNRCA and teaching at the Friedman School. As a senior scientist and director of the Nutritional Immunology Laboratory at the HNRCA, Meydani has received numerous grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Institutes of Health. She has repeatedly been recognized by her peers, serving as president of the American Aging Association from 2005 to 2006 and receiving distinction awards from the American Society of Nutrition, the American College of Nutrition and the American Aging Association, as well as international organizations. \"Over the last 30 years, research conducted by USDA HNRCA scientists has helped shape nutrition policy in the United States and abroad,\" Meydani said. \"I am very excited to have the opportunity to work closely with my colleagues to ensure continuation of high-quality research with signi cant impact for the health of older Americans and those around the world.\" Meydani will continue to serve as a professor at the Friedman School and the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts.

It called for finding small, successful, but \"deviant\" practices that are already working in a community and amplifying them. The Sternins thought their assignment in Vietnam with Save the Children would be a good venue to put Positive Deviance into practice. But the Vietnamese government was a little sus- pect of the Sternins' plans, recalled Mike Y eldham, who was then working in Hanoi. \"Y ou were not bringing food; you were not bringing money, and yet you were sup- posed to be helping malnourished children,\" he said. \"At the end of six years, the result was a nationwide project, ever expanding, a great success and an award from the govern- ment of Vietnam.\" Their Positive Deviance model for ad- dressing child malnutrition has been rep- licated in 41 countries. They have champi- oned its use for tackling the most complex issues, such as HIV/AIDS, female genital cutting and girl trafficking. In the United States, they have shown how the methods can be applied to everything from business practices to health care. Jon Lloyd asked Jerry Sternin to intro- duce Positive Deviance at a workshop for hospital employees in Pittsburgh, where he got a glimpse of Sternin's sense of humor. \"During the workshop, Jerry referenced his work with a community of transvestite commercial sex workers in Indonesia trying to avoid the problem of sexually transmitted diseases,\" Lloyd said. \"He con ded that he had thought that they were the most exotic people he had ever worked with, until that day when he began working with health- care people.\" His friend Mickey Levitan said it was well known that Sternin \"knew every word to ev- ery song of every musical ever written.\" He even wrote a musical of his own, called River Swift , which is set in China. For all the efforts Jerry Sternin made to ght malnutrition, he knew that food was about more than sustenance. A talented cook, he founded Chautara, a four-star res- taurant in Pembroke, Mass. Through it all, he was fun, said his friend Lois Raimondo. \"I always told Jerry I wanted to learn how to cook,\" she said. \"But I really didn't want to learn how to cook; I just want- ed to hang out with Jerry and eat his food.\"SHNRCA Director Simin Nikbin Meydani (right) with Professor Emeritus Robert Russell (left), who stepped down as director in July 2008, and his predecessor, University Professor Irwin RosenbergTHE WIDER WORLD OF TUFTS UNIVERSITY NEWS PHOTO: JOANIE TOBIN 28 tufts nutrition spring 2009Carbs, proteins and fats affect the brain in different ways by Helene Ragovin f you ' re reading this story after you ' ve made a mid-afternoon trip to the vending machine for a candy bar, or grabbed a cheese stick from the fridge for your morning snack, you may be feeling happily sated. But what you ate may affect how well you remember this article after you put the magazine down. Researchers in the psychology department at Tufts' School of Arts and Sciences have been investigating the connections between nutrition and cog- nition for several years. Their ndings show that carbohydrates, proteins and fats can affect mental functioning in different ways, depending on how and when they are eaten. But, the researchers say, there's no need for most Americans to dramatically ne-tune their nutrient intake in the quest for mental prowess. \"It's important not to obsess about what you're eating,\" says Kristen D'Anci, Ph.D., G96, a research associate who works with professors Robin Kanarek, Ph.D., and Holly Taylor, Ph.D. \"What we're seeing are subtle changes in cogni- tion. It's not the kind of thing that's going to prevent someone from winning a Nobel Prize.\" \"It's also not what you eat at each meal; it's what you eat over the course of a day, a week or a year that contributes to brain structure and brain health,\" D'Anci emphasizes. They have examined, among other things, the effects of different breakfasts on the cognitive performance of 9- to 11-year- old children; the effects of sweet snacks on learning and attention in young boys and college students; and the effects of low-car- bohydrate weight-loss regimes on the cogni- tive behavior of dieters. \"The underlying idea behind the research is that the brain is fueled by glucose,\" Taylor says. During digestion, carbohydrate is bro- ken down into glucose, which enters the bloodstream to be used by the brain. \"We're looking at what people consume, and how the brain's uptake of glucose affects cogni- tion,\" she says. In the breakfast study, published in 2005 in Psychology & Behavior and funded by Quaker Oats, elementary school chil- dren were fed either instant oatmeal, cold cereal or no breakfast at all. While similar in calories, the two breakfasts had differ- ent amounts of carbohydrate, protein, fat and fiber, which contribute to their gly- cemic scores. Oatmeal had a lower glyce- mic score than the cold cereal used in the study, which means that its carbohydrates are digested and absorbed into the blood- stream more slowly. As expected, the children who ate break- fast performed significantly better on a series of cognitive tests than those who had no breakfast at all. But among the break- fast-eaters, the children who ate oatmeal performed better on spatial and short-term memory tests administered an hour later. Taylor, Kanarek and their co-authors theo- rized that \"due to compositional differ- ences in protein and ber content, glycemic scores and rate of digestion, oatmeal may provide a slower and more sustained energy source, and consequently result in cognitive enhancement compared to low- ber, high- glycemic, ready-to-eat cereal.\" In two separate studies looking at the effect of snacks on learning, memory and attention, Kanarek, Taylor and their col- leagues offered test subjects either sugar- sweetened candy or low-calorie artifi- cially sweetened snacks at different times of the day. In the first study, published in Food Smart IKristen D'Anci, Robin Kanarek and Holly TaylorPsychology and Behavior in 2001, school-age boys received the snacks after an overnight fast and were then tested on a variety of tasks involving memory and attention. The children who ate the sugary snack were better able to stay on task for an extended period of time. In the second study, published in the same journal six years later, boys and college undergraduates were given their snacks in the afternoon; the high-sugar snack generally improved per- formance on tasks involving memory, but had a mixed effect on attention. Funding for both studies came in part from the Mars candy company. The researchers hypothesize that the different results may be a consequence of whether the snack is consumed after an overnight fast or shortly after a meal. Their most recent work\u2014published in March in the journal Appetite \u2014touched on America's obsession with weight loss, and garnered attention for its conclusion that strict low-carbohydrate diets led to some degree of memory impairment and self-reported confusion. For three weeks, two groups of women followed two different weight-loss plans, either a diet that prohibited or strictly lim- ited carbohydrates, or a balanced, reduced- calorie diet recommended by the American Dietetic Association. After the rst week of the low-carb diet, during which the women ate no carbohydrates whatsoever, they per- formed significantly worse on memory- related tasks. \"What we saw was very clear and speci c on memory performance,\" D'Anci says. \"When we restricted the carbohydrates, the women were less able to remember loca- tions on a map, which is a visual and spatial task, either immediately or a week later.\" The low-carb dieters' short-term memory was also impaired, D'Anci said. However, \"as soon as we re-introduced even a small amount of carbohydrate, their memory functioning returned to the original level,\" Taylor said. The carbs they added were in the form of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In addition, the low-carb group was able to pay closer attention during a long-term repetitive task. It' s not entirely surprising that the no-carbohydrate diet had a different effect on memory than it did on attention. \"From brain-imaging studies, we know that the pro- cessing of memory and attention take place in different parts of the brain,\" Taylor says. The long-term impact of the work, Kanarek says, lies not in providing diet tips to college students seeking a leg up on their exams, or to ambitious executives trying to score the best deal at the negotiating table. \"I think in this country, most people have enough to eat\u2014while a given snack or lunch may have a small effect on behavior, it's not a major effect,\" Kanarek says. But the research could apply to children and others in developing nations where food scarcity is an issue, or to nutritionally vul- nerable groups in developed nations, such as the elderly, dieters or those with eating disorders. spring 2009 tufts nutrition 29THE ROAD TO KOREA letcher school dean stephen bosworth has been named to the newly created position of special representative for North Korea policy by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. As the new special envoy, Bosworth is charged with addressing \"the full range of concerns with respect to North Korea, including its nuclear ambitions and its proliferation of sensitive weapons technology, as well as its human rights and humanitarian problems,\" Clinton said when she intro- duced him to the press corps in Washington, D.C., on February 26. Bosworth, who will report to President Barack Obama and Clinton, says that formal goals haven't been set yet, but that he hopes to \"re-establish dia- logue with the North Koreans to ensure that all the countries of the region are operating from a base of common understanding and consensus.\" He adds that \"it's particularly important for the U.S. that we maintain close F Continued on page 30 Dean Stephen Bosworth named special representative for North Korea by Taylor McNeil Stephen Bosworth is introduced by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Bosworth, who was U.S. ambassador to the Republic of Korea from 1997 to 2000, will remain dean of the Fletcher School. \"My commitment is for about a fourth to a third of my time with this new position,\" he says, noting that he will be in Washington for about a week every month, and will travel to Asia every six weeks or two months. \"It's going to be a good deal of work, because I'll continue doing what I'm doing here at the Fletcher School\u2014we've got a lot going on,\" says Bosworth, who has been dean since February 2001. \"I've always considered that public service is a privi- lege, and I'm thankful for the president and secretary giving me the opportunity to do it again,\" he says. Bosworth joins two other special representatives newly appointed by Clinton, George Mitchell for the Middle East and Richard Holbrook for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Holbrook received an honorary degree from Tufts at commencement ceremonies in 1997. His appointment came quickly, Bosworth says. When he returned on February 8 from a private trip to Pyongyang with a group of academics and former gov- ernment of cials for meetings at the foreign ministry, there was a message from Clinton. Less than three weeks later, he was in Washington, meeting with Obama and Clinton, his appointment having been nalized. Before he could accept the position, though, he spoke with President Lawrence S. Bacow and others at the university. \"They've been very supportive and agreed I could do this,\" Bosworth says. \"We are proud that Secretary Clinton has tapped Dean Bosworth for this delicate and important assign- ment,\" says Bacow. \"His selection speaks volumes about the respect he commands on the world stage generally and in Korea speci cally. I have promised Steve that we will do whatever we can to support his mission.\" Bosworth says he might be calling on others at the Fletcher School to provide expertise, such as those in the Program in International Negotiation and Confl ict Resolution. \"Those people have not been dealing directly with North Korea, but there are certain basic principles that I think are useful,\" he says. He also thinks that students might bene t from his work. \"I would hope to use this, depending on time availability, as an opportunity to give Fletcher stu- dents some insight into the process\u2014how these things work,\" Bosworth says. \"Obviously, I can't go into the substance, but I don't see any reason why I can't talk to [students] about how the U.S. government approaches a problem like this.\" THE KOREAN CONNECTION A career diplomat, Bosworth was ambassador to Tunisia from 1979 to 1981 and to the Philippines from 1984 to 1987. After holding a number of State Department posts, he was named executive director of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization in 1995. \"This was the international organization that was set up under the U.S.-North Korean-agreed framework in 1994,\" Bosworth says, \"and we were implementing that agreement, includ- ing beginning to construct two 1,000-mega- watt light water nuclear reactors in North Korea, which was the quid for the quo of their halting and eventually dismantling their nuclear weapons program.\" The 1994 agreement fell apart in 2002, \"and the North Koreans again started pro- ducing plutonium, and now have produced a good deal of that,\" Bosworth points out. As part of his portfolio, Bosworth will be involved in the so-called Six-Party Talks, between North Korea, South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia, though the day-to-day negotiator for the United States will be Ambassador Sung Kim. \"I'm hopeful that the talks will resume,\" he says. \"The extent of their frui- tion will depend on the policies and events. [The talks] have produced some results already, and it's a question of building on those.\" One of the key players in the region is China. Asked how much infl uence the Chinese government has on the rulers in Pyongyang, Bosworth says it's likely \"they probably have a little more than they admit to, and somewhat less than we think.\" The trip he took to North Korea in early February seems to have been rather prescient, and maybe those connections he made will be helpful. \"One would think that perhaps the fact that I'm not totally unfamiliar to them will help,\" he says, \"but I think you have to be very cautious about estimating the value of this kind of rela- tionship in North Korea. It's a very tightly controlled and highly calculated government with the same sort of view toward its policies.\"Continued from page 29 \"He will work closely with our allies and partners to convince North Korea to become a constructive part of the international community.\"UNIVERSITY NEWS \u2014hillary clinton on stephen bosworthBEYOND BOUNDARIES PROVIDING THE MEANS FOR EXCELLENCE spring 2009 tufts nutrition 31 PHOTOS: PATRICK O'CONNOR (TOP), ALONSO NICHOLS (BOTTOM)As the former director of admissions at the Friedman School, Elizabeth Cochary Gross, N82, N88, now a Friedman School overseer, understands the plight of an accepted student who is forced to defer admission for one or more years because of insuf cient funds. She knows that these students may never end up coming to the Friedman School. She has come up with a creative way to help. She and her hus- band, Phillip, have given $200,000 to establish the Friedman School Deferral Recovery Fund to assist admitted students who show they need a little extra nancial help if they want to come to Tufts. The idea for the fund was developed last spring as the economic future became less clear and education loans less available. The fund gives the Friedman School flexibility to increase financial aid awards to admitted stu- dents who otherwise would have to defer enrollment due to unforeseen nancial challenges. The fund will be available for two years on a case-by-case basis. This year the fund made it possible for several students to attend, including the top- ranked candidates in the Master's in Humanitarian Assistance and Nutritional Epidemiology programs. \"I remember when I was director of admissions, some students would call ask- ing to defer their admission because they didn't have enough money,\" Cochary Gross says. \"Sometimes it was only a couple of thousand dollars. And when a stu- dent defers, you're less likely to get them\" to enroll even after the deferment, she says. \"I thought it would be great to have a pool of money where an admissions person could gure out how much it would take to have a student stay.\"Fund helps students keep their studies on track She has longstanding ties to the Friedman School as founder of its alumni association, a former researcher and current adjunct fac- ulty member. \"The school matters to me,\" she says. \"I've spent so much of my life here. I really care about the students, love hearing their stories and want them to succeed.\" As the school's capital campaign vice chair, Cochary Gross says she hopes \"to be able to help other donors come up with cre- ative ideas for giving. It is enormously satis- fying as a donor to ll in a gap that wouldn't otherwise be addressed.\" Liz Cochary Gross, N82, N88, hosted an event at her home in January for a group of Friedman School alumni and friends. Dean Eileen Kennedy shared her thoughts on the future of nutrition and ways that the Friedman School is spearheading efforts to improve the nutritional well-being of people worldwide through education and research.

More than 200 alumni took the time to share their thoughts on our current programming and advancement initiatives. We found that more than half of you have reg- istered with the Tufts Online Community (www. alumniconnections.com/tufts), but many are un- aware of the bene ts that entails, such as access to the Tufts Career Advisory Network and some of the online resources of the Tisch Library. We also saw an overwhelming request to have more access to nutrition news and information. In response, the school is posting online audio and slides from its weekly nutrition seminar series as well as nearly all sessions of the 2008 Friedman School Symposium. A new student-run initiative, the Nutrition Internet Radio Project, highlights current nutrition issues in its \"Nutrition Talk\" podcasts, available for download from iTunes and www.nutritioninternet radio.org. And if you go to the \"Publications\" link on the school website (http://You Spoke, We Listened nutrition.tufts.edu), you'll nd all the issues of the Dean's Letter for Tufts Nutrition , the school's electronic newsletter. We also send regular alumni email updates. Networking was another theme that ranked high on the survey. Y ou can now join our Friedman School alumni groups on both Facebook and LinkedIn, in addi- tion to the networking opportunities you'll nd at our Alumni Association receptions around the country. This year alone we hosted events in Chicago, San Diego, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and of course right here in Boston. Y our Executive Council is working hard to ensure that the Friedman School Alumni Association remains active and involved. Please do your part by reaching out, staying connected, attending an event, signing up to be a career mentor or making a gift to the school.

PHOTO: LOUIE PALUGreat choreographers draw inspiration from a diversity of subjects. Think of \"Jewels\" by George Balanchine or Agnes de Mille's \"Rodeo.\" But few have found a muse in a topic as profound as \"The role of folate in epigenetic regulation of colon carcinogenesis.\" Lara Park, a doctoral student in the Biomedical and Molecular Nutrition Program at the Friedman School and a lifelong dance enthusiast, created this moving rendi- tion of her directed study for a contest called Dance Your Ph.D., sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Its aim is to facilitate the col- laboration between the arts and sciences. Park did just that by recruiting her ensemble from both the Friedman School community and her fellow members of the Tufts dance group Sarabande. \"I know it may sound a little out there, but certain con- cepts like the protein conformational changes or things like dynamic equilibrium can really translate into quite beautiful choreography,\" Park said. Even less-than-scienti c minds may recognize the pairs of entwined dancers as DNA, who unwind and stretch out on the fl oor in preparation for transcription to mRNA. Dancers in black leotards, representing transcription fac- tors, leap and twirl among the prostrate DNA dancers, tak- ing their genetic blueprints in the form of blue ribbons. The process is regulated by methyl groups, who do back bends over the DNA to block the transcription dancers. When the dancer representing folate exits the stage (as in a folate- de cient diet), the methylation process is impaired, the DNA is aberrantly transcribed, and the dancers come to- gether in a chaotic group to form a cancerous tumor. Although Park's was not the winning entry, it has been viewed more than 15,000 times on www.youtube.com. \u2014Joanie Tobin and Julie FlahertyPAS DE FOLATE 36 Gift Planning Office 888.748.8387 t giftplanning@tufts.edu t www.tufts.edu/giftplanning During his lifetime, DAVID TARR, A57, was an overseer at the Gerald J. and Dorothy R.
