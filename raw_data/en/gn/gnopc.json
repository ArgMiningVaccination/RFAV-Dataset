What is naturopathy? Naturopathy, or naturopathic medicine, promotes whole body wellness, and seeks to prevent, treat, and heal diseases. Although the term \"naturopathy\" wasn't coined until 1902, this philosophy of medicine has been in practice in every culture around the world since humans were created. Naturopathic doctors (ND's) receive extensive training in medical school where they are educated in the same sciences as MD's and DO's with an emphasis on disease prevention, optimizing wellness, and holistic approaches. A holistic, whole body approach Our bodies are made intelligently. You know your body well, but you may not know how to listen to it yet. Why does your stomach hurt at certain times or after eating certain foods? Are you suffering from fatigue, brain fog, irritability, or joint pain? Our goal at MedLink is to find the root cause of your issues by analyzing your health history, current emotional state, and your diet and lifestyle habits. By treating you as a whole and not as a body part, it's much easier to achieve whole body wellness. We serve as your guide as you learn to listen to your body's needs. A natural approach to pain relief Pain and injuries are an unfortunate reality, especially as we age. Whether you're going out for a run every morning or prefer yoga and meditation, our bodies naturally wear and tear, leading to chronic pain and inflammation. Wouldn't you rather heal your body naturally with its own cells than take painkillers or undergo surgery? Because naturopathy seeks to heal you from within, we avoid prescription drugs and life-altering surgery by leading you to a path of a pain-free life, naturally. Common conditions that we treat at MedLink are: - Chronic joint pain - Ligament tears - Tendonitis - Neuropathy - Plantar fasciitis - Knee pain - Rotator cuff tears - Elbow pain - Arthritis, and more How it differs from Western medicine Western medicine (also referred to as \"traditional medicine\") typically deals with pain and disease after it has surfaced. Since prevention is not a goal, prescription drugs and surgery are seen as the solution rather than looking at a patient as a whole. Naturopathic medicine promotes the importance of diet and exercise along with supplements to fill any gaps in treatment, working with your body's natural ability to heal itself. While Western medicine treats from the outside in, natural medicine treats from the inside out by finding the cause of the disease and oftentimes preventing it. With a healthy body and mind, you are less susceptible to disease and pain. Wouldn't you want to stop disease before it ever has a chance? What is regenerative medicine? Nature meets science with naturopathic medicine. Our bodies naturally heal themselves, but sometimes they need an extra dose of nutrients to get you back to an active and pain-free lifestyle. Our practice is equipped with the highest quality therapies and FDA-compliant products to complement your customized treatment plan. Our therapies work with your body to stimulate healing while decreasing inflammation and pain. A powerful tool we use is ultrasound for precise diagnostics, and a dynamic view that allows us to guide the needle exactly into the point of injury. And when paired with ozone therapy, your joints will function at an optimal level. Safe, effective therapy tailored to your needs When we're injured our bodies start the healing process. When this isn't enough, regenerative medicine is utilized to give your body the boost it needs. We use a product called Amniotic Liquid Allograft, or Amnio for short, to assist and advance the soft tissue repair to stop your pain. Ultrasound is our guide when performing injections because unlike an x-ray or MRI, we are able to see your full range of motion in real time to find the source of your pain and treat it, rather than guessing from a still image. By taking out the guesswork of what movements aggravate your pain, we are able to tailor your treatment plan without the need for prescription drugs or surgery. Using your body's own cells for healing with regenerative joint injections Another great treatment we offer for achy joints is PRP, or platelet rich plasma. By extracting and concentrating a small amount of your blood and reintroducing it into your body as an injection, your body is stimulated to begin healing. Because your own blood is being used, the risk of rejection or infection is minimal. PRP is effective in repairing ligaments, tendons, muscles, and relieving joint pain. Ozone therapy Did you know that oxygen is powerful enough to heal the human body? Carefully made with medical-grade oxygen, ozone therapy has extraordinary benefits such as pain and inflammation relief, and the ability to destroy bacteria and viruses. Inflammation can lead to oxidative stress that can be helped with ozone therapy. Serious conditions such as arthritis, heart disease, and cancer have all been treated with ozone therapy to stimulate cellular repair and regeneration. We administer ozone via injections or intravenously (IV) at our clinic, and it can be administered at home with the proper equipment Benefits of naturopathic medicine Natural medicine has seen an increase in popularity as more individuals experience the healing power of nature. It's much too common to be rushed out the door when meeting with your doctor and feeling unheard because your symptoms are not improving. You deserve to be treated with compassion and an open ear in order to begin your path to healing. Education and guidance What we put into our bodies is vital to our health. After your extensive consultation, Dr. Sam creates a dietary plan with supplement recommendations specific to your lifestyle, genetics, and needs. Diets are not universal. What works for a loved one may not work for you. Through extensive training and research, we have created the blueprint for returning to a disease-free and active life free of pain. Rather than masking your symptoms, naturopathic medicine seeks to find the root of the issue. Instead of immediately turning to prescription drugs, we educate you in all aspects including treatment and nutrition to treat your body as a whole. When you feed your body the nutrients it needs rather than the processed and saturated products that are much too common today, your health will improve. With natural treatments, extensive blood panels, and a focus on preventing disease, naturopathy provides a multitude of benefits. Treatment of diseases, disorders, and pain without surgery or prescription drugs Prescription drugs and surgery are costly and life-altering. Although most acute injuries are accidents, chronic pain and disorders can oftentimes be prevented completely with a comprehensive treatment plan. By treating pain from the inside out, your body will be rejuvenated and in better condition to continue healing itself. You'll be equipped with the proper resources and tools for a vibrant life without the need to sacrifice time away from your family due to a painful and invasive surgery. With the risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease reduced, what are you going to do with the added years to your life?
