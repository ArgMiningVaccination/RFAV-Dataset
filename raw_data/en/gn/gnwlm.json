How to Fix Low Energy - 5 Other Tips Taking herbs is a great natural way to fix low energy. However, if you want a significant improvement in your energy levels, you should combine that with some lifestyle changes. We'll get you started with 5 useful tips on how to boost your energy. #1. Work Out When you have low energy, getting out of bed and exercising might seem like absolute torture. However, you'll be doing your body a huge favor. When you exercise, [your body produces more endorphins](https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/workouts/boost-your-energy-level-with-exercise.aspx), which leads to this amazing feeling of euphoria at the end of your workout. In this way, exercising boosts your mood and gets you in much better shape to get through the rest of your day. Not to mention it's better for your overall health, both physical and mental. So, what are you waiting for? Get moving! #2. Eat a Balanced Diet You know what they say - it's 70% diet and 30% exercise. Even if you're not the sportiest person out there, it really matters what food you put into your body. A well-balanced diet generally includes whole grains, fruits, seeds and nuts, lean meats, leafy greens, dairy and eggs, and fish. Make sure your diet includes enough vitamins such as B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D and K, as well as minerals like iron, potassium, and magnesium, as these are essential for staying energized. If you are feeling tired, you might be tempted to grab a sugary snack, but the energy it will provide you with won't last long. So, try to avoid sugary snacks, soda, fast food, deep-fried and processed food, refined grains, and... yes, you guessed it. Coffee. Let us explain. Caffeine forces your adrenal glands to produce more stress hormones to keep you energized. Consuming large amounts of it regularly will put a huge strain on your body, leading to additional exhaustion and stress. Therefore, you're better off reducing your caffeine intake as much as possible. Still not convinced? You might want to check out our article on [adrenal fatigue and coffee](https://happyhealthyhippieco.com/blogs/news/adrenal-fatigue-coffee). #3. Prioritize your tasks Exhaustion often comes from a large workload - you might be overwhelmed with different tasks related to work, family, school, friends, and other areas of your life. Try to prioritize your tasks and plan your day. Even though you might think everything should be done this very second, sit down and think about which tasks are truly urgent and which can wait a little bit. Don't hesitate to ask for help or say \"no\" from time to time. #4. Drink enough water [One of the first signs of dehydration is fatigue](https://www.health.harvard.edu/energy-and-fatigue/9-tips-to-boost-your-energy-naturally). Make sure you are drinking enough water - around 8 cups a day should be good. While other fluids also contribute to hydration, sugary drinks cause weight gain and inflammation, as well as spikes in energy levels which later lead to a crash. Alcohol is also something you want to avoid, especially in larger quantities during the evening hours. Yes, it makes you sleepy, but it also [interferes with deep sleep](https://www.webmd.com/women/features/10-energy-boosters#3), so you won't feel as well-rested in the morning. All things considered, a good old glass of water seems like the best option. #5. Sleep enough and better This one might seem obvious, but although the 7-8 hours of sleep recommendation is common sense, there is a lot more to say when it comes to sleep quality. Here are some tips on how to sleep better: - Avoid screens before bedtime. We're all guilty of watching movies late in the evening or endlessly scrolling through social media until we can no longer keep our eyes open. However, the blue light from the screens restrains the production of melatonin, which [disturbs your circadian rhythm](https://www.sclhealth.org/blog/2019/09/why-it-is-time-to-ditch-the-phone-before-bed/#:~:text=Tips%3A,and%20start%20reading%20before%20bed.)and makes it more difficult to go to sleep and wake up the next day. Furthermore, leaving your phone buzzing with notifications through the night can interrupt your deep sleep. Try to put your phone away 30 minutes before bed. Instead, you can opt for reading a book to relax at the end of the day. - Keep your curtains/blinds open. Following the same logic, [waking up to light](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a25617294/how-to-get-more-energy-fast/)would help regulate your internal sleep-wake body clock and boost your mood, getting you ready to conquer the day. - Go for a power nap. Although getting full 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep would be optimal, our busy schedules don't always allow that. If you have some extra time in-between tasks, go for a nap. However, try not to go over 20 minutes, because the longer you sleep, the more likely you are to go into deep sleep and feel extra groggy when you wake up. - Take (natural) sleep supplements. Just can't seem to fall asleep? [Namastay In Bed](https://happyhealthyhippieco.com/collections/all/products/namastay-in-bed), an all-natural herbal sleep supplement, can help! Final Thoughts We all have those moments where we feel exhausted and overwhelmed. However, instead of reaching out for an extra cup of coffee or a sugary snack, remember there are many natural ways to fix low energy that are much more beneficial for your health and will work better in the long term. Combine the right herbs with some good habits and try to reduce the stress in your life as much as possible, and you'll find yourself waking up with a smile, ready for the day ahead. "}
