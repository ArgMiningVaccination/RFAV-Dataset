Adrenalin intoxication weakens the astral body leading to illness. The kidneys as an astral organ are probably the first organs to be afflicted by the overwhelming flood of feelings such as anxiety of death, helplessness etc. (a German idiom - 'something goes on the kidneys - is getting on your nerves Engish.) The peritraumatic dissociation retracts the consciousness from the realm of soul experience, before waking consciousness becomes overwhelmed by the experiences. Hence soul impressions can have an immediate, unchecked effect on the organs. The sensory impressions of children influence the forming of the organs directly since the cushioning consciousness is still not developed. Adults who have experienced extreme sensory impressions can also be susceptible to structural organ damage. Images are be retained by the lungs if they cannot become absorbed in the soul. In such cases people have flaskbacks which interfere with everyday life. Similarily, the black-haired 'surplus-iron children' mentioned in the Curative Education Course are not able to absorb normal sensory impressions in their organism and sentences, words, pictures, songs unintentionally disturb their everyday consciounsness. Their metabolic system is too weak. The importance of the twelve senses in connection with trauma therapy, and how the twelve senses are afflicted as a result of traumatisation is as yet unknown and remains an unexplored field of research. Therapeutic Aims - To reawaken in the soul the interest for the beauty in the world. - To consolidate the regenerating metabolic-nutritional pole so that it can fight the toxic influence coming from the nerve-sensory pole. - To cautiously and consciously reflect on the experiences and gradually coming to terms with them. Therapeutic ideas: - Meditative work with the Prologue of John, The Lord's Prayer, or with the Protection meditations by Rudolf Steiner (\"Schutzmeditation\" - 'Wall of crystal', of my Life', 'I carry peace in me') - Call on help from the the Hierarachies leading destiny and the management of destiny - Sufficient sleep and pauses to regenerate the life-forces as a solid foundation for experiences of the soul. - Oberservation of nature (e.g. sketching the metamophosis of plants); the oberservation of art - - EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) in the sense of a therapeutically induced crossing of the hemispheres. Compare with the baby which calms down and falls asleep while being rocked. (Relief comes because at the turning point while cradling the child, the consciousness is emancipated from the nervous system.) - Day and trauma review (backwards) to gain more distance to the experiences Whatever pictures we imagine influences the realm of the will indirectly via the feelings which evolve. This explains the effectiveness of the mental-training which musicians and athletes practice. The phenomen of uncontrolled dissociation which traumatized victims develop and which distances them not solely from the trauma but also from everyday life can be consciously and freely practised to create an inner stability. The psychotraumatology has already developed particular exercises: The safe inner place, the inner garden, and other imaginative exercises which the patient, after initial instruction, can practise independently whenever he/she needs stability. Medical treatment: - Ferrum metallicum preparatum D12 - Gentiana lutea Rh 5% relieving the digestion to strengthen the metabolic system - Oxalis body compresses can revive lost life-forces due to grief, strengthens the etheric body. - Levico D3, in order to restore the equilibrium between antipathy to the world (Fe) and sympathy to the world (Cu). - Cuprum metallicum preparatum e.g. D8 internal, or 0.4 % ointment externally applied to the navel region help the process of bereavement and taking leave of the deceased.
