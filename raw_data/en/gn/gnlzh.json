What Is Schizophrenia? [Schizophrenia](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/schizophrenia/) is a mental health disorder characterized by chronic [positive symptoms](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/positive-symptoms-of-schizophrenia/) (i.e., changes in behaviors or thought patterns), like hallucinations and delusions, as well as [negative symptoms](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/negative-symptoms-of-schizophrenia/) (i.e., social withdrawal, lack of interest), like blunted emotion or lack of motivation. Cognitive deficits, such as memory and decision-making impairments, are also commonly present and may precede the acute onset of the disorder. Usually schizophrenia is diagnosed between late adolescence and early adulthood with the onset of [psychotic symptoms](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/psychosis/). However, subtle signs of the disorder may emerge earlier in the form of negative and cognitive symptoms. Common [symptoms of schizophrenia](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/schizophrenia-symptoms/) include: [Delusions](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/delusion/) [Hallucinations](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/hallucinations/) - Disorganized speech - Disorganized behavior [Anhedonia](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/anhedonia/#:~:text=Common%20Type%20of%20Therapies,have%20a%20trial%20of%20CBT.) - Lack of motivation or ability to do tasks - Difficulty with speaking - Inability to engage in social interactions [Blunted affect](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/blunted-affect/) - Cognitive impairments How Is Schizophrenia Treated? A combination of treatment methods is the best way to manage symptoms of schizophrenia. If positive symptoms are present, medication is often a first line of treatment. Therapy, social skills training, and support groups also play an important role in long term treatment and management of the illness. Alternative approaches may be beneficial when used in conjunction with traditional [treatments for schizophrenia](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/schizophrenia-treatment/). In some cases, these complementary methods serve to enhance treatment, decrease the risk of relapse, and reduce medication side effects. However, when used in place of conventional treatments (and especially medication), they are usually not sufficient. 14 Complementary Treatments for Schizophrenia An estimated 20%-45% of individuals with schizophrenia experience symptoms that are not completely remitted or are resistant to [antipsychotic medication](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/antipsychotics/).1 Negative symptoms in particular can be stubborn to treat. In treatment-resistant cases, complementary treatments can be beneficial for providing symptom relief and reducing medication side effects. While many of these options may be helpful for both those with schizophrenia and non-clinical individuals, one should always consult their physician about treatments that can interact with their medications and other health conditions. Below are 14 complementary treatments for schizophrenia: 1. Vitamin Supplements A number of vitamins have been shown to be deficient in those with schizophrenia, such as vitamins B, C, D, and E.2 Research is mixed as to whether supplements help alleviate schizophrenia symptoms, but a few studies suggest a benefit when used adjunctively to medication. Vitamins B9 (folate) and B12 may improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia for certain genotypes.3 Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble antioxidant, for which one study found improvements in psychiatric symptoms. It has been suggested that this vitamin may also modulate the brain's dopamine pathways, which are dysfunctional in schizophrenia.4 Vitamin D supplementation may be helpful for individuals who may be genetically predisposed for schizophrenia. One study indicated that male participants who regularly took the supplement were at a decreased risk of developing the disorder.5 Lastly, vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that has been theorized to help ameliorate antipsychotic medication side effects. However, it does not seem to help improve schizophrenia symptoms. In fact, high doses can actually exacerbate symptoms.5 2. Ketogenic Diet There is mounting research suggesting that brain glucose and energy abnormalities are common in individuals with schizophrenia. Numerous studies have demonstrated that a ketogenic diet-one low in carbohydrates and sugar, and rich in fat and protein-can reduce psychotic symptoms and even counteract certain side effects from antipsychotic medication.6 As an add-on treatment for schizophrenia, low sugar and carbohydrate diets have received more attention recently with the rise in the keto diet's popularity. Resumption of the diet has been shown effective in bringing symptom relief and enhancement of ongoing conventional treatment.7, 8, 9 One study reported symptom improvement despite lapses in diet compliance, suggesting even a mild form of this diet can be beneficial.10 3. Cannabidiol (CBD) CBD has been shown to reduce inflammation and alleviate psychotic symptoms. In fact, a number of studies have shown CBD to be as effective as some antipsychotic drugs, and without as many adverse side effects.11, 12 CBD may also be beneficial when used alongside antipsychotics, even in medication-resistant cases.13 Some research suggests that CBD could have a prophylactic role in treatment through the reduction of inflammation. 4. Antioxidant-Rich Diets There is some evidence supporting that foods with anti-inflammatory properties, such as omega 3 fatty acids, or vitamins C and D, can be helpful in reducing symptoms and medication side effects.14 Although research is mixed, Ginkgo biloba and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) have shown promise in this area.15 Antioxidants are believed to work by reducing unstable free radicals that can lead to oxidative stress and subsequent deterioration of the brain. In addition to vitamin supplements, there are plenty of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables that can be incorporated into one's diet. 5. Melatonin Sleep dysregulation is common in schizophrenia. In some cases, [benzodiazepines](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/benzodiazepines/)* are prescribed to help alleviate sleep disturbances. However, these have side effects, can be addictive, and are only meant for short-term use. A great alternative to consider is melatonin. Melatonin is a natural hormone in the human brain that helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle. When taken routinely, at a time specified by a clinician, melatonin supplements can help stabilize the sleep-wake cycle and prevent [insomnia](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/insomnia/). Although melatonin does not seem to directly influence schizophrenia symptoms, it may serve indirectly to improve overall well-being, health, and wellness. Despite mixed research, melatonin may alleviate certain antipsychotic medication side effects, such as tardive dyskinesia and weight gain. It can also serve as a form of antioxidant and neuroprotective agent.16 Given the relatively safe profile of melatonin, some clinicians may recommend this as an add-on treatment. *This medication has black box warnings, the most serious kind of warnings from the FDA for abuse or misuse, risk of physical dependence and risk of serious side effects, including death, when combined with an opioid. 6. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids are important for brain development and functioning, and are often deficient in individuals with schizophrenia. The human body does not create these molecules naturally, and thus they need to be obtained through dietary means. Although research has been mixed on the efficacy of omega-3 supplements in symptom reduction, some clinicians may opt for recommending them. This is due in part to there being greater potential benefits than risks.17 It should be noted that, as with other alternative treatments, omega-3 fatty acids are not sufficient for preventing a relapse of symptoms when used alone.18 7. Amino Acids Amino acid deficiencies can accompany schizophrenia. One study suggests that using benzoate as an add-on treatment to antipsychotic medication can be beneficial for reducing symptoms, as well as improving cognitive symptoms.19 This is a feat that few treatment strategies have been able to accomplish. The authors note, however, that while benzoate is a natural occurring substance, it can interact with other compounds such as Vitamin C and thus should not be taken together. 8. Stress Management & Yoga Therapy Avoiding difficult situations is not always possible, so learning [techniques to manage stress ](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/stress-management/)is important. This includes recognizing stress before it becomes unmanageable, using relaxation and [mindfulness techniques](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/mindfulness/), and reframing one's thoughts. In a family or group setting, reducing stress of those who support an individual with schizophrenia is essential. [Yoga can improve one's overall mental health](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/yoga-mental-health/). As an adjunct to conventional treatment, weekly yoga classes have been shown to reduce symptoms and increase quality of life. One study found that inpatient schizophrenia participants showed significant symptom improvement during an 8-week yoga therapy program that involved [breathing exercises](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/breathwork/), postures, and guided [meditation](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/meditation/).20 This type of therapy may work by regulating the autonomic nervous system and accompanying physiological functions (like stress hormones, blood pressure, and arousal level) that can be dysfunctional in schizophrenia.21 9. Herbal Supplements There is limited research on the use of herbal supplements for schizophrenia. However, one particular traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Yokukansan, has been used for psychiatric disorders since 1555. Yokukansan, an extract containing 7 herbs, has been shown to improve antipsychotic medication side effects and also reduce positive schizophrenia symptoms.22 This extract is believed to be neuroprotective and work by modulating glutamate, which is often dysregulated in schizophrenia. As with any supplement, it is highly recommended to ask your doctor before incorporating yokukansan into your regimen. 10. Social Skills Training (SST) Social skills training (SST) can be particularly beneficial for those with schizophrenia, especially in conjunction with psychotherapy and medication.23 SST may involve individual and group work, and can be a highly effective complementary treatment. This approach helps individuals with schizophrenia maintain stability, develop coping strategies to protect against dysfunction during relapse, and not feel alone in their struggles. 11. Establishing a Routine Trying to build structure in one's daily schedule can be more helpful than one realizes. Even a couple of timed activities, like going for a walk or eating lunch, can prove beneficial. Routine is often a hidden factor behind the success of many individuals adapting to schizophrenia. For example, a job or enrollment in school are great ways to maintain a routine (as long as one's boss or school is flexible with hours and engagement should symptoms arise). 12. Practicing Substance Abstinence The same brain structures that are implicated in schizophrenia also play a role in drug use and addiction.24 In fact, alcohol and illicit drug dependence are present in approximately half of patients with schizophrenia, and this rate is even higher for nicotine dependence.25 Additionally, individuals who are either at risk for or diagnosed with schizophrenia typically experience poorer outcomes, increased hospitalization, and exacerbation of symptoms with substance use.26 Because of this, choosing to abstain from consuming substances is important in conjunction with traditional treatment. 13. Neuromodulation In extreme cases, neuromodulation techniques, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), [electroconvulsive therapy](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/electroconvulsive-therapy/) (ECT), or targeted neurosurgery, may be performed throughout one's treatment. Although research is fairly sparse on the safety and efficacy of ECT, a few studies have shown notable improvement for positive symptoms in the short-term. However, the approach does not affect or may even worsen negative symptoms.27 Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is more invasive, and requires that electrodes be surgically implanted in the brain. This method is still being refined in order to determine the optimal target area of the brain.28 Alternatively, [transmagnetic stimulation](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/tms/) (TMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation method that involves magnetically modulating a targeted area of the brain. It may be a consideration for those with resistant positive and negative symptoms, particularly auditory hallucinations.29 14. Anti-inflammatories & Immunotherapy Inflammation has been shown to play a role in the pathology of schizophrenia. NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories), such as aspirin, have been shown to improve certain schizophrenia symptoms. However, they do not affect cognitive functioning.30 Other pharmaceuticals, like Minocycline, also show promise for reducing inflammation, in addition to protecting cells from deterioration and modulating levels of glutamate. Potential Risks of Alternative Treatments for Schizophrenia Alternative treatments for schizophrenia are rarely intended to replace pharmaceutical treatment. However, they may be recommended as add-on therapies to enhance treatment efficacy, combat unwanted side effects of medication, and contribute to a well-balanced physical and mental state, giving a person the best chance of navigating this chronic disorder. It is highly recommended to check with your physician before pursuing complementary treatments, as vitamin supplements can interact with medication or cause complications with other medical conditions. Some supplements and CBD have notably been mislabeled and can contain harmful additives or compounds that can cause complications or worsen symptoms.31 Are Alternative Treatments for Schizophrenia Effective? Conventional treatments for schizophrenia are not always ideal, as antipsychotic medications often come with unwanted side effects and psychotherapy takes considerable time. There are also people for whom conventional treatment alone has not been effective. Hence, alternative treatments are appealing, offering hope for symptom relief at a time when there is no single magic pill. The research supporting the efficacy of alternative treatments is mixed. In cases where complementary treatment is effective, it is often only as an add-on to medication and psychotherapy-not as a substitute. Nonetheless, it's important to realize that schizophrenia is a multifaceted disorder, usually accompanied by a cluster of symptoms and underlying dysfunction. With a physician's approval, many of the complementary treatments listed above can help stabilize one's physiology, enhance symptom treatment, and reduce certain medication side effects. When to Seek Professional Help In cases where an individual with schizophrenia is at risk for harming themself or others, it is best to either call 911 or take them to the nearest emergency room. If symptoms and related behaviors are not severe, consider taking the initiative to help a loved one [find the right therapist](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/how-to-find-a-therapist/) to start the process of diagnosis and treatment. Those who have trouble finding resources near them can consider [online therapy options](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/best-online-therapy/), as well as medication management services. Final Thoughts Schizophrenia is a lifelong disorder with symptoms that can be very distressing and intrusive to daily functioning. Traditional treatments, like antipsychotic medication and psychotherapy, are usually the most effective for schizophrenia. Still, their efficacy can be enhanced with complementary strategies. One should always check with their doctor before incorporating over-the-counter supplements, as they may interact with one's medication or other medical conditions. At the very least, taking care of oneself with a healthy diet, exercise, and regular self-care is a good foundation for overall well-being.
