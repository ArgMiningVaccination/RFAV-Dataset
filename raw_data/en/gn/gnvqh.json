The College, which now has separate governance under a Board of Trustees, is an example of the rapid growth in the development of Maryland's community college system. Allegany College of Maryland was established to provide low-cost, high quality, higher education for the residents of the area. Its accessibility to the county's center of population permits students to live at home, thus saving a substantial part of out-of-pocket costs for a college education. Although heavy emphasis was placed on liberal arts transfer programs in the College's early development, in recent years the College has developed highly specialized curricula, including those in the technological and pre-professional areas, as career programs to satisfy identified needs of the region. Ever cognizant of its responsibility to an industrial area pocketed in Appalachian W estern Maryland, Allegany College of Maryland has accepted a mission to make tangible contributions through higher education to the economic and cultural growth of the area. Through its Board of Trustees, the College presents a dimension of learning that prepares men and women for the excitement and satisfaction of creative lives. PHILOSOPHY In developing and implementing the offerings of the College, the Board of Trustees, the faculty, and the staff have steadfastly held, and continue to hold, the following beliefs: We believe in democracy as a way of life, and in both the freedoms and responsibilities inherent in a democracy . We believe in preparation for active participation in a democracy. We believe that education is a process by which certain objectives of society are reached. We believe that education is sustained, utilized, and protected by society . We believe that our college, as an essential and integral part of the American way of life, has a direct relationship and responsibility to the community to serve as a leader in educational thought and practice. To this end, the educational resources of the institution are made available for use by the community. We believe that education embraces knowledge, training, and aspiration. Consequently, we believe in the dissemination of knowledge, the liberation of minds, the development of skills, the promotion of free inquiry , the encouragement of the creative or inventive spirit, and the establishment of wholesome attitude toward order and change, with an emphasis on ethical and legal concerns. We believe that we should educate broadly through a program of general education which introduces the students to the basic fields of knowledge: the arts and humanities, English composition, social and behavioral sciences, mathematics, and the biological and physical sciences. We believe that it is our responsibility to guide students in the exercise of self-direction and self- discipline in the solution of their problems, and to instill in them the desire to continue education as long as they live. We believe that knowledge alone is not enough. Ethics is indispensable; therefore, our program emphasizes appreciation of and response to beauty , truth, and justice, thus contributing to the general cultural development of the community through the individual. We believe in the cooperation of the College with all segments of its service area and in the continual evaluation of the College, its purpose and program, to the end that it may contribute to the maximum development of the individual and the area. 10 General Information VISION We will be the college of choice that transforms lives, strengthens communities, and makes learners the center of everything we do. MISSION Allegany College of Maryland is a lifelong learning community dedicated to excellence in education and responsive to the changing needs of the communities we serve.

The Bedford County Regional Education Foundation has provided total financial support for furnishing the campus facility. The 19,500 square foot facility located in Everett, Pennsylvania, houses ten classrooms, two state-of-the-art computer labs, three distance learning classrooms, electronic library, bookstore, student lounge, conference room and faculty and administrative offices including Admissions/Registration, Student Services, Placement Testing and Career and Transfer Planning and Advisement, and Foundation.

If the account is unpaid, an official withdrawal is still necessary to be eligible for a deletion of the appropriate charges. Non-attendance of classes or termination of attendance of classes does not constitute official withdrawal. All tuition charges and fees (except the registration fee) are refundable if the student officially withdraws or drops a class or classes before the first day of the semester . If the account is unpaid, a deletion of the appropriate charges will be made instead of a refund. Eighty percent (80%) of the tuition charges and fees (less the registration fee) are refundable if a student of ficially withdraws or drops a class or classes prior to the end of the third week of classes, or in the case of a summer session, prior to the end of the first week of classes.

After the course starts, the student is eligible for an eighty percent (80%) refund if he or she withdraws before twenty percent of the course schedule is completed. Please request specific dates from the Business Office. 30 Tuition and Fees No refund or deletion of charges is made if a student withdraws or drops a class or classes after the deadline dates specified above; however, refunds may be considered if the student can verify that he or she never attended classes or stopped attending classes before the refund deadlines. In these cases, since the student did not officially withdraw before the refund deadlines, and since a position was held open in the class, the refund or deletion of charges will not exceed eighty percent (80%). The remaining twenty percent (20%) is considered to be a non-refundable charge. For the following reasons, tuition and fees (less registration fee) are refundable beyond the refund deadline on a pro-rated basis (from 100% to 0%) according to the number of class dates remaining in the semester: (1) Medical reasons dated and certified by a physician; or (2) Job transfer dated and certified by the employer; or (3) Job schedule (shift) change, which causes a conflict with class schedule, dated and certified by the employer; or (4) Military transfer dated and certified by documentation (copy of orders) from the military unit.

Need is determined by subtracting the resources of the student and his/her parents from the total student expenses. All financial aid awards to students are determined by the Director of Student Financial Aid. PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW WHEN APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID Students need only to complete the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) to apply for federal financial aid. The FAFSA for 2017-2018 became available October 1, 2016 and is available at www.fafsa.gov. In order for students to receive the maximum amount of federal and state financial aid monies, students should complete the F AFSA before March 1, 2017. Students are encouraged to complete the FAFSA on the WEB Worksheet (FOTW) to assist them in completing the online application (www.fafsa.gov). The Worksheet may be obtained from the Student Financial Aid Office, the high school guidance counselor, or the web at www.fafsa.gov. After the FAFSA is processed, students selected for verification by the federal government will receive an email notification of additional documents that are required to complete the financial aid process. A Financial Aid Award Letter detailing all award decisions and giving additional information and instructions about the aid of fered is sent to each applicant and can also be viewed on the student's WebAdvisor account. Allegany College of Maryland also provides to students via the WebAdvisor Account the Federal Shopping Sheet, which is a comparative consumer tool designed by the federal government to simplify and standardize financial aid information. A student must reapply for financial aid each academic year. However, aid usually continues at the same level each year , unless a student's resources or his/her parents' expected contribution changes. All students receiving aid automatically get information on how to apply for renewal awards. Other students should request applications as early as possible. FINANCIAL AID POLICY Admissions Status - Only students classified as \"degree-seeking\" or \"certificate-seeking\" are eligible for financial aid, except for the General Studies Certificate program which is not eligible for any type of Title IV Federal Financial Aid. \"Non-degree\" students, such as those classified as Early College, Transient, or Letter of Recognition, are not eligible for student financial assistance. Audited Courses - Audited courses cannot be paid for with financial aid funds. Repeating Classes - Department of Education regulations state that federal student aid funds can only be used to pay for one repeat of a previously passed course.

This regulation must be followed even though our academic policy allows some courses to be repeated for credit up to 3 times. Failed classes which are repeated will be paid for indefinitely. Satisfactory Progress for Financial Aid - Students must be making satisfactory academic progress in order to receive financial aid. A copy of this policy may be obtained from the Student Financial Aid Office or on the web at www.allegany.edu/finaid under Student Information.

Pennsylvania Students - Students receiving a Pennsylvania State Grant, administered by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA), who are enrolled for more credits in web courses than for credits in in-classroom based courses will not be eligible to receive any PA State Grant funds. This rule is effective on a semester basis; students will be evaluated each semester. In addition, in order for hybrid or blended course credits to count as in-classroom, the online instruction component cannot exceed 50 percent of the combined online and in-classroom contact hours. The actual eligibility requirements can be found online at: www.pheaa.org/funding-opportunities/state-grant-program/prepare.shtml. In addition, PA students must be enrolled on at least a half-time basis (6 credit hours) in a PHEAA approved undergraduate program of study which is at least 2 academic years in length and seeking a first bachelor 's degree.

(Work with your forestry advisor to make slight variations to include proper math and chemistry coursework.) Graduates with this degree have options to enter the workforce or continue their education. The Forest Technology program at Allegany College of Maryland trains students for the position of forest technician. A forest technician is a middle-management person trained to work with a graduate professional forester. A forest technician must be able to work alone, to make decisions, and to supervise small crews in the field. The Forest Technology program is designed to allow a graduate to gain employment after four semesters and one summer of practical training. The Forest Technology Curriculum at Allegany College of Maryland has been designated as a Statewide Program by the Maryland Higher Education Commission. Maryland residents from counties other than Allegany County who register in this eligible program will be charged the out- of-county tuition rate. However, these students may be eligible to receive reimbursement for a portion of the cost dif ference between the in-county and out-of-county tuition rates. Funding availability for this program is based on funding from the State of Maryland and is thus subject to change each semester. Some restrictions apply. More information can be obtained by contacting the Admissions Office. Forest Technology is accredited by the Society of American Foresters. Allegany College of Maryland' s Forest Technology program is among a select group of schools in North America that have been accredited by the Society of American Foresters. In addition to maintaining the scholastic standards required of all students in the college, Forest T echnology students must achieve a grade of \"C\" or better in each Forestry course with the exception of Forest Technology 101. Some specialized equipment is required for students in the Forest Technology curriculum. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, drafting equipment, safety boots, chain saw safety pants or chaps, and a safety helmet. Although some courses in this program will transfer, this program is a career program and is not designed to transfer . However, many Forest Technology graduates have transferred and received bachelor's degrees from four-year schools. Allegany College of Maryland and West Virginia University have recently signed an articulation agreement, which will allow graduates of the Forest Technology program to transfer to West Virginia University and complete their forestry degree in an additional two years of study while experiencing minimal loss of credit from Allegany College of Maryland. Other four-year programs may require two or three additional years to complete a bachelor's degree in this way. Students planning to transfer should consult with their advisor or the Student Success Center. Successful completion of this program qualifies a student to apply for an Associate of Applied Science degree in Forest Technology.

Specialized areas of study, called Letters of Recognition, are available in Integrative Health, Integrative Wellness, Leadership Development, and Addiction Treatment. (See catalog description of these programs for more information.) The Human Service Associate curriculum at Allegany College of Maryland has been designated as a Health Manpower Shortage Program. The Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has determined certain health occupations in the state to be in short supply . The Maryland Higher Education Commission has designated educational programs that correspond to these health occupations to be eligible for the Health Manpower Shortage Program. Maryland residents from counties other than Allegany County who register in this eligible program will be charged the out-of-county tuition rate. However, these students may be eligible to receive reimbursement for a portion of the cost difference between the in-county and out-of-county tuition rates. Funding availability for this program is based on funding from the State of Maryland and is thus subject to change each semester. Some restrictions apply. More information can be obtained by contacting the Admissions Office. Although most graduates of the curriculum seek immediate employment in the human service field, over 40% enroll in advanced degree programs such as social work or counseling within three years after graduation. Students planning to transfer should consult their advisor or the Student Success Center. To be considered as a candidate for admission to the clinical phase of the program, students must meet all College admissions requirements, have completed any necessary developmental coursework in reading and English, and have a minimum overall Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.0. The last entering class had an average GPA of 3.4. Students can complete this program within four college semesters and a minimum of one summer session if they attend full-time. Students are accepted into the clinical phase each year on a selective basis. Applications are reviewed beginning February 1 and continue until the class is filled. Early application is essential. The process for application includes three parts; submission of the required written materials, four individual interviews with the members of the Human Service Admissions Committee, and completion of Sociology 104, Interdisciplinary Studies in Human Society , with a \"B\" or better. This course may be taken prior to making application to the Clinical Phase of the program or concurrently with the Admission process. If taken concurrently, a student will be reviewed as a candidate for admission, but acceptance will be conditional upon a final review, which is made at the completion of the course. The Admissions Committee consists of Human Service faculty, second year Clinical Students or recent graduates, and a representative of the Admissions Of fice. The Committee considers four primary factors in determining admission to the clinical phase: 1. Academic performances as measured by a minimum of six credits in the Core Mix category (English, Psychology, Sociology , and Speech) and a computed Core Mix GPA of 2.5 or better. All courses in this category must be passed with a \"C\" or better, with the exception of Sociology 104 which must have a \"B\" or better . (program continued on next page) 103 Programs of Study 2. Career goals. 3. Assessment of the areas, which contribute to successful performance in classroom, fieldwork, and employment settings. These areas include interpersonal skills, oral and written communication, maturity, motivation, flexibility, access to a support system, realistic career goals, potential to work as a team member, and the ability to balance current work, school, family, and personal responsibilities. 4. Related work, volunteer, or life experience. Students who are accepted enroll in the required clinical coursework for the fall semester. Three agency-based clinical training experiences (field work) are included in the four semesters of the program. Students participate in the selection of these training sites and a wide variety of settings are available, including agencies accessible to students from Pennsylvania and W est Virginia. The college carries a blanket professional liability insurance policy which covers Human Service students in the field. A satisfactory health record must be on file prior to clinical experience. In addition to maintaining the College' s scholastic standards, Human Service Associate students must achieve a \"C\" grade in each Human Service course. Failure to achieve a \"C\" grade or better in any Human Service course will result in dismissal from the program since the courses (Human Service) are sequential and prerequisite for continuance. In order to graduate, the student must achieve a grade of \"C\" or better in psychology, English writing, and sociology courses. Failure to achieve a \"C\" or better will result in the student's repeating the course. Students may also be dismissed from the program for unprofessional and/or inappropriate behavior at practicum sites. Readmission to the Clinical Phase of the program is contingent upon the student's demonstrating improvement or appropriate change in the behavior(s) that resulted in the dismissal. Since each Human Service course is offered only once each year, a student must wait one year to be eligible for readmission. The final decision for readmission will be made by the Human Service faculty. Successful completion of this program qualifies a student to apply for an Associate of Applied Science degree in Human Service Associate.

Students may not repeat an examination of the same title within six months of the initial testing date. GRADES Midsemester and Final grades are available to students online through WebAdvisor. For students not meeting all financial obligations to the College, final grades and transcripts may be withheld. Grades officially recorded are: Grade Interpretation Points A Academic achievement of outstanding quality 4 B Academic achievement of high quality 3 C Academic achievement of average quality 2 D Academic achievement below average quality 1 F Failure (credit and non-credit courses) None P Passed (non-credit courses and designated credit courses only) None I Incomplete None R Registered to Audit None W Withdrawn None X Deferred None The minimum cumulative grade point average for graduation is a 2.00. The \"C\" grade or better is the minimum acceptable level of achievement for course work within certain specialized programs. Refer to the description of your curriculum information on minimum grade requirements. The grade of \"I\" (Incomplete) will be granted only upon written request stating the student's reasons why an extension of time is necessary to complete the work. The request should be submitted to the Registration Office no later than the day of the final examination in the course and is subject to the approval of both the Director of Admissions and Registration and the instructor in the course. In the event that a student is physically unable to initiate the request, the instructor may initiate action with the concurrence of the Director of Admissions and Registration. If the student's request is granted, the work must be completed within 30 days after the onset of the following semester, unless a later date is specified by the instructor with the concurrence of the Senior Vice President of Instructional and Student Affairs, and the Registration Office. When the work is completed, the permanent grade will be recorded in the Registration Office; if the work is not completed by the specified date, the grade of \"F\" will be recorded. 301 Academic Information The grade of \"R\" (Registered to Audit) will be recorded if the student so requests (a) at the time of registration; (b) before the end of the 10th week; or, (c) any time prior to the end of the semester if approved by the Academic Standards Committee, providing that the procedures for making an official change in schedule have been fulfilled. To have a grade of \"R\" recorded, the student is expected to meet the requirements for Audit as outlined by the instructor in the course syllabus. The grade of \"X\" (Deferred) will be awarded at the instructor's discretion to those students whom the instructor feels have, through reasonably diligent ef forts, made some progress but have not attained proficiency sufficient for a passing grade. Such students would be eligible to re-enroll at the beginning of any subsequent semester and continue to work toward proficiency. The final grade would, of course, be given at the end of the semester in which the student has reached minimum course objectives. The \"X\" grade is a permanent grade and will remain on the student's official transcript. Specialized grading systems are employed in certain curricula, particularly those in the career areas. Please consult the appropriate curriculum director for information on specialized grading systems. GRADE POINT AVERAGE Only final credit course grades are used to compute the grade point average. No average will be computed for a student while any course remains marked \"I\" (Incomplete). The cumulative grade point average does not change at any time except at the close of a semester. Grades of \"W\", \"P\", \"R\", or \"X\" are not included in any grade point average. If a student repeats a course, only the later grade will be used in computing the grade point average. However, the earlier grade will remain listed on the official transcript and will be included in all transcripts of credits. Quality points can be earned only in courses taken at Allegany College of Maryland. While credits earned at other institutions may be acceptable in transfer , quality points will not transfer. The Allegany College of Maryland grade point average will not be affected by credits transferred. To compute a grade point average, multiply the point value of the grades received by the number of semester credit hours. Divide the sum of points by the number of semester hours attempted. GRADE POINT AVERAGE FOR PASS-FAIL COURSES A grade of \"F\" carries no credit hours or grade points, regardless of whether or not the course is offered for credit. A grade of \"P\" in a credit course awards the student the appropriate number of credit hours but does not award grade points. The semester grade point average (GPA) is determined on the basis of the grades earned that semester in other credit courses. The cumulative GPA is calculated on the basis of all other credit courses. The cumulative hours earned include the hours earned in a credit course in which a grade of \"P\" was awarded. REGISTRATION All students are expected to register for classes within the registration dates listed in the College calendar. Students are requested to make appointments with their advisors or the Advising Center prior to beginning the registration process. On occasions when academic advisors are not available, students may complete the process in the Admissions Office. Courses added after the first week of classes require the written permission of the instructor and the approval of the Academic Standards Committee. To Add or Withdraw from a course(s), the student must prepare a Change of Schedule Form, have it signed by the advisor and the instructor(s), and have it recorded in the Registration Office. The College reserves the right to cancel a course in which there is insufficient enrollment. 302 Academic Information WITHDRAWAL A student withdrawing from any course(s) up to the tenth week of the semester must complete a Change of Schedule form. This form must be filed before adding or dropping any course(s) becomes final. Except by written approval of the Academic Standards Committee, a course may not be officially dropped or changed to an audit after the tenth week of the semester. If a student neglects to follow the official withdrawal procedure and merely ceases to attend classes, a grade of \"F\" will be recorded at the end of the semester . The official date of withdrawal is the date on which the completed Change of Schedule form is filed with the Registration Office, or the date of the Academic Standards Committee's action. The student is responsible for all assigned course work up to this date. Students indebted to the College at the time of withdrawal will be obligated to fulfill the financial obligation. Extenuating circumstances, such as illness, must be documented and will be reviewed individually . HONORS PROGRAM Graduates of accredited high schools and transfer students who have achieved a grade point average of 3.50 or above have an exciting and challenging opportunity available to them at Allegany College of Maryland. The Allegany College of Maryland Honors Program includes honors-by-contract courses and special activities, such as receptions, conferences, cultural affairs, and travel. Since the Honors Program is not a separate curriculum, the student may major in any Allegany College of Maryland one-year or two-year program and still participate in the Honors Program. Students who are members of the Honors Program and are enrolled in Honors course(s) will be eligible for a reimbursement of one-half of the in-county tuition for that course(s) paid by the Allegany College of Maryland Foundation. Students in the Honors Program are required to complete a minimum of 12 hours of honors courses with a grade of \"B\" or better , must maintain a 3.5 GPA, and must provide three hours of service to the college or the community per semester. Please contact Melody Gaschler, Honors Director, located in Room 182 of the College Center for additional information and application process. NOTE: If total scholarship awards exceed the overall semester cost to attend the college, the Honors Program tuition payment will be reduced and will thus be less than 50% of the in-county semester tuition. DEAN'S LIST To be eligible for the Dean's List, a student must have a semester grade point average of 3.80 or higher for course work totaling 5 or more semester hours. The Dean's List will be divided into full-time and part-time students. To be eligible for the Honors List, a student must have a semester grade point average of 3.30 but less than 3.80 for course work totaling 5 or more semester hours. The Honors List is divided into full-time and part-time students. GRADUATION HONORS Students receiving an associate degree or a certificate under one of the several certificate programs will be graduated Summa Cum Laude if their cumulative grade point average is at least 3.80. Those whose cumulative grade point average is between 3.51 and 3.79, inclusive, will be graduated Magna Cum Laude. Those students whose cumulative grade point average is between 3.30 and 3.50, inclusive, will be graduated Cum Laude. 303 Academic Information CREDITS TRANSFERRED FROM ANOTHER COLLEGE Allegany College of Maryland students attending another college and wishing to transfer credits to Allegany College of Maryland must receive prior written approval from the Registration Office. ATTENDANCE When the number of a student's absences is such that the instructor believes that the student cannot successfully complete the course in the time remaining, the instructor may drop the student from the class roll. If the student is dropped after the tenth week of the course, a grade of \"F\" will be recorded. If the student has registered in an audit status, a grade of \"W\" will be recorded. FINAL EVALUATIONS Every student participates in an end-of-semester final evaluation in each course. Credit usually will not be granted if a student does not participate in the final evaluation program. PROBATIONARY STATUS To be removed from probational status, a full-time student must attain a semester grade point average of at least 1.75. Part-time students will continue on probation until they have earned 12 credit hours. If at that point the grade point average for those 12 credit hours is 1.75 or above, the student will be removed from probationary status. If the average is below 1.75, the student will be suspended. A student's probational status will not be changed by grades in course work taken at another college or university . SUSPENSION FOR POOR SCHOLARSHIP A student on probation will be suspended from the College after attempting 12 credit hours when the semester grade point average falls below 1.75 and the cumulative grade point average falls below 1.90. REPEATED COURSES Students may repeat courses up to three times for credit, except in specific programs where noted. If a student repeats a course, only the later grade shall be applied toward credits earned or in determining grade point averages. However, the earlier grade and record shall remain listed on the student's permanent transcript and shall be included in all transcripts of credits. \"W\" and \"R\" grades will not be used to replace grades of \"D\", \"F\", or \"X\" earned in previous attempts. To receive quality points for any course previously taken at Allegany College of Maryland, that course must be repeated and passed at this institution. For Student Financial Aid the Department of Education regulations state that federal student aid funds can only be used to pay for one repeat of a previously passed course. Successful completion includes grades of \"D\" and above. This regulation must be followed even though our academic policy noted above allows some courses to be repeated for credit up to 3 times. Failed classes which are repeated will be paid for indefinitely. STUDENT RESIDENCY CLASSIFICATIONS FOR TUITION PURPOSES \"Residency\" is a legal designation that dictates the tuition that shall be charged to an individual credit student. Residency shall be designated for each full time, part time, and dually enrolled student. Each Allegany College of Maryland student shall have one residency classification. 304 Academic Information Allegany College of Maryland shall classify each incoming student as in-county, out-of-county, or out-of state for tuition purposes and shall create a process whereby the student may request a change in residency classification or appeal a current classification. This classification and process shall fully comply with the Annotated Code of Maryland and COMAR (including terms and definitions where applicable). Students who are under the age of eighteen years or who are financially dependent upon another person shall be classified in accordance with the residency of the parent, legal guardian, or person upon whom he/she is financially dependent. This policy applies to all Allegany College of Maryland students regardless of either campus or instruction site the student primarily attends. A student's residency shall be classified upon enrollment at Allegany College of Maryland by the Of fice of Admission and Registration; this classification shall be determined using information provided by the student on his/her admissions application. This classification upon enrollment creates a rebuttable presumption, and the classification remains in effect as long as the student remains enrolled at the College unless/until the student's domicile changes. If the student disagrees with the classification or if the student's domicile changes, the student may petition for a change in residency and has the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the classification is inaccurate. Petitions to change the residency classification shall be made to the Office of Student and Legal Affairs and must be submitted before the end of the semester for which the change is requested; the student shall be required to submit the necessary documentation with the petition to change residency. To be eligible for a change in residency, the student must satisfy the following criteria: 1.) That the student's domicile or the domicile of the person upon whom the student is financially dependent is located in the locality being claimed; and 2.) That the student or the person upon whom the student is financially dependent has maintained this domicile for three months prior to the start of the semester for which the change is requested; unless 3.) The student or the person upon whom the student is financially dependent qualifies for an exception or special provision. After reviewing all the information and any documents provided by the student, the Dean of Student and Legal Affairs shall determine whether the residency criteria being requested has been met; the decision shall be made in writing and communicated to the student in person, in writing, or electronically. Any student who wishes to appeal this decision may petition the Student Services Appeal Committee via existing committee procedures; the committee's decision is final. Any student who provides incomplete, false, and/or misleading information related to residency may have his/her residency classification reverted to its original classification and may be subject to disciplinary action pursuant to the Code of Student Conduct. If a reduced tuition rate was obtained as a result of the incomplete, false, and/or misleading information provided, the College reserves the right to retroactively adjust the correct tuition rate for each semester af fected. The Offices of Admissions and Registration and Student and Legal Affairs shall create procedures to implement this policy as it applies to their specific responsibilities. The procedures must be consistent, and all residency determinations must be documented and stored for no less than five years. Students are required to notify the College of any address change. The definitions noted below apply to this policy. Definitions DOMICILE is a student's permanent place of abode, where physical presence and possessions are maintained with the intention of remaining indefinitely, or the permanent place of abode of any person or persons contributing more than \u00bd of the students financial support during the most recently completed year .

RELEASE OF INFORMATION REGARDING STUDENTS The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Policy (The following policy is applicable to all Allegany College of Maryland faculty and staff) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student educational records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds from the U.S. Department of Education. As implied by the title, FERPA requires schools to protect the privacy andaccess rights of students regarding their educational records. There are limitations on what information a school may disclose and mandates on when students may inspect, review, and seek to amend their own records. Since many FERPA terms are broad in nature and can be subject to interpretation, the President' s Staff, with input from faculty and staff, has defined these terms as they will pertain to Allegany College of Maryland, and has identified and addressed how all college faculty and staff should respond in certain situations. Institutional Definitions DIRECTORY INFORMATION - Directory information is information that can be disclosed about a student and includes the following: student name, address, field of study , degree/awards, and full-or part-time status. Address will only be disclosed when circumstances warrant it. This policy adds address to \"directory information\". (NOTE: The fact that this information can be disclosed does not require the College to do so.) EDUCATIONAL RECORD - Education records are all records that are directly related to a student and are maintained by an educational agency , an institution, or a party acting for the agency or institution. EMERGENCY - Emergency is any incident that poses a health risk or threat of imminent danger, physical violence, or intimidation. ENROLLED STUDENT - A student is considered to be \"enrolled\" once the student has processed the registration forms and the schedule is either provided to the student or made available to him/her online. While applicant information is not protected by FERP A, the College will not release it without proper authority. Designated Institutional Contacts FERPA questions should be directed to the Director of Admissions and Registration. If he/she is unavailable, the Associate Registrar should be the contact. In Pennsylvania, the Coordinator of Academic Services is the contact. If necessary, the Dean of Student & Legal Affairs may be consulted for responses to legal questions. 307 Academic Information The Student Services Appeals Committee will hear student complaints and petitions to amend educational records. Disclosure of Student Information Educational records are \"owned\" by the student when he/she turns 18 or enrolls in college. However , grades may be disclosed to parents of dependent students only after written verification of dependency status has been obtained from the parents; i.e., copy of the 1040 federal tax return or signed release form obtained from the Admissions/ Registration Office. When an inquiry about a student is made by a faculty/staff member, the person who has the information should disclose that information only after assessing the request and determining its legitimacy as a \"need to know .\" The \"holder\" of the information will make that determination. Student information should not be disclosed over the phone to the students' family members or others, since one cannot be sure with whom he/she is actually speaking. Maintenance of Student Records Grades, rosters, and disciplinary records are kept indefinitely. All other centralized institutional records should be kept for five (5) years. Individual departments should establish their own policies for the length of time students records are to be kept. Alumni Educational records of alumni are subject to FERPA regulations. Anything that occurs after graduation is considered directory information and, thus, not covered under FERP A. Emergency Situations and/or Disclosure of Information to Law Enforcement Information regarding health/safety emergencies may be disclosed without consent, with emergency being defined as stated above. In the event of an on-campus emergency,* the College may call the emergency contact, as this information is provided at registration time. *Or emergency that occurs off-campus during/associated with a college-sponsored activity. If a crime or threatening situation occurs on campus, (eg., fight or breaking and entering) and a College employee calls the authorities or agrees with a non-employee's decision to call the authorities, then the College will provide requested information to the police. Requests for information will be honored within 24-hours of the call. If the investigation is on-going, requiring longer than a 24-hour period, then the concern is not as urgent, and the College will not release student information without a properly issued subpoena or court order. If a law officer comes to the campus to locate a student, the officer must present a subpoena to the Director of Admissions/Registration or designee, if the incident for which he is seeking the student occurred off-campus and/or is not an emergency to us (see emergency definition above). Approved 3/06 308 Academic Information Policy Statement on the Release and Confidentiality of Student Records Allegany College of Maryland affirms that a student's official educational records are confidential matters.

To help accomplish this, Maryland's public colleges and universities follow certain statewide policies. Several of the key policies are: Maryland community college students who have completed the associate degree or students who have completed 56 semester hours of credit with a cumulative grade point average (GP A) of 2.0 or higher on a scale of 4.0 shall not be denied direct transfer to a Maryland public four-year institution, unless the number of students seeking admission exceeds the number that can be accommodated. Courses taken at a Maryland community college as part of a recommended transfer program will ordinarily be applicable to related programs at a Maryland public institution granting the baccalaureate degree. The General Education Program a student takes at one public college or university will transfer without further review to another public institution without the need for a course-to-course match. That is, courses that are designated as general education by a sending institution will transfer as general education even if the receiving institution does not of fer that specific course or has not designated that course as general education. Courses designated as meeting the general education requirements at any Maryland public college shall be applicable to the general education requirements at any other Maryland public college or university . Credit earned in or transferred from an associate degree-granting institution shall be limited to approximately one-half the baccalaureate degree program requirement, not to exceed 70 credits, and to the first two years of the undergraduate educational experience. Steps to a Successful Transfer 1. Seek advice on transfer from your academic advisor or campus transfer coordinator during your first semester or as soon as possible after earning 15 credits. (See \"What A T ransfer Coordinator Can Do For You!\") 2. Choose as early as possible the institution to which you wish to transfer and your intended major program. 3. Make use of ARTSYS, a computerized method of determining the transferability of your courses to your intended transfer institution. Check out the transferability of your courses before registration, not after . (See \"ARTSYS, An Electronic Tool for Transfer Students\") 4. Map out your course work in accord with the recommended transfer program you and your advisor find in ARTSYS or in other resources. 5. Become familiar with Maryland's regulations on General Education and Transfer. These are printed in all college catalogs and/or student handbooks. 6. Determine transfer application and admissions procedures and deadlines of your intended transfer institution. Each institution sets its own deadlines for application, admissions, housing, financial aid and scholarships. So, the sooner you apply , the greater your options will be. 7. Be aware that courses and program requirements may change as colleges attempt to keep their programs current. Therefore, be sure to consult frequently with your advisor and transfer coordinator due to potential changes in courses and program requirements.

Through the office of Student and Legal Affairs, students obtain valuable services, participate in extracurricular activities, discover their leadership potential, and receive professional support in dealing with personal problems. STUDENT GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION At Allegany College of Maryland, the Student Government Association (SGA) functions as the governing organization of the student body. It serves as a means of participation in College 318 Student Affairs and Services governance with the faculty and administration, and it acts on behalf of the students. Additionally, SGA allocates student activity funds, supervises elections, coordinates campus social activities, and approves new campus student organizations. Any student of Allegany College of Maryland who plans to seek office or serve on the Student Government Association must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.0. In addition, a minimum of six hours of credit instruction must be attempted and successfully completed each semester in order to serve. Students attending our Bedford Campus may serve on the Student Council at that campus. Interested students should contact the Student Services of fice for more information. A student on academic probation may not hold appointive or elective offices in any student organization. During the period of probation and unless the grade point average was at least 1.50 for the preceding semester , a student may not perform any task in an extracurricular activity which requires more than three hours during any one week. A person on non-academic probation (social probation) may attend but may not practice or participate in college-sponsored functions, intramurals, or intercollegiate athletics. He or she may not hold appointive or elective of fices in any student organization and will have his or her membership in clubs suspended as specified by the Student Government Association. STUDENT GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Any student who has a grievance against the College must be able to communicate the complaint with confidence that it will be heard and acted upon appropriately - without risk of retaliation. Information on the College's grievance policies and procedures for students and which office(s) a student may contact to file a complaint can be found in the \"Student Handbook\". A copy is available through the Office of the Dean of Student and Legal Affairs, Bedford Campus Student Services Office, and on the College's website under \"Student Affairs\". STUDENT HEALTH CARE While Allegany College of Maryland offers a variety of resources related to student health/wellness, the College does not offer a clinic or other on-campus health care. Students are encouraged to use the many off-campus medical facilities - including the Western Maryland Regional Medical Center located across the street from the Cumberland Campus. Student and Legal Affairs maintains a list of local emergency and urgent medical care providers. Student and Legal Affairs stock multiple first aid kits on campus; additionally, the College has multiple Automated External Defibrillators (AED) on campus, and many College employees have been trained in their use. For mental health needs, see Counseling Services in this section. STUDENT LIFE Participation in extracurricular activities encourages personal growth, develops leadership skills, widens social circles, and enhances resumes. Student Life offers a variety of extracurricular opportunities from the Student Government Association to clubs/organizations, recreational events, special interest programs diversity, more. The Student Life program is developed according to student interest and available resources. STUDENT PHOTO IDENTIFICATION (ID) CARDS All students are strongly encouraged to obtain a College photo ID card since the cards are necessary to access many student services and benefits. For access to student activities, sporting events, testing services, etc., a College photo ID card will be required. State law also requires any person on a college campus to possess (and display upon request) a form of photo identification. Willowbrook Woods residents are required to carry their distinctive housing ID 319 Student Affairs and Services cards at all times as an essential security measure, and any guest to Willowbrook Woods must have a form of photo identification. Credit students may obtain an Allegany College of Maryland photo ID card in the Photo ID office on the Cumberland campus during posted hours or by contacting the Director of Student Life at eyokum@allegany.edu. At the beginning of the fall and spring semesters, photo ID services are available at both campuses. TURNING POINT PROGRAM The Turning Point program provides services for non-traditional student learners as they begin their journey into college. Non-traditional learners are adult students who have been out of school for a time, are parents, military veterans, dislocated workers, or GED recipients. Support is provided through the Academic Access and Resource Coordinator. The coordinator recognizes that non-traditional students have different needs than students coming straight from high school and that taking college courses after being away from school for a time can be intimidating. Services provided include general support and advising, career exploration, mentoring, community referrals, and advocacy. The Academic Access and Resource Coordinator is located in the Humanities Building, room 51, on the Cumberland campus. VETERANS' AFFAIRS Veterans, veterans' widows, and war orphans should contact the Veterans' Officer for information and assistance related to educational benefits to which they are entitled under public law. Assistance may be obtained regarding the appropriate channels through which problems unique to veterans may be approached and rectified. The Veterans' Officer is located in the Registration Office in the College Center and can be reached at 301-784-5209. 320 Board of Trustees, Administration, Faculty and Staff Faculty and Staff - Board of Trustees, Full-Time Faculty THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES Kim B.
