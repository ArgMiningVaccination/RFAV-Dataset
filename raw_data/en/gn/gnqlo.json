Finally, the addition of Menthol Crystals and Eucalyptus Oil support healthy lung function and respiration. Immuno-Blast Ingredients Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) Astragalus is one of Chinese medicines classic immunoregulatory herbs. It is a warm, heavy and sweet root that is quickly absorbed by the body much like it's sister Ayurvedic herb, Ashwagandha.(3) Studies suggest that astragalus activates an immune macrophage response as its primary means of supporting a strong and healthy immune response. (3) Maitake and Shiitake Mushrooms: One study evaluated maitake and shiitake mushroom glycans for their immune supportive potential. They found significant stimulation of immune defense reaction with a maitake-shiitake combination, with maitake alone being the strongest, followed by shiitake. The study concluded that short term oral dosages of natural immunomodulating glucans from maitake and shiitake mushrooms strongly support a heathy immune response in both the cellular and humoral branches of the immune system.(1) Echinacea angustifolia Echinacea angustifolia is one of the west's most reliable immune tonics that has been used as a first defense immune response agent for centuries. Echinacea angustifolia has been found to be a wide-spectrum immunomodulator that modulates both innate and (Forsythiae fructus) Forsythia Fruit (Forsythiae fructus) has been used for thousands of years in Chinese medicine to support a healthy immune response. Forsythia is a heat clearing and detoxifying herb that was classically used in times of immune challenges.(8) Honeysuckle Flower (Lonicera Japonica) Honeysuckle flower has been effectively used as a heat clearing, lymphatic moving immune supportive herb.(9,14,15) Isatis Root Isatis root is a polysaccharide rich root that is used mostly in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine for immune support (7) Colloidial Silver (15ppm) Silver products have been used for thousands of years for hygiene and immune supportive agents. Studies suggest that silver is non toxic and may support a healthy immune response in three ways. Silver cations can form pores in the cell wall, enter the cells and support an immune response once inside the cells of undesirable bacteria. (10) Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) Licorice has been used for thousands of years as an immune stimulating agent. Studies back up the traditional use of licorice to support a healthy immune response. Licorice is a demulcent herb which is therefore kind and gentle once inside the delicate digestive tract. Ayurveda uses licorice as an Anupam or carrier herb to help other herbs in a formula be better absorbed. Studies suggest that one of the mechanisms for licorice's effect on the immune system is through the beneficial effects it has on the lymphatic system (which carries the immune system) and the healthy proliferation of lymphocytes.(6,12,13) Garlic (Allium sativum) Garlic appears to support the functioning of the immune system by stimulating certain cell types, such as macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and eosinophils.(5) Garlic has been found to support the healthy modulation of cytokine secretion, immunoglobulin production, phagocytosis, and macrophage Beta Glucans Beta glucans are naturally occurring polysaccharides or long chains of glucose molecules that make up the cell walls of mushrooms. The healing and immune stimulating properties of mushrooms have been known for thousands of years in Eastern countries. (2) General Disclaimer: [Warning: Keep out of reach of children.
