These include Government Medical Hospital, Srikakulam Andhra Pradesh, remedy 'Immunofree' Life Sciences, and Nutraceutical called 'Reginmune' by Biogetica, are used as a combined method of treatment for moderate COVID-19 positive patients. Herbal treatment of COVID-19 shows exceptional results To ensure accurate results under the same condition, half of the patients in the trial were given natural treatment while the other half underwent conventional treatment prescribed in India for COVID-19 patients. Another unique feature of this trial is that it includes patients as old as 70 years old, with low oxygen saturation and co-morbidities, setting it apart from other trials conducted on natural medicine. When compared to conventional treatment, COVID-19 positive patients given the Ayurvedic remedy showed 20 to 60 per cent better improvement in numerous tests such as C reactive protein, Procalcitonin, D Dimer and RT-PCR for novel coronavirus. Natural treatment with Immunofree and Reginmune also proved more effective at reducing body pain and fatigue. According to the report, about 86.66 per cent of patients undergoing the natural treatment tested negative for the virus on day 5, as opposed to 60 per cent of patients undergoing conventional treatments. On the 10th day test, all patients tested negative. Moreover, no patients' condition undergoing natural treatment worsened. No one progressed past moderate side-effects, needed ventilators or had any adverse events. COVID-19 mortality rate less in countries that adopted natural treatment Countries and states that have adopted or mandated natural treatment for novel coronavirus have shown mortality rates less than 1/10 of their neighbours, the report states. All reports and results shown by different countries point toward the same outcome. It cited China in the report as well. The mandating of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for treatment for COVID has reportedly worked wonders to stop the outbreak in the region. In India, Goa and Kerala both have 1/10th of the mortality rate of its neighbouring states. African countries that adopted COVID Organics, namely Madagascar, Central African Republic, Ghana and others have seen tremendous results compared to other African countries that did not adopt natural treatment. The common factor is that all these well-performing regions were using a contained in Immunofree, which has a total of 15 ingredients. This is one of the first studies proving the effectiveness of natural medicine in treating COVID. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also endorsed a clinical trial protocol for COVID natural medicines. Therefore, the interim report suggested that India should also mandate the use of these herbal medicines to treat the novel coronavirus. \"It is a matter of great pride for India that our ancient sciences are coming to the forefront with this new empirical evidence and showing the importance of Ayurveda in the pandemic,\" IANS quoted Biogetica founder Apurve Mehra as saying. The team is now approaching AYUSH and ICMR to get this remedy listed as the first herbal treatment of COVID-19 in India, added Wockhardt Foundation founder Huzaifa Khorakiwala.
