Price Foundation", "date": "2023-02-03", "cleaned_text": "[ Print post](javascript:window.print()) Once upon a time. . . as some readers may know, I was kindly invited to speak at the 2022 Wise Traditions Conference in Knoxville, Tennessee. I was unable to attend, however, as I was refused entry into the U.S. for not being injected with the Covid jabs. Instead, a little drama ensued at a certain Canada-U.S. land border crossing on my way to Seattle. I was pulled over by the guards and confronted by a heavily bearded, red-headed specimen of the male persuasion in his late forties, who proceeded to interrogate me with suspicious eyes as if I were an unscrupulous smuggler of dangerous contraband, and then angrily stormed outside to search my entire car and luggage with great zeal. As I watched this exceptionally handsome man\u2014there is a silver lining to everything\u2014throw his little tantrum, I felt a mixture of curiosity, amusement and disbelief. Here I was, a sixty-year-old white female, driving a silver Toyota Matrix with a little pink ribbon attached to the antenna so I can find my oh-so-generic car in a parking lot; how much more threatening can it get? Detained for over an hour inside the station, I overheard the other guards, all male, laughing about the various excuses people give for not getting the jabs or not having their documentation with them. Little did they realize that I knew a little secret about the jabs and what the injections might end up doing to the guards' bristling, testosterone-fueled masculinity\u2014but I'm getting ahead of myself. WHAT ARE HORMONES? Hormones are chemical substances released by various endocrine glands in the body, which help to control and coordinate many bodily functions. Both our nervous system and hormonal systems are required to maintain an internal environment necessary for survival, including such niceties as body temperature, blood glucose levels and reproductive function. The glands involved in controlling these and many other functions include the hypothalamus, pineal, pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, adrenals, pancreas, ovaries and testes. These glands communicate with each other as well as with all our organs and cells in very complex and beautiful ways, not unlike musicians playing in a symphony orchestra, who listen carefully to each other but also are guided by a conductor. Now, you may ask, where is the \"conductor\" in our body? In homeopathy, we would think of the vital force\u2014the invisible life force or energy field\u2014as the conductor. Homeopathic remedies always address this vital force, rather than any particular condition. However, hormonal imbalances can be part of distinctive symptom patterns, which can point to many fascinating homeopathic remedies. For the purposes of this article, I will mainly focus on imbalances involving the reproductive system, including premenstrual syndrome (PMS), abnormal menstrual cycles, menopause, masculinity\u2014and the lack thereof\u2014and the controversial topic of gender confusion or dysphoria. HORMONAL IMBALANCES Several factors can have a negative impact on the delicate balance of our endocrine system, including environmental and natural toxins, nutritional factors and stress. Many chemicals, called endocrine disruptors, may mimic or interfere with the body's endocrine system. They include ingredients used in plastics, such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, as well as dioxins, used in the production of herbicides and in paper bleaching, flame retardants, polychlorinated bisphenols, medications and more. These chemicals may contribute to reproductive impairment, including infertility, cognitive deficits, cancer and other negative effects.1-4 Moreover, through epigenetic mechanisms, these environmental toxins may have transgenerational influence,5,6 which may be contributing to human sperm counts falling by over 50 percent worldwide over the past fifty years.7 More recently, researchers have linked spike protein from coronavirus disease and the mRNA injections to endocrine damage in both men and women, including abnormal bleeding, miscarriages and infertility.8-10 Women are about 50 percent more likely to suffer from anxiety and mood disorders between puberty and menopause, and estrogen has been widely studied as being a contributing factor through its effects on neural circuits, neurotransmitter levels and the endocannabinoid system.11 Stress can affect hormonal balance and lead to disruption of the normal menstrual cycle.12,13 Prolonged exposure to stress can lead to complete reproductive impairment with loss of ovulation and menstruation.14 SEPIA OFFICINALIS The finding that homeopathic remedies could be helpful in addressing hormonal concerns dates back to the discoveries of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), the founder of homeopathy. He had an artist friend who was quite unwell and unresponsive to the remedies the good doctor had already tried. One day during a visit, Hahnemann observed his friend dipping a paintbrush into some sepia ink (the ink of the cuttlefish) and then shaping the brush to a point with his lips. In a flash, Hahnemann wondered if the ink was inadvertently poisoning his brush-sucking friend; he proceeded to make a remedy from the inky juice and cured his friend\u2014and the extremely valuable homeopathic remedy Sepia was born.15 Sepia is a fascinating remedy with a strong affinity for the hormonal system, and especially malfunctions caused by overwork and exhaustion. It is predominantly a female remedy and may be needed after hormonal changes such as following childbirth and during menopause. Working women with young children who have become worn out and irritable from lack of sleep and too much responsibility are prime prospects for this remedy. The woman's PMS is out of control, her kids are too much, her husband has become just another annoying kid whose head she wants to bite off\u2014and forget about sex; her libido is gone, and she does not want to be touched. Her mood may be as black and gloomy as the squid ink. The shimmering play of healthy emotions and creativity has been lost to emotional flatness and indifference, and during her period she may feel as if her uterus might fall out. She often feels better from hard exercise or dancing. Sepia can return a mother to her children and a wife to her husband. In men, Sepia may be indicated for similar states\u2014a general flatness, burnout with irritability, lack of motivation as well as low libido and possibly impotence. LACHESIS MUTUS Lachesis mutus, made from the venom of the giant South American bushmaster snake, is another fascinating homeopathic remedy with a colorful history. Constantine Hering, a student of Hahnemann's, became interested in venom remedies as potential armaments against rabies. While stationed in Surinam, South America, he obtained an injured bushmaster snake, fearlessly milked its venom onto some milk sugar and prepared it into a homeopathic remedy. During the process, he accidentally inhaled some of the powder and fell into fever with delirium and manic excitement. He woke up the next morning feeling lucky to be alive. He immediately asked his wife: \"What did I say and do?\" As his faithful collaborator, she had taken excellent notes during that fateful night, which then gave us another wonderful homeopathic remedy, Lachesis! Intolerance to tight clothing around the neck is one of the important symptoms of this remedy. For the rest of his life, Hering could not tolerate tight collars. Lachesis is almost the opposite of Sepia. Whereas Sepia is cold and lethargic, Lachesis is hot and excitable with intense emotions and smoldering sexuality. The Netflix series Love Is Blind: Brazil reminds me of Lachesis, with the contestants showing plenty of physical assets, dripping with bling, covered in tattoos, intertwining tongues at the least provocation; you get the idea! Persons requiring the Lachesis remedy may suffer from abnormal uterine bleeding, spotting, hot flashes during menopause and heart palpitations. Left-sided ovarian pain and ovarian cysts may point to Lachesis as well. This can be a good remedy for women with abnormal bleeding associated with the Covid vaccines. Other snake venom remedies may also be helpful for abnormal bleeding associated with Covid injections, as covered in a previous article of mine.16 Individuals taking Lachesis may be redheaded, and the remedy can also be associated with competition, jealousy, suspicion and even paranoia (maybe my overly suspicious, redheaded border guard needed it!). It may be indicated for hormonal turmoil caused by feeling threatened by a younger, prettier or more accomplished rival. The person wants attention and can become quite manipulative and even cunning, wielding sharp words to inject venom. They may use mockery, sarcasm and ridicule with great proficiency. The comedian Russell Peters personifies Lachesis to me. He literally makes a living by insulting his audience; it is both hilarious and disturbing to watch. PULSATILLA NIGRICANS Pulsatilla is yet another remedy with a profound affinity for the hormonal system. The remedy is prepared from the windflower, also known as meadow anemone or pasque flower. The name windflower suggests changeability, which is a prominent characteristic of Pulsatilla symptoms in addition to softness. It is primarily a feminine remedy, but when a man needs Pulsatilla, he is generally a more soft and gentle individual. The person may be easily moved to tears and prone to feeling abandoned. Research has shown that women are about twice as sensitive to feeling abandoned as men,17 which may be one reason this remedy is often helpful for premenstrual symptoms as well as for problems during and after pregnancy, when a woman may feel more vulnerable and more in need of support. She may weep easily and desire reassurance. She is open, malleable and easily influenced. In Caucasians, blonde hair and blue eyes may be more common for this type. Pulsatilla is one of the main remedies for almost all forms of menstrual problems, from PMS and menstrual cramps to pregnancy-related disorders to menopausal hot flashes. The woman may be fond of creamy foods, butter, whipped cream and cheese, as well as ice cream and other cold foods. She may develop indigestion from fatty foods and pork. FOLLICULINUM A few months ago, I was contacted by the mother of a thirteen-year-old boy because he had developed a condition known as gynecomastia, the development of breasts in a male. This is usually due to a hormone imbalance between estrogens and androgens. It is most common in older, obese men because testosterone can be converted to estrone, a weak estrogen, in adipose tissue. That potbelly does more than stretch t-shirts; it also helps to grow breasts! Of course, that extra estrogen also reduces libido and may induce impotence. The boy's mom was a student of homeopathy and had already tried a few remedies with moderate success. The buds had retreated but reappeared a couple of times. Then she told me about the mood swings this young man had in addition to the breast buds, and I asked: \"Have you ever taken the birth control pill?\" Yes, the mom had taken the pill for about ten years before conceiving her son. This history made me think of the homeopathic remedy Folliculinum, which is made from oestrone, a synthetic form of estrogen. Her son took it, and the breast buds as well as the mood swings quickly resolved. Synthetic hormones were discovered in the late 1930s, and by June 1961, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved oral contraceptives for human use.18 Since then, hundreds of millions of women around the world have taken the pill, with many adverse effects on their bodies, their children's bodies and the environment. Oral contraceptives work by suppressing ovulation, so that eggs are not released to be fertilized. The body is tricked into feeling that it is pregnant. Folliculinum may be useful for many symptoms between ovulation and menses, including PMS with huge mood swings and excessive noise sensitivity, irritability, breast tenderness, nausea and headaches.19 There may also be pain and discomfort around ovulation, spotting, ovarian cysts and polycystic ovaries. Changes after being on the pill may be relieved with Folliculinum, such as the cycle not returning to normal and difficulty conceiving after being on the pill. Folliculinum also can be helpful for women who have suffered at the hands of dominating or abusive parents or partners. There may be mental confusion with an inability to make decisions. These states are not surprising when we consider what artificial hormones are doing to the body\u2014suppressing normal function and causing confusion. \"Am I pregnant or not?\" \"Am I a woman or not?\" \"Why is no baby coming?\" A recent study examined how being on hormonal contraceptives affected the level of stress perceived by women during the Covid \"pandemic.\" Interestingly, women who were taking oral contraceptives during that time\u2014or even those who had taken them in the past\u2014reported increased distress during the pandemic relative to naturally cycling women and men.20 Could the dominating and suppressive effects of both the hormonal contraceptives and the world situation have been synergistic? And could gender confusion and dysphoria be related to the use of oral contraceptives in the person's ancestors, and/or perhaps related to residual effects of oral contraceptives in our water supply? If fish are any indication, the answer may be yes. Several reports have described intersex fish in waterways downstream from sewage treatment plants but not upstream.21 This is a conversation that needs to take place. And maybe children affected by gender dysphoria or confusion would benefit from Folliculinum before their bodies are permanently rearranged with more artificial hormones and surgery. Melissa Assilem, a well-known homeopath who wrote extensively about Folliculinum, stated: \"I have used Folliculinum with both girls and boys in their teenage years where the symptoms were feeling drained, slow and unable to identify with their selfhood.\" Assilem further observed: \"People who need it have no sense of personal authority and have never learned to say 'no.' They feel someone else is in control. Folliculinum can break the controlling link.\"22 This may be an important remedy for our time. SILICA Silica is a homeopathic remedy derived from silicon dioxide, found in nature as quartz, flint, sandstone and many other minerals. Silicon is the most abundant of all the elements in the Earth's crust, next to oxygen. Silica as a homeopathic remedy is often used after vaccination as it can help to remove foreign substances from the body. Jeremy Sherr, a well-known homeopath, has reported very positive results from using Silica post-mRNA injections.23 A friend of mine told me that he had developed heavy perspiration from the slightest effort since taking his two Covid injections and a booster more than a year ago. In addition, somewhat embarrassed, he confessed that his testicles had shrunk significantly since then. This was not something I had read about anywhere, and despite asking several experts, I could not find any research on the topic. However, Dr. Stephen Malthouse, an outspoken Canadian medical doctor and freedom fighter, kindly provided this input: \"I do not have an article on hand, but the distribution study for Pfizer did show that the mRNA markers went to the testes where the spike proteins would create inflammation. That would account for shrinking of testes, as induration sets in. Histology of cardiac muscle after the shots does show significant fibrosis and loss of normal cells, as well as infiltration with spikes and lymphocyte reactivity in the region.\" Just as the Covid vaccine trials did not monitor women's menstrual changes, men's changes in testicular volume likely were also overlooked. That being said, Silica might be a helpful remedy in this circumstance. To return to the story of the border guards, little did they know that the injections they obviously all took might have been wreaking havoc in their nicely padded pants while they were laughing at me and other Covid jab avoiders. And so, although I don't wish anyone ill, a little mischievous part of me enjoys\u2014just a little, tiny bit\u2014the idea of the shrunken gonads of heavily armed men throwing tantrums that would make a three-year-old blush! SIDEBARS REMEDIES TO CONSIDER FOR HORMONAL IMBALANCES Please note that many other remedies might be indicated in people affected by hormonal imbalances. It is always best to consult a professional homeopath for individualized advice. SEPIA: Worn-out and exhausted from too much responsibility; superwoman, working women with children; too many children or children too close together; low or no libido; aversion to partner; better with hard exercise or dancing; after hormonal changes, childbirth, menopause; uterine prolapse. LACHESIS: left-sided symptoms; left-sided ovarian pain; abnormal uterine bleeding, possibly associated with Covid vaccines; often worse after sleep. FOLLICULINUM: Symptoms between ovulation and menses; pain around ovulation, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); hormonal imbalance after oral contraceptives; any health problems due to oral contraceptives; loss of or lack of sense of self; ailments after domination by parents or partners or political forces. PULSATILLA: Open, soft and malleable types; easily feels abandoned and forsaken; prominent remedy in PMS, menstrual disorders; disorders during pregnancy; may crave creamy foods, butter, ice cream. SILICA: weakened constitution; bad effects of vaccines and other injections; may be helpful for spike protein removal; possibly helpful in hormonal changes due to Covid injections. FDA (MIS)GUIDANCE THREATENS ACCESS TO HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES homeopathychoice.org/write-congress/#/26 In December 2022, the FDA finalized a guidance document categorizing all homeopathic medicines as \"unapproved new drugs\" and therefore \"illegally\" marketed. This does NOT mean that we will be losing access to all homeopathic medicines overnight. However, it DOES mean that the FDA is claiming authority\u2014for the first time and through a policy document\u2014that the agency can remove homeopathic medicines from the market at any time without notice. Americans for Homeopathy Choice is pushing back! They have built a fantastic grassroots team\u2014Homeopathy Action Team (HAT)\u2014which is building relationships with members of Congress. Their goal is to introduce and pass a bill that will protect our long-term access to homeopathic medicines. Please consider signing up for their email and text alerts so that you can join the HAT team and get any important action alerts.
