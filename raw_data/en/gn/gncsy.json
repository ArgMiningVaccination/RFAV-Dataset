Having been a former naturopathic \"doctor,\" I can say that the overwhelming majority of naturopathic care relies extensively on dubious alternative therapies, rather than established protocols based on medical and scientific research. When it comes to naturopathy, \"nature\" always trumps the oath to do no harm. Join me for a deconstruction of naturopathy's defining principles and what to do about the growing trend of natural medicine. Britt Hermes is a writer, scientist, and a former naturopathic doctor. She practiced as a licensed naturopath in the United States for three years and then left the profession after realizing naturopathy is a pseudoscientific ideology. She now writes to expose issues with naturopathy, the current rising profession in alternative medicine.
