The complete streets policy is to require the consideration and implementation of design elements and infrastructure improvement projects that promote the ability persons with diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities to travel independently. The bill also requires the department, as part of the complete streets policy, to develop universal design concepts that advance the mobility options for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities and individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The department is to develop guidance and policies for the means by which the universal design concepts are to be incorporated into the planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation of new and rehabilitated public highways and public transportation projects. The department is required to encourage regional and local entities that apply for funding through the local aid program to adopt a complete streets policy consistent with the bill. ||In Committee | | |[A315](/billdetail/1419852) |Requires professional boards to issue licenses for veterans with good standing license or certification in another jurisdiction under certain circumstances. || This bill requires professional and occupational boards to issue a license, certificate, or certification to any applicant who received a license and equivalent training, education, or experience while serving or after serving as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States. The person applying for the license, certificate, or certification could have obtained a license and training, education, or experience during or outside of the person's military service. The bill requires a professional and occupational board to issue a license, certificate, or certification to an applicant who presents evidence to the board that: (1) the applicant was honorably discharged from active military service; (2) the applicant's license, certificate, or certification is in good standing in another jurisdiction; and (3) the applicant complies with all other requirements for licensure, including a requirement for examination. The bill also requires each board to provide methods of evaluating equivalent training, education, or experience obtained towards meeting the requirements for the issuance of a license, certificate, or certification. However, no method of evaluation shall operate in such a manner as to require the same number of hours of experience by the applicant. This bill provides reciprocity for veterans with a license, certificate, or certification issued by another jurisdiction. Veterans with these credentials face barriers to entering the job market since occupational licenses are not necessarily portable due to different standards required by individual states; however, often times, a veteran's training, education, and experience as a licensed professional in another state is valuable and transferable. This bill would help veterans licensed in another jurisdiction to obtain their license in New Jersey and more easily find or keep employment in this State. ||In Committee | | |[A1498](/billdetail/1419871) |Prohibits late penalties from being made against senior citizen tenants in certain senior citizen rental housing in certain circumstances. ||Prohibits late penalties from being made against senior citizen tenants in certain senior citizen rental housing in certain circumstances. ||Crossed Over | | |[A1179](/billdetail/1419908) |Requires firearm owners who become New Jersey residents to obtain firearm purchaser identification card and register handguns acquired out-of-State. || This bill requires firearm owners who move to New Jersey to obtain a firearm purchaser identification card (FPIC) and register their firearm within 60 days of residing in this State. Under current law, a person who purchases a firearm in this State is required to display an FPIC, which identifies the card holder as a person who meets the statutory qualifications to purchase a firearm in this State. A person who legally owned a firearm while residing in another state and then moves to New Jersey is not required to obtain an FPIC. This bill requires a firearm owner who becomes a resident of this State to obtain an FPIC and register his or her firearm. In order to register the firearm, a person would be required to submit to the municipal law enforcement agency or the State Police a registration statement that provides the person's name and address and the make, model, and serial number of the firearm being registered. Under the bill, the Superintendent of State Police is required to prepare the form of registration statement and provide a suitable supply of statements to each organized full-time municipal police department and each State Police station within 60 days prior to the bill's enactment. ||In Committee | | |[A1519](/billdetail/1419938) |Concerns discriminatory appraisals of residential property on basis of race or national origin. || This bill concerns discriminatory appraisals of residential property on the basis of race or national origin. Under this bill, holders of appraisal licenses or certifications, or appraisal management company registrations, may have their licenses, certifications or registrations revoked or suspended, or be subject to fines, if the board determines, after an appropriate investigation, that the holder of the license, certification or registration has knowingly engaged in a discriminatory appraisal of a residential property on the basis of the property buyer or property seller's race, creed, color, or national origin. If the board finds cause to suspend, revoke or fine a holder of a license, certification or registration, then the board is required to notify the holder of the board's rationale in writing. The board must also provide opportunity for a hearing to be held in accordance with the State's Administrative Procedure Act. Additionally, prior to the initiation of a residential property appraisal, a holder of a license, certification or registration is to provide a property seller with a document, in a form and manner prescribed by the New Jersey Real Estate Appraiser Board, informing the property seller of the opportunity to report, through the Division of Consumer Affairs' website or telephone number, any suspicion of a discriminatory appraisal by the holder of a license, certification or registration on the basis of a property buyer or seller's race, creed, color, or national origin.

Information literacy includes digital, visual, media, textual, and technological literacy. The bill directs the Commissioner of Education, in consultation with the New Jersey State Librarian, to develop curriculum guidelines on information literacy to be used by school districts. The guidelines will provide for a sequential course of study for each of the grades kindergarten through 12 and must include, at a minimum, the following: (1) knowledge of the research process and how information is created and produced; (2) skills in using information resources and critical thinking about those resources; (3) the abilities to evaluate information critically and competently, to recognize relevant primary and secondary information, and to distinguish among facts, points of view, and opinions; (4) access to information and information tools; and (5) an understanding of economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and how to use information ethically and legally. The guidelines also will include model instructional units, define learning objectives, and recommend suitable instructional materials. The guidelines will be reviewed annually and updated as appropriate. In addition, the bill requires the commissioner, in consultation with the State Librarian, to establish in-service training programs on information literacy instruction for school administrators, certified school library media specialists, and the teaching staff members who will provide the instruction on information literacy in each grade. The in-service training programs will provide the opportunity for collaboration among teachers and school library media specialists to advance information literacy in the kindergarten through grade 12 curriculum. Under the bill, the commissioner, in consultation with the State Librarian, will develop a system for evaluating the effectiveness of instructional programs on information literacy established by school districts pursuant to the bill's provisions. The commissioner will make programs that are shown to be effective available as model programs to other school districts throughout the State. Finally, the bill requires that teacher preparation programs and alternate route programs for a New Jersey instructional certificate incorporate programming on the subject of information literacy. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1198](/billdetail/1420667) |Establishes limits on transcript release restrictions at institutions of higher education and certain proprietary institutions. || This bill prohibits institutions of higher education and certain proprietary institutions from withholding a student's transcript due to an outstanding balance on the student's account. This bill prohibits an institution, due to an outstanding balance on a current or former student's account, from: \u00b7 refusing to provide a transcript for a current or former student on the grounds that the student owes a debt; \u00b7 conditioning the provision of a transcript on the payment of a debt, other than a fee charged to provide the transcript; \u00b7 charging a higher fee for obtaining a transcript, or provide less favorable treatment of a transcript request because a current or former student owes a debt; or \u00b7 using transcript issuance as a tool for debt collection. ||Crossed Over | | |[A993](/billdetail/1420706) |Provides that firearms purchaser identification card is valid for four years; requires training prior to issuance of firearms cards and handgun purchase permits; revises procedures for passing of firearms to heir or legatee. || This bill imposes additional safeguards on the issuance of firearms purchaser identification cards, imposes training requirements, and revises the procedures for an heir or legatee to inherit or receive possession of a firearm. Under current law, a firearms purchaser identification card is valid indefinitely, unless the holder becomes subject to any of the disabilities that disqualify a person for firearms ownership. The bill provides that a firearms purchaser identification card issued or renewed after the bill's effective date would expire during the fourth calendar year following its date of issuance and on the same calendar day as the card holder's date of birth. The holder of a firearms purchaser identification card issued prior to the bill's effective date would expire to within four years of the bill's enactment and on the same calendar day as the card holder's date of birth. The bill further provides that a firearms purchaser identification card may be renewed if the holder is not subject to any of the statutory disabilities and after filing of a renewal application and payment of the required fee. In addition, this bill requires certain applicants for a permit to purchase a handgun or a firearms purchaser identification card to demonstrate that, within four years prior to the date of the application, he or she satisfactorily completed a course of instruction approved by the Superintendent of State Police in the lawful and safe handling and storage of firearms. This provision is not applicable to an active or retired law enforcement officer or a veteran who was honorably discharged as a member of the United States Armed Forces or National Guard and who received substantially equivalent training. A person who obtained a permit to purchase a handgun or firearms purchaser identification card prior to the bill's effective date would not be required to complete a course of instruction. Under current law, a permit to purchase a handgun or a firearms purchaser identification card is not required for the passing of a firearm to an heir or legatee upon the death of the owner, whether the firearm is passed by testamentary bequest or by the laws of intestacy. This bill requires the heir or legatee to possess a permit to purchase a handgun or a firearms purchaser identification card prior to taking possession of the firearm. An administrator or executor of the estate who does not possess a valid firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun is to surrender custody of the firearm within 30 days to the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality in which the decedent resided or, if municipality does not have a police department or force, the superintendent. The chief law enforcement officer or superintendent, as appropriate, would retain custody of the firearm until the heir or legatee obtains a valid permit to purchase a handgun or firearms purchaser identification card. If the heir or legatee does not obtain a permit to purchase a handgun or firearms purchaser identification card, the heir or legatee is required to sell the firearm to a licensed retail dealer of firearms or arrange for the sale of the firearm by the licensed retail dealer. The licensed retail dealer is to provide the heir or legatee with a receipt and record the date of surrender, the name of the heir or legatee, and the serial number, manufacturer, and model of the surrendered firearm. The bill permits an heir or legatee who possesses a valid permit to purchase a handgun or firearms purchaser identification card to take possession of the firearm directly from the administrator or executor of the estate or from the chief law enforcement officer or superintendent, as appropriate, if the heir or legatee files a signed certification as prescribed by the superintendent. The certification would be filed with the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality in which the decedent resided or, if there is no chief law enforcement officer, the superintendent. ||In Committee | | |[A468](/billdetail/1420847) |Requires State agencies to make their websites accessible to people with disabilities and on mobile devices. ||Requires State agencies to make their websites accessible to people with disabilities and on mobile devices. ||Crossed Over | | |[A977](/billdetail/1420987) |Eliminates past conviction of indictable offense as disqualifier for jury service. ||Eliminates past conviction of indictable offense as disqualifier for jury service. ||In Committee | | |[A256](/billdetail/1421036) |Requires certain health care facilities to adopt and implement policies to prevent exposure to surgical smoke via use of smoke evacuation system. ||Requires certain health care facilities to adopt and implement policies to prevent exposure to surgical smoke via use of smoke evacuation system. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[S249](/billdetail/1421075) |Implements certain guidelines concerning purchase of catalytic converters. ||An Act concerning the purchase of catalytic converters and amending and supplementing P.L.2009, c.8. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A664](/billdetail/1421184) |Establishes Second Chance Program in charge of providing opportunities through labor organizations for formerly incarcerated individuals. ||Establishes Second Chance Program in charge of providing opportunities through labor organizations for formerly incarcerated individuals. ||Crossed Over | | |[A1775](/billdetail/1421193) |Requires DCA provide certain information on low-income home energy assistance program, annually update program handbook and issue program request for proposal, and provide quarterly training sessions on administering program. ||Requires DCA provide certain information on low-income home energy assistance program, annually update program handbook and issue program request for proposal, and provide quarterly training sessions on administering program. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1282](/billdetail/1421213) |Requires DEP to develop and implement electric school bus program; provides for $15 million in first year and $15 million annually in subsequent two years to DEP, subject to availability, to provide grants. || This bill requires the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), to develop and implement, a three-year \"Electric School Bus Program\" (program). The purpose of the program is to determine the operational reliability and cost effectiveness of replacing diesel-powered school buses with electric school buses for daily transportation of students. The bill requires the DEP to select no less than six school districts (districts) and school bus contractors (bus contractors) annually for participation in the program, so that during the third year of the program, no less than a total of 18 school districts or school bus contractors are selected for participation in the program amongst the northern, central, and southern regions of the State. At least half of the districts or bus contractors annually selected and at least half of the grant funding is to be located in a \"low-income, urban, or environmental justice community\" as defined pursuant to law. The DEP is to design a transparent outreach and application process to facilitate the selection of districts and bus contractors. The DEP is to use its best efforts to select an equal number of grantees from the northern, central, and southern parts of the State. The DEP is to award grants to districts or bus contractors selected to participate in the program to purchase or lease electric school buses and to purchase or lease and install electric school bus charging infrastructure. An electric school bus and charging infrastructure vendor purchase or lease arrangement is to include certain provisions as described in the bill. Under the bill, $45 million is made available for grants provided under the pilot program. The DEP is to provide $15 million in grants for each year of the three-year pilot program. The DEP may use available monies to provide grants from the following sources: the societal benefits charge (SBC) revenues and the \"Global Warming Solutions Fund.\" The bill requires the districts or bus contractors selected to participate in the program to submit reports to the DEP detailing the cost to operate electric school buses, including electric school bus maintenance records and transponder data, and details of any reliability issues related to the operation of the buses. The DEP is to establish a committee, chaired by a representative of the DEP, which also includes a representative of the BPU and the EDA. The committee is to meet monthly to review the reports and recommend solutions to any issue raised in a quarterly report submitted by a pilot program participant. The committee is to require a recipient of any grant under any State agency-administered program for the provision of an electric school bus and electric school bus charging infrastructure prior to the effective date of the bill to submit any additional information and data to the committee to compliment any data received by the committee from program participants. The bill requires the DEP, in collaboration with the BPU and the EDA, to submit reports to the Governor and Legislature within six months following the conclusion of the program. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A871](/billdetail/1421252) |Creates sexual assault prevention and response program and coordinator in DMVA. || This bill establishes in the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs a sexual assault prevention and response program. The Adjutant General of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs will appoint an individual to serve as the sexual assault prevention coordinator. The coordinator will provide victim advocacy services, including ensuring that victims of sexual assault receive appropriate responsive care, understand available reporting options, and are notified of eligibility for compensation from the Victims of Crime Compensation Office. The coordinator may also file an application with the consent of the victim for a protective order on behalf of the victim. The protective order may be filed at the State level and with the military authorities. The program will permit a victim of sexual harassment to: (1) file a confidential complaint of sexual harassment with the coordinator alleging that a service member committed the offense; (2) participate in the United States Department of Defense Catch a Serial Offender Program; (3) receive notice if the accused service member is subsequently accused of an offense of sexual assault by a service member or another person; and (4) convert a confidential complaint to a formal complaint at any time. An annual report will be submitted to the Legislature and the Governor on the activities of the program and the activities of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs relating to the prevention of sexual assault. The report will include: (1) the policies and procedures implemented by the coordinator and the Adjutant General in response to incidents of sexual assault; (2) an assessment of the implementation and effectiveness of the program and the policies and procedures on the prevention and oversight of and response to sexual assaults; (3) an analysis of the number of sexual assaults involving members of the New Jersey National Guard; (4) deficiencies in the department's sexual assault prevention training; and (5) the department's plans for preventing and responding to sexual assault. The program will apply to alleged sexual assaults committed by a service member against another service member, regardless of whether or not either person was on or off duty at the time of the alleged assault. A complaint may be filed if the alleged offense took place while the accused was a service member and retires or is discharged from service prior to the filing of the complaint. Under the bill, \"service member\" means a member of the United States Armed Forces, or a Reserve component thereof, including the New Jersey National Guard. ||In Committee | | |[A577](/billdetail/1421269) |Directs BPU to establish program concerning renewable natural gas; provides gas public utilities with customer rate recovery mechanism for costs associated with program. || This bill directs the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to establish a program to encourage the procurement of renewable natural gas and investment in renewable natural gas infrastructure by a gas public utility (utility). The bill requires the BPU to adopt a ratemaking mechanism that ensures the recovery of and on all prudently incurred costs made pursuant to the bill. When a utility makes a qualified investment, the costs associated with the qualified investment are to include the cost of capital established in the utility's most recent rate case as well as other incremental costs associated with those qualified investments. The bill requires that when a utility procures renewable natural gas from a third party, the utility is to purchase the renewable natural gas supply at prices and on terms consistent with market conditions in the market for renewable natural gas. A charge assessed to customers for the supply of renewable natural gas is to be regulated by the BPU and be based on the cost to the utility of providing that supply, including the cost of renewable natural gas commodity and capacity, purchased at prices consistent with market conditions in the market for renewable natural gas, and related ancillary and administrative costs. If a utility's total incremental annual cost to meet the requirements of the renewable natural gas program exceeds five percent of the utility's total revenue requirement for an individual year, the utility is no longer authorized to make additional qualified investments under the renewable natural gas program for that year without the approval of the BPU. ||In Committee | | |[A1176](/billdetail/1421297) |Requires institutions of higher education to implement suicide prevention programs and raise awareness of mental health services. ||Requires institutions of higher education to implement suicide prevention programs and raise awareness of mental health services. ||Passed | | |[A938](/billdetail/1421516) |Establishes \"New Jersey Force.\" ||In Committee | | |[A509](/billdetail/1421814) |Increases from 18 to 21 age at which person is eligible to receive firearms purchaser identification. || This bill increases from 18 to 21 the age at which a person is eligible to receive a firearms purchaser identification card used to purchase shotguns and rifles. Under current law, a person 18 years of age and older may obtain a firearms purchaser identification card and a handgun purchaser is required to be at least 21 years old. Under the bill, a person under the age of 21 would be allowed to possess a handgun, rifle, or shot gun in accordance with section 14 of P.L.1979, c.179 (C.2C:58-6) under the following circumstances: (1) in the actual presence or under the direct supervision of a parent or guardian, or some other person who holds a permit to carry a handgun or a firearms purchaser identification card; (2) for the purpose of military drill under the auspices of a legally recognized military organization and under competent supervision; (3) for the purpose of competition, target practice, instruction, and training in and upon a firing range approved by the governing body of the municipality in which the range is located or the National Rifle Association and which is under competent supervision at the time of such supervision or target practice or instruction and training at any location; or (4) for the purpose of hunting during the regularly designated hunting season, provided that the person possesses a valid hunting license and has successfully completed a hunter's safety course taught by a qualified instructor or conservation officer and possesses a certificate indicating the successful completion of such a course. The bill preserves current law allowing minors to obtain a youth hunting license and apprentice firearm hunting license. In addition, the bill allows a person between the ages of 18 and 21 who demonstrates evidence of military service to receive a firearms purchaser identification card. Persons between the ages of 18 and 21 who obtained a firearms purchaser identification card prior to the bill's effective date would be permitted to maintain the card and continue to purchase and possess shotguns and rifles. ||Crossed Over | | |[A179](/billdetail/1421882) |Requires DEP to make certain information regarding water purveyors available on its Internet website. ||An Act concerning public access to information concerning water purveyors and supplementing P.L.2017, c.133 (C.58:31-1 et seq.). ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1884](/billdetail/1421901) |Requires telecommunications, cable television, and Internet service providers to allow service recipients to terminate service contracts following physician's referral to long-term care facility. ||Requires telecommunications, cable television, and Internet service providers to allow service recipients to terminate service contracts following physician's referral to long-term care facility. ||Crossed Over | | |[S287](/billdetail/1421988) |Provides CBT and gross income tax credits for certain deliveries of low carbon concrete and for costs of conducting environmental product declaration analyses of low carbon concrete. ||Provides CBT and gross income tax credits for certain deliveries of low carbon concrete and for costs of conducting environmental product declaration analyses of low carbon concrete. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[AJR36](/billdetail/1422089) |Designates November each year as \"Hospice and Palliative Care Awareness Month.\" ||This joint resolution designates the month of November of each year as \"Hospice and Palliative Care Awareness Month\" in New Jersey to raise public awareness about hospice and palliative care and to encourage the citizens of the State to increase their understanding of supportive, high-quality, end-of-life care before they or members of their families are confronted with a health care crisis or terminal diagnosis. Every year throughout the United States, 1.6 million people living with a terminal diagnosis receive hospice and palliative care, but more can be done to educate members of the public about the benefits of such care. At the center of hospice and palliative care is the belief every person has the right to die pain-free and with dignity. The role of hospice and palliative care workers and volunteers is to provide improved quality of life to patients and caregivers coping with life-limiting illness, and to allow an individual to focus on living as fully as possible even as life draws to a close. The joint resolution requests that the Governor issue an annual proclamation calling upon public officials and the residents of this State to observe \"Hospice and Palliative Care Awareness Month\" with appropriate activities and programs. ||Crossed Over | | |[A1967](/billdetail/1422141) |Revises law prohibiting feeding of black bear. ||Revises law prohibiting feeding of black bear. ||In Committee | | |[S147](/billdetail/1422345) |Requires DOT to implement complete streets policy that considers persons with certain disabilities. ||An Act concerning the Department of Transportation's implementation of a complete streets policy and supplementing Title 27 of the Revised Statutes. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1357](/billdetail/1422502) |Establishes New Jersey Siblings' Bill of Rights. || This bill establishes the \"New Jersey Siblings' Bill of Rights.\" Based on a document drafted by the Department of Children and Families' Youth Council, comprising 24 young New Jerseyans with lived experience in the child welfare system, this bill specifically establishes the following rights for siblings who have been placed in a resource family or a congregate care settings: to be placed with siblings when possible and in the best interests of all siblings placed together, including placement together in congregate care settings when possible; to be placed in the closest proximity possible to other siblings who are not in out-of-home placement or if placement together is not possible, when it is in the best interests of the child; to be allowed to participate in the permanency planning decisions of their siblings, as age and developmentally appropriate, and to have their recommendations and wishes in this regard documented in the case record, in the words written or otherwise expressed by the sibling when possible; to know or be made aware of expectations for continued contact with their siblings after an adoption or transfer of permanent physical and legal custody to a relative; to be promptly informed about changes in sibling placements or circumstances; to be permitted in-person contact with siblings, if in the best interest of both siblings, and to be provided necessary transportation as reasonable, and to have access to a phone or computer that allows for virtual visits in between or when face-to-face visits are not feasible; to be actively involved in their siblings' lives, including planning and attending celebrations, birthdays, holidays, graduations, and other meaningful milestones, to the greatest extent possible; to not have sibling visits, including phone calls and virtual visits, be denied as a result of behavioral consequences when residing in a resource family home or congregate care setting; and to be provided updated contact information for all siblings, at least annually, including a current telephone number, address, and email address, unless not in the best interests of one or more siblings. ||In Committee | | |[AJR38](/billdetail/1423077) |Designates April 16 of each year as \"Upcycling Day\" in State. ||This joint resolution acknowledges the benefits to the environment of reusing and upcycling plastic and other common materials by designating April 16 of each year as \"Upcycling Day.\" ||Signed/Enacted | | |[S896](/billdetail/1427098) |Prohibits State Board of Education from requiring completion of performance-based assessment as condition of eligibility for certificate of eligibility with advanced standing or certificate of eligibility. || Under current State Board of Education regulations, in order to be eligible to receive a certificate of eligibility with advanced standing (CEAS) a candidate must pass a Commissioner of Education approved performance-based assessment, currently the edTPA.

Under current law, a person who purchases a firearm in this State is required to display an FPIC, which identifies the card holder as a person who meets the statutory qualifications to purchase a firearm in this State. A person who legally owned a firearm while residing in another state and then moves to New Jersey currently is not required to obtain an FPIC. The person also is not required to register the firearm, but may do so voluntarily. The bill requires a firearm owner who becomes a resident of this State to apply for an FPIC within 60 days and if the firearm is a handgun, to register that handgun within 60 days. To register the handgun, the owner is required to submit to the municipal law enforcement agency or the State Police a registration statement that provides the person's name and address and the make, model, and serial number of the firearm being registered. Under the bill, the Superintendent of State Police is required to prepare the form of registration statement and provide a suitable supply of statements to each organized full-time municipal police department and each State Police station within 60 days prior to the bill's enactment. The bill provides that a person who fails to apply for a firearm purchaser identification card or register a handgun as required under the bill's provisions is liable to a civil penalty of $250 for a first offense and is guilty of a disorderly persons offense for a second or subsequent offense. Under the bill, if a person is in possession of multiple firearms or handguns in violation of the bill's provisions, the person is guilty of one offense under the bill provided the violation is a single event.

Those seeking renewal or reissuance of a commercial driver license will not be required to complete the training. The training requirement will apply to all new applicants when this bill takes effect. The training course will be reviewed at least every two years and modified by the chief administrator, in consultation with the commission and the approved nonprofit course provider, if any, from time to time as need may require. The chief administrator, through its oversight and enforcement authority provided under P.L.1990, c.103 (C.39:3-10.9 et seq.), will be responsible for ensuring that all applicants, prior to being issued a commercial driver license, receive the one-time training course. If an approved nonprofit course provider is involved in providing the one-time training course to applicants of a commercial drive license, then the nonprofit course provider will be responsible for ensuring that all applicants have an opportunity to receive the training course. The chief administrator will make available the training materials for the one-time training course to applicants for commercial driver license, or to the approved nonprofit course provider, if any, for the required individuals to fulfill the one-time training requirement set forth in this subsection. This bill will take effect 60 days after enactment. ||In Committee | | |[ACR94](/billdetail/1447712) |Urges US Congress and President to strengthen provisions of Medicare Part D. ||This concurrent resolution respectfully urges the President and the Congress of the United States to enact legislation which strengthens and clearly recognizes the existing \"Any Willing Provider\" provisions within the Medicare Part D program to protect access to prescription drugs by senior citizens and Americans with disabilities participating in Medicare. Currently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require any sponsors of prescription coverage for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to permit the participation in the sponsor's Part D plan network of any pharmacy that is willing to accept the sponsor's standard contracting terms and conditions. These standard contracting terms and conditions must be reasonable and relevant, and meet accessibility guidelines. Health plans, which are sponsors of prescription coverage for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, establish networks of \"preferred\" pharmacies at which consumers pay lower fees and do not incur other out-of-pocket costs. Concerns have been raised by consumers and pharmacies that sponsors of Medicare Part D plans are changing \"preferred\" pharmacies without adequate notice to consumers. Individuals who have limited access to transportation are not able to fill their prescriptions in a timely manner due to a lack of access to \"preferred\" pharmacies. Additionally, pharmacies are being instructed to refer consumers to other competing \"preferred\" pharmacies to have their prescriptions filled. Legislation needs to be enacted that will allow for fair and equal participation for all pharmacies willing to provide needed medication treatments and healthcare services to the patients they serve. ||Crossed Over | | |[A2234](/billdetail/1447781) |Provides CBT and gross income tax credits for certain deliveries of low carbon concrete and for costs of conducting environmental product declaration analyses of low carbon concrete. || This bill would provide a corporation business tax (CBT) credit to concrete producers that deliver certain forms of concrete associated with reduced greenhouse gas emissions, pursuant to a contract (or subcontract) with a State Agency, which is used by a construction or improvement project that requires the purchase of 50 cubic yards or more of concrete . The bill would also provide a CBT credit to taxpayers that produce concrete or a major component of concrete for the costs of conducting environmental production declaration analyses. Specifically, the bill would authorize a CBT credit for the delivery of low embodied carbon concrete of up to five percent of the cost of the concrete, and a CBT credit for the delivery of concrete that incorporates carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology of up to three percent of the cost of the concrete. Concrete that meets both criteria could receive a tax credit of up to eight percent of the cost of the concrete. The actual amount of the CBT credit would be determined using a formula to be developed by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) pursuant to section 3 of the bill, which would make the tax credit proportional to the greenhouse gas emissions reduction achieved by the specific type of concrete used. In order to qualify for the CBT credit, the concrete producer would be required to submit a certified environmental product declaration to the DEP that provides a global warming potential score for the concrete used. The bill would also establish certain additional requirements to receive the credit, as enumerated in subsection d. of section 1 of the bill. A concrete producer could not receive a CBT credit greater than $1 million annually. In addition, the Statewide amount of the tax credit would be capped at $10 million annually. In preparing the specifications for any contract for the purchase of 50 cubic yards or more of concrete, or for any construction or improvement project that requires the use of concrete, a State agency would be required to include in the invitation to bid, where relevant, a statement that any response to the invitation that proposes or calls for the use low embodied carbon concrete or that utilizes carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology is eligible for the CBT credit established by the bill. If the agency makes a determination to purchase or use low embodied carbon concrete or concrete that uses carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology in the construction project, the agency would be required to include in the invitation to bid a predetermined bid allowance price for the concrete, which would be used by all bidders. The bill would also require any agency or department of State government that purchases 50 cubic yards or more of concrete, or undertakes any construction or improvement project that requires the use 50 cubic yards or more of concrete, to follow the rules, regulations, and guidelines established by DEP pursuant to section 3 of the bill. The bill would also provide a CBT credit to compensate a taxpayer that produces concrete or a major component of concrete for costs incurred as a result of conducting an environmental product declaration analysis to determine the product-based embodied carbon emissions of concrete produced at one or more production facilities that the taxpayer owns or operates. The amount of the tax credit would not exceed the lesser of: (1) the full cost incurred for an environmental product declaration analysis of a single concrete, cement, aggregate, or related production facility, or (2) $3,000. However, a taxpayer may claim the credit authorized under the bill for the cost of completing environmental product declaration analyses at up to eight production facilities owned or operated by the same taxpayer in a single privilege period. The bill would require the DEP, in consultation with the State Treasurer, to adopt rules and regulations to implement the bill. The bill would establish certain minimum contents for the rules and regulations, as enumerated in subsection a. of section 3 of the bill, including guidelines to assist concrete producers and State agencies to comply with the bill. As used in the bill, \"low embodied carbon concrete\" means concrete that has been certified to embody lower carbon emissions, as measured by a global warming potential metric, than the baseline embodied carbon emissions of conventional concrete made with Portland cement. Low embodied carbon emissions may be achieved through a variety of methods described in the bill. \"Carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology\" means technologies or methods to remove carbon dioxide generated from the concrete manufacturing process from the flue gas or from the atmosphere, and the recycling of the carbon dioxide either through utilization of the captured carbon dioxide in the concrete manufacturing process, or safe and permanent storage of the captured carbon dioxide. An \"environmental product declaration\" is a product-specific Type III environmental product declaration that conforms to ISO Standard 14025 and enables the numeric global warming potential and environmental impact comparisons between concrete mixes fulfilling the same functions. ||In Committee | | |[A2426](/billdetail/1447887) |Establishes rebuttable presumption of pretrial detention for defendants who commit certain firearm offenses under Graves Act. || This bill establishes a rebuttable presumption that a defendant subject to a mandatory prison term for a firearm-related crime pursuant to the \"Graves Act\" is to be detained prior to trial. P.L.1981, c.31, also known as the \"Graves Act,\" sets forth mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for individuals convicted of certain crimes involving the use or possession of a firearm. Under P.L.2014, c.31, also known as the \"Criminal Justice Reform Law,\" criminal courts are authorized to order the pretrial release of a defendant pending further proceedings, or order pretrial detention of a defendant who is found to be a flight risk, a danger to another or the community, or likely to obstruct further criminal proceedings. Currently, there is a rebuttable presumption that a defendant who is charged with murder or a crime that subjects the defendant to an ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment is to be detained pending trial. This rebuttable presumption applies when a prosecutor makes a motion for the pretrial detention, and may be rebutted upon a showing of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, in favor of the defendant. If the presumption is not rebutted, the court may order pretrial detention of the defendant. If the presumption is rebutted, the prosecutor still has the opportunity to establish grounds for pretrial detention. This bill provides that the rebuttable presumption of pretrial detention also applies to defendants charged with a firearm related crime under the \"Graves Act.\" The act requires the court to sentence a person who unlawfully possesses a firearm or commits certain serious crimes while possessing a firearm to a mandatory term of incarceration. The mandatory term of incarceration is one-third to one-half of the sentence imposed, or three years, whichever is greater. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A2210](/billdetail/1448034) |Implements certain guidelines concerning purchase of catalytic converters. ||Implements certain guidelines concerning purchase of catalytic converters. ||In Committee | | |[A2526](/billdetail/1449318) |Permits court to order transfer of billing responsibility for, and rights to, wireless telephone number to certain victims of domestic violence or stalking. ||Permits court to order transfer of billing responsibility for, and rights to, wireless telephone number to certain victims of domestic violence or stalking. ||Crossed Over | | |[A2682](/billdetail/1449481) |Establishes \"Alzheimer's and Dementia Care Long-Term Advisory Commission\" in DHS. ||Establishes \"Alzheimer's and Dementia Care Long-Term in DHS. ||In Committee | | |[A2722](/billdetail/1449670) |Permits veteran to receive credit toward licensure as licensed practical nurse upon completing certain military medical training programs. ||Permits veteran to receive credit toward licensure as licensed practical nurse upon completing certain military medical training programs. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[AR91](/billdetail/1454275) |Urges Supreme Court to establish payment kiosks for court-ordered obligations. ||Urges Supreme Court to establish payment kiosks for court-ordered obligations. ||In Committee | | |[A3199](/billdetail/1463590) |Establishes \"Health Care Heroes Violence Prevention Act.\" ||An Act concerning violence against health care professionals, amending N.J.S.2C:44-1, and supplementing Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes and P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). ||Signed/Enacted | November as \"Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Awareness Month\" in NJ. || This bill designates the month of November as \"Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Awareness Month\" in New Jersey, and requests that the Governor issue an annual proclamation calling on public officials and citizens of the State to observe the month with appropriate activities and programs. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS), also known as complex regional pain syndrome, is a debilitating and progressively chronic condition characterized by severe burning pain, pathological changes in bone and skin, excessive sweating, tissue swelling, and extreme sensitivity to touch. In 2007, New Jersey established a reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome education and research program in the Department of Health in order to increase public awareness of the causes of RSDS, promote the value of early detection and the diagnosis of and possible treatments for the syndrome, and support research, through public and private sources, to accurately identify, diagnose, and treat RSDS. ||In Committee | | |[A3712](/billdetail/1475097) |Requires disclosure of lead drinking water hazards to tenants of residential units; prohibits landlords from obstructing replacement of lead service lines; concerns testing of residential units for lead drinking water hazards. ||Requires disclosure of lead drinking water hazards to tenants of residential units; prohibits landlords from obstructing replacement of lead service lines; concerns testing of residential units for lead drinking water hazards. ||Crossed Over | | |[A3804](/billdetail/1475180) |Increases distribution to municipalities from Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund over two years; prohibits anticipation of certain revenue in municipal budget; requires additional aid be subtracted from municipal property tax levy. ||Increases distribution to municipalities from Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund over two years; prohibits anticipation of certain revenue in municipal budget; requires additional aid be subtracted from municipal property tax levy. ||In Committee | | |[A3852](/billdetail/1482561) |Establishes New Jersey Child Tax Credit program. || This bill establishes the New Jersey Child Tax Credit program allowing a gross income tax credit for each child of the taxpayer under the age of six years. The credit amount will be $500 per child of the taxpayer if the taxpayer's income is $30,000 or less. The $500 amount will be reduced by $10 for every $1,000 of income that the taxpayer's taxable income exceeds $30,000 until the taxpayer's income reaches $80,000. A taxpayer will be allowed to claim the credit whether the taxpayer uses a Social Security number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) on their tax forms. The credit is refundable, meaning that any excess credit beyond the taxpayer's tax liability will be paid to the taxpayer in the form of a tax refund. The bill sponsor notes that the expanded federal Child Tax Credit, part of the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, has substantially reduced child poverty, improved family financial footing, and made New Jersey a more affordable place to raise children safely and healthily. Although New Jersey's overall population has increased from 2010 to 2020, its child population has decreased, and strong pro-family policies are needed to ensure that families can afford to raise children in the Garden State. All families with children deserve to be able to afford to raise them in New Jersey, regardless of household income or economic status. With the high cost of child-rearing in New Jersey, including high housing, child care, and transportation costs, low- and moderate-income families need direct financial relief to stabilize family budgets and cover these costs. A New Jersey Child Tax Credit can promote strong child development, reduce child poverty and food insufficiency, and help make New Jersey a better place to live, work, and raise a family. A New Jersey Child Tax Credit can help close the racial income and wealth gaps in New Jersey and ensure a more equitable future for New Jersey's children. ||In Committee | | |[S2523](/billdetail/1483744) |Provides child tax credit under gross income tax. || This bill establishes the New Jersey Child Tax Credit program allowing a gross income tax credit for each child of the taxpayer under the age of six years.

Under the bill, there would be a rebuttable presumption that if the defendant is a resident of New Jersey, the rendering state lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant at the time the action was brought. The bill also provides that a New Jersey resident could not be held criminally or civilly liable for any civil action or criminal prosecution brought against the New Jersey resident pursuant to that state's law. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Guttmacher Institute, approximately 25 states are likely to ban abortion or substantially limit access to it if the United States Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). For example, a law enacted in Texas in May 2021, Tex. SB 8, 87th Regular Session ch. 62, bans abortions in that state after six weeks' pregnancy. The law also permits enforcement by private citizens, including authorizing an action against a person who \"aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion.\" Statutory relief includes damages in an amount not less than $10,000, costs, and attorney fees. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A4033](/billdetail/1484390) |Extends deadline for completion of school district's annual audit. ||Extends deadline for completion of school district's annual audit. ||Crossed Over | | |[A4022](/billdetail/1484414) |Expands definition of child under PFRS and SPRS. ||Expands definition of child under PFRS and SPRS. ||In Committee | | |[SJR86](/billdetail/1484622) |Designates October 15th of each year as \"New Jersey Railroad Workers Day.\" ||This joint resolution designates October 15th of each year as \"New Jersey Railroad Workers Day.\" By allowing for the efficient transportation of consumer goods and commuters, railroads continue to serve a crucial, and often overlooked, role in connecting and sustaining the modern, globalized economy. Without the continuous operations of the freight railroad sector, global supply chains can easily become disrupted, thereby increasing consumer prices and reducing access to necessary goods and services. The passenger railroad sector also plays a similarly important role in ensuring that the workforce can affordably and reliably commute to their places of employment, which service is vital for businesses located inside and outside of this State. However, the operations of freight and passenger railroads would not be possible without the tireless efforts of railroad workers, who work long hours to ensure that freight containers are properly handled and passenger trains are safely operated. Due to the constant demand for freight and passenger rail service, many railroad workers are often forced to work irregular shifts, sacrificing time away from their friends and family. Moreover, railroad workers have also shown a willingness to work in dangerous conditions during times of crisis to ensure that the public receives crucial freight and passenger rail services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, railroad workers served as frontline workers who, despite the dangers of working in close proximity to one another, worked to alleviate supply chain backlogs and commute essential health care workers. Without their contributions, there is little doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic would have unleashed even more harm on the physical and economic well-being of the people of this State. Whether during times of peace or times of crisis, railroad workers provide an invaluable service for the people of this State by ensuring that the modern, globalized economy continues to function. As such, it is altogether fitting and proper to celebrate the contributions of these workers by designating \"New Jersey Railroad Workers Day\" in this State.

This bill lowers the age at which a minor can consent to such treatment from 16 years of age or older to 14 years of age or older. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among New Jersey teens. Between 2016 and 2018, the number of suicide deaths among persons ages of ten and 24 in New Jersey was 291. During the early stages of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, adolescents accounted for a higher proportion of suicides in the United States than in the years prior to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. Five states, including New Jersey, had an increase in the absolute count of adolescent suicides during the pandemic. These states also had an increase in the proportion of overall suicides among adolescents. Twenty-four states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have enacted laws allowing minors to consent to some type of behavioral or mental health treatment, and ten states allow minors between the ages of 12 and 15 to consent to such treatment. It is the sponsor's intent to address the issue of, and facilitate efforts to prevent, teen suicide by lowering the age at which a minor, who believes that he or she is in need of behavioral health treatment services, can consent to such services. ||In Committee | | |[S2872](/billdetail/1489308) |Establishes Behavioral Healthcare Provider Loan Redemption Program within Higher Education Student Assistance Authority; appropriates $5 million. || This bill establishes a Behavioral Healthcare Provider Loan Redemption Program within the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority and appropriates $5 million from the General Fund for the bill's purposes.

Under the bill, approved sites include community providers of behavioral and mental health services identified by the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority, in consultation with the Department of Health, for inclusion in the program. Approved sites may include, but need not be limited to, providers operated by a nonprofit, school district, county, the Department of Children and Families, the Department of Human Services, and the Department of Health. The bill will benefit \"eligible behavioral healthcare providers,\" which include psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, psychiatric nurse mental health clinical specialists, board certified behavior analysts; licensed clinical alcohol and drug counselors; and any other professionals identified by the executive director of the authority for inclusion in the program. Under the bill, to be eligible to participate in the program, an applicant is required to: (1) be a resident of the State; (2) be employed, or plan to be employed, as an eligible behavioral healthcare provider at an approved site; and (3) submit an application in accordance with such procedures and requirements as are established by the executive director. The bill directs the executive director or the director's designee to select the program participants from among those applicants who meet the eligibility criteria, subject to available funds.

Under the bill, the Attorney General is required to: (1) establish performance standards and qualifying criteria for determining whether a firearm constitutes a microstamping-enabled firearm; (2) establish a process by which to determine whether a firearm constitutes a microstamping-enabled firearm; and (3) complete an investigation as to whether microstamping-enabled firearms technology currently is viable. The bill requires the Attorney General to designate a microstamping examiner, whose duties include examining firearms submitted by applicants to determine whether a firearm meets the performance standards and qualifying criteria established by the Attorney General to be designated as a microstamping-enabled firearm. Additionally, if the Attorney General determines after the initial investigation that microstamping technology is not yet viable, the examiner would be required to examine submitted firearms and make recommendations to the Attorney General as to technological viability until the Attorney General certifies that the technology is viable. Upon designation of the first microstamping-enabled firearm, the examiner would be required to create a microstamp roster. The bill provides that the roster would be published on a website maintained by the New Jersey State Police and updated as necessary. A copy of the roster would be made available every six months to licensed retail dealers of firearms in this State. Upon the inclusion of one or more firearms on the roster, the bill requires the Attorney General to determine the commercial availability of microstamping-enabled firearms. When it is determined that microstamping-enabled firearms are commercially available, each licensed retail dealer of firearms in the State would be required to: (1) make available for purchase at least one firearm included on the roster and display the firearm in a conspicuous manner; (2) post copies of the roster and signage concerning features of microstamping-enabled firearms; (3) accept and process orders to enable customers to purchase any firearms included on the roster; (4) refrain from claiming that any firearm is a microstamping-enabled firearm if that firearm is not included on the roster; and (5) in the event that the licensed retail dealer's inventory of microstamping-enabled firearms is depleted, order new stock, maintain order records, and notify customers of the typical availability of microstamping-enabled firearms. The records would be subject to inspection by State Police investigators. Under the bill, a licensed retail dealer who violates the bill's provisions would be subject to the following penalties: (1) for a first offense, a fine of up to $500; (2) for a second offense, a fine of up to $1,000; (3) for a third or subsequent offense, a six-month license suspension following notice to the licensed retail dealer and opportunity to be heard. The bill additionally provides that any person who, without license or privilege to do so, tampers or attempts to tamper with a microstamping enabled firearm by intentionally interfering with the microstamping component technology would be guilty of a third degree crime. The bill defines \"microstamp\" as a unique alphanumeric or geometric code that identifies the make, model, and serial number of a firearm. \"Microstamping component\" is defined as a component part of a firearm that will produce a microstamp on at least one location of the expended cartridge case each time the firearm is fired. \"Microstamping-enabled firearm\" is defined as a firearm that contains a microstamping component. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A4399](/billdetail/1489854) |Establishes Behavioral Healthcare Provider Loan Redemption Program within Higher Education Student Assistance Authority; appropriates $5 million. || This bill establishes a Behavioral Healthcare Provider Loan Redemption Program within the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority and appropriates $5 million from the General Fund for the bill's purposes.

A \"school meals program\" is defined to mean and include: the National School Lunch Program; the federal School Breakfast Program, including a school breakfast after the bell program; the Summer Food Service Program or Seamless Summer Option; the Child and Adult Care Food Program; any emergency meals distribution program; and any other similar State or federal nutrition assistance program that is designed to ensure that children enrolled in school, or that children or adults attending a day care center or other, similar temporary care facility, have regular and affordable access to nutritious meals. The transfer of authority under the bill would not affect any civil or criminal actions or proceedings that have been brought by or against the DOA in association with its administration and enforcement of a school meals program, and which are pending as of the bill's effective date. Nor would the transfer affect any order or recommendation that has been made by, or any other matters or administrative proceedings that are pending before, the DOA as of the bill's effective date. The existing orders, rules, and regulations of the DOA that have been issued in relation to the State's school meals programs would also remain in effect until they are either repealed or superseded by rules, regulations, and orders adopted by the DOE pursuant to the bill, whichever occurs first. Although the DOA currently has authority to administer and enforce all school meals programs operating in the State, this authority is superfluous to, and takes the department's attention away from, its main purposes and functions, which are to promote and protect the State's agriculture and agribusiness industries and lands, and to conserve soil and water resources for agricultural purposes. The primary purpose and function of the DOE, by contrast, is to support schools, students, educators, and school districts in order to ensure that students are capable of achieving academic excellence. Because access to nutritional meals is a proven means by which students enhance their capacity for academic success, and because the DOE's mission already requires it to focus on programs geared toward schools and students, the DOE is better positioned, and is the more appropriate department, to administer the school meals programs and to provide assistance to schools, students, parents, and guardians, in association with the operation of those programs. ||In Committee | | |[A4639](/billdetail/1493447) |Eliminates high school graduation proficiency test. ||Eliminates high school graduation proficiency test. ||Crossed Over | | |[A4686](/billdetail/1494010) |Establishes penalties for person who commits motor vehicle noise violation. ||Establishes penalties for person who commits motor vehicle noise violation. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A4691](/billdetail/1494496) |Requires hazard mitigation plans to include climate change-related threat assessments and hazard prevention and mitigation strategies. ||Requires hazard mitigation plans to include climate change-related threat assessments and hazard prevention and mitigation strategies. ||Crossed Over | | |[A4755](/billdetail/1494873) |Permits behavioral and mental health care providers to operate within homeless shelters. ||An Act concerning homeless shelters and behavioral and mental health and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A4750](/billdetail/1494875) |Vacant Storefront Registry Program; establishes public database of vacant commercial space for small businesses. ||Vacant Storefront Registry Program; establishes public database of vacant commercial space for small businesses. ||Passed | | |[A4746](/billdetail/1494897) |Requires availability of accessible mail-in ballot for voters with disabilities. ||Requires availability of accessible mail-in ballot for voters with disabilities. ||Crossed Over | | |[A4748](/billdetail/1494904) |Enhances customer service experience with Business Action Center in Department of State by collecting and disseminating customer assistance metrics. ||An Act requiring the collection and dissemination of customer assistance metrics for the Business Action Center and supplementing P.L.1948, c.445 (C.52:16A-1 et seq.). ||Signed/Enacted | new businesses and start-ups. ||Establishes mentorship program for new businesses and start-ups. ||Passed | | |[A4752](/billdetail/1494925) |Promotes small business Internet presence. ||Promotes small business Internet presence. ||Passed | | |[A4759](/billdetail/1494929) |Requires public water systems and landlords to provide certain notice of elevated perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances levels in drinking water; requires DEP to establish educational program. ||Requires public water systems and landlords to provide certain notice of elevated perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances levels in drinking water; requires DEP to establish educational program. ||Crossed Over | | |[A4760](/billdetail/1494941) |Requires DEP and Drinking Water Quality Institute to perform study concerning regulation and treatment of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. ||Requires DEP and Drinking Water Quality Institute to perform study concerning regulation and treatment of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. ||In Committee | | |[A4756](/billdetail/1494945) |Requires Division of Children's System of Care to establish training program for employees of emergency shelters for homeless. ||Requires Division of Children's System of Care to establish training program for employees of emergency shelters for homeless. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A4720](/billdetail/1494951) |Requires Commissioner of Education to distribute survey to school districts regarding instruction on Holocaust and genocides. ||Requires Commissioner of Education to distribute survey to school districts regarding instruction on Holocaust and genocides. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[AJR194](/billdetail/1495462) |Designates January of each year as \"Muslim Heritage Month\" in NJ. ||Designates January of each year as \"Muslim Heritage Month\" in NJ. ||In Committee | | |[A4784](/billdetail/1495492) |Requires vehicle identification number be stamped on catalytic converters of motor vehicles. ||Requires vehicle identification number be stamped on catalytic converters of motor vehicles. ||Crossed Over | | |[A4790](/billdetail/1495502) |Establishes NJ Non-Profit Loan Guarantee Pilot Program within EDA. ||Establishes NJ Non-Profit Loan Guarantee Pilot Program within EDA. ||Vetoed | | |[AJR201](/billdetail/1498240) |Designates annual Lunar New Year in NJ. ||Designates annual Lunar New Year in NJ. ||Crossed Over | | |[SJR105](/billdetail/1498288) |Designates January of each year as \"Muslim Heritage Month\" in NJ. ||This Joint Resolution designates the month of January of each year as \"Muslim Heritage Month\" in the State of New Jersey.

The duty of the commission is to study the effects of a longer school day and school year on advancing student achievement, enhancing the overall school learning environment, and increasing student enrichment opportunities and educational offerings. In conducting its study the commission is to examine any extended school day and school year schedules utilized in other states. The commission is required to issue a final report of its findings and recommendations, including any recommended legislation, to the Governor and the Legislature no later than six months after its organizational meeting. The commission expires 30 days after the report is submitted. ||In Committee | | |[A4968](/billdetail/1501632) |Requires motor vehicle manufacturer to stamp motor vehicle identification number on catalytic converters. ||This bill requires every manufacturer of motor vehicles to stamp or engrave the motor vehicle identification number onto each catalytic converter installed in any motor vehicle sold within this State. Under the bill, \"manufacturer\" is defined to mean a person engaged in the business of manufacturing or assembling motor vehicles, who will, under normal business conditions during the year, manufacture or assemble at least 10 new motor vehicles. A violation of the bill's provisions is an unlawful practice under the New Jersey consumer fraud act. An unlawful practice is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense. In addition, a violation can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured party. ||In Committee | | |[A4988](/billdetail/1503150) |Provides for licensure of packaged ice plant operators and packaged ice dealers. ||This bill provides for the licensure of packaged ice plants and packaged ice dealers. Under the bill, the New Jersey Department of Health is required to establish standards governing the manufacturing, storage, and distribution of packaged ice, including standards addressing the processing, packaging, storage, and distribution methods necessary to prevent the contamination of packaged ice or its packaging materials and recall procedures for contaminated packaged ice. Under the bill, packaged ice plants and packaged ice dealers who are also packaged ice plants are to conduct quarterly testing of packaged ice to determine the presence of certain contaminants. In addition, packaged ice which is manufactured, distributed, or sold within this State is to comply with the regulations concerning drinking water quality standards adopted by the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to the \"Safe Drinking Water Act.\" The bill requires any person owning or operating a packaged ice plant located within, or conducting business within, this State or acting as a packaged ice dealer within this State is to hold a valid license issued by the Department of Health. Under the bill, the Department of Health is to: \u00b7 ensure that any applicant or licensee adhere to any standards established by the department pertaining to packaged ice plants or packaged ice distribution;\u00b7 inspect licensed packaged ice plants and packaged ice dealers to ensure compliance with standards established by the department; and\u00b7 disseminate informational material to instruct and assist applicants and licensees regarding best practices in the industry, as well as the types of activities that constitute a statutory or regulatory violation. In the event that it is discovered that a contaminant which is present in packaged ice may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health and safety, the Commissioner of Health may take any action deemed necessary to protect the public health and safety. The actions may include, but need not be limited to, issuing any orders necessary to protect consumers of the packaged ice, and commencing a civil action for appropriate relief, including a restraining order or permanent or temporary injunction. Any person who sells or manufactures or who has in that person's possession with intent to sell in this State any packaged ice in violation of this bill shall be liable to a civil administrative penalty of not more than $5,000 for the first offense, or more than $10,000 for the second offense, and up to $25,000 for the third and subsequent offense. The bill defines \"packaged ice plant\" to mean any place, premises, or establishment where a person is engaged in the production, processing, or packaging of packaged ice for wholesale distribution or sale directly to the consumer and includes rooms and premises where machines, utensils, and packaging are washed, sanitized, or kept. In addition, the bill defines \"packaged ice dealer\" to mean a person engaged in the business of distributing packaged ice to retailers for sale to consumers. ||In Committee | | |[AJR209](/billdetail/1503223) |Designates November 20th of each year as \"World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims\" in NJ. ||This joint resolution recognizes November 20th of each year as \"World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims\" in New Jersey. World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims is an opportunity to raise awareness about the devastation wrought by traffic accidents and educate residents about crash prevention. This is also an occasion to honor the emergency response and medical professionals who assist in the aftermath of traffic incidents. World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims originated in Europe during 1995 and is now recognized around the world. The United States Department of Transportation has acknowledged World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. The United Nations designates the third Sunday of each November as World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. Traffic incidents in New Jersey resulted in 697 fatalities during 2021, the highest rate in 14 years. Designating November 20th as \"World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims\" acknowledges the significant impact of traffic incidents on New Jersey families and communities and recognizes the value of crash prevention to this State. ||In Committee | | |[AR172](/billdetail/1521048) |Urges incorporation of Sikhism instruction into social studies curriculum. ||Urges incorporation of Sikhism instruction into social studies curriculum. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A5096](/billdetail/1533328) |Replaces statutory terms regarding alcohol and substance use. ||Replaces statutory terms regarding alcohol and substance use. ||Passed | | |[A5141](/billdetail/1547936) |Allows persons diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or Crohn's disease to receive parking privileges reserved for persons with disability. ||This bill permits a person who has been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or Crohn's Disease, as certified by a physician with a plenary license to practice medicine and surgery in this State or a bordering State; a physician stationed at a military or naval installation located in this State who is licensed to practice in any state; a physician assistant licensed to practice in this State or a bordering state; or a nurse practitioner licensed to practice in this State or a bordering state, to park a motor vehicle in parking spaces reserved for persons with a disability. Under the bill, persons diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or Crohn's Disease are eligible to receive from the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission a person with a disability identification card, a vehicle identification placard, and license plates that display the national wheelchair symbol. People living with Irritable Bowel Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or Crohn's Disease often suffer from the debilitating urgency to use a restroom immediately.

No fee other than that permitted by section 17 of P.L.1997, c.256 (C.2B:24-17) is to be assessed for representation by a municipal public defender Under the provisions of section 17 of P.L.1997, c.256 (C.2B:24-17), a municipality may require by ordinance that a person applying for municipal public defender representation pay an application fee of not more than $200. The statute provides that the fee must be in an amount necessary to pay the costs of municipal public defender services. The municipal court may waive the application fee if the court determines upon a clear and convincing showing by the applicant that the fee represents an unreasonable burden on the person seeking representation. The bill would take effect 60 days after enactment. ||In Committee | | |[A3110](/billdetail/1463160) |Establishes minimum Medicaid reimbursement rates for brain injury services. || This bill establishes minimum Medicaid reimbursement rates for brain injury services. Under this bill, the term brain injury includes both a traumatic brain injury and a non-traumatic brain injury. \"Traumatic brain injury\" means an injury to the brain caused by a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury or neuro-trauma that disrupts the normal brain function, where continued impairment can be demonstrated. \"Non-traumatic brain injury\" means an injury to the brain caused by internal factors, such as stroke, aneurysm, tumor, infectious disease, and anoxia, where continued impairment can be demonstrated. Neither term includes brain dysfunction caused by congenital or degenerative disorders, birth trauma, or injuries caused by other circumstances. Brain injury services include community-based services, residential services, day care services, and home care services whether the services are provided through the Medicaid fee-for-service delivery system or the managed care delivery system. Specifically, the bill requires that the Medicaid per diem or encounter reimbursement rates for eligible brain injury services, when such services are provided by an approved brain injury services provider to a Medicaid beneficiary requiring treatment for a brain injury, is to be, at minimum, as follows: (1) The reimbursement rate for Community Residential Services - Low Supervision provided to a Medicaid beneficiary eligible for brain injury services, currently at $140 a day, is to be equal to the reimbursement rate for Individuals Supports Services Tier - C provided to a Medicaid beneficiary eligible for services provided by the Division of Developmental Disabilities, currently at $283.20 per day; (2) The reimbursement rate for Community Residential Services - Moderate Supervision provided to a Medicaid beneficiary eligible for brain injury services, currently at $190 a day, is to be equal to the reimbursement rate for Individuals Supports Services Tier - D provided to a Medicaid beneficiary eligible for services provided by the Division of Developmental Disabilities, currently at $396.48 a day; (3) The reimbursement rate for Community Residential Services - High Supervision provided to a Medicaid beneficiary eligible for brain injury services, currently at $220 a day, is to be equal to the reimbursement rate for Individuals Supports Services - Tier E provided to a Medicaid beneficiary eligible for services provided by the Division of Developmental Disabilities, currently at $509.96 a day; and (4) The reimbursement rate for Structured Day Program Services provided to a Medicaid beneficiary eligible for brain injury services, currently at $3.65 for every 15 minutes of services, is to be equal to the reimbursement rate for Day Habilitation Services - Tier D provided to a Medicaid beneficiary eligible for services provided by the Division of Developmental Disabilities, currently at $6.91 for every 15 minutes of service. Currently, the State's Medicaid program provides brain injury services under the Managed Long-Term Supports and Services program, with the goal of providing community alternatives for individuals with brain injuries residing in nursing facilities or who are in the community and at risk for placement in nursing facilities. Unlike other Medicaid community-based services, reimbursement rates for brain injury services have remained static in recent years despite growing costs, which threatens the ability of providers to meet the complex needs of individuals with brain injuries and provide services within a safe and fulfilling community environment. Despite the similar model of care, reimbursement rates for services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) have not only increased, but have been restructured to account for adequate consideration for acuity, increased minimum wage requirements, and other inflationary trends that assert pressure on providers' cost structures. It is the sponsor's goal to align brain injury service rates with I/DD service rates to ensure that individuals with brain injuries can continue to thrive and reach their optimal recoveries in community settings. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[ACR115](/billdetail/1463372) |Condemns Russian invasion of Ukraine and supports Ukraine's government and citizens. ||Condemns Russian invasion of Ukraine and supports Ukraine's government and citizens. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1499](/billdetail/1423141) |Requires restaurants to provide healthy beverages with meals designated for children. || This bill requires restaurants to provide a healthy beverage with any meals designated for children.

The bill does not prohibit or preclude a restaurant from selling or offering another beverage as a replacement to the default beverage included with the children's meal. ||In Committee | | |[A3531](/billdetail/1469083) |Appropriates $450,000 for Hooked on Fishing-Not on Drugs Program. || The bill appropriates $450,000 to the Department of Environmental Protection to fund the cost of implementing the Hooked on Fishing-Not on Drugs Program. The money would be appropriated from the \"Drug Enforcement and Demand Reduction Fund,\" a statutory account established to receive fines and penalties from convicted drug offenders that are used to support State-authorized drug and alcohol abuse abatement programs. The bill encourages the Legislature to appropriate sufficient funding annually from the \"Drug Enforcement and Demand Reduction Fund\" or any other appropriate source to maintain the operation of the program in future years. ||In Committee | | |[A3535](/billdetail/1469088) |Increases amount annually credited to Shore Protection Fund to $50 million. || This bill increases from $25 million to $50 million the amount that is annually credited to the Shore Protection Fund from the collection of realty transfer fees. The realty transfer fee is imposed on the recording of deeds transferring real property, and is calculated on the basis of the amount paid in the deed. The basic rate is $1.75 for each $500 of consideration, of which $0.50 is retained by the county and $1.25 is the State share. Currently, the first $25 million of the State share collected annually is credited to the Shore Protection Fund. ||In Committee | | |[AJR165](/billdetail/1485192) |Designates October 15th of each year as \"New Jersey Railroad Workers Day.\" ||Designates October 15th of each year as \"New Jersey Railroad Workers Day.\" ||Crossed Over | | |[A1434](/billdetail/1422466) |Prohibits use of receipt paper containing bisphenol A. || This bill would prohibit a person from using or providing, as a business or banking record, a piece of paper to which bisphenol A (BPA) was added or used in the manufacturing process in order to provide a specific characteristic, appearance, or quality to the paper. A person who violates the provisions of the bill would be subject to a penalty of between $250 and $500. The bill would take effect 18 months after the date of enactment. ||In Committee | | |[A4169](/billdetail/1487250) |Directs DOE to develop New Jersey Student Learning Standards in information literacy. || This bill requires school districts to incorporate instruction on information literacy into the curriculum in each of the grades kindergarten through 12. \"Information literacy,\" as used in the bill, means a set of skills that enables an individual to recognize when information is needed and to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information. Information literacy includes digital, visual, media, textual, and technological literacy. The bill directs the Commissioner of Education, in consultation with the New Jersey State Librarian, to develop curriculum guidelines on information literacy to be used by school districts. The guidelines will provide for a sequential course of study for each of the grades kindergarten through 12 and must include, at a minimum, the following: (1) knowledge of the research process and how information is created and produced; (2) skills in using information resources and critical thinking about those resources; (3) the abilities to evaluate information critically and competently, to recognize relevant primary and secondary information, and to distinguish among facts, points of view, and opinions; (4) access to information and information tools; and (5) an understanding of economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and how to use information ethically and legally. The guidelines also will include model instructional units, define learning objectives, and recommend suitable instructional materials. The guidelines will be reviewed annually and updated as appropriate. In addition, the bill requires the commissioner, in consultation with the State Librarian, to establish in-service training programs on information literacy instruction for school administrators, certified school library media specialists, and the teaching staff members who will provide the instruction on information literacy in each grade. The in-service training programs will provide the opportunity for collaboration among teachers and school library media specialists to advance information literacy in the kindergarten through grade 12 curriculum. Under the bill, the commissioner, in consultation with the State Librarian, will develop a system for evaluating the effectiveness of instructional programs on information literacy established by school districts pursuant to the bill's provisions. The commissioner will make programs that are shown to be effective available as model programs to other school districts throughout the State.

The purpose of the task force will be to reduce military suicides and provide a plan for the elimination of all military suicides. The task force will recommend comprehensive strategies aimed at addressing suicide among members of the military, active duty and veterans, and will recommend ways to establish and execute plans and programs to implement those strategies. The task force will consist of 17 members, and it will be the duty of the task force to: identify and review the issues and concerns facing active duty service members and veterans; recommend measures the State should take to address the issues and concerns, including legislation if appropriate; examine data, research, programs, and initiatives related to military suicide, including the physical, social, emotional, and mental impact of military service, with a focus on deployments; identify evidence-based best practices to increase awareness of veteran suicide prevention hot lines, in New Jersey or nationally, and other crisis resources with proven effectiveness to reduce military suicide; identify effective strategies for promoting lifelong physical, social, emotional, and mental health of service members and veterans, and develop recommendations to implement those strategies; review the laws, regulations, and public policies governing services provided to active duty service members and veterans of this State, and determine whether those services are currently being performed in the most effective manner; and determine whether those services can be performed more efficiently and effectively by a county or municipal government and whether services now being provided by a county or municipal government may be more efficiently and effectively performed by State government. The task force will submit periodic reports, no less than twice a year, concerning the findings and actions related to its duties to the Governor and the Legislature. ||In Committee | | |[A4235](/billdetail/1488558) |Requires county health departments to maintain reserve stock of opioid antidotes to dispense to certain entities on interim basis to ensure uninterrupted supply. || This bill amends the \"Overdose Prevention Act,\" P.L.2013, c.42 (C.24:6J-1 et seq.), to require each county health department to obtain and maintain in an accessible storage location, a reserve stock of opioid antidotes that can be accessed by law enforcement agencies, emergency medical response entities, schools, and hospital pharmacies to ensure those entities have access to an uninterrupted supply of opioid antidotes. The exact quantity of opioid antidotes to be maintained in the reserve stock will be determined by the director of each county health department in consultation with the county prosecutor, the county association of police chiefs, and the county association of fire chiefs, and with input from law enforcement agencies, emergency medical response entities, hospitals, school districts, and schools operating in that county. The bill specifies that, whenever a law enforcement agency, emergency medical response entity, school, or hospital pharmacy anticipates it will exhaust its supply of opioid antidotes before it is able to acquire more, it may make a request to the county health department to provide an interim supply of opioid antidotes from the county health department's reserve stock. Upon receiving a request, the county health department will be required to promptly deliver to the requester an interim supply sufficient to meet the requester's need for opioid antidotes for the interim period between the date the requester's supply is expected to be exhausted and the date the requester expects to receive a new supply of opioid antidotes by regular means. Law enforcement agencies, emergency medical response entities, schools, and hospital pharmacies that obtain an interim supply of opioid antidotes from a county health department's reserve stock will be required to reimburse the county health department for the department's actual costs in acquiring and delivering the interim supply. The bill expressly authorizes county health departments to enter into shared service agreements, in accordance with the \"Uniform Shared Services and Consolidation Act,\" in order to facilitate the acquisition of opioid antidotes at discounted rates, minimize delivery costs, and otherwise facilitate the implementation of the provisions of the bill. ||In Committee | | |[A3086](/billdetail/1455107) |Directs installation of electric vehicle charging stations at service areas on State's toll roads. || This bill directs the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) and the South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) to equip service areas along the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway, and the Atlantic City Expressway with electric vehicle charging stations. The charging stations are to provide, at a minimum, level 3 charging, or more current readily available technology. The charging stations are required to be installed in at least five percent of service area parking spaces in service areas with at least 100 spaces that are open to the public. The authorities are directed to recover costs for providing the electricity from motorists who use the stations, in proportion to their use. To pay for the cost of installation of the charging stations, money may be appropriated to the authorities from: private sources, if available; any settlement between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. or any other appropriate division of the Volkswagen company operating worldwide (Volkswagen), if available as determined by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection; or any settlement between the Department of Environmental Protection or any other State agency or department and Volkswagen, if available as determined by the appropriate agency head. ||In Committee | | |[A4125](/billdetail/1487151) |Prohibits sale, manufacture, distribution, and use of firefighting foam containing intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. || This bill would prohibit, beginning two years after the bill's effective date, the sale, manufacture, distribution, and use of any class B firefighting foam containing intentionally added PFAS within the State. As defined in the bill, \"perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances\" or \"PFAS\" means substances that include any member of the class of fluorinated organic chemicals containing at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom and \"class B firefighting foam\" means foam designed to prevent or extinguish a fire in flammable liquids, combustible liquids, petroleum greases, tars, oils, oil-based paints, solvents, lacquers, alcohols, and flammable gases. The bill's provisions would not apply to the sale, manufacture, distribution, or use of class B firefighting foam for which the inclusion of PFAS is required by federal law or regulation, including, but not limited to, 14 C.F.R. s.139.317. If a federal requirement to include PFAS in class B firefighting foam is revoked, the bill's provisions would apply one year after the requirement is revoked. A violation of the bill's provisions would be an unlawful practice pursuant to P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), commonly known as the State's \"Consumer Fraud Act.\" As provided by section 1 of P.L.1966, c.39 (C.56:8-13), an unlawful practice under the Consumer Fraud Act is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense. In addition, a violation can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured. PFAS are man-made chemical compounds that have multiple fluorine atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. There are over 4,700 different types of PFAS, and new types are invented on a nearly daily basis. The carbon-fluorine bond that forms PFAS is one of the strongest chemical bonds found in nature and does not break down under typical environmental conditions. As a result, PFAS are nicknamed \"forever chemicals\" because they accumulate, rather than break down, over time. Since the 1930s, PFAS have been widely used in countless consumer products and are used in certain types of firefighting foam. There are two major types of firefighting foam, Class A and Class B. Class A firefighting foams are used to extinguish fires caused by wood, paper, and brush and generally do not contain PFAS. Class B firefighting foams are commercial surfactant solutions that have been, and continue to be, stored and used for fire suppression, fire training, and flammable vapor suppression at military installations, civilian facilities, and airports. Class B foams can be divided into two film forming foams or \"AFFF\" are the foams that contain varying amounts and mixtures of PFAS, and for this reason, are of the most concern to human health and the environment. Studies have indicated that exposure to PFAS, and the resulting accumulation of PFAS in the human body, may be linked to certain adverse health effects. Firefighters, who endure prolonged exposure to PFAS-based foams, face a greater risk of developing associated health conditions and diseases. In addition, the runoff from firefighting foam containing PFAS can lead to widespread PFAS contamination in the drinking water of surrounding communities near facilities where the firefighting foam is used. Because PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam jeopardize the health, safety, and well-being of firefighters, it is crucial to prohibit the sale, manufacture, distribution, and use of firefighting foams that contain PFAS within the State. ||In Committee | | |[A2895](/billdetail/1455006) |Provides corporation business tax credit and gross income tax credits for purchase and installation of certain electric vehicle charging stations. || This bill provides corporation business tax credit and gross income tax credits for the purchase and installation of certain electric vehicle charging stations. The credits are available for the taxpayer tax periods beginning in calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016. The bill provides credits under the corporation business tax and the gross income tax for electric vehicle charging stations used directly and exclusively by the taxpayer in the taxpayer's business, trade, or occupation. For charging stations purchased and installed in 2014 tax periods a taxpayer will be allowed a credit in an amount of 25 percent of the cost, up to $500 per electric vehicle charging station; for a charging station purchased and installed in 2015 tax periods the credit is 15 percent of the cost, up to $300 per charging station; and for a charging station purchased and installed in 2016 tax periods the credit is eight percent of the cost, up to $150 per station. The bill also provides a gross income tax credit for a charging station purchase that is not required to be for business use. The credit for 2014 is 25 percent of cost, up to $500, for 2015 15 percent of cost, up to $300, and for 2016 eight percent of cost, up to $150, for the purchase and installation of a charging station. Married taxpayers filing separately are allowed up to half of those amounts. To qualify for the bill's tax credits, the bill requires the taxpayer to file an application for a certification with the Commissioner of Environmental Protection that the charging station purchased and installed by the taxpayer is a qualified electric vehicle charging station. ||In Committee | | |[A4053](/billdetail/1485161) |Requires civil service examination for police and correctional police officers to include questions to identify implicit racial bias. || This bill requires the State Civil Service Commission to include on the Civil Service entry-level law enforcement examination questions designed to identify implicit bias, including racial bias, in candidates applying for appointment to law enforcement officer positions. The test is required for applicants for municipal and county police officers, adult and juvenile correctional police officers, sheriff's officers, and other law enforcement officer positions. Implicit bias refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions and may cause feelings and attitudes about other people based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, age, and appearance. ||In Committee | | |[A2772](/billdetail/1454815) |Authorizes special occasion events at certain commercial farms on preserved farmland, under certain conditions; appropriates $85,000. || This bill would authorize commercial farms that are located on preserved farmland, and produce agricultural or horticultural products worth $5,000 or more annually, to hold special occasion events, subject to certain conditions. The bill would establish various restrictions on the special occasion events. For example, under section 3 of the bill, a special occasion event: (1) may not interfere with the use of the preserved farmland for agricultural or horticultural production; (2) may not cause a significant and direct negative impact to any surrounding properties; (3) must be designed to protect the agricultural resources of the land and ensure that the land can be readily returned to productive agricultural or horticultural use after the event; (4) may not violate any applicable State and local laws, regulations, resolutions, and ordinances including those concerning alcohol, food safety, litter, noise, solid waste, traffic, and the protection of public health and safety; and (5) may not involve the construction of any new structures or water or sewer utilities on the preserved farmland. Under the bill, a farm that produces agricultural or horticultural products worth between $5,000 and $100,000 annually may hold up to a maximum of 15 special occasion events per calendar year, of which two may have 250 guests or more in attendance. A farm that produces agricultural or horticultural products worth $100,000 or more annually may hold up to a maximum of 52 special occasion events per calendar year, of which 12 may have 250 guests or more in attendance. An event would be considered as a single special occasion event, even if the event lasts for more than one day, provided the event is marketed as a single event, occurs only on consecutive days; and does not last for more than three days. A person holding a special occasion event during which 250 guests or more will be in attendance at any time during the event would be required to apply to the grantee of the farm, i.e. the entity to which the development rights of the farm have been transferred, for approval prior to holding a special occasion event, or if the grantee is the owner of the preserved farmland, the application would be made to the State Agriculture Development Committee (SADC) for approval. Special occasion event during which fewer than 250 people will be in attendance as guests at any time would not need to receive approval, provided the owner or operator of the commercial farm complies with certain requirements set forth in section 4 of the bill. The bill directs grantees to develop an application process for special occasion events during which 250 guests or more in attendance at any time during the event, and the bill imposes certain minimum requirements on this application. For example, it requires the application to allow the grantee or the SADC as applicable, to determine the value of agricultural goods produced by the farm, the number of special occasion events already held on the farm that year, and the area of the preserved farmland to be used for the special occasion event. In addition, the application process should allow an owner or operator to submit readily available existing data or documentation. The bill would authorize a grantee or the SADC, as applicable, upon the effective date of the bill, and prior to the adoption by the SADC of rules and regulations pursuant to section 6 of the bill, to accept applications under the bill and approve applications for special occasion events that comply with the provisions of the bill. Upon the adoption of rules and regulations by the SADC under the bill, applications and approvals would also be required to comply with those rules and regulations. The bill would also allow the SADC and the appropriate grantee to inspect preserved farms on which special occasion events are held, upon presentation of appropriate credentials during normal business hours or during a special occasion event, in order to determine compliance with the bill's provisions. In addition, the bill would allow the SADC or the grantee, upon reasonable cause, to order an audit of a farm to verify that it is in compliance with the bill's provisions. Under the bill, an owner or operator of a commercial farm who violates the bill's provisions would be subject to a civil administrative penalty of up to $250 for the first offense, up to $500 for the second offense, or up to $1,000 for a third and subsequent offense. In addition, an owner or operator who repeatedly violates the bill's provisions would be prohibited from holding special occasion events on the preserved farm for a period of time that increases along with the number of violations. The bill would require the SADC to submit an annual report to the Governor and the Legislature that includes the number of special occasion events held that year, the number of audits conducted, the amount of penalties collected, and a description of any problems associated with the holding of special occasion events reported by municipalities, county agriculture development boards, and nonprofit organizations that are grantees. Finally, the bill would require the SADC to adopt rules and regulations to implement the provisions of the bill. ||In Committee | | |[A3077](/billdetail/1455059) |Requires notice prior to lapse of life insurance policy due to nonpayment of premium. || This bill requires an insurer to provide notice to the holder of an individual life insurance policy, and any producer of record on that policy, that the policy will lapse due to nonpayment of premium. The notice must be provided to the holder and any producer of record at least 10 days prior to the lapse of the policy and shall be accomplished by regular mail, electronic mail, and telephone to the holder of the life insurance policy and any producer of record, as appropriate, based on information provided by the insured and the producer and on record with the insurer. The notice required by the bill shall be in addition to any other notice concerning nonpayment of premium or lapse of the life insurance policy required under the terms of the policy. ||In Committee | | |[A2885](/billdetail/1455204) |Requires issuance of one free copy of birth certificate to military veteran. || This bill requires the issuance of one free copy of a birth certificate to a military veteran. Under the bill, a current or former member of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard is to be eligible to receive one certified copy of his or her birth certificate upon request. Additional copies of the birth certificate are to be subject to the regular statutory fee. As used in the bill, \"veteran\" means any individual who has been discharged or released from service in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, or any discharged member of the American Merchant Marine who served during World War II and is declared by the United States Department of Defense to be eligible for federal veterans' benefits. \"Veteran\" is not to include an individual discharged or released under dishonorable circumstances. ||In Committee | | |[A2883](/billdetail/1455207) |Requires child care centers to test for and remediate lead in drinking water, and disclose test results. || This bill would require child care centers to test for and remediate lead in drinking water, and disclose their test results. Specifically, under the bill, each child care center would be required to undertake periodic testing of each drinking water outlet used by the child care center in the building where the child care center is located for the presence of lead. The tests would be conducted by a certified laboratory in accordance with the sampling and testing methods specified in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) technical guidance for reducing lead in drinking water at child care centers, or more protective technical guidance that may be issued by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The initial tests would be conducted no later than 90 days after the effective date of the bill, and subsequent tests would be conducted every five years thereafter, unless the DEP determines, on a case-by-case basis, that more or less frequent testing is necessary or sufficient to protect the public health. A child care center may obtain an exemption from the requirement to conduct initial testing if it demonstrates to the DEP that it has conducted testing that substantially complies with the technical guidance within two years prior to the effective date of the bill, and any drinking water outlet that was found to have an elevated lead level has either been removed from service or remediated. Under the bill, a child care center may seek the assistance of a local health agency or public water system to help ensure compliance with the bill. Nothing in the bill would prevent a child care center from conducting more frequent testing than required by the bill. The testing requirements would not apply to a child care center that is considered a public water system under federal law and meets the applicable standards for lead in drinking water supplied by public water systems. If testing conducted pursuant to the bill reveals an elevated lead level at a drinking water outlet, the child care center would be required to immediately shut or close off access to that outlet and report the test results to the DEP. The child care center and the owner of the building in which the child care center is located, in consultation with the DEP, would be required to conduct follow-up testing to determine the source of the lead, and take appropriate remedial measures to ensure that children are not exposed to water with an elevated lead level and have access to free, fresh, and clean drinking water. Remedial measures may include permanently shutting or closing off access to the drinking water outlet, providing an alternative source of water, manual or automatic flushing, installing and maintaining a filter, and replacing outlets, plumbing, or service lines contributing to the elevated lead level. Under the bill, each child care center would be required to maintain the complete results of the testing conducted under the bill, and information on any measures being taken to remediate a drinking water outlet found to have an elevated lead level. The DEP would have the authority to inspect this information during regular business hours and without prior notice. Child care centers would also be required to post a summary of this information in a conspicuous location near the entrance of the child care center, and notify parents (including guardians) and employees of the child care center of the availability of the information. If test results reveal an elevated lead level at a drinking water outlet, the child care center would be required to immediately notify parents and child care center employees directly. The bill would require the DEP, within 30 days after the effective date of the bill, to provide to each child care center with the EPA's technical guidance for reducing lead in drinking water at child care centers, a summary of the sampling and testing methods contained in the technical guidance, a list of each laboratory in the State certified to conduct lead testing, and any other information the DEP deems relevant. ||In Committee | | |[A655](/billdetail/1422030) |Exempts discharge of student loan debt of certain veterans through the federal Total and Permanent Disability discharge process from taxation under the gross income tax. ||This bill codifies the current New Jersey gross income tax treatment of a specific type of cancellation of debt. Under current law, discharge of indebtedness is not subject to New Jersey gross income tax and is not reportable by the taxpayer. This bill would codify that treatment as it applies specifically to certain federal student loan indebtedness of a disabled veteran who has had that debt discharged through the Total and Permanent Disability discharge program of the U.S. Department of Education. Cancellation of debt, including amounts discharged through the federal Total and Permanent Disability discharge program, is not currently subject to New Jersey gross income tax. Total and Permanent Disability discharge relieves individuals who can demonstrate that they are totally and permanently disabled from having to repay certain federal student loans or comply with certain teaching obligations associated with certain federal grants. Exempts discharge of student loan debt of certain veterans through the federal Total and Permanent Disability discharge process from taxation under the gross income tax. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1966](/billdetail/1422069) |Reduces standard voter registration deadline to eight days before election; allows voter registration at polling place on election day and at offices where mail-in ballots are issued within 45 days before election. || This bill reduces the standard voter registration deadline from 21 days before election day to eight days before election day. The bill also allows persons to register to vote at their assigned polling place on election day, and at an office where a mail-in ballot may be issued during the period beginning 45 days before the election and ending at 3 P.M. the day before the election. Under the bill, an applicant registering to vote at the polling place on the day of any election, at an office where a mail-in ballot may be issued under \"The Vote By Mail Law\" for the period beginning 45 days before the election and ending at 3 P.M. the day before the election, would be required to (1) present or submit a copy of an identifying document; (2) complete an appropriate voter registration form; and (3) submit an affidavit in which the applicant declares that the applicant is not already properly registered to vote for the election in which the applicant is voting, will have lived in the county in which the applicant is voting for at least 30 days prior to that election, has not previously voted in that election, and upon voting will not thereafter vote in that election. The bill requires the commissioner of registration to designate an individual at each polling place, and at each office where a mail-in ballot may be issued, to receive and review the forms and affidavits. The commissioner's designee would be required to read to an applicant, prior to accepting the forms and affidavits, the penalty provision for voter fraud. The designee would then issue a temporary registration certificate to a qualified applicant. The certificate would be in triplicate, with one copy to be retained by the designee, one copy to be retained by the office, and one copy to be retained by the applicant. The applicant would then be permitted to vote at the polling place on election day, or immediately at the office where mail-in ballots are issued, as the case may be, in a manner promulgated by the Secretary of the State to allow verification of the applicant's identity and ensure the security of the ballot. The bill requires the commissioner of registration in each county to furnish voter registration forms and affidavit forms to each polling place and to each office where a mail-in ballot may be issued. Under the bill, the completed forms and affidavits received by the commissioner's designee at these locations would be delivered to the commissioner as soon as possible, and no later than within two days of completion. The bill directs the commissioner, upon receiving these forms, to send to the registrant written notification of the registrant's registration; to enter the information into the Statewide voter registration system; to file the records as required by current law; and, in the case of a registrant currently registered in another county of this State, to notify the commissioner of registration of such other county to delete such registrant's name from the list of persons registered in such other county. The bill also requires the commissioner to notify a registrant of the reasons for any refusal to approve that person's registration within two business days of such determination. The bill also allows the county clerk of each county to accept change of residence notices. Under current law, such notices are accepted by each county commissioner of registration and each municipal clerk. ||In Committee | | |[A1509](/billdetail/1419717) |Requires signs to be posted and pamphlets to be distributed in emergency rooms regarding VCCO. || This bill requires signs to be posted and pamphlets to be distributed in emergency rooms regarding the Victims of Crime Compensation Office. Under the bill, the Commissioner of Health (commissioner), in collaboration with the Attorney General, is to develop, prepare, and produce pamphlets and signs containing and displaying information relating to the Victims of Crime Compensation Office (VCCO). The pamphlets and signs are to be clearly written and readily comprehensible, and are to provide information concerning: (1) the services and benefits offered by the VCCO; (2) contact information for the VCCO; and (3) the procedures for filing a victim's compensation claim.

Under the bill, if a patient is unconscious or otherwise lacks the capacity to make health care decisions, the health care professional who is required to provide the information is to provide the information to the patient's designated next of kin, patient advocate, or legally authorized representative, as appropriate. If the designated next of kin, patient advocate, or legally authorized representative is unknown or is unavailable after best efforts to contact that individual, the requirement to provide the information will be deemed to be waived and the transfer of the patient to the out-of-State facility will be deemed to be authorized. The bill provides that, in the event that notice cannot be provided to the patient's health benefits plan prior to the transfer, the health care professional who is required to provide the notice is to certify that the required information was provided to the patient's designated next-of-kin, patient advocate, or legally authorized representative, or that such individual was unknown or unavailable. In addition, the health care facility will be required to notify the patient's health insurance carrier or self-funded health benefits plan sponsor of the pending transfer, and facilitate communication between the patient and the patient's carrier concerning: the network status of the health care facility located outside the State and whether the specific medical services provided by that health care facility are covered under the patient's health benefits plan; and any estimated out-of-pocket costs the patient would incur as the result of being transferred to a health care facility located outside the State. The facility will additionally be required to provide notice to the Department of Health (DOH), on a quarterly basis and in a form and manner to be determined by the DOH, of each transfer to a health care facility located outside the State and the clinical necessity or other reason for the transfer. Under the bill, a health care facility that transfers a patient to an out-of-State health care facility without an opportunity to notify the patient's health insurance carrier is to be required to certify that the patient notice requirements under the bill have been met. The bill also requires that, prior to referring a patient to an out-of-State health care professional or health care facility, a health care professional will be required to provide the patient, in writing and in a manner that is easily understood, the following information, which is to be documented in the patient record: the patient's right to receive medical care from a health care professional or facility of the patient's choosing; the clinical basis for the patient's proposed referral to an out-of-State health care professional or health care facility; the location of the out-of-State health care professional's office or the location of the out-of-State facility; whether clinically-appropriate services from an in-State health care professional or facility are available; and, if the referring health care professional is affiliated with the out-of-State health care professional or health care facility to whom the patient is to be referred, the nature of the relationship between the two professionals or the professional and the facility. In addition, the health care professional is to notify the DOH, on a quarterly basis, of each referral and the clinical necessity or other reasons for the referral. The DOH is to then forward each such notification to the Division of Consumer Affairs (Division) in the Department of Law and Public Safety. The bill mandates DOH and the Division, as applicable, to post on their respective Internet websites information, and update at least annually, the number of: patients transferred by each health care facility to an out-of-State health care facility and the services provided to those patients; the number of patients referred by in-State health care professionals to out-of-State health care professionals or health care facilities by specialty and the clinical basis for patient transfers and referrals; and the number of complaints received by DOH or the Division regarding patient transfers to out-of-State health care facilities.

JAG is a nationwide dropout prevention program which helps young people build professional skills, earn credentials, gain employment, and enter postsecondary education. Students are placed on pathways to academic and economic success through classroom learning, coaching, leadership development, and job placement. These student-centered services help young people achieve their fullest potential and gain an advantage in today's emerging workforce. Since 1980, Jobs for America's Graduates has helped over 1.4 million students nationwide complete high school, pursue a postsecondary education, and secure quality entry-level jobs that provide opportunities for career advancement. Studies have shown that those who graduate from high school are more likely to earn more over the course of their lifetimes while greatly benefitting the local economy. Currently, the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce Foundation serves as the managing unit for the JAG program here in the State and operates as \"Jobs for America's Graduates New Jersey\" (JAGNJ). The pilot program would help create programs that encourage students in underserved high schools to pursue career opportunities in the healthcare field. Funding would be used to fund JAGNJ specialist positions to provide elective courses for high school students and offer guidance to recent graduates for the twelve months following graduation. Funds would also be used to subsidize a portion of the tuition for program graduates who decide to pursue educational opportunities in healthcare at the recipient institution of higher education or proprietary institution, fund stipends to help JAGNJ with certain implementation costs, and for any other resources, events, and purposes approved by the Commissioner of Education to meet program objectives.

Bias Intimidation Under current law, N.J.S.2C:16-1, a person is guilty of the crime of bias intimidation if the person commits, attempts to commit, conspires with another to commit, or threatens the immediate commission of certain enumerated criminal offenses with any of the following states of mind: (1) with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity; (2) knowing that the conduct constituting the offense would cause an individual or group of individuals to be intimidated because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity; or (3) under circumstances that caused any victim of the underlying offense to be intimidated and the victim, considering the manner in which the offense was committed, reasonably believed either that (a) the offense was committed with a purpose to intimidate the victim or any person or entity in whose welfare the victim is interested because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity, or (b) the victim or the victim's property was selected to be the target of the offense because of the victim's race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity. These enumerated predicate offenses include criminal homicide, assault, recklessly endangering another person, terroristic threats, stalking, disarming a law enforcement officer, kidnapping and related offenses, sexual offenses, robbery, carjacking, arson and other property destruction, burglary, trespass, harassment, prohibited weapons and devices, unlawful possession of a weapon, and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. This bill adds to these enumerated offenses computer criminal activity, initiating a false alarm, and cyber-harassment. In State v. Pomianek, 221 N.J. 66 (2015), the New Jersey Supreme Court held that paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:16-1 (above) is unconstitutionally vague and violates due process because, rather than focusing on the defendant's state of mind, the law focuses on the victim's perception of the defendant's state of mind. The bill removes this unconstitutional provision from N.J.S.2C:16-1. Under the bill, it is not a defense to a prosecution for bias intimidation that a defendant acted with a purpose, in addition to a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity. The bill also provides that a defendant may be convicted of bias intimidation against a person who is associated with an individual or group because of the individual's or group's race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity, regardless of whether the victim is the same race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity as the individual or group. The bill imposes additional penalties for a conviction of bias intimidation, for each offense, in the amount of: $2,000 for a crime of the first degree; $1,000 for a crime of the second degree; $750 for a crime of the third degree; $500 for a crime of the fourth degree; and $250 for a disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offense. These penalties are to be deposited into the Bias Crime Prevention Fund, established under the bill. The monies deposited are to be used for investigating and prosecuting bias intimidation crimes; supporting community response to bias crime incidents; funding training and educational programs on bias crimes and diversity, as well as other programs designed to enhance public awareness of bias crimes and diversity. False Public Alarm Under current law, a person convicted of initiating a false public alarm is liable to a civil penalty of not less than $2,000 or the actual costs resulting from law enforcement and emergency services in response to the false alarm, whichever is higher. The bill provides for the award of a civil penalty of not less than $2,000 or treble the actual costs incurred, whichever is higher. The bill further provides that a person convicted of initiating a false alarm also is liable to a person suffering personal injury, and to the owner of property damaged as a result of law enforcement and emergency services response to the false alarm. Bias Intimidation Motivation Compensatory Damages Enhancement The bill also provides for an award of bias intimidation motivation compensatory damages enhancement. The bill defines \"bias intimidation motivation\" to mean with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression, national origin, or ethnicity, or knowing that the conduct constituting the offense would cause an individual or group of individuals to be intimidated because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity. The bill provides that, in addition to any other recovery authorized under current law, treble the amount of compensatory damages is to be awarded to a plaintiff if the plaintiff proves, by a preponderance of evidence, that the harm suffered was the result of the defendant's acts or omissions, and the acts or omissions were actuated by bias intimidation motivation. ||In Committee | | |[A1029](/billdetail/1423127) |Creates special license plates supporting Autism Awareness. || This bill authorizes the creation of a special license plate supporting Autism Awareness.

The provisions of the bill will remain inoperative until the appropriate applications and fees required to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission are provided by an individual or entity designated by the council. The bill expires after 12 months if sufficient applications and fees to offset the initial costs are not received. ||In Committee | | |[A363](/billdetail/1423144) |Requires DOH to conduct study on causes of youth suicide. || This bill requires the Department of Health (DOH) to conduct a study on the causes of youth suicide.

The department shall require, as a condition of a grant award, that the programs be updated every two years to ensure that they prepare participants adequately for the current job market in the solar energy or clean energy industry. The bill would also direct the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, in coordination with community-based organizations, to develop a program to provide entrepreneurial training, mentoring, apprenticeships, investment capital, loans, loan loss reserve funds, credit enhancement funds, or other technical and financial support to residents of overburdened communities to help launch new clean energy enterprises or establish careers in the clean energy workforce. Under the bill, the Department of Community Affairs, in consultation with the office, would require all new construction located in an overburdened community to be solar ready, and provide preference to applications for onsite, community solar, energy storage, or other clean energy projects that are sited in overburdened communities or include minority or women-owned businesses. Lastly, the bill would amend the current law establishing the Community Solar Energy Pilot Program to require the rules and regulations establishing the pilot program as a permanent program to require the provision of access to solar energy projects for low and moderate income customers in comply with the provisions of this bill. ||In Committee | | |[A1361](/billdetail/1422460) |Establishes \"New Jersey Eviction Crisis Force.\" || establishes the \"New Jersey Eviction Crisis Task Force.\" The purpose of the task force is to study recent trends in eviction actions against residents of this State, identify the impact of evictions on renters, landlords, local governments, and the State, and make recommendations for legislation and strategies to create more effective and efficient policies regarding housing and evictions in the State.

The bill also requires firearms purchaser identification cards and permits to purchase handguns to be revoked if the holder of the card or permit is convicted of a domestic violence crime or offense. The bill further requires cross-referencing of records to assist in determining whether the alleged attacker owns a firearm and in removing those firearms. Seizure of Weapon at Scene of Domestic Violence The bill requires the prosecutor, prior to returning a firearm seized at the scene of a domestic violence incident, to inform the victim of the availability of restraining orders and the ability to seek revocation of the accused person's card or permit. Domestic Violence Offenders The bill revises the law regarding defendants convicted of domestic violence crimes and offenses by: ? Requiring the sentencing court to inform defendants convicted of a domestic violence crime or offense that they are prohibited from possessing a firearm. ? Requiring the court to order the defendant to arrange for the immediate surrender of firearms, firearms purchaser identification cards, and permits to purchase a handgun to a law enforcement officer. The bill allows the defendant five days from when the order of conviction is entered to arrange to sell a surrendered firearm to a licensed firearms dealer; the dealer has 10 days from the date of the order to take possession of the firearm from the law enforcement agency to which it was surrendered. ? Deeming any identification card and permit that has been issued to the defendant to be immediately revoked and requiring the court to establish a process for notifying the appropriate authorities of the revocation. ?

The bill would also direct the DEP, every three years, to review the latest scientific information concerning neonicotinoid pesticides, and classify as a restricted use pesticide any neonicotinoid pesticide that the DEP determines will cause harm to populations of pollinating bees, birds, other pollinating wildlife, or aquatic invertebrates. A restricted use pesticide is a pesticide that can be purchased and used only by a certified and licensed pesticide applicator, or persons working under the direct supervision of the certified and licensed pesticide applicator. Under the bill, a person would be restricted from selling, offering for sale, or using within the State any neonicotinoid pesticide, unless the pesticide is registered and will only be applied by a licensed pesticide applicator to an agricultural plant. The bill would also authorize the DEP Commissioner, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, to permit a licensed pesticide applicator to use a pesticide that is prohibited under the bill if the commissioner finds that: (1) a valid environmental emergency exists; (2) the pesticide would be effective in addressing the environmental emergency; and (3) no other, less harmful pesticide or pest management practice would be effective in addressing the environmental emergency. The bill defines \"environmental emergency\" as an occurrence of any pest which presents a significant risk of harm or injury to the environment, or significant harm, injury, or loss to agricultural crops, including, but not limited to, any exotic or foreign pest which may need preventative quarantine measures to avert or prevent that risk, as determined by the DEP in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Rutgers, the State University. The provisions of the bill would not apply to: (1) any pet care, veterinary, personal care, or indoor pest control pesticide product; (2) any pesticide-treated wood product; (3) the application by a licensed pesticide applicator of a neonicotinoid pesticide within one foot of a building foundation perimeter to manage structural pests provided that the neonicotinoid pesticide is not applied on any plant; (4) any direct action taken by certified and licensed responsible pesticide applicators or by persons working under their direct supervision within the New Jersey Department of Agriculture or its agents, or within the Department of Environmental Protection or its agents, against any invasive plant or pest; or (5) any application to protect agricultural seeds. The bill provides that, notwithstanding the provisions of the bill to the contrary, the application by a licensed pesticide applicator of a neonicotinoid pesticide adjacent to a building foundation perimeter to manage structural pests may be extended by an additional four feet, if such additional area is necessary to treat the source of the infestation and the application is limited to a spot targeted treatment of the source of the infestation only. ||Dead | | |[A1481](/billdetail/1421966) |Excludes veteran disability compensation from income qualification limits under homestead property tax reimbursement program. || This bill would allow more disabled veterans to qualify for the homestead property tax reimbursement program. The homestead property tax reimbursement program reimburses eligible senior citizens and disabled persons for property tax increases. The amount of the reimbursement is the difference between the amount of property taxes that were due and paid for the \"base year\" (the first year that an individual meets all the eligibility requirements) and the amount due and paid for the year that the individual is applying for the reimbursement, provided the amount paid for the current year is greater. The bill would exclude disability compensation paid by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to a veteran from the calculation of that person's income for the purpose of determining whether the person is eligible to participate in the homestead property tax reimbursement program. ||In Committee | | |[A674](/billdetail/1422019) |Establishes New Jersey Easy Enrollment Health Insurance Program. || This bill requires the Department of Banking and Insurance to establish and operate the New Jersey Easy Enrollment Health Insurance Program (the program). The department is required to integrate the program with the State-based health insurance exchange, and may enter into an agreement with a third-party for operation of the program. The purpose of the program is to: (1) establish a State-based reporting system to provide information about the health insurance status of State residents through the use of State income tax returns to identify individuals and determine whether an individual is interested in obtaining minimum essential coverage; (2) determine whether an individual who is interested in obtaining minimum essential coverage qualifies for insurance affordability assistance; (3) proactively contact an individual who is interested in obtaining minimum essential coverage to assist in enrolling the individual in insurance affordability assistance and minimum essential coverage; and (4) maximize enrollment of eligible individuals in insurance affordability assistance and minimum essential coverage to improve access to care and reduce insurance costs for all residents of the State. The bill requires the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, the Commissioner of Human Services, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, and the State Treasurer to develop and implement systems, policies, and practices that encourage, facilitate, and streamline determination of eligibility for insurance affordability assistance and enrollment in minimum essential coverage to achieve the purposes of the program. The bill requires the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance to establish a New Jersey Easy Enrollment Health Insurance Program Advisory Workgroup to provide ongoing advice regarding the implementation of the program, which is to include representation from various organizations. The workgroup is required to meet at least once every six months. The program is required to determine eligibility for insurance affordability assistance as soon as possible after an individual files a State income tax return on which the individual indicates that the individual is seeking health benefits coverage. To the extent practicable, the program must verify an individual's eligibility for insurance affordability assistance with information on a State income tax return and other data from third-party data sources, without requesting additional information from the individual. The bill provides that if additional documentation from an individual is required to establish eligibility for insurance affordability assistance, the program must take certain steps to limit the burden on the individual. Before determining eligibility of an individual for insurance affordability assistance, the program is required to attempt to verify the citizenship status of the individual and each household member listed on the State income tax return, based on the information available from the return and reliable third-party sources of citizenship data. If this process does not confirm that the individual and each household member listed on the State income tax return is a United States citizen, the program may not seek additional verification or take other steps to determine eligibility for or enroll the individual in insurance affordability assistance until the individual provides affirmative consent using forms and procedures approved by the program. If citizenship is not verified and affirmative consent is not provided in accordance with the bill, the program may not take any further steps to determine an individual's eligibility for or enroll an individual in insurance affordability assistance. The bill requires the program to make a determination of eligibility for the State Medicaid program or the NJ FamilyCare Program before determining eligibility for any other insurance affordability assistance. If an individual is determined to be eligible for the State Medicaid program or the NJ FamilyCare Program, the procedures described in the bill and the guidelines established by the program to implement the bill apply. If an individual fails to select a managed care organization plan within a period of time established by the program, the program may assign the individual to and promptly enroll the individual in a managed care organization plan. Before an individual is assigned to a managed care organization plan, the individual is required to receive advance notice, an opportunity to select another managed care organization plan, and an opportunity to opt out of coverage. If an individual is determined to not be eligible for the State Medicaid program or the NJ FamilyCare Program, the program is required to determine whether the individual is eligible for premium tax credits or cost-sharing reductions. The bill provides that a special enrollment period for the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage Program will begin on the date the program sends notice of eligibility to the individual. The enrollment period is to last for a period of time, to be determined by the program before the start of the calendar year, that is not to be shorter than 30 days. Information about the enrollment period described in the bill must be communicated to the public and affected individuals through measures that may include language in the instructions for the State individual income tax return, if inclusion of the language is approved by the State Treasurer. The bill requires the Department of Banking and Insurance to develop data privacy and data security safeguards to govern the conveyance, storage, and utilization of data under the program. The bill requires the State Treasurer to include on the individual income tax return form a checkoff box for indicating whether the individual, or each spouse in the case of a joint return, and any individual claimed as a dependent on the tax return is uninsured at the time the tax return is filed. The bill requires the State Treasurer to include with the income tax return form a separate form that is required only for individuals who file a tax return indicating that an individual is uninsured at the time the tax return is filed. The form is required to include two checkoff boxes. One checkoff box shall give an individual who files a tax return the choice to have the program determine the individual's eligibility for insurance affordability assistance, and obtain additional data that may be relevant to determine the individual's eligibility for insurance affordability assistance. The other checkoff box shall allow an individual who files a tax return the choice to not have the program make that determination. The bill requires the State Treasurer to waive the State shared responsibility tax for any taxpayer who chooses the checkoff box indicating the taxpayer wishes the program to determine the individual's eligibility for insurance affordability assistance. If the taxpayer fails to enroll in health benefits coverage and maintain that coverage in each month following the enrollment period, the taxpayer is liable for any payments to which the taxpayer would have otherwise been subject. The bill requires the Department of Labor and Workforce Development to implement, and an individual who has filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits to consent to participate in, a system to share relevant information collected by the department with the program, the State-based exchange established pursuant to P.L.2019, c.141 (C.17B:27A-57 et seq.), the Department of Banking and Insurance, and the Department of Human Services to determine whether the individual qualifies for the State Medicaid program or the NJ FamilyCare Program, or any other insurance affordability assistance. An individual who consents to participation in such a system is also eligible for a special enrollment period for the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage Program. The bill takes effect immediately and applies to tax returns filed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, unless the State Treasurer determines, after consultation with the Department of Banking and Insurance and the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, that the implementation of the bill is not administratively feasible for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, in which case the Treasurer may delay implementation to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1805](/billdetail/1422036) |Allows termination of motor vehicle lease in event of death; prohibits imposition of fee for early termination. || This bill allows a motor vehicle lease to be terminated upon the death of the lessee and the return of the vehicle to the dealer or lessor. The bill prohibits a dealer or lessor from imposing or assessing any fee for the early termination of a vehicle lease in the event of a lessee's death. However, the dealer or lessor would be permitted to assess a reasonable fee for a vehicle returned with excess wear, use, or mileage, if specified in the lease agreement. The bill also prohibits a lease from requiring, in the event of a lessee's death, that the decedent's surviving spouse, family member, guardian, or estate administrator or executor: 1) purchase the leased vehicle; 2) buy out the remainder of the lease; or 3) continue to lease the vehicle under the original terms of the lease. A surviving spouse, family member, guardian, or estate administrator or executor would need to provide a death certificate, or other satisfactory proof of the lessee's death, to the dealer or lessor within 60 days after the death of the decedent. The bill provides that it is not to be construed as applying to a surviving co-lessee who executed the motor vehicle lease agreement with the lessee. Further, the bill requires that dealers and lessors provide information about early termination in the event of death in the lease contract or financing agreement. A dealer or lessor in violation of this requirement would be subject to a $500 penalty. ||In Committee | | |[A672](/billdetail/1421757) |Establishes Water Apprenticeship, Training, and Employment Resources (WATER) Pilot Program in DOLWD; appropriates $1 million. || This bill would create a five-year Water Apprenticeship, Training, and Employment Resources (\"WATER\") Pilot Program in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DOLWD) to provide grants to support funding for newly-established adult apprenticeship programs in the water infrastructure, water utilities, and other water-related sectors, focusing on underserved and underrepresented communities. Any organizational sponsor of an apprenticeship program would be eligible to receive a grant, including businesses, labor organizations, colleges, workforce training providers, non-profit organizations, public utilities, local government entities and authorities, and trade organizations, provided that they have secured an industry partner or a monetary or in-kind funding contribution. Under the bill, grant applications would be accepted starting July 1, 2021, and the grants would be awarded no later than January 1, 2022. The DOLWD would rank eligible applicants for grants based upon each applicant's potential to reach a broad audience through its recruitment and outreach efforts, significantly increase enrollment and completion of the apprenticeship program, including among members of underserved and underrepresented communities, and fill existing needs for skilled workers in the market. Beginning January 1, 2022, and each year thereafter for the duration of the pilot grant program, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development would be required to submit to the Governor and the Legislature a report that evaluates the results of the program and its effectiveness. In addition, the bill would create a special, non-lapsing fund in (to be known as the \"WATER Fund\") in the Department of the Treasury to collect and invest moneys to be used for the purposes of the bill. The bill also directs the Treasury to solicit grants from interested public or private sources for the fund. ||In Committee | | |[A1957](/billdetail/1420944) |The \"Liberty State Park Protection Act\"; establishes Liberty State Park Advisory Committee and requirements concerning DEP actions related to Liberty State Park. || This bill, to be known as the \"Liberty State Park Protection Act,\" would preserve Liberty State Park as a public urban green open space with authority for limited privatization by establishing certain requirements concerning actions by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) related to Liberty State Park and establishing a Liberty State Park Advisory Committee (committee). The bill would prohibit the DEP from considering any proposal to commercialize, develop, or privatize Liberty State Park, except as provided in the bill. The bill would restrict the DEP from conveying, leasing, or otherwise transferring any property rights within the 235-acre natural restoration area in the interior of Liberty State Park, and at Caven Point Peninsula. The bill would require the DEP, within five years after the bill is enacted into law, and after consultation with the committee, to develop a management plan for Liberty State Park. The DEP would be required to consult the committee for review and recommendations: (1) prior to entering into any agreement for a concession, conveyance, or lease or any other transfer of property rights; and (2) prior to the extension or renewal for a term of one year or longer any lease in effect on the date the bill is enacted into law. In addition, the bill directs the DEP to develop and implement, in conjunction with the committee, a public participation process to allow public citizens and civic organizations to provide public input on any proposed changes in land use at Liberty State Park or to the management plan developed pursuant the bill, and to also, at least once each year, hold a public forum to receive input from the public concerning plans, improvements, preservation, conservation, and management of the park, in addition to any public hearings that may be required pursuant to law. The bill also directs the DEP to develop a map depicting Liberty State Park. Under the bill, the DEP would only approve an agreement for a concession, conveyance, lease, or other agreement with a private entity to provide small-scale commercial activities if the agreement enhances the experience of a visitor to Liberty State Park, such as a bicycle or kayak rental concession, food concession, temporary winter skating rink, commercial boat tour operating from an existing boat slip, and use of the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal (\"CRRNJ Terminal\"), and other uses identified in the management plan developed pursuant to the bill. In addition, whenever the DEP proposes to enter into a concession, lease, or other agreement for a duration of one year or longer, the DEP would be required to present the proposal to the committee for review and recommendations and provide an opportunity for public comment on the proposal, including holding two public hearings at Liberty State Park, with one hearing being held on a weekday evening and one on the weekend, and providing a 30-day public comment period. In addition, the DEP would be required to take these same actions when it intends to convey lands acquired or developed by the State with Green Acres funds, or acquired or developed by the State in any other manner and administered by the department, located within or adjacent to Liberty State Park. The Liberty State Park Advisory Committee established by the bill would be charged with assisting the DEP in conserving, preserving, protecting, and improving Liberty State Park. In carrying out its responsibilities, the committee would give due consideration to the natural, historic, cultural, recreational, and scenic resources and the local, State, and national significance of Liberty State Park. The committee's responsibilities would include: assisting the DEP in developing the management plan required by the bill, and advising the DEP on the ecological restoration of the 235-acre interior portion of the park and means to increase public access and public enjoyment of the natural, historic, cultural, recreational, and scenic resources of the park; reviewing and making recommendations concerning concessions, leases, or other transfer of property rights with a duration of one year or longer; and submitting to the DEP Commissioner any recommendations the committee deems necessary to improve, protect the park. In addition, this bill would amend the \"State Park and Forestry Resources Act,\" P.L.1983, c. 324 (C.13:1L-1 et seq.), which, in part, allows the DEP to enter agreements with private entities for the construction, operation, and maintenance for private profit of any facility, utility, or device in State parks and forests as the DEP finds proper for the use and enjoyment of the lands by the public. This bill would amend the law to reflect the provisions of this bill concerning agreements related to Liberty State Park. Lastly, the bill would amend the \"Hackensack Meadowlands Agency Consolidation Act\" to delete the provision that provided the commission, i.e., the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which under current law is also referred to as the \"Meadowlands Regional Commission,\" with certain authority concerning Liberty State Park. ||In Committee | | |[AR25](/billdetail/1421177) |Urges President and Congress of the United States to create National Infrastructure Bank. ||Urges President and Congress of the United States to create National Infrastructure Bank. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A496](/billdetail/1420462) |Requires school districts and nonpublic schools to develop emergency operations plans; requires school districts to provide instruction on environmental and natural disasters to students enrolled in grades kindergarten through 12. || This bill requires school districts and nonpublic schools to develop emergency operations plans. The bill also requires school districts to provide instruction on environmental and natural disasters to students enrolled in grades kindergarten through 12. Under the bill, the board of education of each school district and the chief school administrator of each nonpublic school is required to develop and coordinate an emergency operations plan to ensure the continuity of essential school functions under all circumstances. The plan is required to identify a baseline of preparedness for all potential emergencies and be coordinated with State and local authorities. The bill requires the plan to include, but not be limited to, the following components: identification of essential functions, programs, and personnel; procedures to implement the plan; delegation of authority and lines of succession; identification of alternative facilities and related infrastructure, including those for communications; identification and protection of vital records and databases; and schedules and procedures for periodic tests, training, and exercises. The plan will be consistent with the local emergency operations plan of the municipality or municipalities in which the school district or nonpublic school is located. The bill directs the board of education or chief school administrator to adopt and submit for review an emergency operations plan to the Commissioner of Education, the State Office of Emergency Management, the Department of Health, and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness within six months of the bill's effective date. The board or administrator will be required to review, update, and resubmit the plan to the offices every five years. Under the bill, the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, the State Office of Emergency Management, the Department of Health, and the Commissioner of Education will be required to review the emergency operations plans submitted and, when necessary, make recommendations for a plan's improvement. An emergency operation plan prepared pursuant to this bill will not be considered a government record under the State's open public records act and, therefore, will not be available for public inspection, copying, or the purchase of copies. The bill also requires the board of education or chief school administrator of a nonpublic school to ensure that students enrolled in the school district or nonpublic school annually receive appropriate instruction related to the emergency operations plan adopted by the board of education or chief school administrator. The instruction will include the expectations and responsibilities of students in the event that an emergency occurs.

This bill requires an ammunition purchaser to also exhibit a driver's license, nondriver identification card, or other government-issued form of photo identification at the time of purchase. The bill requires a manufacturer or dealer of handgun ammunition to keep a detailed, electronic record of handgun ammunition sales. The electronic record maintained by the manufacturer or wholesale dealer is required to contain the date of the transaction; the type, caliber, or gauge of the ammunition; the quantity of ammunition sold; the name and address of the purchaser; and any other information deemed necessary by the Superintendent of State Police. The electronic record maintained by the retail dealer is required to contain the name of the manufacturer, the date of the transaction, the type, caliber, or gauge of the ammunition; the quantity of the ammunition sold; the name, address, and date of birth of the purchaser; the identification used to establish the identity of the purchaser; and any other information deemed necessary by the superintendent. A manufacturer or dealer that is unable to maintain record in an electronic form is to be given 12 months from the effective date of this bill to establish a system for maintaining electronic records of the transfer of handgun ammunition. The electronic records are required to be made available for inspection at all reasonable hours by any law enforcement officer. In addition, the bill requires electronic reporting of handgun, firearm, and handgun ammunition sales. Under the bill, every retail dealer is required to electronically report firearm, handgun, and handgun ammunition sales and transfers to the superintendent. The superintendent would be required to develop a program for retail dealers to electronically report this information. Regarding handgun ammunition, the reported information is to include the date of the transaction; the name of the manufacturer, the caliber or gauge, and the quantity of ammunition sold or transferred; the name, address, and date of birth of the purchaser; the identification used to establish the identity of the purchaser; and any other information that the superintendent requires. A retail dealer of handgun ammunition may charge a fee not to exceed $5 for a transaction that is required to be electronically reported. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1525](/billdetail/1420447) |Prohibits the sale of certain children's products containing lead, mercury, or cadmium. || This bill would prohibit the sale, distribution, import, or manufacture of any children's product intended for use by a child under the age of six which contains, is composed of, or is made with lead, mercury, or cadmium. The Director of Consumer Affairs or any manufacturer, distributor, or importer of children's products, who discovers that a children's product intended for use by a child under the age of six contains, is composed of, or is made with lead, mercury, or cadmium, would be required to issue an immediate recall for that product. Within 48 hours of receiving notice of the recall, retail mercantile establishments would be required to remove the children's product from displays and make it unavailable for purchase. Within 14 business days, retail mercantile establishments would be required to return all inventory of the children's product to the manufacturer, distributor, or importer from which it was obtained, at the cost of the manufacturer, distributor, or importer. The manufacturer, distributor, or importer would then have 60 business days to destroy the children's product in such a way that renders it useless, and to dispose of the remnants in a manner and location designed to remove them from access by the general public. The bill specifies the following penalties for violations: \u00b7 knowingly selling, offering for sale, distributing, importing, or manufacturing a children's product intended for use by a child under the age of six which contains, is composed of, or is made with lead, mercury, or cadmium would be an unlawful practice; \u00b7 failing to remove the recalled children's product from displays, make it unavailable for purchase, or return it to the manufacturer, distributor, or importer within the required timeframe would be an unlawful practice; and \u00b7 a manufacturer, distributor, or importer failing to issue an immediate recall or destroy and dispose of children's products returned to them as a result of a recall, as required, would be a crime of the fourth degree for a first offense, a crime of the third degree for a second offense, and a crime of the second degree for a third or subsequent offense. An unlawful practice under the consumer fraud act is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense. In addition, a violation can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured. A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment, a fine of $10,000, or both. A crime of the third degree is punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of $15,000, or both, and a crime of the second degree is punishable by five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of $150,000, or both. ||In Committee | | |[A1181](/billdetail/1420000) |Requires high school students to complete financial aid applications. ||Requires high school students to complete financial aid applications. ||Crossed Over | | |[A1183](/billdetail/1420043) |\"Reproductive Freedom Act.\" || This bill, to be known as the \"Reproductive Freedom Act,\" would make various changes to the law to facilitate and safeguard the individual right to reproductive autonomy in the State. The State Supreme Court has held that the New Jersey Constitution protects the right to reproductive autonomy and choice, including the right to choose abortion, to an extent that exceeds the protections found in the federal Constitution. Although the right to reproductive choice and autonomy, including the right to choose abortion, is not specifically expressed within the text of the State Constitution, the Supreme Court has concluded that the right to reproductive autonomy derives from the provisions of Article I, paragraph 1 of the State Constitution, which provide extensive protections for individual liberty and privacy to an extent that exceeds the protections established under the United States Constitution. This bill would make it express, within the State's statutory law, that every individual in the State, regardless of whether they are domiciled in the State, and regardless of whether or not the individual is under State control, has a fundamental right to: 1) choose or refuse contraception or sterilization; and 2) choose whether to carry a pregnancy, to give birth, or to have an abortion. Under the bill's provisions, no individual would be subject to prosecution or otherwise deprived of their individual constitutional rights for terminating or attempting to terminate the individual's own pregnancy or for acting or failing to act, in any manner, with respect to the individual's own pregnancy, based on the potential or actual impact on the individual's own health or pregnancy. The bill specifies that no public entity may, in the regulation or provision of benefits, facilities, services, or information, deny or interfere with an individual's fundamental reproductive rights, as expressed in the bill. The bill further provides that, in protecting or enforcing the fundamental reproductive rights recognized by the bill, a public entity may not discriminate on the basis of: sex, including, but not limited to, sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or perceived gender identity or expression; disability; status; or economic status. The bill specifies that a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus may not be understood to have independent rights under any of the laws of this State, and it further specifies that any health care professional, acting within the professional's lawful scope of practice and in compliance with generally applicable regulations, is authorized to provide abortion care. Current regulations of the State Board of Medical Examiners and the Commissioner of Human Services, which are codified in Titles 10 and 13 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, specifically regulate the procedures that may be used in the termination of pregnancy and limit coverage for abortion based on the type of facility and professional that provides the abortion services. Because these existing regulations are medically unnecessary forms of abortion regulation, which conflict with the purposes of the bill, the bill would specify that, following its effective date, these and all other rules or regulations that specifically regulate and apply exclusively to the termination of pregnancy or are otherwise inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions or express or implied purposes of the bill will become void, inoperable, and unenforceable. Any person who is aggrieved by an action that is undertaken in violation of the bill's provisions will be entitled to bring suit under the \"New Jersey Civil Rights Act,\" P.L.2004, c.143 (C.10:6-1 et seq.) or to enforce the bill's provisions in any other manner provided by law. In addition to recognizing an individual's fundamental rights to reproductive autonomy and choice, the bill also requires all providers of health insurance (including hospital service corporations, medical service corporations, health service corporations, individual and group health insurance carriers, individual and group health benefits plans, the State Health Benefits Commission, and the School Employees' Health Benefits Commission) to provide coverage for abortion. An insurance contract, policy, or plan may not impose any restrictions or delays on, and may not require prior authorization for, the abortion coverage required by the bill. An insurance contract, policy, or plan also may not impose any deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or other cost-sharing requirement on the coverage required by the bill and, for a qualifying high-deductible health plan for a health savings account, the cost-sharing for coverage is to be set at the minimum level necessary to preserve the covered person's ability to claim tax-exempt contributions and withdrawals from the covered person's health savings account under 26 U.S.C. s.223. Notwithstanding the bill's insurance coverage requirements, if the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance concludes that the provision of insurance coverage for abortion, in accordance with the bill, might adversely affect the allocation of federal funds to the State, the commissioner may grant an exemption to the coverage requirements, but only to the minimum extent necessary to ensure the continued receipt of federal funds. In addition, the bill provides that religious employers will be eligible to request and obtain an exclusion from the bill's abortion coverage requirements if the required coverage conflicts with the religious employer's bona fide religious beliefs and practices. A religious employer that obtains such an exclusion will be required to provide written notice thereof to covered persons and prospective covered persons. The bill specifies, however, that nothing in its provisions may be construed as authorizing an insurance carrier to exclude coverage for abortion care that is necessary to preserve the life or health of the covered person. The bill also amends the existing insurance laws that pertain to the provision of coverage for contraceptive care in order to require coverage for the dispensing of a single dispensing unit of up to a 13-unit supply of prescription contraceptives, intended to last over a 12-month period, regardless of whether coverage was in effect at the time of the first dispensing, and except in cases where a 12-month supply would extend beyond the terms of the insurance contract, policy, or plan. Current law requires coverage for only a three-month period in association with the first dispensing of a contraceptive and for a six-month period in association with any subsequent dispensing of the same contraceptive. The bill authorizes the contraceptives to be furnished over the course of the 12-month period at the discretion of the health care provider, and it prohibits an insurance carrier from imposing any restrictions or delays on, or requiring any prior authorization for, the provision of contraceptive coverage. Like the bill's provisions pertaining to insurance coverage for abortion, the bill authorizes a religious employer to request and obtain an exclusion from the bill's contraceptive coverage requirements if the required coverage conflicts with the religious employer's bona fide religious beliefs and practices. A religious employer that obtains such an exclusion will need to provide written notice thereof to covered persons and prospective covered persons, which notice is to list the contraceptive health care services that the employer refuses to cover for religious reasons. Nothing in the bill's provisions may be deemed to authorize an insurance carrier to exclude coverage for contraceptive care that is necessary to preserve the life or health of the covered person. In addition to amending the existing laws pertaining to contraceptive coverage, the bill would supplement the existing law in order to require the School Employees' Health Benefits Commission to provide coverage for contraceptives to the same extent as is required of all other insurance carriers under the bill's provisions. Existing law does not require the School Employees' Health Benefits Commission to provide coverage for contraceptives, despite the fact that all other insurance carriers are required to provide such coverage. The bill further requires the Department of Human Services (DHS) to establish and administer a program to reimburse the cost of prenatal, labor, and delivery care, as well as abortion care and contraceptives, which are provided by a hospital service corporation to individuals who can become pregnant and would be eligible for medical assistance if not for the provisions of 8 U.S.C. s.1611 or 8 U.S.C. s.1612, which provisions prohibit certain immigrants from obtaining public benefits. The reimbursement program is to incorporate any existing programs and funding streams that provide coverage or reimbursement for prenatal, labor, and delivery care received by relevant immigrants. The DHS, in collaboration with other appropriate agencies, will be required to explore any and all opportunities to obtain federal financial participation to offset the costs of implementing the reimbursement program; however, the implementation of the program will not be contingent upon the department's receipt of a waiver or other authorization from the federal government to operate a demonstration project. The bill would provide for the State Legislature to annually appropriate the amount necessary to pay the reasonable and necessary expenses of the program, which expenses are to be determined by the DHS. The bill requires both the Commissioner of Human Services and the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance to adopt rules and regulations to implement the bill's provisions. The bill additionally requires each professional licensing board operating under the authority of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety to adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the \"Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), with respect to the health care professionals under each licensing board's respective jurisdiction, as may be necessary to implement the bill's provisions. The rules and regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Human Services under the bill are to include, but need not be limited to, rules and regulations permitting electronic billing for abortion services, which rules and regulations are to be promulgated by January 1, 2022. The bill specifies that it is to be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes. If any provision of the bill is deemed by a court to be inconsistent with, in conflict with, or contrary to, any other provision of law, the provision contained in the bill will prevail over the other, contradictory, provision of law, and such other provision of law is to be deemed amended, superseded, or repealed to the extent necessary to reconcile the inconsistency or conflict and ensure the law's consistency with the provisions of the bill. If any provision of the bill, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remaining provisions of the bill, and the application of the provision at issue to all other persons or circumstances, will not be affected thereby. The bill would amend the existing law pertaining to autopsies and medicolegal death investigations to eliminate the requirement that a medicolegal death investigation be conducted in a case where a fetal death occurs without medical attendance. The bill would also repeal the \"Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997,\" sections 1 through 3 of P.L.1997, c.262 (C.2A:65A-5 through C.2A:65A-7), and the \"Parental Notification for Act,\" sections 2 through 13 of P.L.1999, c.145 (C.9:17A-1.1 through C.9:17A-1.12), each of which has been found by the New Jersey Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, void, and unenforceable. Finally, the bill would amend the law at section 1 of P.L.1999, c.145 (C.9:17A-1), which governs the consent of minors to medical treatment, in order to eliminate a cross-reference to the \"Parental Notification for Abortion Act\" and thereby ensure that the statutory law conforms to the existing case law in this area, which allows an unmarried, pregnant minor to give consent to the furnishing of hospital, medical, and surgical care related to her pregnancy or child, without the need to notify her parents. ||In Committee | | |[A1854](/billdetail/1419756) |Directs Secretary of Higher Education to study prevalence, cost, and quality of certain on-line courses compared to traditional classroom courses offered by institutions of higher education. || This bill directs the Secretary of Higher Education to conduct a study to examine the prevalence, cost, and quality of on-line courses offered for credit by institutions of higher education upon payment of a fee. Under the bill, the study would only pertain to such on-line courses and must include: a list of the specific on-line courses made available by each institution; the cost of offering an on-line course at the institution compared to the cost of a traditional, classroom-based course at the institution; the overall number and percentage of part-time and full-time students who enroll in at least one on-line course at each institution; the total amount of savings generated from offering on-line courses compared to classroom-based courses realized by each institution in an academic year; whether the quantified savings are used by the institution to benefit the students enrolled in the institution and, if so, the manner in which those savings are used to reduce student costs; the average completion rate and average grade for the students enrolled in each on-line course offered by each institution; the overall four-year and six-year graduation rates for students who enroll in at least one on-line course at each institution of higher education compared to the average four-year and six-year graduation rates for students who do not enroll in an on-line course at the institution; and an assessment of the policies and procedures each institution of higher education has in place to ensure that institutional support, technological support, and faculty support are provided to students enrolled in on-line courses to ensure a high quality educational experience. The bill requires the secretary to prepare and submit a report of the study's findings to the Senate Higher Education Committee and the Assembly Higher Education Committee within 180 days of its effective date. ||In Committee | | |[A1996](/billdetail/1419781) |Prohibits manufacture, sale, or promotion of consumer products containing microbeads. || This bill would prohibit the manufacture, sale, and promotion of consumer products containing plastic microbeads, beginning on January 1, 2022. The bill defines \"consumer products\" as products that are customarily produced for consumption by individuals for personal care or for the performance of services ordinarily rendered within the household, and which are designed to be expended in the course of such use. Microbeads are small plastic particles commonly used to exfoliate or cleanse. Although microbeads are effective abrasive agents, they end up in fresh waters and the ocean, where they are eaten by fish and other wildlife and enter the food chain. Some studies indicate that microbeads may absorb contaminants from the surrounding environment, such as harmful bacteria found in wastewater treatment plants. Microbeads also may contain chemicals left over from the manufacturing process. Current State law prohibits the manufacture, sale, and promotion of personal care products containing microbeads. In addition, the federal \"Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015\" prohibits the manufacturing, packaging, and distribution of rinse-off cosmetics containing microbeads. This bill would expand the prohibition to include all consumer products. ||In Committee | | |[A2021](/billdetail/1420065) |Requires embryo storage facilities to record and report health information of patients in manner that is consistent with certain federal laws. || This bill requires embryo storage facilities to record and report health information of patients in a manner that is consistent with certain federal laws. Under the bill, within 90 days after the bill's effective date, as a condition of continued or new licensure, an embryo storage facility that is required to record or report the health information of a patient, is to record and report the patient's health information using a program that is compliant with the \"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,\" Pub.L.104-191 and requirements adopted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regarding functions, technological capabilities, and security features within the program. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[S553](/billdetail/1419853) |Adds technology transfer duties to New Jersey Commission on Science, Innovation and Technology. ||Adds technology transfer duties to New Jersey Commission on Science, Innovation and Technology. ||Crossed Over | | |[A2025](/billdetail/1419855) |Establishes requirements for certain tobacco product retailers to stock and sell nicotine replacement therapy products. || This bill requires any entity that sells, offers for sale, or distributes for commercial purpose any tobacco product to maintain a stock of, and offer for retail sale, at least one type of nicotine replacement therapy drug, device, or combination product that has been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for cessation of tobacco use pursuant to the \"Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" 21 U.S.C. s.301 et seq. This requirement will not apply to cigar shops, which are defined under the bill to mean retail establishments wherein the only tobacco products and products related to tobacco use that are available for sale or commercial distribution are cigars and cigar accessories. An entity that is subject to these requirements will have the discretion to determine the number and type of nicotine replacement therapy products that the entity will stock and offer for sale, as well as the quantity of the product that is stocked and offered for sale and whether the entity will stock and offer for sale more than one type of nicotine replacement therapy product. All nicotine replacement therapy products offered for retail sale are to be displayed in a location that is behind the sales counter. An entity that sells out of the entity's full stock of nicotine replacement therapy products will have five business days to place an order for a new stock of nicotine replacement therapy products, and will have 14 days from the date the entity sells its last nicotine replacement therapy product to again stock and offer for retail sale a nicotine replacement therapy product. The entity will be required to additionally display: 1) printed notice that nicotine replacement therapy products are available for retail sale at that location; and 2) the official logo, phone number, and Internet address of the NJ Smoking Quitline or a successor program. The Commissioner of Health may establish requirements concerning how and where these materials are to be displayed, as well as requirements concerning the size and other characteristics of the materials. ||In Committee | | |[A1991](/billdetail/1419833) |Clarifies statutory exemptions from mandatory immunization requirements for child care center and school attendance. || This bill revises the requirements concerning exemptions from mandatory student immunization requirements. Under the bill, provisions in the State Sanitary Code, or provisions otherwise set forth in statute or regulation, which require the immunization of children in public or private licensed child care centers and students at public or private elementary or secondary schools and institutions of higher education, are to provide for an exemption from the mandatory immunization requirements based upon a statement submitted to the child care center, elementary or secondary school, or institution of higher education, as applicable, using a standard form designated by the Department of Health by a licensed physician, doctor of osteopathy, or advanced practice nurse indicating: (1) that the vaccine is medically contraindicated for a specific period of time; (2) the professional's full name, address, and national provider identifier (or the national provider identifier of the professional's collaborating physician); and (3) the reasons for the medical contraindication, which are to be valid medical reasons consistent with guidelines issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The child or student will be exempt from receiving the indicated vaccination for the stated period of time. In addition, the bill authorizes an exemption from mandatory immunization requirements for a child or student who has a sibling who experienced a vaccine injury. To qualify for the exemption, the child or student will be required to submit to the Department of Health documentation of a final determination of vaccine injury issued through the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration in the United States Department of Health and Human Services or a final judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that includes a finding of vaccine injury. Documentation of the department's approval of a sibling vaccine injury exemption will be submitted to the school or child care center by the child or student, or by the child or student's parent or guardian, if the child or student is a minor. Medical and sibling vaccine injury exemptions may be subject to review and approval by a physician employed by or consulting for the county or local board of health, and may be audited by county and local boards of health. Approved medical and sibling vaccine injury exemptions will be forwarded for inclusion in the New Jersey Immunization Information System (NJIIS). The bill requires the NJIIS to be updated no later than one year after the effective date of the bill to allow for the inclusion of medical exemption information, and to allow for a printable report of information included in the registry. The bill prohibits a public child care center, elementary or secondary school, or institution of higher education from exempting a child or student from a mandatory immunization unless the child or student, or the child's or student's parent or guardian if the child or student is a minor, complies with all of the applicable requirements set forth in the bill. The bill allows nonpublic child care centers, preschool programs, elementary and secondary schools, and institutions of higher education to adopt a policy authorizing the admission of children and students who are not in full compliance with mandatory immunization requirements and who do not meet the requirements for a medical or sibling vaccine injury exemption, provided that the facility requires each child or student enrolled in the child care center, preschool program, school, or institution of higher education, or the child's or student's parent or guardian if the child or student is a minor, to sign an acknowledgement form, at the time of enrollment, that sets forth the facility's policy with regard to admitting children or students who are not in full compliance with mandatory immunization requirements, and that indicates the immunization rates for the facility for the prior academic year. The child care center, preschool program, school, or institution of higher education will additionally be required to prominently post its policy concerning the admission of children or students who are not fully immunized, and the facility's immunization rates for the prior academic year, at each entrance to the facility. The Commissioner of Health will be required to adopt rules and regulations concerning the format of acknowledgement forms used by nonpublic schools for this purpose. A child or student who is not in compliance with mandatory immunization requirements who seeks to attend the nonpublic child care center, preschool program, school, or institution of higher education will be required to provide the facility with written notice of which specific immunization requirements the child or student is not in compliance with and sign a form that states that the child or student, or the child or student's parent or guardian, as applicable, understands the risks and benefits of vaccination and acknowledges that the child or student may be excluded from attendance in the event of the occurrence of a communicable disease or condition or threat of a communicable disease or condition. The bill provides that the current statutory list of uses for the NJIIS is nonexclusive. The bill additionally removes a provision of current law that provides that an agency, organization, or other entity authorized to access information in the NJIIS may not use any report made by a health care provider in any punitive manner against the provider. The bill provides the Commissioner of Health with expedited rulemaking authority in order to provide guidance to child care centers, schools, and public health authorities, as they will need to implement its provisions on a timely basis, including creating acknowledgement forms that may be used by nonpublic institutions that admit children and students who are not fully compliant with mandatory immunization requirements. The provisions of the bill will take effect 180 days after the date of enactment. ||In Committee | | |[A1990](/billdetail/1420491) |Requires DEP to adopt Statewide plan to reduce lead exposure from contaminated soils and drinking water. || This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection to develop and adopt, within one year after the effective date of the bill, a Statewide plan to reduce public exposure to lead in the environment. The department would be required to use existing soil testing results from site remediations that have been submitted to the department, as well as public water supply and private well testing results and any other relevant information it may have, in preparing the plan and any updates thereto. The department would be required to designate those geographic areas where lead in soils or drinking water poses the greatest danger of exposure to the public. The bill would require the department to identify public moneys that may be used to address the risks of exposure to lead and prioritize the expenditure of public moneys to remediate soils or drinking water supplies to minimize those risks. The bill would also require the department to develop a public education program to ensure the widespread dissemination of information concerning the health risks posed by lead exposure and measures that may be taken to minimize the risks. ||In Committee | | |[A2008](/billdetail/1420526) |Requires health insurance carriers to provide coverage for treatment of mental health conditions and substance use disorders through collaborative care. || This bill requires hospital, medical and health service corporations, commercial insurers, health maintenance organizations, health benefits plans issued pursuant to the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage and Small Employer Health Benefits Programs, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees' Health Benefits Program, to provide coverage for benefits provided through the collaborative care model in the treatment of mental health conditions and substance use disorders. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1995](/billdetail/1419945) |Requires DOH to conduct survey on status of antenatal and prenatal care clinics in New Jersey. || This bill requires the Commissioner of Health to conduct a survey and analysis of antenatal and prenatal care clinics for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of maternity, antenatal, and prenatal care services throughout the State. The survey includes data collected from all antenatal and prenatal care clinics in the State, including antenatal and prenatal care clinics that have closed or substantially ceased operation of any of its beds, facilities, or services, within a two-year period prior to the effective date of the bill. As used in the bill, \"antenatal and prenatal care clinic\" means an inpatient or ambulatory health care facility licensed by the Department of Health that provides maternity, antenatal, and prenatal care services. The purpose of the survey is to: inform policy on the certificate of need requirements as provided by P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.) concerning the closure or discontinuance of all, or a component of, antenatal and prenatal care clinic's services; assess the availability of antenatal and prenatal care clinics and their ability to provide maternity, antenatal, and prenatal care services; identify where low and moderate income pregnant women receive maternity, antenatal, and prenatal care services; and collect cultural, demographic, and socioeconomic background data about the pregnant women served by antenatal and prenatal care clinics. The collected survey data is to be analyzed to: identify local and Statewide trends and developments in the provision of maternity, antenatal, and prenatal care services and disparities in the care received by pregnant women based on economic factors and the accessibility of antenatal and prenatal care clinics; and develop programs, resources, and strategies to improve access to, and the quality of, maternity, antenatal, and prenatal care services throughout the State. Survey data is to be made available through the Department of Health's website, and the commissioner is to submit a report to the Legislature concerning the results of the survey and any recommendations for legislation or other action. The bill specifies that published and reported data is not to include any personal identifying information or confidential patient information. The bill authorizes the commissioner to contract with a third party entity to administer the survey, review survey data, and produce the required report. ||In Committee | | |[A2002](/billdetail/1419965) |Requires State registrar to permit county surrogate to provide certified copy of death certificate to authorized person under certain circumstances. || This bill requires the State registrar in the Department of Health to permit, upon the request of a county surrogate on behalf of an authorized person, a county surrogate to have real-time access, and facilitate a county surrogate's access, to the necessary vital statistics records in order for the county surrogate to provide a certified copy of a death certificate to the authorized person. Under the bill, the authorized person is required to be otherwise engaged in receiving services provided by the requesting county surrogate. Under current law, an authorized person includes the following: the parent, legal guardian or other legal representative of the subject of that record; the subject's spouse, child, grandchild or sibling, if of legal age, or the subject's legal representative; an agency of State or federal government for official purposes; a person possessing an order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or a person who is authorized under other emergent circumstances as determined by the commissioner.

Under the bill, the Commissioner of Human Services (commissioner) is to, on or before July 16, 2022, designate a crisis hotline center or centers to provide crisis intervention services and crisis care coordination to individuals accessing the 9-8-8 suicide prevention and behavioral health crisis hotline from anywhere within the State 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A designated hotline center is to have an active agreement with the administrator of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) for participation within the network. To ensure cohesive and coordinated crisis care, a designated hotline center is to utilize technology that is interoperable between and across crisis and emergency response systems used throughout the State and with the Administrator of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The bill provides that a designated hotline center is to have the authority to deploy crisis and outgoing services, including mobile crisis teams, and coordinate access to crisis receiving and stabilization services as appropriate and according to guidelines and best practices established by the NSPL. A designated hotline center is to coordinate access to crisis receiving and stabilization services for individuals accessing the 9-8-8 suicide prevention and behavioral health crisis hotline through appropriate information sharing regarding availability of services. The commissioner is to have primary oversight of suicide prevention and crisis service activities and essential coordination with a designated 9-8-8 hotline center. A designated hotline center is to meet the requirements set forth by NSPL for serving high risk and specialized populations as identified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, including training requirements and policies for transferring such callers to an appropriate specialized center or subnetworks within or outside the NSPL network and for providing linguistically and culturally competent care. A designated hotline center is to provide follow-up services to individuals accessing the 9-8-8 suicide prevention and behavioral health crisis hotline consistent with guidance and policies established by the NSPL. Under the bill, the commissioner is to provide onsite response services for crisis calls utilizing State or local mobile crisis teams. A mobile crisis team is to include a behavioral health team, licensed behavioral health professionals, and peers, or a behavioral health team and peers embedded within an emergency medical services entity. A mobile crisis team is to collaborate on data and crisis response protocols with local law enforcement agencies and include police as co-responders in behavioral health teams, and licensed behavioral health professionals and peers, only as needed to respond to high-risk situations that are unmanageable without law enforcement. A mobile crisis team is to be designed in partnership with community members, including people with experience utilizing crisis services. The commissioner is to establish and maintain a 9-8-8 trust fund for the purposes of creating and maintaining a Statewide 9-8-8 suicide prevention and mental health crisis system pursuant to the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 and the Federal Communication Commission's rules adopted July 16, 2020, and national guidelines for crisis care. The fund is to consist of: (1) monies from a Statewide 9-8-8 fee assessed on users pursuant to the bills provisions; (2) appropriations, if any; (3) grants and gifts intended for deposit in the fund; (4) interest, premiums, gains, or other earnings on the fund; and (5) any other monies that are deposited in or transferred to the fund.

Under the bill, the 9-8-8 fee is not to be applied to mobile service users who receive benefits under the federal Lifeline program as defined in 47 CFR 54.401. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1989](/billdetail/1420227) |Prohibits sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored substances intended for hookah use. || This bill prohibits the sale, offer for sale, and distribution of electronic smoking devices and related products and cigarettes that have a characterizing flavor. As used in the bill with regard to electronic smoking devices, \"characterizing flavor\" means a distinguishable flavor, taste, or aroma, including, but not limited to, any fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, dessert, alcoholic beverage, herb, mint, menthol, or spice flavoring, that is imparted, prior to or during consumption, by an electronic smoking device or any cartridge or other component of the device or other related product, including liquid nicotine, or any smoke or vapor emanating from that device or product. \"Characterizing flavor\" does not mean a naturally occurring flavor that has not been added to during the manufacture or distribution of the electronic smoking device or any cartridge or other component of the device or other related product. \"Electronic smoking device\" means any device that can be used to deliver any aerosolized or vaporized substance to the person inhaling from the device, including, but not limited to, an e-cigarette, e-cigar, e-pipe, vape pen, or e-hookah. \"Electronic smoking device\" includes any component, part, or accessory of the device, and any substance that may be aerosolized or vaporized by the device, whether or not the substance contains nicotine. \"Electronic smoking device\" does not include drugs, devices, or combination products authorized for sale by the federal Food and Drug Administration under the \"Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" 21 U.S.C. s.301 et seq. A retailer who violates the provision of the bill pertaining to electronic smoking devices is to be liable to a civil penalty of not less than $500 for the first violation, not less than $750 for the second violation, not less than $1,000 for the third, and for the fourth and each subsequent violation, not less than $1,000 and a three-year suspension of the person's retail dealer licensee issued pursuant to P.L.1948, c.65 C.54:40A-1 et seq. Under the bill, no retailer is to sell or distribute cigarettes, which contain a natural or artificial constituent or additive that causes the cigarette or any smoke emanating from that product to have a characterizing flavor other than tobacco. As used in the bill with regard to cigarettes, \"characterizing flavor other than tobacco\" means that: the cigarette, or any smoke emanating from that product, imparts a distinguishable flavor, taste or aroma other than tobacco prior to or during consumption, excluding a naturally occurring flavor that has not been added to the cigarette during the manufacture or distribution of the cigarette, and including, but not limited to, any menthol, mint, wintergreen, clove, fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, dessert, alcoholic beverage, herb or spice flavoring; or the cigarette or any component part thereof is advertised or marketed as having or producing any such flavor, taste or aroma. The bill provides that a retailer who violates this provision of the bill pertaining to cigarettes is to be liable to a civil penalty of not less than $250 for the first violation, not less than $500 for the second violation, and $1,000 for the third and each subsequent violation. ||In Committee | | |[A1012](/billdetail/1420342) |Increases distribution to municipalities from Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund over five years to restore municipal aid reductions; requires additional aid to be subtracted from municipal property tax levy. || This bill requires the distribution of additional State aid to municipalities under the \"Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Act.\" Budget constraints required reductions in the amount of Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid (CMPTRA) distributed to all municipalities in Fiscal Years 2009, 2010, and 2011. Some municipalities also experienced reductions in their Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid (ETR Aid) distribution during that period. This supplemental funding would restore, over a five-year period, approximately $331 million in reductions to CMPTRA and ETR Aid. In Fiscal Year 2017, municipalities would receive an aid increase equal to 20% of the difference between their total payment of CMPTRA and ETR Aid in Fiscal Year 2008 and Fiscal Year 2012. Municipalities would receive equal increases in each of the following four fiscal years. The fully restored amount would be distributed beginning in State Fiscal Year 2021 and in each fiscal year thereafter. The total amount of aid to be restored to each municipality would be in addition to the total amount of CMPTRA and ETR Aid distributed to each municipality in Fiscal Year 2012. This legislation also extends the existing ETR Aid \"poison pill\" protection to ensure that each municipality received an aid amount not less than the combined payment of CMPTRA and ETR Aid to municipalities in Fiscal Year 2012 and the additional aid distributed under the bill. This bill also amends current law to require a municipality to subtract any additional amount of ETR aid it receives, pursuant to the bill, from its adjusted tax levy when computing that amount for its next fiscal year. By deducting the additional amount of ETR Aid from the previous year's levy, municipalities would be permitted to raise a lower amount of taxes through the levy for municipal purposes, thereby benefitting property taxpayers. ||In Committee | | |[S715](/billdetail/1420382) |Establishes commission to study effects on adolescents of social media usage in and out of school. ||Establishes commission to study effects on adolescents of social media usage in and out of school. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A1259](/billdetail/1420401) |Provides that average time to issue licenses to physicians shall not exceed 51 days. || This bill requires the State Board of Medical Examiners to ensure that the average time to grant or deny applications for a license to practice medicine and surgery does not exceed 51 days from the date the board has received all information necessary to process an application for licensure.

Demonstrate that female employees have equal opportunity to advance to leadership positions in the workplace; 2. Provide, if appropriate to the employer's needs, flexible work arrangements for both female and male employees, including, but not limited to, the use of sick leave for family illness, flexible scheduling or compressed work time opportunities for employees with children, and part-time work; 3. Make available child care facilities or services and qualify for the federal \"Employer-provided child care credit,\" or make available child care facilities or services and qualify for an employer-provided child care tax credit in this State; 4. Create and implement mentorship or leadership programs for female employees, or alternatively, arrange and provide financial support for female employees to attend leadership training conferences hosted by third parties during normal working hours; and 5. If the employer's main industry is a male-dominated industry, actively engage the community in which the employer is located by sending highly qualified employees to schools, career fairs, and other appropriate settings in the community to promote the positive aspects of that industry to females. Under the bill, the commissioner must establish procedures by which an employer may apply and be awarded an annual \"NJ Family First Employer\" designation. The bill requires the commissioner to revoke an award received by any employer who knowingly or purposefully provides false information on an application required by the bill. The bill requires the commissioner to create a logo or emblem which an employer who has been awarded the \"NJ Family First Employer\" designation may use in the promotion of that business. The bill also prohibits an employer from advertising, or in any way implying in any advertisement, that the employer is a \"NJ Family First Employer\" if that employer has not received an award, or if an award was revoked from that employer. Finally, the bill requires the commissioner to publish a list, available to the public, and available on the Internet, of employers that are awarded the \"NJ Family First Employer\" designation. ||In Committee | | |[AR50](/billdetail/1421742) |Encourages Congress and President to enact stimulus legislation to address the emerging housing crisis. ||Encourages Congress and President to enact stimulus legislation to address the emerging housing crisis. ||In Committee | | |[A1755](/billdetail/1419927) |Requires installation of operational automatic rain sensor or smart sprinkler as condition of sale of certain real properties, and on certain commercial, retail, and industrial properties and common interest communities within specified timeframes. ||Requires installation of operational automatic rain sensor or smart sprinkler as condition of sale of certain real properties, and on certain commercial, retail, and industrial properties and common interest communities within specified timeframes. ||In Committee | | |[A1959](/billdetail/1421660) |Requires reporting of certain attempted and completed suicides by minors. ||Requires reporting of certain attempted and completed suicides by minors. ||In Committee | | |[A1997](/billdetail/1420814) |Prohibits certain actions relative to endangered and threatened plant species; directs DEP commissioner to take certain actions to protect endangered and threatened plant species. || This bill, named the \"New Jersey Endangered and Threatened Plant Protection Act,\" would prohibit certain actions relative to endangered and threatened plant species, and would direct the Commissioner of Environmental Protection to establish programs for protection of endangered and threatened plant species. The bill would define \"endangered and threatened plant species\" as any species on the respective lists developed by the Division of Parks and Forestry in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) pursuant to the \"Endangered Plant Species List Act,\" P.L.1989, c.56 (C.13:1B-15.151 et seq.). The bill would create a new category of protection under that act named \"threatened plant species\" which is defined as any native plant species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range, including, but not limited to, plant species designated as listed, proposed, or under review by the federal government as threatened throughout its range in the United States pursuant to the federal \"Endangered Species Act of 1973.\" Consequently, the bill would also rename the State law to be the \"Endangered and Threatened Plant Species List Act.\" The bill would prohibit the following actions relative to endangered and threatened plant species, without a permit: transport, export, import; willfully damaging, or destroying a listed plant species on State property; removing, cutting, digging up, damaging or otherwise intentionally destroying a listed plant species if the person knows, or should have known, that the species is a listed plant species; damaging or destroying a listed plant species during the course of a criminal trespass; and selling or offering to sell a listed plant species. The bill includes exceptions for typical and existing agricultural and aquacultural operations, and allows the commissioner to allow exceptions for research, educational, and other purposes consistent with the bill. The bill would require the commissioner to establish programs, including the acquisition of land or aquatic habitats, as are deemed necessary for the conservation and management of endangered and threatened plant species. The bill provides that the commissioner may receive money from the federal government, private sources, and others to be deposited into the fund created by the \"Endangered Plant Species List Act,\" to be used for the purposes of the bill. The bill would also direct the commissioner to establish the \"Endangered and Threatened Plant Species Advisory Committee\" for advising and assisting the commissioner. The committee would be comprised of three members of the State's academic community, three members from environmental organizations, and three members of the public at large, who may also be affiliated with the academic community or an environmental organization. The committee members would be appointed by the commissioner and be required to have expertise, knowledge, or experience in endangered and threatened species protection or the native plants of New Jersey. The commissioner would also be required to develop conservation plans for the conservation and survival of endangered plant species in conjunction with the \"Endangered and Threatened Plant Species Advisory Committee.\" The bill would provide for public comment on each conservation plan, and require the commissioner to create a system for the prioritization of the creation and implementation of conservation plans. The bill provides substantially similar violation and enforcement provisions as used in the \"Endangered and Nongame Species Conservation Act,\" P.L.1973, c.309 (C.23:2A-1 et seq.). All moneys collected for a violation would be deposited into the fund created by the \"Endangered Plant Species List Act.\" The bill would also amend the \"Endangered Plant Species List Act\" to provide that monies in the fund created pursuant to that act may also be used to implement this bill. Additionally, the bill amends provisions of law to clarify the responsibilities of the Natural Heritage Program in developing and maintaining the list of endangered and threatened plant species, and plant species of concern. The Natural Heritage Program established by statute in 1988, requires the DEP to identify the most critically important natural areas in the State. ||In Committee | | |[A1473](/billdetail/1421674) |Requires Corrections Ombudsperson review criminal investigations under certain circumstances. || This bill requires the Corrections Ombudsperson to review criminal investigations under certain circumstances to ensure the investigation was accurate, unbiased, and thorough. Under the bill, in order to determine whether a criminal investigation conducted by the Department of Corrections or the Special Investigations Division was accurate, unbiased, and thorough, the ombudsperson is required to inspect, examine, and analyze all aspects of the criminal investigation including, but not limited to: \u00b7 the manner in which the investigation was conducted and whether the investigation adhered to best practices and appropriate standards; \u00b7 evidence contained in the investigatory file; and \u00b7 any other information contained in the investigatory file deemed appropriate by the ombudsperson. The bill provides an exception for ongoing investigations. Under current law, the ombudsperson is prohibited from inspecting, examining, or assessing Prison Rape Elimination Act investigations; other information, records, or investigations deemed confidential by the Special Investigations Division of the department; and the Special Investigations evidence room. This bill eliminates these prohibitions. Finally, under the bill, the ombudsperson is required to provide information to the inmate who submitted the complaint regarding the status of the inspection, examination, or assessment of the criminal investigation and an estimate for when the inspection, examination, or assessment will be complete. ||In Committee | | |[A181](/billdetail/1419797) |Prohibits landlords from requiring rent to be paid by certain means of payment or at any off-site location. || This bill prohibits a landlord from requiring a tenant's rent to be paid by certain means of payment or at any off-site location.

The bill provides that the Department of Health will identify an evidence-based cultural competency training tool that may be utilized by cultural competency training programs implemented by general acute hospitals and clinical laboratories under the bill. The use of the department's approved training tool by a general acute hospital or clinical laboratory will not preclude the hospital or clinical laboratory from utilizing additional or customized training tools in addition to the department's approved training tool. Under the bill, a clinical laboratory is to electronically record the race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity of each patient who presents with a non-electronic order for testing at a clinical laboratory patient service center. If a clinical laboratory processes a specimen without the presence of a patient, the clinical laboratory shall not be responsible for recording and reporting the patient's gender identity, sexual orientation, and racial and ethnic information.

Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when the body does not properly produce or use the hormone insulin, which regulates blood sugar. The condition affects more than 29 million Americans and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, with more than seven million Americans undiagnosed and more than 5,000 Americans diagnosed each day. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, representing an estimated 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed adult cases. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death associated with diabetes and accounts for 68 percent of deaths in people with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes also have a much higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the first place. Yet findings from a recent study reveal that 52 percent of adults living with type 2 diabetes are unaware of this increased risk. There are significant costs associated with the treatment of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and Medicare expenditures for this population in the State total nearly $1.5 billion for 5,481 beneficiaries. By increasing public awareness and providing education about the cardiovascular risks associated with diabetes, the State can improve the overall outcome of, and reduce the financial burdens associated with, the illness. ||Crossed Over | | |[A2493](/billdetail/1448991) |Defines indigent veteran and veteran status for certain veteran interment purposes. ||An Act concerning the interment of | | |[A2572](/billdetail/1449301) |Prohibits sale of tobacco products and electronic smoking devices at certain pharmacies and certain businesses with on site pharmacies. || This bill prohibits the sale of all tobacco products and electronic smoking devices, including any cartridge or other component of an electronic smoking device, at pharmacies located in New Jersey, as well as at any business in New Jersey that has a pharmacy located on its premises.

It is the sponsor's belief that pill shaming occurs when an individual expresses a negative opinion or disdain for a person who is prescribed medication to treat a mental health issue. Pill shaming perpetuates behaviors and emotions that may leave someone feeling alone and isolated. It is the sponsor's intent that the enactment of this bill will curtail the practice of pill shaming and dispel the common misconception that those who are prescribed medication for a diagnosed mental health issue are affected with insanity or a frail mind. ||In Committee | | |[SJR34](/billdetail/1440039) |Designates March as \"Triple Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\" ||Designates March as \"Triple Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\" ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A205](/billdetail/1421791) |Requires DOT to provide additional information in annual report on pavement condition and conduct pavement lifecycle cost analysis; make report available to public. || This bill requires the Department of Transportation (department) to include, in the annual \"Report to the Governor and Legislature on New Jersey's Roadway Pavement System\" (annual report), additional information on pothole repairs.

Under the data sharing agreement, the division is required to provide all available data, in a manner that complies with federal and State laws and regulations, which will assist the county in: 1) examining the claims or documentation submitted by individuals to the county upon the provision of publicly-funded health-related services provided in connection with COVID-19, including, but not limited to, testing, diagnosis, and treatment, administered at any point since the Governor's declared public health emergency regarding COVID-19, to determine whether the individuals are insured; and 2) if any individual is determined to be insured, identifying the carrier under which the individual is a covered person so that the county may properly bill the carrier for any health-related services provided to that individual in connection with COVID-19 that are covered by the carrier. Under the bill, \"carrier\" means an insurance company, health service corporation, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation, or health maintenance organization authorized to issue health benefits plans in this State, and shall include the State Health Benefits Program and the School Employees' Health Benefits Program. States are required under federal Medicaid statute to compel health insurers in the state to provide at least four data elements to support identification of third party liability: the insured's name, address, group or member ID number, and periods of coverage. It is the sponsor's intent to permit counties to access this information to determine third party liability for COVID-19 health services in order to protect the limited amount of public funds that have been made available to counties to offer those services. ||Crossed Over | | |[A3017](/billdetail/1455249) |Establishes New Jersey Healthy Soils Program; establishes grant program for soil testing of urban agriculture sites; establishes Urban Agriculture Site Soil Testing Fund. ||Establishes New Jersey Healthy Soils Program; establishes grant program for soil testing of urban agriculture sites; establishes Urban Agriculture Site Soil Testing Fund. ||Crossed Over | | |[A2038](/billdetail/1421956) |Establishes permitting process for testing highly automated vehicles in NJ; establishes Highly Automated Vehicle Interagency Advisory Committee. || This bill requires the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (commission) to establish a procedure for the application for and issuance of highly automated vehicle testing permits to test highly automated vehicles on public roadways in New Jersey. The commission is required to consult the Highly Automated Vehicle Interagency Advisory Committee (HAVIA committee) in determining whether to approve or deny an application for a highly automated vehicle testing permit. The commission is required to issue a highly automated vehicle testing permit to a highly automated vehicle tester that holds valid approval from another state to test highly automated vehicles, provided that the standards and requirements established by the other state to test highly automated vehicles are similar to those established by the commission. The bill establishes the HAVIA committee to encourage the safe testing of highly automated vehicles in New Jersey by fostering collaboration between State government and stakeholders and promoting public acceptance of highly automated vehicles. The HAVIA committee is to study, examine, and review the testing and use of highly automated vehicles in New Jersey and to advise the Governor, Legislature, and various State agencies on policies, programs, research, and priorities to advance the use and testing of highly automated vehicles throughout the State.

The NJEDA is to provide financial assistance from the fund to qualified businesses in a targeted industry businesses. Targeted industry businesses are those businesses that are in the biotechnology industry and businesses that manufacture or develop high capacity storage batteries, electric vehicle batteries, semiconductors, artificial intelligence-powered machines, robotics equipment, advanced small modular reactors, micro-reactors, and medical technology equipment. Under the bill, the NJEDA is to deposit in the fund the proceeds of the appropriation made to the NJEDA. The NJEDA may also credit the fund with monies received from State, federal, or private sources of funds. The NJEDA may use those monies to provide financial assistance to qualified businesses in a manner consistent with federal law or the private source of funds. Under the program, the NJEDA is to provide financial assistance in the form of grants, loans, or loan guarantees ranging from $25,000 to $1,500,000 per qualified business, depending on the market potential and long-term economic impact of a qualified business's new production capabilities on the State or regional economy, as determined by the NJEDA. Each provision of financial assistance to a qualified business is required to be revenue neutral to the State as determined by the NJEDA. The bill requires the NJEDA to establish an application process. The NJEDA is to determine the form and manner through which a business may make and file an application for certification as a qualified business. The NJEDA may accept applications on a rolling basis or on a date set by the NJEDA. The NJEDA is not, however, to make any payments from the fund after December 31, 2025. A qualified business that receives financial assistance is to annually report to the NJEDA its financial information, audited by a certified public accountant, which is to include a consolidated summary of the performance of the qualified business.

This bill seeks to meet that mandate by providing financial assistance to qualified businesses in those targeted industries as a catalyst for economic growth and to advance the competitiveness of the State's businesses in the global economy. ||In Committee | | |[A2018](/billdetail/1421280) |Requires financial institutions to release records to adult protective services when suspecting fraud of vulnerable adult or senior customer; allows adult protective service to release same records to law enforcement agency if necessary. || This bill amends section 3 of P.L.1998, c.121 to require financial institutions to release financial records regarding a customer's account to a county adult protective services provider when suspecting fraud of a vulnerable adult or senior customer. Under the bill, the adult protective services provider is then authorized to release the same records to a law enforcement agency, if deemed necessary. Under the existing law, a financial institution is authorized, but not required, to release financial records regarding a customer's account to a law enforcement agency, a county adult protective services provider, or both under the same circumstances. As such, this bill mandates financial institutions to release such records and provides that adult protective services is the first point of contact. As defined under the existing law, a \"senior customer\" means a natural person, who, to the financial institution acting in good faith, appears to be at least 60 years of age, who utilized or is utilizing any service of a financial institution, or for whom a financial institution is acting or has acted as a fiduciary, in relation to an account maintained in the person's name.

The bill provides that the Commissioner of Community Affairs, in consultation with the Board of Public Utilities, would adopt a set of standards to allow for the safe indoor storage of batteries that are part of an energy storage system for a building or facility, as well as working to incorporate these safety storage standards into the State Uniform Construction Code. These standards would include but not be limited to: (1) developing specific indoor storage safety requirements for the batteries; (2) communicating with the fire official or code enforcement official of a municipality where the batteries are going to be stored; and (3) developing safe procedures, in consultation with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, for the disposal of batteries. Under the bill, the following types of qualifying batteries would require safety indoor storage standards: lithium-ion; nickel-cadmium; nickel metal hydride; flow or redox lead acid. ||In Committee | | |[A2946](/billdetail/1454836) |Requires recalls on motor vehicles to be repaired prior to sale. || This bill would prohibit the sale of a motor vehicle with outstanding recalls. Under the bill, a person would not be able to sell a vehicle without first contacting, or accessing information provided by, the vehicle manufacturer or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to determine if there are any recalls on the vehicle which have not been corrected or addressed. In the event that a recall is discovered, the recall would have to be appropriately corrected or addressed prior to the sale of the vehicle. ||In Committee | | |[A4338](/billdetail/1489217) |Requires vaccinations against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) be reported to New Jersey Immunization Information System. || This bill requires vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to be reported to the New Jersey Immunization Information System (NJIIS). The NJIIS is a Statewide database that maintains records of individual vaccination histories. Individuals born after January 1, 1998 are automatically included in the registry, unless the individual's parent or guardian provides a written request that the person not be included in the registry; individuals born prior to January 1, 1998 may be included in the registry by written request. This bill would require any person who is not currently enrolled in the registry to be automatically enrolled at the time the person is administered the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, unless the person, or the person's parent or legal guardian in the case of a person younger than 18 years of age, provides a written request not to participate in the registry. Each health care provider who administers the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will be required to register as an immunization site and as an authorized user, and will be required to commence online reporting of administrations of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The Department of Health will be required to establish procedures for health care providers to advise people receiving the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine of the purpose of using the NJIIS to track administrations of the vaccine. It is the sponsor's belief that the NJIIS will be an essential tool for tracking administrations of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and helping ensure the vaccine is administered as widely and effectively as possible, as well as in identifying gaps in vaccination rates that could lead to an outbreak of COVID-19 among a given population group or in a given region. ||In Committee | | |[A4063](/billdetail/1485178) |Prohibits carriers from offering dental plans with dental benefit waiting periods. || This bill prohibits carriers from offering dental plans with a dental benefit waiting period.

For the purposes of this bill, \"dental benefit waiting period\" means a provision within a dental plan that delays the eligibility of a covered person to receive certain covered services under the plan. ||In Committee | | |[A4113](/billdetail/1487195) |Codifies and expands Medicaid coverage for certain school-based services. || This bill codifies and expands Medicaid coverage for certain school-based services. Under the bill, the State Medicaid program is to include coverage for school-based services listed in a recipient student's Individualized Education program (IEP), 504 accommodation plan, Individualized Health Care Plan, Individualized Family Service Plan, or that are otherwise medically necessary as determined by a licensed medical practitioner, and that are coverable under the Medicaid program, pursuant to P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.). School-based services are to be provided: (1) by a licensed medical practitioner approved as a Medicaid provider or a local education agency (LEA) approved as a Medicaid provider; (2) to a student who is an eligible beneficiary of the Medicaid program; and (3) within the recipient student's school setting, or in the recipient student's home or in a community setting if deemed medically necessary by a licensed medical practitioner or if specified in the recipient student's IEP. Currently, Medicaid reimbursement for school-based services is administered under the Special Education Medicaid Initiative (SEMI), a program jointly operated by the New Jersey Departments of Education, Human Services, and Treasury along with participating LEAs. The purpose of the SEMI is to recover a portion of costs for certain Medicaid-covered services provided to Medicaid-eligible students enrolled in participating LEAs. Health-related services provided to Medicaid-eligible students and submitted to Medicaid for reimbursement under the SEMI are required to be included in the student's IEP. This bill codifies this provision of the SEMI, and expands Medicaid reimbursement to include other school-based services listed in a recipient student's 504 accommodation plan, Individualized Health Care Plan, Individualized Family Service Plan, or that are otherwise medically necessary as determined by a licensed medical practitioner. All services are required to be coverable under the Medicaid program. Finally, the bill requires the Commissioner of Human Services to apply for such State plan amendments or waivers as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act and to secure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program. For reference, in 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a State plan amendment submitted by the Massachusetts Medicaid agency which allowed schools that are Medicaid-eligible providers to bill for Medicaid services provided to all Medicaid-enrolled students, similar to the provisions in this bill. ||In Committee | | |[A4115](/billdetail/1487198) |Requires minimum annual State appropriation of $10 million for Public Health Priority Funding. ||Requires minimum annual State appropriation of $10 million for Public Health Priority Funding. ||In Committee | | |[A4195](/billdetail/1487857) |Requires DOH to develop Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan. ||Requires DOH to develop Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan. ||In Committee | | |[A4210](/billdetail/1487896) |Requires DOLWD to establish mobile unit program to provide unemployment compensation insurance assistance and services. || This bill requires the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance (division) in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DOLWD) to establish a \"Mobile Unit UI Program\" to provide information, assistance, and other services concerning unemployment compensation insurance to provide unemployment compensation insurance assistance and services.

A legislator or other official may request mobile unit services to 12 times in a calendar year. To the extent practicable, the division is required to model the program after the mobile unit program employed by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission. These units will provide residents of the respective localities with an opportunity to meet with a division employee concerning unemployment insurance, who can: (1) address general questions regarding the program and benefits; and (2) assist with specific claim questions, issues, concerns, and troubleshooting, including but not limited to: (a) assessing whether an individual is likely to qualify for unemployment compensation; (b) providing instructions on how to file an unemployment compensation claim and assistance in obtaining and interpreting information on the 1099-G tax form; and (c) providing information on an individual's existing unemployment claim, including but not limited to, the status of the claim, potential solutions and troubleshooting of any issues regarding an individual's eligibility or other barriers to the individual collecting unemployment compensation benefits. By January 1, 2024, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development is required to submit to the Governor and the Legislature a report that evaluates the results of the program and its effectiveness in assisting residents with unemployment benefit claims and other unemployment concerns. The report will include a recommendation regarding whether to make changes to the program, and if changes are recommended, if the program should be expanded or otherwise enhanced. The program will be funded from an initial allocation of $500,000 from the funds appropriated pursuant to the annual appropriations act for State fiscal year 2022 from the Workforce Development Partnership Fund, and, additional allocations of $500,000 in each fiscal year thereafter, from the amounts appropriated pursuant to the annual appropriations act in those fiscal years from the Workforce Development Partnership Fund. ||In Committee | | |[A4196](/billdetail/1487953) |Requires Higher Education Student Assistance Authority to develop pathway to nursing scholarship for health care workers who want to become nurses; appropriates $1 million. || This bill requires the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA), in consultation with the New Jersey Board of Nursing, to develop a pathway to nursing scholarship program.

The bill provides that it is unlawful for a person to own or otherwise possess body armor unless the person has registered the body armor in accordance with the bill's provisions. The bill requires the Attorney General to establish a registration process for body armor owned prior to the effective date of the bill and provides that an owner has 90 days from the effective date to register each piece of body armor owned in compliance with the registration process. For purchases of body armor occurring after the bill's effective date, a person would be required to meet eligibility criteria established by the Attorney General and obtain a permit to purchase body armor, and a seller of body armor would be required to register the sale of the body armor with the Attorney General.

Following the sale or other transfer of body armor, a seller is required to take possession of the purchaser's permit to purchase body armor and complete a registration form that includes the personal identifying information of the purchaser and a description of the body armor purchased. The bill requires the seller to submit the registration form and the permit to purchase body armor obtained from the purchaser to the Attorney General within three business days. A seller who violates these provisions would be subject to a civil penalty of up to $500 for a first offense and up to $1,000 for a second or subsequent offense. The provisions of the bill would not apply to: (1) a State or local government entity which purchases or possesses body armor for the purpose of furnishing body armor to employees; or (2) possession of body armor by employees of a State or local government entity during the employee's period of employment and used for employment-related purposes. The registration and permit to purchase body armor provisions of the bill would not apply to a bona fide dealer of body armor who has registered with the Attorney General. A dealer in business prior to the bill's effective date has 60 days following the effective date to register with the Attorney General.

Specifically, the bill provides that the cultural competency training programs hospitals and clinical laboratories are required to implement under P.L.2021, c.454 are to include training on how to collect race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity in a culturally competent and sensitive manner. The bill removes a provision of current law requiring the Department of Health to identify an evidence-based cultural competency training tool that may be utilized by cultural competency training programs implemented by general acute hospitals and clinical laboratories. The bill revises questionnaire choices regarding demographics. The bill provides that as an alternative to a requirement under P.L.2021, c.454 that hospitals and clinical laboratories record demographic information using a program that is compatible with the State's disease surveillance reporting system using such data fields as may be available or necessary in the version of Health Level Seven International recording and reporting standards or equivalent standards adopted by the laboratory, the Commissioner of Health may designate the use of a different standard or program that produces superior data collection and related benefits. Under the bill, the Department of Health may impose necessary corrective actions to achieve compliance with the provisions of with the provisions of section 3 of P.L.2021, c.454, (C.45:9-42.47), which may include, but need not be limited to, an attestation to be completed by an acute care hospital or a licensed clinical laboratory that: indicates specific steps that will be taken to achieve compliance within 120 days following the date of attestation; acknowledges legal obligations and penalties; and provides relevant vendor information. This bill revises the section of P.L.2021, c.454 that requires the Commissioner of Health to adopt rules and regulations to implement P.L.2021, c.454, to provide that the rules and regulations will take effect immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and will remain in effect for 18 months. Thereafter, the rules and regulations may be amended, adopted, or readopted in accordance with the provisions of the \"Administrative Procedure Act,\" P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). The bill makes technical changes and various revisions to the effective date of P.L.2021, c.454. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A4114](/billdetail/1487100) |Requires all prescriptions be transmitted electronically, subject to certain exceptions. || This bill requires that every prescription for a controlled dangerous substance, prescription legend drug, or other prescription item be transmitted electronically using an electronic health records system. This requirement will take effect one year after the date of enactment. The electronic prescription requirement will not apply to: a veterinarian; a practitioner administering a prescription drug or item directly to a patient; a practitioner prescribing a drug or item to be dispensed by an institutional pharmacy or to a patient in hospice care; a situation in which the electronic prescribing system is not operational or is temporarily inaccessible; a situation in which the patient requests the prescription be transmitted to a pharmacy that is unable to receive and process electronic prescriptions; or a practitioner who has been granted a waiver due to technological limitations or other exceptional circumstances. A prescription that is subject to an exception would be issued on a New Jersey Prescription Blank or in such other manner as may be authorized by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. The bill revises various provisions of the statutory law to reflect the mandatory electronic prescribing requirement. ||In Committee | | |[A4135](/billdetail/1487108) |Directs DEP to develop guidelines concerning State and local government purchase of goods made from recycled material. || This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to develop, and update as appropriate, guidelines for use by State and local agencies when entering into contracts for the purchase of goods to encourage the maximum purchase of goods made with the highest percentage of recycled material. The bill provides that these guidelines may be based upon, or incorporate by reference, guidelines developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, including but not limited to the recommended recovered materials content levels specified in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Consolidated Recovered Materials Advisory Notice. The bill requires the Director of the Division of Purchase and Property in the Department of the Treasury, the Director of the Division of Property Management and Construction in the Department of the Treasury, and all State and local agencies having authority to contract for the purchase of goods or services to ensure that all product specifications for new procurements advertised after the bill is enacted into law reflect the guidelines developed, or updated, if applicable and to the extent practical and feasible. However, this requirement would not apply to a contract entered into by a local contracting unit, if following the guidelines developed, or updated, pursuant to the bill would increase the cost of the contract. ||In Committee | | |[AR146](/billdetail/1487109) |Urges U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to reconsider implementation of new rules concerning organ procurement organizations. ||Urges U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to reconsider implementation of new rules concerning organ procurement organizations. ||In Committee | | |[A4117](/billdetail/1487129) |Requires driver's manual to include information on driver's rights and responsibilities during police stop. || This bill requires the driver's manual to include information on a driver's rights and responsibilities during a police stop. Under the provisions of this bill, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General, is required to include in the driver's manual information regarding the rights and responsibilities of a driver when the driver is stopped by a law enforcement officer. ||In Committee | | |[A4429](/billdetail/1490128) |Requires licensure for manufacturers, distributors, wholesale dealers, and retail dealers of electronic smoking devices and related products. || This bill establishes certain requirements for licensure for manufacturers, wholesale dealers, distributors, and retail dealers of vapor products, which are defined to mean electronic smoking devices and related products, including the liquid nicotine cartridges used in the devices. Specifically, the bill will require annual licensure for each person engaging in the business of manufacturing, purchasing, selling, consigning, or distributing vapor products. Licenses will lapse on March 31 of the period for which they are issued and will be continued annually, provided the licensee pays the licensure fees and meets the requirements for continued licensure. The Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety will be charged with administering and enforcing the provisions of the bill. The bill clarifies that an individual holding a tobacco license issued under the \"Cigarette Tax Act,\" P.L.1948, c.65 (C.54:40A-1 et seq.), will be deemed to hold the corresponding licensure for the purposes of the bill, authorizing the individual to engage in the same conduct permitted under the license for both tobacco and vapor products. The annual vapor product licensure fees established under the bill are as follows: $10 for a manufacturer license; $5 for a manufacturer representative license; $250 for a wholesale dealer license; $350 for a distributor license; $50 for a retail dealer license; and $50 for a retail dealer operating a vapor product vending machine license. Additionally, a fee of $1 will apply for issuance of an amended or duplicate vapor product license or certificate of licensure. Of the $50 fee paid to the director for issuance of each vapor product retail dealer license and each vending machine license, $30 is to be credited to the special projects and development fund in the Department of Health established pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1966, c.36 (C.26:2F-7), and $5 is to be credited each year to the division for administrative costs. The director is to determine and certify to the State Treasurer, on a monthly basis, the amount of revenues which are to be credited to the special projects and development fund in the Department of Health. In the case of a vapor product distributor who sells or intends to sell vapor products at two or more places of business, whether established or temporary, a separate license will be required for each place of business. In the case of a vapor product wholesale dealer who sells or intends to sell vapor products at 10 or more places of business, whether established or temporary, a separate license will be required for each place of business. In the case of a vapor product retail dealer who sells or intends to sell vapor products at two or more places of business, whether established or temporary, or whether in the same building or not, a separate license will be required for each place of business. A separate vapor product license will be required for each vending machine operated by a vapor retail dealer. Each vapor product license or certificate of licensure issued under the bill is to be exhibited in the place of business for which it is issued and in such manner as may be prescribed by the director. Vapor product licensees will be required to notify the director of a change in address within 30 days of the change, or the license will be subject to revocation. The bill specifies that no person, including a licensed vapor product retail dealer, may create, produce, or modify any vapor product or nicotine solution for the purposes of sale or distribution within or without the State unless that person is a licensed vapor manufacturer. Vapor product licenses issued under the bill may not be transferred or assigned, except that: (1) a vapor product vending machine license may be transferred to another machine owned by the retail dealer; and (2) a vapor product wholesale dealer or distributor license may be transferred or assigned, provided the assignee or transferee otherwise qualifies for licensure and pays a $5 transfer fee. In the case of death, bankruptcy, receivership, or incompetency of a licensee, or if for any other reason the business of the vapor product licensee devolves upon another by operation of law, the director will be permitted to extend the license for a limited time to the executor, administrator, trustee, receiver, or person upon whom the license devolved. The director may, upon notice and a hearing, suspend or revoke a vapor product license issued under the bill for a violation of the bill or any other provision of law, including, but not limited to, acting in a capacity that exceeds the licensee's scope of licensure. A disciplinary proceeding or action initiated under the bill will not be barred or abated by the expiration, transfer, surrender, continuance, renewal, or extension of the license that is the subject of the action or proceeding. The bill additionally revises various statutory provisions to include updated references to the licensure provisions established under the bill and to harmonize the terminology used throughout the statutes. The bill does not otherwise revise the tobacco product licensure provisions under the \"Cigarette Tax Act.\" ||In Committee | | |[A4427](/billdetail/1490131) |Requires certain homemaker-home health aides to be certified or trained to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation. || This bill requires certain homemaker-home health aides to be certified or trained to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Under the bill, a homemaker-home health aide is to be certified or effectively trained to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation in order to provide care for patients over the age of 65. The employer of a homemaker-home health aide is to be responsible for any costs associated with certifying or training a homemaker-home health aide to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation as required pursuant to the bill's provisions. It is the sponsor's belief that this bill is necessary given the elevated risk of choking in elderly persons. For example, of the 5,051 people who died from choking in 2015, over half were older than the age of 74. In addition, individuals over 65 are seven times more likely to choke on food compared to children aged 1-4. ||In Committee | | |[A4422](/billdetail/1490133) |Stipulates that emergency medical helicopter trip qualifies for certain protections under current law. || This bill stipulates that the provisions of the \"Out-of-network Consumer Protection, Transparency, Cost Containment and Accountability Act\" apply to transportation by emergency medical service helicopter. In addition, the bill establishes a cap of $1,000 on the total amount to be paid by a covered person who receives transportation by emergency medical service helicopter to a health care facility. ||In Committee | | |[A4425](/billdetail/1490136) |Prohibits SHBP, SEHBP, and Medicaid from denying coverage for maintenance medications for chronic conditions for covered persons solely because of change in health benefits plan or pharmacy benefits manager. || This bill would prohibit contracts which are issued or purchased pursuant to the State Health Benefits Program, School Employees' Health Benefits Program, and Medicaid Program from denying coverage for a maintenance medication prescribed by a covered person's physician for the covered person's chronic condition because of a change in the covered person's pharmaceutical benefits that results solely from a change in the health benefits plan or the pharmacy benefits manager for that plan. The prohibition applies only if the covered person was taking the medication prior to the date of the change in the covered person's health benefits plan or the pharmacy benefits manager for that plan, and if the covered person's new health benefits plan, or health benefits plan under the new pharmacy benefits manager, as applicable, provides coverage for that class of drugs. ||In Committee | | |[A4112](/billdetail/1487139) |Requires automatic registration with New Jersey Immunization Information System upon administration of vaccine for certain persons who consent to registration. || This bill requires automatic registration with the New Jersey Immunization Information System (NJIIS) upon the administration of a vaccine for persons who are not currently registered with the NJIIS and unless the person or the person's parent or legal guardian, in the case of a person younger than 18 years of age, provides a written request not to participate in the registry. The NJIIS is a Statewide database that maintains records of individual vaccination histories. Individuals born after January 1, 1998 are automatically included in the registry, unless the individual's parent or guardian provides a written request that the person not be included in the registry; individuals born prior to January 1, 1998 may be included in the registry by written request. This bill requires any person who is not currently enrolled in the registry to be automatically enrolled at the time the person is administered a vaccine, unless the person or the person's parent or legal guardian, in the case of a person younger than 18 years of age, provides a written request not to participate in the registry. ||In Committee | | |[A4120](/billdetail/1487149) |Prohibits sale of menthol cigarettes. || This bill includes menthol and clove cigarettes in the current prohibition against the sale and distribution of flavored cigarettes. Current State law provides that no person may sell, offer for sale, distribute for commercial purpose at no cost or minimal cost or with coupons or rebate offers, give, or furnish to a person a cigarette that imparts a \"characterizing flavor other than tobacco, clove or menthol.\" The ban applies to the cigarette, any smoke emanating from the cigarette, and any component part of the cigarette, including the tobacco, paper, roll or filter, or any other matter or substance that can be smoked. A series of monetary penalties and adverse licensure actions may be imposed for violations of the ban. The current State law was enacted in 2008; in 2009, a federal ban on the sale of flavored cigarettes was enacted and codified at 21 U.S.C.S. s.387g. The federal law includes clove flavorings in the ban, but provides an exception for tobacco and menthol flavors. This bill updates the current State law to reflect the federal ban on clove-flavored cigarettes, and additionally prohibits sales of menthol-flavored cigarettes. ||In Committee | | |[A4426](/billdetail/1490141) |Requires bio-analytical or clinical laboratory conducting hepatitis C screening test to draw and store blood for confirmation test. || This bill requires that, pursuant to a standing order issued by its chief medical officer or equivalent officer, when a bio-analytical or clinical laboratory draws a blood sample for the purpose of conducting a hepatitis C screening test, the laboratory is to collect a sufficient quantity of blood so that the ordered test may be conducted and separately confirmed without any need for the patient to return for a second blood draw. The laboratory will be required to store the additional blood sample until a confirmation test is ordered, or for a minimum of 90 days following the initial blood draw, whichever is earlier. The requirements of the bill will not apply if the health care professional ordering the hepatitis C screening test indicates that blood should be drawn for only a single screening test, or if the test to be conducted is ordered for the purpose of confirming a hepatitis C screening test conducted within the preceding 12 months. ||In Committee | | |[A4431](/billdetail/1490144) |Prohibits preauthorization of certain ultrasound screenings covered under health benefits plans. || This bill prohibits health insurers, third party administrators, and the State Health Benefits Program and the School Employees' Health Benefits Program from requiring the preauthorization of prenatal ultrasound screenings covered under a health benefits plan. ||In Committee | | |[SJR100](/billdetail/1494528) |Designates the month of August as \"Civic Health Month\" in New Jersey. ||Designates the month of August as \"Civic Health Month\" in New Jersey. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A4754](/billdetail/1494877) |Requires State Medicaid beneficiaries to notify county welfare agencies no later than 20 days of change of circumstances. ||Requires State Medicaid beneficiaries to notify county welfare agencies no later than 20 days of change of circumstances. ||Crossed Over | | |[A4719](/billdetail/1494891) |Consolidates and makes technical updates to certain definitions used in Title 26 of the Revised Statutes. ||This bill consolidates certain definitions used in Title 26 of the Revised Statues by placing those definitions into a single definitions section, section 1 of P.L.1947, c.177 (C.26:1A-1), which will be applicable to all of the statutes contained in Title 26, and by removing the definitions where they appear in individual sections of Title 26. Specifically, the bill will add to C.26:1A-1 definitions for \"adult,\" of Health/department.\" The bill does not make any substantive revisions to any of these definitions. The bill repeals another section of law, R.S.26:1-1, which defines the same terms as are included in C.26:1A-1 in generally the same manner, and which is currently applicable to all of Title 26. The bill additionally makes various technical updates to the laws being amended to ensure definitions are listed alphabetically, to replace gendered language, to update citations to other laws and to various regulatory agencies, and to update punctuation, the use of subdivisions within definitions sections, and syntax, as well as to update several cross-citations occurring outside Title 26. This bill is based on the recommendations set forth in a report by the New Jersey Law Revision Commission titled \"Final Report to Eliminate Duplicative Definitions Sections of the Health and Vital Statistics Statute in Title 26,\" issued April 21, 2022. ||In Committee | | |[A4340](/billdetail/1489204) |Adds and revises items for nursing homes to submit to DOH in annual financial report. || This bill adds items for nursing homes to submit to the Department of Health (department) in annual financial reports. The bill amends existing law, which requires nursing homes to submit annual financial reports to the department by adding two additional items to be submitted to the department: (1) any person who owns or operates a sister company, holding company, or parent company, or who is a primary owner, a member of the board of trustees, or a member of the board of directors of the long-term care facility; and (2) any person who has ownership interest in a private equity pool or who is primary owner, a member of the board of trustees, or a member of the board of directors of the long-term care facility. Under current law, the following is to be reported by a nursing home: (1) any person who, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns a 10 percent or greater interest in any mortgage, note, deed of trust or other obligation secured in whole or in part by the land on which or building in which the nursing home is located; and (2) Any person who, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns a 10 percent or greater interest in any mortgage, note, deed of trust or other obligation which, although not secured by the land on which or building in which the nursing home is located, is considered an outstanding liability on the books of the nursing home and was executed to finance directly or indirectly the purchase of the nursing home, land, building, lease or sublease pertaining thereto. The bill revises the above interest thresholds from 10 percent to five percent. The bill also adds a new penalty provision to current law, which provides that the Department of Health may curtail the admissions for new residents in the case of a person, firm, association, partnership or corporation who fails to file a statement as required by P.L.1977, c.237 or willfully files a false statement until corrective action is taken by the violator. ||In Committee | | |[A4332](/billdetail/1489207) |Requires procurement of management support and other services for certain nursing homes. || This bill requires the procurement of management support and other services for certain nursing homes. Under the bill, if the Department of Health identifies a nursing home in substantial violation, or with a pattern and practice of habitual violations, of the standards of health, safety, and resident care established under federal or State law, the department may, with adequate notice and as appropriate, provide or appoint at the expense of the nursing home, or direct the nursing home to employ, contract with, or otherwise provide, a monitor or other vendor for management support services and resources, consultative services, staffing services, or any other support that may be necessary to: (1) remedy the violations or deficient conditions; (2) transition the nursing home to new ownership; (3) facilitate the safe and orderly closure of the nursing home if ordered by the department; or (4) avoid the cessation of operations of the nursing home. A monitor or vendor selected pursuant to the bill's provisions may: (1) attend any meetings of the nursing home's: owners or board, executive committee, finance committee, steering committee, infection control committee, or any other meeting of the nursing home, including meetings held with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services if permitted under federal law; (2) hire consultants; (3) undertake studies of the nursing home; (4) access records of the nursing home in a manner that is consistent with federal and State privacy laws; (5) convene meetings with the owners of a nursing home; and (6) take actions that are necessary and appropriate to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the nursing home. ||In Committee | | |[S3241](/billdetail/1495645) |Extends temporary waiver of certain basic life support services and specialty care transport unit crewmember requirements. ||This bill revises P.L.2021, c.477, which temporarily waived certain crewmember requirements for emergency medical services vehicles, to provide that the waiver for basic life support services will remain in effect until January 1, 2024, rather than January 1, 2023. The bill additionally provides that nothing in P.L.2021, c.477 is to be construed to alter the provisions of subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-2), which sets forth the definition of \"health care service\" for the purposes of P.L.1971, c.136 seq.), or section 13 of P.L.1987, c.284 (C.27:5F-30), which provides that nothing in the \"New Jersey Highway Traffic Safety Act of 1987\" is to be construed to grant the Governor or any other State or local official any power to promulgate regulations that may restrict a volunteer and nonvolunteer first aid, rescue or ambulance squad in the proper performance of its duties. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A4336](/billdetail/1489223) |Prohibits annual increase in rent or lease payments of more than two percent for certain nursing homes except in certain circumstances. || The bill prohibits a person who leases or rents the land or a building to an owner or operator of a nursing home for use therefor from increasing or entering into any agreement to increase the lease or rent payments by more than four percent annually. A person may be exempt from the provisions of the bill if the person files a petition in the Superior Court, in the Office of the Special Civil Part Clerk in the county where the rental or leased premises are located, and the court finds good cause for the increase based on the factors related to the land or building. These factors include: (1) heating; (2) utilities; (3) maintenance or janitorial services or materials; (4) real estate taxes; (5) property insurances; (6) reasonable improvements to the land or building; (7) reasonable services or amenities not previously provided; (8) depreciation; (9) repairs and replacements; (10) a commensurate increase, if any, in the overall Consumer Price Index for New York-Northeastern New; (11) a decrease in funds received by any agency of the federal government or pursuant to any act or enactment of the federal government; (12) whether the nursing home owner or operator consents to the increase; (13) any actions taken to mitigate the increase; and (15) any other factor deemed appropriate by the court. The bill provides that a person who leases or rents the land on which or building in which a nursing home operates may file a petition in the Superior Court alleging violation of the provisions of this bill. A person who violates the provisions of this section will be subject to a penalty equal to two and one-half times the monthly lease or rent payments for each violation. The payment of such penalties will be deposited into a fund to be used to offset the cost to the courts of administering the provisions of this section. The bill defines a \"person\" to include corporations, companies, associations, societies, firms, partnerships and joint stock companies as well as individuals, unless restricted by the context to an individual as distinguished from a corporate entity or specifically restricted to one or some of the above enumerated synonyms and, when used to designate the owner of property which may be the subject of an offense, includes this State, the United States, any other State of the United States as defined infra and any foreign country or government lawfully owning or possessing property within this State. The bill defines \"nursing home\" to mean a health care facility licensed by the Department of Health to provide professional nursing care on a daily basis and includes intermediate care facilities. ||In Committee | | |[A4119](/billdetail/1486949) |Allows public bodies to conduct meetings by electronic means. || This bill permits a public body to conduct a meeting and public business, cause a meeting to be open to the public, vote, and receive public comment by means of communication or other electronic equipment. Under current law, remote meetings, voting, and public comment are only permitted during a state of emergency, public health emergency, or state of local disaster emergency. This bill removes that restriction. \"Public body\" is defined under the \"Senator Byron M. Baer Open Public Meetings Act\" to be a commission, authority, board, council, committee, or any other group of two or more persons organized under the laws of this State, and collectively empowered as a voting body to perform a public governmental function affecting the rights, duties, obligations, privileges, benefits, or other legal relations of any person, or collectively authorized to spend public funds including the Legislature, but does not mean or include the judicial branch of the government, any grand or petit jury, any parole board or any agency or body acting in a parole capacity, the State Commission of Investigation, the Apportionment Commission established under Article IV, Section III, of the Constitution, or any political party committee organized under Title 19 of the Revised Statutes. ||In Committee | | |[A4821](/billdetail/1495730) |Directs DEP to take certain actions concerning identification and testing of microplastics in drinking water, and requires DEP and BPU to study and promote use of microplastics removal technologies. ||Directs DEP to take certain actions concerning identification and testing of microplastics in drinking water, and requires DEP and BPU to study and promote use of microplastics removal technologies. ||Crossed Over | | |[S3250](/billdetail/1495929) |Amends lists of environmental infrastructure projects approved for long-term funding by DEP; makes various changes to FY2023 environmental infrastructure funding program. ||Amends lists of environmental infrastructure projects approved for long-term funding by DEP; makes various changes to FY2023 environmental infrastructure funding program. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[AJR169](/billdetail/1487057) |Designates May of each year as \"Let's Move to a Healthier New Jersey Month.\" ||This joint resolution designates May of each year as \"Let's Move to a Healthier New Jersey Month\" in New Jersey, in recognition of the physical and mental health benefits of exercise and fitness, and the key role the fitness industry plays in bringing these fitness services to all residents of this State.

The purpose of this bill is to close a \"loophole\" in the existing law that has resulted in the increased use of cigars that can be legally sold in fruity flavors among youth in this State because they were not specifically included within the provisions of P.L.2008, c.91. The enactment of this bill will fulfill the intent of that law to prevent young people from being able to legally obtain these alluring tobacco products and thereby take a significant step towards advancing the public health interest of New Jersey and its citizens. The bill defines \"cigar\" to mean \"any roll for smoking made wholly or in part of tobacco, or other substance or substances other than tobacco, irrespective of size, shape, or flavoring, which is wrapped or covered by a wrapper or cover made of tobacco, or any other substance or material containing tobacco, and which may contain a mouthpiece or tip.\" ||In Committee | | |[A4918](/billdetail/1498200) |Extends temporary waiver of certain basic life support services and specialty care transport unit crewmember requirements. ||This bill revises P.L.2021, c.477, which temporarily waived certain crewmember requirements for emergency medical services vehicles, to provide that the waiver for basic life support services will remain in effect until January 1, 2024, rather than January 1, 2023.

Under current law, in order to receive a prescription for medication that a qualified terminally ill patient may choose to self-administer pursuant to P.L.2019, c.59 (C.26:16-1 et al.), the patient is to make two oral requests and one written request for the medication to the patient's attending physician, subject to the following requirements, with at least 15 days elapsing between the first and second oral requests, and between the first oral request and the issuance of a prescription for the medication. Additionally, at least 48 hours must elapse between the receipt of the written request, which may be submitted at any time, and issuance of the prescription. This bill waives the 15-day waiting periods in the case of a patient who, based on reasonable medical certainty, is not expected to survive for 15 days. The attending physician will be required to document the medical basis for the determination that the patient is not expected to survive for 15 days. The bill retains the 48-hour waiting period between submission of a written request and the issuance of a prescription for medical aid in dying medication. ||In Committee | | |[AR166](/billdetail/1498246) |Recognizes and honors volunteers with NJ Medical Reserve Corps. ||This resolution recognizes the volunteers of the New Jersey Medical Response Corps (NJMRC) and honors their service to the State and the dedication they displayed in providing services ensuring their communities remained healthy and were prepared in the face of the public health emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The NJMRC is a network of 24 community-based units comprised of volunteers who help ensure their communities are healthy, prepared, and resilient. During the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, NJMRC volunteers across the State stepped forward to support their communities in response to the Governor's call for individuals with prior medical experience, and dedicated approximately 52,100 volunteer hours to a wide array of COVID-19 response roles. Many local health agencies where NJMRC units are housed have stated they could not implement their COVID-19 response activities without the assistance of the NJMRC. Therefore, it is appropriate to recognize and honor the volunteers of the NJMRC for their service to the State and their communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. ||In Committee | | |[A4913](/billdetail/1498260) |Requires carriers to offer health care providers more than one method of payment for reimbursement. ||Requires carriers to offer health care providers more than one method of payment for reimbursement. ||Crossed Over | | |[A4917](/billdetail/1498262) |Requires boards of education to adopt policies pertaining to use of safe schools resource officers and referral of students to law enforcement. ||This bill establishes requirements for the adoption of policies by school districts pertaining to the use of safe schools resource officers and the referral of students to law enforcement. The bill directs each board of education to adopt policies that:\u00b7 Require that the referral of a student to the safe schools resource officer by an employee of the school district be supported with written documentation for the referral's need; \u00b7 provide that, in the event that a student is referred to a safe schools resource officer, the student's parents or guardians will be offered an opportunity for an in-person meeting with a school administrator or school counselor to discuss potential behavioral interventions that may be available to the student; \u00b7 require that the citation of a student by a safe schools resource officer be accompanied by the immediate notification of this action to the student's parents or guardians; \u00b7 require that a school district referral of a student to law enforcement other than the safe schools resource officer is approved by the superintendent or the principal of the school at which the student is enrolled, and is accompanied by the immediate notification of this action to the student's parents or guardians; and\u00b7 establish penalties against any school district employee who knowingly submits false or misleading information or allegations against a student to the schools resource officer or law enforcement. Under the bill, each board of education is required to provide appropriate training to its superintendent, school administrators, safe schools resource officers, school liaisons to law enforcement, school counselors, and teaching staff on the legal standards and requirements for referring a student to law enforcement and the potential impact of a referral on student wellbeing and opportunities. The bill also provides that the training course provided to safe schools resource officers and other school district employees by the Police Training Commission, as required under current law, include content on: de-escalation techniques; communicating with youth; and how disciplinary actions, including referrals to law enforcement and arrests, may impact a student's future opportunities. Finally, the bill requires each school district to submit to the Commissioner of Education data from the prior school year, for each school of the district, on: \u00b7 the number of students referred to a safe schools resource officer; \u00b7 the number of students referred to other law enforcement; and \u00b7 the number of incidents in which a safe schools resource officer assigned to a school of the district utilized physical restraint on a student. ||In Committee | | |[AR167](/billdetail/1498269) |Urges President and Congress to enact legislation that requires parental consent for children under 13 years of age to use social media and other websites. ||Urges President and Congress to enact legislation that requires parental consent for children under 13 years of age to use social media and other websites. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A4423](/billdetail/1490139) |Requires police department to reimburse person for property damage under certain circumstances. || This bill requires a State, county, or municipal police department or force to reimburse a person for any damage to personal or real property that occurred during the course of executing a warrant if: (1) the warrant was executed at the wrong location; or (2) it is determined that the warrant was procured through fraud or misrepresentation. Under the bill, a claim for reimbursement for damage to property is to be filed with the State, county, or municipal police department or force that executed the warrant.

The law would determine the eligibility of veterans for the purpose of hiring preferences for civil service positions. Currently, only veterans who served in time of war receive a hiring preference when applying for civil service positions. This amendment would allow veterans who did not serve in time of war also to receive a hiring preference for civil service positions. ||In Committee | | |[AJR208](/billdetail/1503128) |Designates November of each year as \"Curing Stomach Cancer Month.\" ||This resolution designates November as \"Curing Stomach Cancer Month\" in New Jersey. Stomach cancer, also referred to as gastric cancer, is among the cancers with the lowest five-year survival rate, in part because routine screening for the disease is not typically done in the United States. Survival rates for stomach cancer are also affected by the fact that many individuals do not experience symptoms and, therefore, do not seek medical care until the cancer has metastasized. While individuals diagnosed with early stage stomach cancer have a greater than 71 percent five-year survival rate, patients with metastatic cancer have just a 6.0 percent likelihood of living for five years after diagnosis. Given the difficulty in identifying stomach cancer symptoms, the lack of routine screening for this cancer, and the reduced five-year survival rate for metastatic disease, funding for research into effective treatments is vital. In federal fiscal year 2020, however, the National Cancer Institute invested just 0.16 percent, or $10.6 million, of its $6.4 billion appropriation on stomach cancer research. The resolution's sponsor intends to educate the public concerning risk factors for stomach cancer, the necessity for timely screening and diagnosis, and the need for greater funding for research into innovative treatments for stomach cancer. ||In Committee | | |[A4476](/billdetail/1490317) |Requires emergency medical technicians and firefighters to receive training concerning electric vehicle fires. ||This bill requires emergency medical technicians and firefighters within the State to be trained on the risks associated with electric vehicles and in the safe and effective management of electric vehicle fires. Under this bill, the Division of Fire Safety, in consultation with the New Jersey Fire and Emergency Medical Services Institute, will adopt a training course for firefighters. The Commissioner of Health, in consultation with the Commissioner of Human Services, the New Jersey Fire and Emergency Medical Services Institute, and the New Jersey State First Aid Council, will adopt a training course for emergency medical technicians. For the last 20 years, there has been increased interest in and use of electric vehicles. While the risk of an electric vehicle fire is low, managing an electric vehicle fire requires specialized training since a lithium-ion battery can burn hotter and for a longer period of time than a gasoline engine. ||In Committee | | |[A4485](/billdetail/1490346) |Requires health insurance carriers to provide adequate network of physicians. ||This bill requires health insurance carriers to provide an adequate network of physicians. Under the bill, a carrier will ensure that a network have a sufficient number of physicians to ensure that 100 percent of covered persons reside no more than: (1) a 20 minute drive or 10 miles, whichever is less, from at least three primary care physicians within each type of primary care specialty as defined in the bill and within the geographic boundaries of the State; and (2) a 30 minute drive or 15 miles, whichever is less, from at least three office-based medical specialists within each specialty as defined in the bill and within the geographic boundaries of the State. Under the bill, a network will be required to have a sufficient number of physicians to: (1) meet the health needs of covered persons; (2) provide an appropriate choice of physicians sufficient to render services covered by the health benefits plan; and (3) reasonably ensure that covered persons have timely access to in-network facilities. The bill provides that a carrier will be required to submit a plain language description of the network to the commissioner with information sufficient to allow the commissioner to determine whether the network is in compliance with the provisions of the bill. The commissioner will investigate the information supplied in the description to ensure compliance. Annually thereafter, the carrier will be required to submit an updated, plain language description of the network to the commissioner and must certify that the network described remains compliant with the provisions of the bill. Additionally, the bill requires the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance and the Commissioner of Human Services to establish a system by which a covered person may file a formal complaint concerning network adequacy with the Department of Banking and Insurance or the Department of Human Services. The bill also requires a carrier to display the plain language description of each network available to the public in a conspicuous location within its internet website within 20 days of the submission of the description to the commissioner. ||In Committee | | |[A5066](/billdetail/1520779) |Concerns administration of ready-to-use undesignated glucagon rescue therapy in public schools. ||This bill directs the school to obtain and properly maintain a standing order of ready-to-use undesignated glucagon rescue therapy. This bill also directs authorized school employees to administer the ready-to-use glucagon to a student experiencing severe hypoglycemia. Ready-to-use glucagon rescue therapy is used to treat someone experiencing severe hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia occurs when a person experiences an abnormally low blood sugar level and is categorized by level of severity, expressed as mild, moderate, or severe hypoglycemia. Failure to treat severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness, seizures, critical brain damage, and possibly death. In 2019, about 29 million Americans had diabetes; approximately 244,000 of them were children and adolescents. People with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes who are treated with insulin are at the highest risk of experiencing a hypoglycemic event. Severe hypoglycemia is the most immediate danger to children with diabetes. Having a ready-to-use undesignated glucagon rescue therapy available to school employees would provide treatment to a student experiencing severe hypoglycemia. This bill would create access to glucagon rescue therapies for any student with diabetes while the student is in the care of school. ||In Committee | | |[A5070](/billdetail/1520828) |Establishes act of disseminating misinformation as professional misconduct for health care professionals. ||This bill establishes the act of disseminating misinformation or disinformation by a health care professional as an act of professional misconduct subject to disciplinary action. It is the sponsor's intent that this legislation will help combat health misinformation and curb the spread of falsehoods that threaten the health and safety of New Jersey residents. The bill defines \"disseminate\" to mean the conveyance of information, in the form of treatment or advice, from a health care professional to a patient under the health care professional's care. \"Misinformation\" means any health-related claim of fact that is false and contradicted by contemporary scientific consensus contrary to the standard of care. \"Disinformation\" means misinformation that is deliberately disseminated with malicious intent or an intent to mislead. ||In Committee | | |[A4484](/billdetail/1490349) |Revises reporting requirements for nursing homes concerning financial disclosures and ownership structure. ||This bill revises certain reporting requirements for nursing homes. Specifically, the bill requires nursing home owners and operators, as well as applicants for a transfer of ownership of a nursing home and third party entities exercising substantial management control over the nursing home, to provide an organizational chart identifying: parent corporations and wholly-owned subsidiaries; principals that provide a service, facility, or supplies to the nursing home; and unrelated parties that provide a service, facility, or supplies to the nursing home that are paid $200,000 or more by the nursing home. In the case of an applicant for a transfer of ownership of a nursing home, these disclosures will be based on expectations with regard to services, facilities, supplies, and payments. The bill additionally revises the financial disclosures required for nursing home owners and operators, as well as applicants for a transfer of ownership and entities to which substantial management control over the nursing home would be delegated, to require the submission of a consolidated financial statement that: 1) is reviewed or audited by a certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and 2) includes: a balance sheet detailing the assets, liabilities, and net worth that the end of the reporting entity's fiscal year; a statement of income, expenses, and operating surplus or deficit for the annual fiscal period, and a statement of ancillary utilization and patient census; a statement detailing patient revenue by payer, including, but not limited to, Medicare, NJ FamilyCare, and other payers, and revenue center; a statement of cash flows, including, but not limited to, ongoing and new capital expenditures and depreciation; and a combined financial statement that includes all entities reported in the consolidated financial report. For applicants for a transfer of ownership and entities seeking to delegate management of a nursing home, this information will be included with certain materials that current law requires be provided to the Department of Health (DOH); in the case of a transfer of ownership application, the information will be made available on the DOH's Internet website, with certain personal identifying and proprietary material excised. For current nursing home owners and operators, the nursing home's ownership information, the financial information for the nursing home, for certain parties providing services to the nursing home, and for a third party exercising substantial management control over the nursing home, and the organizational chart for the nursing home and for any third party exercising substantial management control over a nursing home, are to be annually posted on the nursing home's internet website, submitted to the DOH, and linked through the DOH's website. Current law provides that the financial disclosures required for a transfer of ownership application vary, depending on whether the transfer involves a controlling interest in the nursing home and whether the prospective new owner has previously owned, operated, or managed a nursing home in New Jersey. The bill revises these requirements to require audited consolidated financial statements for all prospective new owners and operators who will be acquiring an interest of five percent or more in the nursing home. The bill removes an existing requirement for nursing homes to post the cost reports submitted to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on their Internet websites. Current law allows nonprofit nursing homes to submit their Internal Revenue Service Form 990 in lieu of an owner-certified financial statement. The bill removes this language, thereby requiring nonprofit nursing homes to submit the same audited consolidated financial statements as are required of for profit nursing homes under the bill. The bill grants the Commissioner of Human Services the discretion to accept a consolidated financial statement that meets the requirements of the bill as satisfying the requirement that nursing homes report revenues and expenditures for the purposes of establishing and enforcing a direct care loss ratio, as required under current law. ||In Committee | | |[A5069](/billdetail/1520937) |Prohibits social media platforms from using certain practices or features that cause child users to become addicted to platform. ||Prohibits social media platforms from using certain practices or features that cause child users to become addicted to platform. ||Crossed Over | | |[A5073](/billdetail/1520956) |Requires planning board reexamination report to set forth recommendations for the siting of warehouses consistent with State Plan and with warehouse siting guidance policy adopted by State Planning Commission. ||The development of industrial-scale warehousing for goods storage and distribution has undergone rapid change in recent years, which has caused the State Planning Commission to adopt Distribution Warehousing and Goods Movement Guidelines for the purpose of providing municipalities with guidance to follow in the siting of warehouses. Previous warehouse types used to be a less conspicuous land use, often limited to industrial parks in peripheral areas. Distribution warehouses that are being developed currently are significantly larger than previous warehouse types, and their development has often imposed detrimental externalities on adjacent municipalities and residential neighborhoods. While recognizing that the development of distribution warehouses is of Statewide economic importance, the State will benefit from greater consistency and coordination in the decision-making that leads to warehouse development approvals. Under current law, every planning board that has adopted a master plan is required to reexamine its master plan at least every 10 years. This bill would require each planning board's reexamination report to set forth the planning board's recommendations concerning locations appropriate for the development of warehouses, and would require the recommendations to be consistent and compatible with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, and with the most recent warehouse siting guidance policy adopted by the State Planning Commission. ||In Committee | | |[A4515](/billdetail/1493369) |Requires State blanks, forms, documents, and applications to incorporate new standards for collection of information about sex, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. ||This bill requires all blanks, forms, documents, and applications furnished to the public for official business by a State department, commission, committee, council, or agency to be modernized to incorporate new standards for the collection of information about an individual's sex, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Specifically, the bill requires that information about an individual's sex, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation be collected in all situations where other demographic data is collected, such as data concerning race and ethnicity. As with the collection of other demographic information, it will be optional for an individual to provide information about the individual's sex, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Any blank, form, document, or application requesting information about an individual's sex, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation is to be clearly marked in a manner that informs the individual that providing the information is optional, and that services will not be withheld if the individual chooses not to provide the information. The authority to grant or refuse the disclosure of information about an individual's sex, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation remains with the individual, or with the individual's parent or guardian, if the individual is a minor under the age of 18, and no third party actor, including, but not limited to, a health care provider or a State employee or partner, will have the ability to grant or refuse the disclosure of such information. The bill requires that any questions relating to sex, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation be posed in a manner that: 1) is sensitive to the individual, and that does not infringe upon or threaten the individual's mental and physical well-being; 2) allows for non-binary designations; and 3) is consistent with relevant best practices, as recognized by Garden State Equality and other relevant organizations that engage in advocacy on behalf of the State's lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ+) communities. The bill further provides that, in cases where the State is required by a federal agency or other federal initiative to collect and report information related to a person's sex, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation, the State department, commission, committee, council, or agency responsible for collecting and reporting that information will be required to include, within its program rules, documentation verifying the applicable federal requirements before it will be authorized to include any questions related to sex, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation on the forms, blanks, documents, or applications that it uses to comply with those federal requirements. Most, if not all, State blanks, forms, documents, and applications currently use outmoded means of collecting information about sex and gender. Specifically, they often conflate the meanings of sex and gender, do not collect information concerning sexual orientation and gender identity, and do not allow individuals who exist outside of the historical male/female binary system to accurately document their gender identity. This is inconsistent with recent changes made to New Jersey birth certificates, which now allow for documentation of gender identity outside of a historical male/female binary system. It is the sponsor's belief that, by requiring all State forms and other documents to reflect a more modernized methodology for the collection of information on sex, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation, the State will better serve New Jersey's sexual and gender minorities by gathering information critical to targeting government programs and public policy to address the needs of the LGBTQ+ community. ||In Committee | | |[A5072](/billdetail/1521079) |Establishes bee-friendly habitat Department of Agriculture; appropriates $1 million. ||Establishes bee-friendly habitat appropriates $1 million. ||Crossed Over | | |[AJR219](/billdetail/1560562) |Designates November of each year as \"New Jersey Homeless Children and Youth Awareness Month.\" ||This resolution Designates November of each year as \"New Jersey Homeless Children and Youth Awareness Month.\" In the United States, public schools identified approximately 1,100,000 homeless children and youth during the 2020-2021 school year. An estimated 1,300,000 children younger than six years of age in 2018-2019 and approximately 4,200,000 youth and young adults in 2017 experienced homelessness. Infants experiencing homelessness are at a higher risk for certain illnesses and health conditions, and families experiencing homelessness are more likely to experience involvement in the child welfare system and difficulty with school attendance. More than one in three high school students experiencing homelessness has attempted suicide, and nearly one in four high school students experiencing homelessness has experienced dating violence. Individuals without a high school degree or general educational development certificate (GED) are three times more likely to report homelessness than their peers, making lack of education the leading risk factor for homelessness. In 2018, the high school graduation rate for students experiencing homelessness was 67.8 percent, compared to 80 percent for low-income students and 85.5 percent for all students. According to the New Jersey 2022 Point-In-Time Count, on the night of January 25th, 2022, a total of 6,631 households, including 8,754 persons, were experiencing homelessness in New Jersey. Of the 6,631 homeless households counted in New Jersey in 2022, 988 were families with at least one child under the age of 18 and one adult. A total of 1,750 persons were identified as chronically homeless, and 978 persons were unsheltered on the night of the count. Homeless youth, which is defined by the New Jersey 2022 Point-In-Time Count as individuals and families with heads of households 24 years old or younger, represented 8.9 percent of the counted homeless population, with 780 persons identified. The rate of youth homelessness is the same in rural, suburban, and urban areas. Twenty-nine percent of unaccompanied homeless youth between 13 and 25 years of age have spent time in foster care, compared to approximately six percent of all children. Homelessness among children and youth is a complex issue that often co-occurs with deep poverty, low education and employment levels, substance misuse and abuse, mental illness, lack of affordable housing, and family conflict. Awareness of child and youth homelessness must be heightened to encourage greater support for effective programs to help children and youth overcome homelessness. ||In Committee | | |[A5197](/billdetail/1569539) |Directs DEP to identify oyster reefs in need of restoration and allow certain entities to establish no-harvest restoration sites. ||This bill directs the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to identify existing oyster reefs that are in need of restoration in State waters. In addition, this bill directs the DEP to allow, under conditions deemed appropriate by the DEP, malacologists, knowledgeable nonprofits or organizations, and any other entity that is qualified and appropriate, the opportunity to restore the identified oyster reefs by establishing no-harvest restoration sites within them. The DEP would be required, under the bill, to adopt rules and regulations to implement the bill's provisions, including, but not limited to, rules and regulations establishing standards, requirements, and best practices for the cultivation of oysters in association with the restoration of oyster reefs, the establishment and maintenance of no-harvest restoration sites, and a process to add or remove the designation of a site as a no-harvest restoration site. ||In Committee | | |[A5191](/billdetail/1569608) |Establishes Statewide targets to reduce disposal of organic waste in landfills; requires DEP to adopt regulations to achieve targets. ||This bill would establish Statewide targets to reduce the disposal of organic waste in landfills, and would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to adopt regulations to achieve those targets. The Statewide targets established in the bill are as follows: (1) a 50 percent reduction in the level of the Statewide disposal of organic waste from the 2016 level by January 1, 2027; and (2) a 75 percent reduction in the level of the Statewide disposal of organic waste from the 2016 level by January 1, 2032. The bill would require the DEP to adopt regulations to achieve these targets within 18 months after the bill's enactment. These regulations may require local governments to impose requirements on generators of organic waste or other appropriate persons or entities, and may authorize local governments to impose reasonable penalties for noncompliance. The regulations would not, however, include a numeric organic waste disposal limit for individual landfills. The bill would authorize local governments to charge and collect reasonable fees from generators of organic waste and other appropriate persons or entities to recover costs the local government incurs in complying with the regulations. No later than July 1, 2027, the DEP would be required to prepare and submit a report analyzing the progress that the solid waste sector, State government, and local governments have made in achieving the organic waste reduction targets established in the bill. Nothing in the bill would prohibit a local government from adopting, implementing, and enforcing requirements regarding the reduction of organic waste that are more stringent than, or in addition to, those adopted under the bill. ||In Committee | | |[A5196](/billdetail/1569679) |Requires warning label for water beads. ||Requires warning label for water beads. ||Introduced | | |[A5198](/billdetail/1569752) |Requires registration and regulation of certain hemp-derived cannabinoids manufactured and sold in this State. ||Requires registration and regulation of certain hemp-derived cannabinoids manufactured and sold in this State. ||In Committee | | |[A5194](/billdetail/1569767) |Provides certain protections to residents of long-term care facilities. ||Provides certain protections to residents of long-term care facilities. ||In Committee | | |[A5195](/billdetail/1569819) |Requires State and private correctional facilities to allow inmates to make telephone and video calls at no cost to inmate or other party. ||Requires State and private correctional facilities to allow inmates to make telephone and video calls at no cost to inmate or other party. ||In Committee | | |[A4513](/billdetail/1493383) |Prohibits excessive price increases during period of declared abnormal market disruption. ||This bill makes it an unlawful practice for any person to sell or offer to sell any consumer good consumed or used to preserve, protect, or sustain the life, health, safety, or comfort of persons or their property for a price that constitutes an excessive price increase following the declaration of an abnormal market disruption by the Governor. Current law prevents excessive price increases during a declared state of emergency in the State. This bill would expand the protections afforded to consumers during periods of abnormal market disruption that may occur in the State in the wake of natural or man-made emergencies, disasters, and outbreaks, taking place nationwide and globally. In these situations, conditions within the geographical boundaries of the State may not warrant a declaration of a state of emergency; however, New Jersey consumers, including individuals, businesses, hospitals, schools, and local government units could be harmed significantly by rapidly increasing prices for certain consumer goods. The Legislature recognizes that the cost of merchandise is best left to the marketplace under ordinary conditions, but finds that the public interest requires certain excessive and unjustified price increases to be prohibited during declared periods of abnormal market disruption. Under the provisions of the bill, it would be an unlawful practice for any person to sell or offer to sell within 30 days after the declaration of an abnormal market disruption, or for any other period of time as the Governor may specify in the declaration, any consumer good which is consumed or used to preserve, protect, or sustain the life, health, safety, or comfort of persons or their property for a price that constitutes an excessive price increase. The bill defines an \"excessive price increase\" as a price that is excessive as compared to the price at which the consumer good was sold or offered for sale by the seller in the usual course of business immediately prior to the abnormal market disruption. Under the definition, the price would be deemed excessive: (1) if it exceeds by more than 10 percent the price at which the good was sold or offered for sale by the seller in the usual course of business immediately prior to the declaration of an abnormal market disruption, unless the price charged by the seller is attributable to additional costs imposed by the seller's supplier or other costs of providing the good during the abnormal market disruption; or (2) if the increase is attributable to additional costs imposed by the seller's supplier or additional costs of providing the good during the abnormal market disruption, but the price represents an increase of more than 10 percent in the amount of markup from cost, compared to the markup customarily applied by the seller in the usual course of business immediately prior to the abnormal market disruption. Additionally, under the bill, upon issuance of a declaration of an abnormal market disruption, the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety would be required to provide notice to consumers on its Internet website. The notice would be required to be displayed prominently for the duration of time for which the declaration is in effect.

An unlawful practice under the consumer fraud act, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense.

Mental illness can adversely affect children in many ways, including increasing the likelihood of a child being suspended from school, abusing drugs or alcohol, or ending up in the juvenile justice system. ACEs, which are traumatic experiences that occur during childhood, can cause toxic stress, impacting the development of a child's fundamental brain architecture and stress response systems, and place children who undergo multiple ACEs at a higher risk of suffering from depression, alcohol and substance use disorders, suicidal tendencies, early death, and becoming victims or perpetrators of sexual violence. Many children with mental health disorders who undergo multiple ACEs do not receive treatment for their illnesses due to poor understanding of mental illness, toxic stress, stigma, and an insufficient number of pediatric mental health professionals in the United States and New Jersey which reduces of access to available treatment options. The resolution intends to promote awareness of pediatric mental illness and ACEs, in hopes of improving the lives of children who have emotional disturbances, other mental health disorders, or faced trauma and adversity throughout their lives. ||In Committee | | |[A4514](/billdetail/1493404) |Requires air conditioning in State correctional facilities. ||This bill requires each existing correctional facility be retrofitted with air conditioning within three years of this act becoming effective. Construction of new correctional facilities, in accordance with this bill, will require installation of an air conditioning system. The Commissioner of Corrections would be required to ensure that the heat index or \"feels like\" temperature does not exceed 85 degrees. The commissioner is required to record and report the daily maximum temperature inside each facility, and include this data in the annual reports of the Department of Corrections and the Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson, which are to be made available on their official websites. In the sponsor's view, excessive heat and lack of air conditioning put the elderly, those with health conditions such as high blood pressure and mental health issues at a higher risk. According to the sponsor, the Department of Corrections has current protocols in place to address excess heat which are initiated when temperatures exceed 85 degrees. The sponsor's intent is to have correctional facilities maintain indoor temperatures between 60 and 85 degrees. The bill clarifies that the reference to 85 degrees refers to the heat index or \"how hot it feels\" rather than the recorded air temperature. ||In Committee | | |[A4619](/billdetail/1493482) |Codifies and extends authorization for certain out-of-State health care practitioners and recent graduates of health care training programs to practice in New Jersey. ||Codifies and extends authorization for certain out-of-State health care practitioners and recent graduates of health care training programs to practice in New Jersey. ||In Committee | | |[A5334](/billdetail/1608633) |Designates bridge over Crosswicks Creek on Interstate Highway Route 295 North as \"Benjamin Moore and the 693rd Sappers Company Memorial Highway.\" ||This bill designates the bridge over Crosswicks Creek on Interstate Highway Route 295 North as the \"Benjamin Moore and the 693rd Sappers Company Memorial Highway\" to honor the patriotism of Benjamin G. Moore, who was killed in action in Afghanistan, and the 693rd Sappers Company. The Legislature honors Mr. Moore for his service to the people of the United States and the State of New Jersey. Consistent with Department of Transportation policy and other road designations, the bill provides that State or other public funds are not to be used for producing, purchasing, or erecting signs bearing the designation for the \"Benjamin Moore and the 693rd Sappers Company Memorial Highway.\" The Commissioner of Transportation is authorized to receive financial assistance from private sources for the costs associated with producing, purchasing, erecting, and maintaining signs bearing the designation. ||In Committee | | |[A4758](/billdetail/1494918) |\"Protecting Against Forever Chemicals Act\"; establishes requirements, prohibitions, and programs for regulation of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). ||\"Protecting Against Forever Chemicals Act\"; establishes requirements, prohibitions, and programs for regulation of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). ||In Committee | | |[A5330](/billdetail/1608684) |Prohibits sale of non-flushable disposable wipes. ||This bill prohibits the sale of non-flushable disposable wipes. Under the bill, it is an unlawful practice under the consumer fraud act, for a person to sell, offer for sale, or distribute for sale a non-flushable disposable wipe product. Non-flushable disposable wipes are cloth-like products intended for the personal cleansing of the human body. However, consumers may wrongly assume these products may be safely disposed of in the toilet. Non-flushable disposable wipes are typically made of synthetic materials that do not break down or disintegrate when submerged in water, even over a long period of time. This results in significant harm to sewage and septic systems, causing pipes, pumps, and water treatment systems to get clogged and require costly repairs. An unlawful practice under the consumer fraud act, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense.

This bill requires the Division of Purchase and Property in the Department of the Treasury to award a cybersecurity contract for use by all State agencies. Any State agency or local contracting unit will be required to, whenever technically feasible, use or require the use of this Statewide cybersecurity contract. This bill also requires the Office of Information Technology to develop and publish cybersecurity system standards on its website, which must be equivalent to the standards of the National Institute of Standards and Technology or any other substantially similar federal entity.

Under the bill, the Department of Health (department) is to establish a food and beverage delivery vehicle network company license program and application process, which is to entitle the holder to engage in digital sales in the State. An applicant seeking to obtain a food and beverage delivery vehicle network company license is to apply to the department in a form and manner determined by the department. The application is to include such information as the department deems relevant. The bill defines \"digital network\" to mean any online-enabled technology application, service, website, or system offered or utilized by a food and beverage delivery vehicle network company that enables a digital sale to occur between a customer and a food and beverage delivery vehicle network company. \"Digital sale\" means a transaction in which a customer purchases food from a food and beverage delivery vehicle network company through a digital network, for which a food and beverage delivery vehicle is used to deliver food that was processed and prepared at a food commissary. \"Food and beverage delivery vehicle\" means a vehicle that is operated by a food and beverage delivery vehicle network company, which contains refrigerated storage, hot holding, or heating equipment for the purposes of transporting and delivering food prepared and processed at a food commissary to a customer at a predetermined location, does not accept payment or otherwise process sales transactions on the vehicle, and is stored at either at a food commissary or storage and supply center when not being used for delivery. \"Food and beverage delivery vehicle network company\" means a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or any other legal entity that utilizes a digital network to conduct digital sales in the State. \"Food commissary\" means a facility that is utilized by a food and beverage delivery vehicle network company where food is processed, prepared, stored, or packed for transport, delivery, and consumption. \"Storage and supply center\" means a facility that is operated by a food and beverage delivery vehicle network company that provides storage of a food delivery vehicle, or storage of food that was processed, prepared, stored, or packed at a food commissary. The bill provides that the department may permit applicants to self-certify that, if approved for licensure, food will be stored, processed, prepared, and handled in sanitary conditions in all food and beverage delivery vehicles, food commissaries, and storage and supply centers operated by the applicant in a manner that is consistent with the applicable provisions of law. A food and beverage delivery vehicle network company license is to be valid for a term of two years from the date of issuance, unless suspended or revoked for cause, and may be renewed upon application to the department. Under the bill, the department may inspect any of the food and beverage delivery vehicles, food commissaries, and storage and supply centers, operated by a licensed food and beverage delivery vehicle network company, if the department reasonably believes that the food and beverage delivery vehicle network company is storing, preparing, processing, or handling food in unsanitary conditions, selling unsafe food, or violating any provision of this bill. The department may partner with a municipal or county health department to conduct inspections and may charge a license holder a reasonable fee to cover all costs associated with conducting an inspection. If, upon inspection of a food and beverage delivery vehicle, food commissary, or storage and supply center, the department determines that the food and beverage delivery vehicle network company is storing, preparing, processing, or handling food in unsanitary conditions, selling unsafe food, or violating any provision of this bill, the department is to take appropriate corrective measures. The bill provides that a food and beverage delivery vehicle network company is to maintain individual digital sale records for all sales conducted within the State for at least a two year period following the date of the digital sale. The department may inspect the digital sale records held by the food and beverage delivery vehicle network company for all sales conducted within the State if the department provides a written request for the records and a legitimate basis for the request. Any records inspected by the department are to: be deemed confidential, not be disclosed to a third party except with the prior written consent of the food and beverage delivery vehicle network company, and not be considered a government record pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5 et al.), or the common law concerning access to government records. ||Dead | | |[A5537](/billdetail/1633019) |Establishes New Jersey Veteran Services Grant Program in DMVA; makes appropriation. ||Establishes New Jersey Veteran Services Grant Program in DMVA; makes appropriation. ||In Committee | | |[AJR228](/billdetail/1634405) |Commemorates 70th anniversary of armistice that ended Korean War. ||Commemorates 70th anniversary of armistice that ended Korean War. ||Crossed Over | | |[ACR183](/billdetail/1634502) |Urges United States President, Congress, and USDA to take steps to protect SNAP beneficiaries from fraud. ||This resolution urges the President of the United States, the United States Congress, and the United States Department of Agriculture to take all steps necessary to promptly find a comprehensive resolution to the rising levels of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit fraud occurring throughout the country. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides assistance to supplement the food budget of low-income families nationwide. The program is regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and administered by the Division of Family Development, within the Department of Human Services, in conjunction with the county welfare agencies. Fraud of SNAP benefits has risen to an alarming level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the most frequent culprit of lost benefits related to \"skimming\" devices. Skimming occurs when devices are illegally installed on point-of-sale terminals to capture a cardholder's personal identification number and other data stored on the magnetic strip of the EBT card. Criminals use the data to duplicate the EBT card and access the victim's SNAP benefits. In December 2022, Congress addressed the growing concern of stolen SNAP benefits in the passage of the \"Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023,\" which allows state agencies to temporarily use federal funds to replace SNAP benefits lost to skimming and other forms of fraud between October 1, 2022, and September 30, 2024. While these federal efforts to protect SNAP beneficiaries from the consequences of skimming are a positive step in the right direction, the New Jersey State Legislature encourages its federal partners to take additional actions to more aggressively safeguard this vulnerable community; including authorizing the permanent replacement of stolen SNAP benefits with federal funds, retroactive to October 2021, and the provision of regulations and funds to support more secure card payment systems for SNAP benefits. ||In Committee | | |[A5630](/billdetail/1636251) |Expands exemptions from criminal drug paraphernalia laws to additionally exempt certain harm reduction supplies. ||This bill exempts certain harm reduction supplies from State criminal drug paraphernalia laws. Current law establishes criminal penalties for possessing, manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or advertising drug paraphernalia, which items used in connection with the production, distribution, and use of illicit drugs. Current law provides certain exceptions from the definition of \"drug paraphernalia\" for fentanyl test strips and hypodermic needles and syringes that are sold by a pharmacy. This bill would expand the current exceptions to include any materials or equipment used or intended for use in preventing, reducing, or mitigating the adverse effects associated with personal drug use, including materials and equipment, such as clean syringes and needles, that can prevent disease transmission, as well as materials like opioid antidotes and test strips, that can help prevent and reverse an overdose. The bill expands a provision of current law specifying that it is not unlawful to use, or to possess with the intent to use, a hypodermic needle or syringe, to additionally provide it is not unlawful to distribute hypodermic needles and syringes. The bill additionally revises the definition of \"harm reduction supplies\" used in the \"Bloodborne Disease Harm Reduction Act,\" which authorizes the establishment of syringe access programs, to align that definition with the one established under the bill in relation to drug paraphernalia. The bill amends the definition of \"drug paraphernalia\" used in the criminal code to remove from the definition: dilutants and adulterants used to cut drugs; certain devices that can be used to compound drugs, such as mixing bowls and blenders; and various objects that can be used to ingest drugs, such as pipes, roach clips, and cocaine spoons. The bill additionally removes from the definition a reference to testing equipment, which is obviated by the bill. Current law authorizes pharmacies to sell up to 10 hypodermic needles and syringes to an individual without a prescription, provided the needles and syringes are maintained under or behind the pharmacy counter. This bill authorizes needles and syringes to be stored in another otherwise-secure place in the pharmacy, and requires pharmacies to offer the option of returning used needles and syringes to the pharmacy for safe disposal. The bill makes certain technical changes to the current law to update a citation, to update certain obsolete language, and to clarify certain rulemaking authority under the \"Bloodborne Disease Harm Reduction Act.\" It is the sponsor's belief that making harm reduction supplies more readily available will help reduce the transmission of bloodborne diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis C, and help reduce overdose deaths caused by the presence of substances like fentanyl and xylazine, which are increasingly present in drugs purchased on the black market. ||In Committee | | |[A5631](/billdetail/1636304) |Broadens eligibility of NJ STARS Program by permitting later entry into program. ||This bill broadens eligibility of NJ STARS Program by permitting later entry into the program than is currently allowed. Current law provides that if a student meets the eligibility criteria for receipt of a NJ STARS scholarship but is not able to demonstrate the skill levels required to pursue courses for credit at a county college, the student will have one year to attain and demonstrate college readiness, or the student will lose eligibility for the NJ STARS scholarship. This bill removes this time limit. Additionally, N.J.A.C.9A:9-10.4 requires an eligible student to enroll in a full-time course of study at a New Jersey county college by the fifth semester after high school graduation. This bill provides that a student's eligibility for the program, once established, will not expire provided that the student meets the program's eligibility criteria at the time of program participation. ||In Committee | | |[A5632](/billdetail/1636367) |Adopts Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact. ||Adopts Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact. ||Crossed Over | | |[A5697](/billdetail/1637913) |Establishes School Plastics Upcycling Grant Program in DEP to provide proportional awards to eligible schools based on pro rata share of plastics collected, by each school, for upcycling purposes; appropriates $5 million. ||Establishes School Plastics Upcycling Grant Program in DEP to provide proportional awards to eligible schools based on pro rata share of plastics collected, by each school, for upcycling purposes; appropriates $5 million. ||Introduced Agricultural Development Zone Act.\" || This bill directs the governing body of the county, in consultation with the county agriculture board and the Department of Agriculture, to establish urban agricultural development zones in urban areas of the county and designate within municipalities within those zones qualified real property to receive property tax exemptions. \"Qualified real property\" is defined under the bill as any parcel of real property less than five acres in size that is abandoned, underutilized, or vacant, including, but not necessarily limited to, an abandoned, underutilized, or vacant plot of land or a building, which can be used for agricultural or horticultural purposes to produce agricultural or horticultural products through aquaculture, aquaponics, or hydroponics, by roof-top farming, or through the use of greenhouses, high tunnels, or other structures beneficial for the production of agricultural or horticultural products. The bill also establishes requirements for municipalities and property owners to enter into a financial agreement for the schedule of payments in lieu of taxes established in the bill. Finally, the bill provides for a 50% reduction of sales tax collected from the sale of agricultural or horticultural products produced on the qualified real property. ||In Committee | | |[A4916](/billdetail/1498198) |Amends \"New Jersey Angel Investor Tax Credit Act\" to provide additional tax credits for investments in high-growth businesses. ||This bill amends the \"New Jersey Angel Investor Tax Credit Act\" to provide additional tax credits for taxpayers who make qualified investments in high-growth businesses. Currently, taxpayers are allowed credits against the gross income tax and corporation business tax equal to 20 percent of a qualified investment made by the taxpayer in a New Jersey emerging technology business, in a New Jersey emerging technology business holding company that makes a verified transfer of funds to a New Jersey emerging technology business, or in a qualified venture fund. Taxpayers qualify for an additional five percent credit, provided that the qualified investment is made in an emerging technology business that is either located in an opportunity zone or a low-income community, is a minority or women's business, or, in the case of a qualified venture fund, if the qualified venture fund commits by contract to invest 50 percent of its funds in diverse entrepreneurs. The bill would extend the availability of the five percent credit to those taxpayers who invest in a New Jersey high-growth business with 50 to 200 full-time employees, and would provide an additional 10 percent credit for investments made in a New Jersey high-growth business with 10 to 49 full-time employees. \"High-growth business\" is defined as a business that is growing significantly faster than the average growth rate of the economy; or a start-up company that is investing in developing a product or new business model that will allow it to grow significantly faster than the average growth rate of the economy within the next three to five years. \"Full time employee\" is defined as a person who is employed for consideration for at least 35 hours a week, or who renders any other standard of service generally accepted by custom or practice as full-time employment. ||In Committee | | |[A4922](/billdetail/1498219) |Requires manufacturers of electric vehicles to label electric vehicle batteries; establishes electric vehicle battery tracking database; establishes guidelines for safe disassembly of electric vehicle batteries. ||This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), no later than one year after the bill's effective date, to develop standards for the form and content of a label to be affixed to the battery of an electric vehicle by an electric vehicle manufacturer. The purpose of these standards is to ensure that the labels, developed by electric vehicle manufacturers pursuant to the bill, contain all of the information required by the DEP, are legible, and are affixed properly to the battery of an electric vehicle. The standards would be required to include, at a minimum: (1) specific information required to be included on the electric vehicle battery label, such as: (a) the company name of the electric vehicle; (b) the battery manufacturer; (c) the date of the battery's manufacture; (d) the identification of the battery's cathode chemistry; (e) the battery voltage performance and battery capacity; (f) the battery composition and processing information; and (g) a quick response (QR) code that can be scanned to provide access to the electric vehicle battery tracking database established pursuant to section 5 of the bill; (2) label placement information concerning where to affix the label on an electric vehicle battery, specifically requiring the label to be affixed to the exterior of the electric vehicle battery in such a manner that the label is visible and accessible when the battery is removed from the vehicle; (3) label placement information that is specific to electric vehicle batteries that are designed to separate into different parts, including a requirement that the label be affixed to the exterior of each part of the electric vehicle battery; (4) label formatting information; and (5) any other information the department deems necessary. The bill would also require manufacturers of electric vehicles, no later than 18 months after the bill's effective date, to develop a label, in compliance with the standards established by the department pursuant to the bill, to affix to the batteries of the electric vehicles that the manufacturer produces. A manufacturer would be required to submit a sample of the electric vehicle battery label to the DEP for approval. The DEP would be required to approve the label upon a determination that the label meets the DEP's standards. If the DEP determines that the format or location of the label does not comply with the standards, the DEP may require that the label or its location be modified accordingly. Upon request, the DEP may approve an alternate label location adjacent to the battery if the application of the label to the battery will render the label illegible. The DEP would also be required to determine a process for the submission, review, and approval of electric vehicle battery labels. Beginning two years after the bill's effective date, electric vehicle manufacturers would be prohibited from selling an electric vehicle unless the electric vehicle contains an electric vehicle battery that is affixed with the label required by the bill that is consistent with the standards set by the DEP. A manufacturer who violates the bill's provisions would be subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 for a first offense and $3,000 for a second offense. Third and subsequent violations would be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each offense. Each violation would constitute a separate offense, and each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. The DEP, no later than 18 months after the bill's effective date, would be required to establish and maintain a database to track electric vehicle batteries throughout the State. The purpose of the electric vehicle battery tracking database would be to provide information on the quantity of electric vehicle batteries within the State, battery-specific information to the owners of electric vehicles, and educational material on the safe disassembly, recycling, repurposing, and disposal of electric vehicle batteries. The database would be accessible by the QR code on the electric vehicle battery labels established pursuant to this bill. The database would be required to include, at a minimum: (1) all of the information required to be included on the electric vehicle battery label pursuant to the standards set by the department pursuant to section 2 of the bill; (2) any disclosure of hazardous materials or heavy metals present in the electric vehicle battery; (3) any product safety information or recall information, as applicable; (4) instructions for the safe disassembly of an electric vehicle battery from an electric vehicle; (5) contact information of the original equipment manufacturer to request the safe disposal of the battery; and (6) information concerning electric vehicle battery recycling, reuse, repurposing, and disposal options. The DEP would be required to review the information in the database and submit a report annually to the Governor and the Legislature on the effectiveness of the database in tracking electric vehicle batteries throughout the State, providing battery-specific information to the owners of electric vehicles, and educating the owners of electric vehicles, employees of motor vehicle repair shops, and electric vehicle manufacturers on how to safely dissemble, recycle, repurpose, and properly dispose of electric vehicle batteries. Lastly, the bill would require the DEP, no later than one year after the bill's effective date, to establish guidelines for the safe disassembly of electric vehicle batteries from electric vehicles and for the recycling, reuse, repurposing, and proper disposal of electric vehicle batteries within the State. The guidelines would serve as an educational guide for any person who may be in the position to disassemble an electric vehicle, but would also be accessible to any person in the State. The DEP would be required to publish the guidelines on the department's Internet website and update the guidelines annually. The guidelines would be required to include, at a minimum: (1) informational resources, training, and safety measures for the safe disassembly of an electric vehicle battery from an electric vehicle; and (2) information about recycling, reuse, repurposing, and disposal options for electric vehicle batteries within the State. Millions of electric vehicles have been sold in the United States during recent years. This recent increase in electric vehicle use, while positive for the fight against climate change, has presented new environmental challenges, such as where and how to properly dispose of used electric vehicle batteries, how to reuse or repurpose used electric vehicle batteries in a cost-effective way, and how to properly disassemble an electric vehicle battery from an electric vehicle. This bill would require important information about an electric vehicle battery to be labeled on the battery and also linked to an electric vehicle battery tracking database. The database would also provide educational resources concerning battery disassembly from an electric vehicle and battery recycling, reuse, repurposing, and disposal options. Lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries, which are the most commonly used electric vehicle batteries today, contain toxic chemicals that should not be placed into landfills, since they could be hazardous, cause pollution, contaminate nearby soil and water, and potentially explode if mishandled. Many used electric vehicle batteries also still retain up to 70 percent of their battery capacity when they are no longer able to power a vehicle effectively. For this reason, it is cost-effective for these used electric vehicle batteries to be reused for alternate purposes, such as home energy storage, power for streetlights, power to back-up elevators, and solar energy storage, until they are fully expired of their battery life prior to recycling or disposal. According to the California Air Resources Board, electric vehicle battery labeling will also help to enable the efficient sorting of batteries, improve the economic efficiency of material recovery, enable the reuse of used batteries for second-life applications, and prevent improper battery disposal or exposure to hazards. ||In Committee | | |[A4919](/billdetail/1498223) |Concerns social media privacy and data management for children and establishes New Jersey Children's Data Protection Commission. ||Concerns social media privacy and data management for children and establishes New Jersey Children's Data Protection Commission. ||In Committee | | |[A4920](/billdetail/1498273) |Establishes restrictions on number of dogs kept on residential property; establishes residential kennel license for property on which owner keeps and houses 15 to 25 dogs, and inspection and maintenance requirements for residential kennels. ||This bill establishes certain prohibitions concerning the number of dogs that can be kept by a person on residential property, and requires a person who keeps or houses 15 to 25 dogs on residential property the person owns or rents, to license the property as a residential kennel. The bill also provides for inspection requirements and operational requirements for residential kennels pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of the bill and authorizes additional requirements to be established by municipal ordinance and the revision of the Department of Health (DOH) regulations adopted pursuant to section 14 of P.L.1941, c. 151 (C.4:19-15.14). Specifically, the bill prohibits: 1) a person from keeping, housing, or otherwise possessing more than 25 dogs on any residential property owned or rented by the person, except if the property is licensed as a kennel by the municipality in which it is located; and 2) a person from keeping, housing, or otherwise possessing 15 to 25 dogs on any property owned or rented by the person, unless the person has a valid residential kennel license issued by the municipality in which the residential property is located pursuant to section 3 of the bill. The bill requires each dog in the residential kennel to have an individual license and establishes requirements in section 3 of the bill for the residential license, issuance of the license, and renewal thereof. The bill provides that a municipality may establish additional requirements for residential kennels by ordinance and that all the requirements established under the bill be enforced by the municipality, local health authority, or the DOH. A residential kennel license would be subject to revocation by the licensing municipality, after a hearing by the DOH or the local health authority, upon a recommendation by the DOH or local health authority for failure to comply with the bill's requirements for a residential kennel. In addition to municipal and State requirements, section 4 of the bill establishes requirements for the operation of residential kennels, including keeping and maintaining records as enumerated in subsection g. of section 4 of the bill, which must be kept for three years and made available to the DOH, local health authority, or municipality upon demand. In addition to license revocation, the bill provides that violators who fail to correct violations of the bill's provisions would be subject to civil penalties as enumerated in section 5 of the bill, and may be subject to the confiscation and forfeiture of dogs on the residential property pursuant to subsection c. of section 5 of the bill. The bill also specifies that: 1) the bill's provisions cannot be construed to confer any land use rights onto the person licensing a residential kennel; 2) any commercial operations must comply with the appropriate and required provisions of local and State law governing the zoning and regulation thereof; and 3) the bill's provisions would not supersede or interfere with a person pursuing the necessary local approvals concerning variances or other permits for land use. Finally, the bill directs the DOH to revise current rules and regulations governing the sanitary conduct and operation of kennels, pet shops, shelters, and pounds to include provisions governing the sanitary conduct and operation of residential kennels. ||In Committee | | |[A5020](/billdetail/1503105) |Prohibits water utility from taking certain actions if utility fails to participate in Low Income Household Water Assistance Program. ||Prohibits water utility from taking certain actions if utility fails to participate in Low Income Household Water Assistance Program. ||In Committee | | |[AR171](/billdetail/1503240) |Urges federal Food and Drug Administration to ease restrictions on gay and bisexual men donating blood. ||Urges federal Food and Drug Administration to ease restrictions on gay and bisexual men donating blood. ||In Committee | | |[A5044](/billdetail/1515473) |Requires health insurers to cover self-measured blood pressure monitoring for subscribers with preeclampsia; requires health care professionals to provide home blood pressure monitor to pregnant patients diagnosed with preeclampsia. ||This bill directs the Commissioner of Health to require every hospital in the State, every birthing center licensed in the State, every federally qualified health center in the State, and every physician or health care practitioner in the State providing care to a pregnant person, to provide, without cost to the patient,: (1) a validated home blood pressure monitor to a pregnant patient who is diagnosed with preeclampsia; (2) a validated home blood pressure monitor to a pregnant patient who expresses fear or anxiety regarding the patient's blood pressure and who requests a blood pressure monitor; and (3) printed educational material regarding preeclampsia to each pregnant patient at the patient's first pregnancy visit. The educational material shall be developed and distributed to providers by the Department of Health and shall include, at a minimum, the following information: a definition of preeclampsia; the symptoms and warning signs of preeclampsia and at what point a patient experiencing those symptoms or warning signs should contact a medical professional; and a description of how a patient can advocate for themselves in regard to addressing preeclampsia. The sponsor's goal is to provide pregnant patients in New Jersey, particularly those diagnosed with preeclampsia, with home blood pressure monitors and the training to use such a monitor to improve maternal outcomes in the State. Preeclampsia is a high blood pressure disorder that can occur during or after pregnancy. The condition can keep the baby from getting proper amounts of blood and oxygen from the mother. Preeclampsia can also cause the mother to have serious problems with her brain, liver, and kidneys. Monitoring blood pressure is therefore an essential part of prenatal and postpartum care. Self-measured blood pressure monitoring in a patient's home can be particularly critical in the case of masked hypertension, where blood pressure levels are elevated at home despite normal blood pressure in a clinical setting. In addition, sudden rises in blood pressure can threaten pregnant women between prenatal appointments or if they have limited access to healthcare. This bill seeks to eliminate barriers to home-based monitoring, such as access to blood pressure measurement devices or limited knowledge on how to utilize a device. In doing so, this bill provides for the early detection of life-threatening high blood pressure in pregnancy, thereby preventing the maternal and neonatal morbidities associated with preeclampsia. In addition, the bill directs that a hospital, a birthing center, a federally qualified health center, or a physician or health care practitioner that provides a patient a validated home blood pressure monitor pursuant to the bill is required, in accordance with guidelines developed by the commissioner, to educate and train the patient on the proper use of the blood pressure monitor; to transmit blood pressure data from the patient's blood pressure monitor; to interpret blood pressure data from the patient's blood pressure monitor; and to report to the Department of Health, one year after the effective date of this act and annually thereafter, de-identifiable data on the number of patients who received blood pressure monitors under this section and the health outcomes of those patients. The bill also directs the Department of Health to establish a process by which a hospital, a birthing center, a federally qualified health center, or a physician or health care practitioner that provides a patient with a validated home blood pressure monitor under the bill is able to submit a claim to the department for the reimbursement of the cost of the validated home blood pressure monitor and any provider time used to educate and train the patient on the proper use of the blood pressure monitor, to transmit blood pressure data from the patient's blood pressure monitor, and to interpret blood pressure data from the patient's blood pressure monitor, provided that the patient does not have coverage of such benefits from a third party, such as an insurance carrier or medical assistance program. The bill appropriations $1 million to the department to issue these reimbursements and requires that any unspent balance at the end of the current fiscal year be appropriated for the same purpose in the next fiscal year. Finally, under the bill, the Commissioner of Health is mandated to report to the Governor and to the Legislature, 18 months after the effective date of the bill, and annually thereafter, on the health care outcomes of patients provided blood pressure monitors under the bill, which report is to include: the number of patients who received blood pressure monitors, disaggregated by those patients who were diagnosed with preeclampsia and those patients who requested blood pressure monitors; and the number of patients who received blood pressure monitors who: had documented improvement with blood pressure following the receipt of the monitor, required hospitalization due to blood pressure issues following the receipt of the monitor, and experienced maternal mortality related to preeclampsia. The bill also requires health insurers to provide coverage for self-measured blood pressure monitoring for any subscriber who is diagnosed with preeclampsia, which coverage is to include the provision of a validated home blood pressure monitor and the reimbursement of provider time used to educate and train the subscriber on the proper use of the blood pressure monitor, to transmit blood pressure data from the subscriber's blood pressure monitor, and to interpret blood pressure data from the subscriber's blood pressure monitor. Specifically, this provision of the bill affects health, hospital, and medical service corporations; individual and group health insurance policies; health maintenance organizations; individual health benefits plans; small employer health benefits plans; the State Health Benefits Program; the School Employees' Health Benefits Program; and the State Medicaid Program. ||In Committee | | |[A5071](/billdetail/1520926) |Permits tenant to purchase residential property in certain circumstances 45 days after successful submission of bid during sheriff's sale and includes new procedures for sheriff's sale. ||This bill permits certain tenants to purchase residential property 45 days after successful submission of bid during a sheriff's sale and includes new procedures for sheriff's sales. The bill requires a notice of sale to contain specified notices to the property owner in substantially prescribed language. The bill requires the notice of sale to contain a specified notice to a tenant regarding the tenant's potential right to purchase a property containing from one to four single-family residences pursuant to a 45-day process established by the bill. In connection with these properties, the bill also requires sheriffs to maintain an Internet website and a telephone number to provide specified information on the properties that is free of charge and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The bill requires sheriff's sales to be held in the county where the property or some part of it is situated and to be made at auction, to the highest bidder, as specified. The bill provides that if the property consists of several lots or parcels, they are to be sold separately unless the mortgage provides otherwise. The bill also prohibits sheriffs from bundling properties for the purpose of sale, instead requiring each property to be bid on separately, unless the mortgage provides otherwise. The bill provides certain requirements for bids made at a sheriff's sale, authorizes a sheriff to require bidders at these sales to satisfy certain conditions, and specifies when a sheriff's sale becomes final. Under the bill, an alternative process in connection with a sheriff's sale of property will also be prescribed. In this process, if a prospective owner-occupant, as defined, is the last highest bidder, the date upon which specified conditions required of the bidder at the sheriff's sale to become final are met. The bill requires the sheriff to require the prospective owner-occupant to provide certain information confirming the owner-occupant's status. If a prospective owner occupant is not the last highest bidder, the bill would grant eligible tenant buyers, as defined, and other eligible bidders, as defined, certain rights and priorities to make bids on the property after the initial sheriff's sale and potentially to purchase it as the last and highest bidder, subject to certain requirements and timelines. The bill prescribes duties for a sheriff in connection with this process that would be performed if an owner occupant is not the last highest bidder. The bill additionally provides that specified provisions related to mortgages do not relieve a person who is deemed the legal owner of property when a deed is recorded from complying with applicable law regarding the eviction or displacement of tenants. The bill also requires the owner of vacant residential property purchased at a sheriff's sale to maintain that property. The bill authorizes a municipality to impose a civil fine of up to $1,500 for each day that the owner fails to maintain the property, subject to the owner being given notice and an opportunity to cure the violation, as specified. The bill requires the municipality to provide notice of intent to assess a civil fine if the legal owner does not commence action to remedy the violation, notify the municipality of that action, and complete the action within certain periods to be determined by the municipality, subject to specified minimum lengths of time. Finally, the bill allows a sheriff's office to establish any fees necessary to cover the costs of this bill, to be charged to the successful bidder of a sheriff's sale. The bill also requires the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency to report, to the Governor and Legislature, the number of first-time property owners that utilized the bill to acquire a residential property. ||In Committee | | |[A5074](/billdetail/1521024) |Establishes \"New Jersey Invasive Species Task Force.\" ||This bill would establish the \"New Jersey Invasive Species Task Force\" in the Department of Agriculture, comprised of nine members. The task force would be required to: (1) study the most efficient methods of controlling and limiting the spread of invasive species; (2) develop a plan to prevent new invasive species from entering the State and limit the continuing spread of invasive species that are already present; (3) develop a plan to restore threatened or fragile ecosystems to their natural condition; (4) repair damage caused by invasive species; (5) develop uniform policies and a coordinated response to the threat posed by invasive species to the State's native and agricultural vegetation, and ecological, cultural, historical, or infrastructure resources; (6) identify regulatory and statutory obstacles and inefficiencies at the federal, State, and local levels impeding the development or implementation of prevention, control, and restoration efforts; and (7) prepare a comprehensive invasive species management plan for the State that includes an estimate of the resources necessary for its implementation. The task force which would be comprised of five ex officio members or their designees, including the Secretary of Agriculture, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, the Commissioner of Health, the State Forester, and the Executive Director of the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers, the State University. The task force would also include four public members, all of whom would have extensive knowledge of invasive species, to be appointed as follows: (1) two public members to be appointed by the Governor; (2) one public member to be appointed by the President of the Senate; and (3) one public member to be appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. This bill would designate the Secretary of Agriculture and the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, or their respective designees, as co-chairpersons of the New Jersey Invasive Species Task Force. The task force would be required to hold quarterly meetings throughout the State, and at least one public meeting would be required to take place on an annual basis in southern New Jersey, central New Jersey, and northern New Jersey. The task force would also be required to prepare and update every three years, a comprehensive list of all invasive species in the State, and prepare an annual report to be submitted to the Governor and the Legislature. ||In Committee | | |[A5232](/billdetail/1575048) |Revises \"Paratransit Services DHS. ||In Committee | | |[A5258](/billdetail/1585990) |Allows for natural organic reduction of human remains. ||Allows for natural organic reduction of human remains. ||In Committee | | |[A5331](/billdetail/1608456) |Prohibits food service businesses from providing single-use plastic utensils and condiments to customers, except upon request, and requires certain food service businesses to provide reusable, washable utensils to customers eating on site. ||This bill would prohibit food service businesses in the State from providing customers with access to single-use plastic utensils or condiments, except in certain limited cases. \"Food service business\" is defined, by the bill, to mean a restaurant, caf\u00e9, food truck, vendor station, cafeteria, or any other facility or premises, or section or part thereof, including, but not limited to, a section or part of a grocery store, convenience store, hospital, school, sports arena, entertainment venue, or other similar facility or venue, where meals are prepared and served to customers for immediate consumption thereby on or off the premises, whether on a take-out, eat-in, drive-thru, or delivery basis. \"Single-use plastic utensils or condiments\" is further defined by the bill to mean those utensils or condiment packets or packages which are composed of conventional plastics and are designed to be discarded, by the consumer, after a single use. Specifically, the bill would provide that, commencing on its effective date (i.e., the first day of the seventh month next following the date of the bill's enactment): (1) no food service business operating in the State will be authorized to provide single-use plastic utensils or condiments to any customer, except upon, and in accordance with, the express request of that customer; and (2) a food service business that has on-site seating capacity for 50 or more customers will be required to provide its on-site customers with easy access to reusable, washable utensils that may be used thereby while consuming meals on the premises, and which are to be returned to the food service business, upon completion of the on-site meal, for the purposes of cleaning and reuse. Any food service business that elects to supply customers with single-use plastic utensils or condiments, upon customer request, as authorized by the bill, would be additionally required to provide each customer with only those types and amounts of single-use plastic utensils and condiments that have been expressly requested by the customer. A food service business would also be prohibited from creating, acquiring, or providing customers with bundled utensil or condiment packages that contain more than one type of single-use plastic utensil or condiment, regardless of the nature of any customer request therefor. The bill would specify that nothing in its provisions may be deemed to: (1) require a food service business to provide any single-use plastic utensils or condiments to customers, upon request, as authorized by the bill; or (2) in any way restrict a food service business' ability to provide its customers with eco-friendly alternative utensils and condiments, either on an exclusive basis or otherwise. Pursuant to definitions established in the bill, \"eco-friendly alternative utensils or condiments\" would include: utensils and condiment packets or packages which are composed of compostable material or another material approved, by the department or the United States Environmental Protection Agency, as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional plastics, regardless of whether such utensils and condiment packages are designed to be discarded, by the consumer, after a single use; utensils and condiment packets or packages which are designed to be used multiple times and are not intended to be discarded after a single use, regardless of whether such utensils and condiment packages are composed of conventional plastics; and any other utensils and condiment packets or packages that are approved, by the department or the United States Environmental Protection Agency, as eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastic utensils or condiments. Any food service business that exclusively provides its customers with eco-friendly alternative utensils and condiments would be fully exempt from compliance with the bill's requirements. Any non-exempt food service business that violates the bill's provisions would be liable to a civil penalty of $1,000 for the first offense, $2,500 for the second offense, and $5,000 for the third and each subsequent offense, to be collected through a summary proceeding, and each day on which a violation occurs would constitute a separate and distinct offense. The bill would specify, however, that no food service business will be subject to a penalty, under the bill, if it acquires, possesses, or maintains on the premises, a supply of single-use plastic utensils or condiments to provide to customers, upon request, as authorized by bill. Any moneys collected from penalties imposed pursuant to the bill would be deposited into the \"Clean Communities Program Fund\" for use in financing litter pickup, removal, education, and enforcement programs at the State and local levels. ||In Committee | | |[A5333](/billdetail/1608517) |Prohibits deepfake pornography and imposes criminal and civil penalties for non-consensual disclosure. ||This bill prohibits the emerging technological phenomenon of sexually \"deceptive audio or visual media,\" commonly known as \"deepfakes.\" Unlike older forms of audio or visual manipulation, the creator of a deepfake uses newer technology such as artificial intelligence with the intent of making it appear, as realistically as possible, that the person being depicted has engaged in activity that did not actually occur. Deepfakes have been intentionally used to embarrass or harass a person, or to cast that person in a false light. When the person being depicted is a child, deepfake technology has the potential to create realistic pornography involving the child. The penalty for non-consensual disclosure of deceptive audio or visual media is the same as for non-consensual disclosure of so-called \"revenge porn\" under the invasion of privacy statute, which under current law is a crime of the third degree. A crime of the third degree is punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both. The penalty for deceptive audio or visual media depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child is the same as for distributing, possessing, or storing child pornography, which under current law is a crime of the second degree for less than 1,000 items and a crime of the first degree for 1,000 or more items. A crime of the second degree is punishable by five to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both. A crime of the first degree is punishable by 10 to 20 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.

It is the intent of the bill's sponsor to provide enrollees with the nutritional support necessary to help prevent, manage, or treat diet-related illness or medical conditions. The bill provides Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare coverage for a minimum of 10 medically tailored meals per week for enrollees who have been diagnosed with congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or renal disease. Medically tailored meals are defined under the bill as being ready-to-eat or fully prepared meals and snacks that are designed by a dietician or a licensed nutritionist as part of a treatment plan to address an individual's diagnosed medical conditions, and which are intended to provide complete or near-complete nutrition. The bill also requires Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare coverage for medically tailored foods, in an amount sufficient for the preparation of 14 meals per week, for enrollees diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or obesity. The bill defines medically tailored foods as being non-prepared, perishable and nonperishable grocery items and produce, which are selected by a dietician or a licensed nutritionist as part of a treatment plan, and which are intended to provide partial or near-complete nutrition. Under the bill, the Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare programs are to provide subsidies for nutritious foods, in the amount of $25 per week or greater, for enrollees who have been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, overweight, or hypertension. The food items that enrollees may purchase using these subsidies may require further preparation before consumption. The bill additionally provides Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare coverage for medical nutrition therapy, in an amount and for a duration to be determined by the prescribing physician, for certain enrollees diagnosed with diabetes or renal disease. The bill further stipulates that all medically tailored nutrition services provided under the Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare programs be designed and managed by a dietician or a licensed nutritionist as part of a treatment plan to address an enrollee's medical condition. Studies show that dietary interventions, such as medically tailored meals, help reduce the number of hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and nursing home admissions for patients with diet-related illnesses. According to data from the Food is Medicine Coalition, a research and advocacy organization, six months of dietary interventions can reduce an individual's medical costs by 16 percent. As of February 2023, moreover, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers the federal Medicaid and CHIP programs, has approved Medicaid demonstration programs in Oregon, Massachusetts, and Arkansas that provide healthy food and nutrition supports for certain enrollees. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only one in ten adults consumes the recommended number of servings of fruit and vegetable, as included in the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Results of a study conducted by researchers at Tufts University show that the majority of children and youth between the ages of two and 19 years consume a diet that nutrition researchers would describe as being of \"poor quality,\" while less than one percent consume a diet that researchers would consider to be of \"ideal quality.\" A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease; conversely, a diet high in refined carbohydrates, added sugars, alcohol, and processed meats is associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and early death. Researchers have found that highly processed foods, which are associated with increased caloric intake and weight gain, comprise nearly 60 percent of the average consumer's diet and account for 90 percent of added sugar consumption. It is the sponsor's belief that individuals living with particular primary and comorbid health conditions may also have specific dietary needs that must be met in order for these individuals to manage their health. ||In Committee | | |[A5366](/billdetail/1615403) |Prohibits sale of water beads. ||This bill prohibits the sale of water beads. Water beads are small, round beads made of a water-absorbing polymer substance that, when placed in water, increase in size. Pursuant to the bill's provisions, it would be an unlawful practice under the consumer fraud act to sell, offer for sale, or distribute water beads, or any product containing water beads. An unlawful practice is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense. In addition, a violation can result in a cease and desist order issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured. Water beads are fabricated from a water-absorbing polymer capable of absorbing and retaining large amounts of water. When water beads are placed in water, they can expand to many times their original size. Water beads are marketed to children as toys and adults for use as decorative items and to help retain water in plants. When ingested, water beads expand inside the body and may cause life-threatening intestinal blockage or death. The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission has reported that children can easily mistake water-absorbing polymer balls for candy. ||In Committee | | |[A5516](/billdetail/1632833) |Requires certain health care professionals to undergo bias training. ||Requires certain health care professionals to undergo bias training. ||In Committee | | |[A4822](/billdetail/1495716) |Directs DEP to establish rebate program for purchase of microfiber washing machine filter or replacement filter; appropriates $2.5 million. ||Directs DEP to establish rebate program for purchase of microfiber washing machine filter or replacement filter; appropriates $2.5 Committee | | |[A4823](/billdetail/1495726) |Requires and BPU to study and promote use of microplastics filtering systems and technologies in New Jersey. ||Requires DEP and BPU to study and promote use of microplastics filtering systems and technologies in New Jersey. ||In Committee | | |[AJR196](/billdetail/1495990) |Designates the month of August as \"Civic Health Month\" in New Jersey. ||Designates the month of August as \"Civic Health Month\" in New Jersey. ||In Committee | | |[A5529](/billdetail/1632898) |\"New Jersey Fostering Success Voucher Act\"; provides rental assistance and case management services for certain young adults leaving foster care or kinship care; appropriates $10 million. ||\"New Jersey Fostering Success Voucher Act\"; provides rental assistance and case management services for certain young adults leaving foster care or kinship care; appropriates $10 million. ||In Heart State.\" ||This resolution declares New Jersey a \"Purple Heart State.\" New Jersey veterans and active duty military members have fought selflessly to preserve our nation's freedom, with many being wounded or killed while in the line of duty.

The recipients of the Purple Heart Medal deserve recognition and honor for the bravery that recipients have shown while serving our nation. Three states, including West Virginia, Virginia, and Washington, are declared \"Purple Heart States.\" Parts of 45 states are part of the \"Purple Heart Trail,\" a symbolic and honorary system of roads, highways, bridges and other monuments that give tribute to the veterans and active duty military members who have been awarded the Purple Heart Medal. New Jersey has multiple counties, cities, and locations that are part of the \"Purple Heart Trail.\" The \"Purple Heart Trail\" was established at the 1992 Military Order of the Purple Heart convention, which was held in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Declaring New Jersey a \"Purple Heart State\" honors the contributions and sacrifices of the New Jersey service members who have received the Purple Heart Medal. Purple Heart Medal recipients from the State have been vital in maintaining the freedoms and way of life enjoyed by the State's citizens. The people of New Jersey have great respect, admiration, and the utmost gratitude for all of the service members who have selflessly served our country and the State.

The purpose of this program is to provide municipalities with grant awards to support the establishment or expansion of programs that provide transportation services to senior citizens, without cost-sharing and regardless of the senior citizen's income. The bill defines \"senior citizen\" to mean a resident of the applicable municipality who is 55 years of age or older. \"Transportation services\" means the availability of round-trip transportation from the senior citizen's residence or other designated location, such as the municipality's senior center, to a location, either specified by the municipality or requested by the senior citizen, for purposes that may include medical appointments, recreational activities, or shopping and errands. Under the bill, the department is required to develop an application and process for municipalities to submit a request for grant funds. The application is to include, at a minimum: (1) a description of the municipality's existing transportation program for senior citizens, including the number of senior citizens serviced annually and the current fiscal year budget for senior citizen transportation services, if applicable; (2) a requested grant amount of $25,000 or less; (3) an explanation of how the grant funds will be utilized to support transportation services for senior citizens in the municipality; and (4) the estimated number of senior citizens who will be provided transportation services with the use of the grant funds. The department is also required to establish and promote a six-month period during which municipalities may submit applications for the Senior Citizen Transportation Grant Program, which period is to begin no more than 180 days after the effective date of the bill. The bill authorizes the department to determine the: (1) grant award amounts based upon information provided by the municipality through the application process and the availability of State appropriations; and (2) criteria for eligibility for grant awards, provided that the use of the grant funds by the municipality are within the scope of the program as provided for in the bill. No later than 30 days following the closure of the six-month application period, the department is to report to the Governor and the Legislature a summary of the grant program, including a list of municipalities that submitted an application for the grant, noting any application that was denied and the reason for the denial, as well as the amount and use of each awarded grant. In order to implement the grant program, the bill appropriates $2.5 million from the General Fund to the Department of Human Services. Any unexpended funds from this appropriation is to revert to the General Fund 180 days following the submission of the report by the Department of Human Services, as required under the bill. ||In Committee | | |[A4834](/billdetail/1496559) |Amends lists of environmental infrastructure projects approved for long-term funding by DEP; makes various changes to FY2023 environmental infrastructure funding program. ||This bill would amend P.L.2022, c.99 to amend the lists of environmental infrastructure projects for which the Legislature has appropriated funds to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for State fiscal year 2023 (FY2023). In August 2022, P.L.2022, c.99 was enacted into law, which appropriated funds to the DEP for the purpose of financing approximately $2.07 billion in Storm Sandy and other environmental infrastructure projects through the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (NJIB) in FY2023. This bill would amend the lists of environmental infrastructure projects for which the DEP is appropriated funds pursuant to P.L.2022, c.99 to include new projects, remove projects, modify the priority of certain projects, and modify the loan amounts for certain projects, as enumerated in subsections a. and b. of section 3 of the bill. The bill would appropriate to the DEP up to $2.19 billion, and any unexpended balances from previous authorizations, to provide loans to project sponsors for a total of 225 eligible environmental infrastructure projects for FY2023. This would include 151 projects on the \"Storm Sandy and State Fiscal Year 2023 Clean Water Project Eligibility List\" and 55 projects on the \"Storm Sandy and State Fiscal Year 2023 Drinking Water Project Eligibility List.\" The bill would also make various changes to P.L.2022, c.99 to reflect changes in the financial plan of the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (NJIB), which administers the loans used to finance the environmental infrastructure projects listed in the bill. These changes include: (1) consolidating certain appropriations for principal forgiveness loans for emerging contaminant projects; (2) adding an appropriation of up to $248 million from moneys appropriated to the DEP under the federal \"American Rescue Plan Act,\" Pub.L. 117-2, for principal forgiveness loans for construction projects that reduce or eliminate discharges from certain combined sewer overflow outfalls; (3) modifying the authorized interest rates for loans to certain projects on drinking water systems serving populations of up to 10,000 people; (4) modifying the authorized interest rates for certain drinking water projects that do not address emerging contaminants or lead; (5) providing that up to $25 million plus any appropriated but unallocated funds designated in State fiscal year 2022 may be issued for principal forgiveness loans for drinking water systems that meet the department's affordability criteria pursuant to the State's lead service line replacement program, rather than for drinking water systems that serve 10,000 or fewer customers, as in current law; (6) adding an appropriation of up to $45 million from moneys appropriated to the DEP under the federal \"American Rescue Plan Act\" for drinking water projects that address climate change concerns and ensure long-term drinking water resilience in New Jersey, or for projects for the installation of treatment systems to address multiple maximum contaminant level violations at certain drinking water systems; and (7) authorizing the DEP to increase the maximum amounts available for principal forgiveness for certain loans, to the extent additional funds are available. ||In Committee | | |[AJR233](/billdetail/1637940) |Condemns Justice Clarence Thomas' actions and urges Congress to investigate possible ethics violations and establish stringent ethics for members of the United States Supreme Court. ||Condemns Justice Clarence Thomas' actions and urges Congress to investigate possible ethics violations and establish stringent ethics for members of the United States Supreme Court. ||Introduced | | |[A2795](/billdetail/1454457) |Expands requirements for health insurance carriers concerning prostate cancer screening and requires coverage be provided without cost sharing. || This bill requires health, hospital, and medical service corporations, health maintenance organizations, and commercial group health insurers to provide coverage for an annual prostate cancer screening without cost sharing. Under current law, these health insurance carriers are required only to provide coverage for an annual medically recognized diagnostic examination including, but not limited to, a digital rectal examination and a prostate-specific antigen test for men age 50 and over who are asymptomatic and for men age 40 and over with a family history of prostate cancer or other prostate cancer risk factors. The bill expands the definition of \"prostate cancer screening\" to mean medically viable methods for the detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer, which includes a digital rectal exam and the prostate-specific antigen test and associated laboratory work. \"Prostate cancer screening\" shall also include subsequent follow up testing as direct by a physician, including, but not limited to: (1) urinary analysis; (2) serum biomarkers; (3) medical imaging, including, but not limited to, magnetic resonance imaging. The bill also extends the prostate cancer screening requirements to commercial individual health insurers, health benefits plans issued pursuant to the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage and Small Employer Health Benefits Programs, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees' Health Benefits Program, which are not required to provide this coverage under current law. ||In Committee | | |[A2792](/billdetail/1454468) |Requires long-term care facility to post certain information on its Internet website regarding Office of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman. || This bill requires a long-term care facility to post certain information on the facility's Internet website. Under the bill, a long-term care facility is to post on its Internet website information regarding the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman (ombudsman), which shall include information on the general duties of the ombudsman, the role of the ombudsman in advocating for the residents of the long-term care facility, and the ombudsman's contact information. The bill defines \"long-term care facility\" to mean a nursing home, assisted living residence, comprehensive personal care home, residential health care facility, or dementia care home licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). ||In Committee | | |[AJR37](/billdetail/1422197) |Designates March 1 of each year as \"COVID-19 Victims and Survivors Memorial Day.\" ||Designates March 1 of each year as \"COVID-19 Victims and Survivors Memorial Day.\" ||In Committee | | |[A2794](/billdetail/1454508) |Prohibits use of paper receipts containing bisphenol-A or bisphenol-S; provides for phased-in prohibition on use of all paper receipts; authorizes continued use of electronic receipts. || This bill would immediately prohibit the use, in the State, of potentially toxic paper receipts, and it would additionally phase-in a blanket prohibition on the use of all paper receipts in the State. Specifically, the bill would provide that: (1) as of the bill's effective date, a retailer or service provider will be prohibited from providing a consumer in the State with a business or banking record, including a receipt or other proof of purchase, a credit, deposit, or withdrawal slip, or a record of a debit or credit card transaction, or with any associated coupon or advertisement, that is printed on paper to which bisphenol-A (BPA) or bisphenol-S (BPS) has been added during the manufacturing process; and (2) commencing on the first day of the thirteenth month next following the bill's effective date, a retailer or service provider will be prohibited from providing a consumer in the State with a business or banking record, including a receipt or other proof of purchase, a credit, deposit, or withdrawal slip, or a record of a debit or credit card transaction, or with any associated coupon or advertisement, that is printed on paper. The bill would specify that nothing in its provisions may be deemed to prohibit a retailer or service provider from providing a consumer with an electronic receipt through email, text message, or other digital means. A retailer or service provider that violates the bill's provisions would be subject to a civil penalty of $250 to $500, to be recovered in a summary proceeding. In the case of a continuing violation, each day on which the violation continues would constitute a separate and distinct offense. The bill also authorizes the Department of Environmental Protection, a county, a municipality, or any entity certified pursuant to the \"County Environmental Health Act,\" P.L.1977, c.443 (C.26:3A2-21 et seq.), to institute a summary civil action for a civil penalty or injunctive relief to enforce the bill's provisions or prohibit and prevent a violation thereof. The United States annually consumes more than three million trees and approximately nine billion gallons of water, creates approximately 300 million pounds of solid waste, and emits approximately five billion pounds of carbon dioxide (the same amount emitted from 400,000 cars) in the production and use of paper receipts. In addition, an estimated 93 percent of paper receipts are coated with BPA and BPS, which are toxic chemicals that have been banned from water bottles and other plastic products due to the chemicals' association with reproductive impairment, type 2 diabetes, thyroid conditions, endocrine system disruption, metabolic and neurological problems, cancer, and other health conditions. When present on receipts, these chemicals can enter a person's body simply through touch, and, as a result, the use of paper receipts containing these chemicals poses a major health risk, not only to consumers, but to the workers who regularly handle them. For these reasons, the bill's prohibitions are necessary both to protect the health and welfare of consumers and retail and service workers in the State and to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, the negative effects on the environment that result from paper receipt production and use. ||In Committee | | |[ACR111](/billdetail/1454529) |Urges Congress to pass \"Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act\" and fund initiatives to expand palliative care. ||Urges Congress to pass \"Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act\" and fund initiatives to expand palliative care. ||In Committee | | |[A2776](/billdetail/1454537) |Requires telemarketers making sales calls to display their name and telephone number on any caller identification service; prohibits certain caller identification service manipulation and provides additional penalty. || This bill prohibits a telemarketer, when making or causing to be made any telemarketing sales call, from failing to transmit or cause to be transmitted the telephone number, and, when made available by the telemarketer's telephone company, the name of the telemarketer, to any caller identification (ID) service in use by a recipient of a telemarketing sales call. The bill permits the telemarketer to substitute, for the name and telephone number used in or billed for making the call, the name of the seller on behalf of which the call is placed and the seller's customer service telephone number that is answered during regular business hours. This bill prohibits a telemarketer, in connection with any telecommunications service used within this State, to knowingly make, place, initiate, or otherwise transmit a call or text message or engage in conduct that results in the display of misleading, false, or inaccurate caller ID information on the receiving party's telephone or circumvent a caller ID service that is designed to allow the receiving party to identify caller ID information regarding the origin and nature of the call or text message with the intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value. The bill provides, consistent with federal law or otherwise, several exceptions to the bill's prohibition on caller ID manipulation. Further, the bill provides that a person who knowingly manipulates a caller ID service is guilty of a disorderly persons offense. A disorderly persons offense is ordinarily punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months or a fine of up to $1,000, or both. certain caller identification service manipulation and provides additional penalty. ||In Committee | | |[A2023](/billdetail/1421051) |Requires electric, gas, and water public utilities to disseminate outage information to customers through autodialed telephone call, text message, and electronic mail alert service. || This bill requires an electric, gas, and water public utility (utility) to develop and implement a plan to disseminate information concerning service outages through an autodialed telephone call (robocall), text message, and electronic mail alert service, using the customer contact information on record with the utility. The robocall, text message, and electronic mail alert service is to be maintained by the utility and is to disseminate information such as the location and estimated length of the service outage, contact information for the utility and emergency services, information on how to report any other service problem related to the service outage, and any relevant updates as the situation to address the service outage progresses. The bill allows appropriate State, county, and municipal entities to disseminate information made available by the utilities through their own robocall, text message, and electronic mail alert services. ||In Committee | | |[A2798](/billdetail/1454646) |Excludes certain income earned from health promotion or disease prevention work from income eligibility determination under NJ FamilyCare, WFNJ, and NJ SNAP. || This bill prohibits the Department of Human Services from using any income earned in supporting a health promotion or disease prevention program as an hourly employee of a community-based organization, local health department, or other similar organization in determining an applicant's income eligibility, or re-determining a beneficiary's income eligibility, for the Medicaid program, the NJ FamilyCare program, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Under the bill, \"disease prevention program\" means a program that involves actions or efforts to reduce or eliminate exposure to risks that might increase the chances that an individual or a community will incur disease. \"Health promotion program\" means a program that engages and empowers individuals and communities to develop behaviors that improve and maintain an individual's health. It is the sponsor's goal that this legislation will prevent applicants and enrollees of Medicaid, NJ FamilyCare, and SNAP from jeopardizing their benefits when earning nominal income for certain public health work, such as promoting the administration of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) vaccination or other efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19. ||Crossed Over | | |[A2791](/billdetail/1454677) |Prohibits investment of pension and annuity funds by State in entities that avoid Superfund obligations to State. || This bill prohibits the investment of New Jersey public employee retirement funds in any business, country, country's instrumentality, or business affiliate that avoids its Superfund obligations to the State. The bill prohibits the investment of any pension or annuity fund asset under the jurisdiction of the Division of Investment in the Department of the Treasury in any business, country, country's instrumentality, or business affiliate, if that business has been identified as a responsible party by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, in accordance with the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) for a Superfund site in the State, and if that business, country or country's instrumentality filed for bankruptcy rendering it incapable of complying with its obligations with respect to a Superfund site in the State for which it has been identified as a responsible party. This prohibition applies if the bankruptcy filing is in direct anticipation of or in direct response to a finding of responsibility by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with CERCLA for a Superfund site in the State. The bill requires that divestment occur within three years of the bill's effective date or within three years of an initial identification of a business, country, or country's instrumentality that it is in violation of the bill. The bill requires the director to notify the business, country, or country's instrumentality that it is in violation of the bill, and to inform the business of the appeal process, prior to taking any action to divest prohibited investments. The bill requires the director to file a report with the Legislature of all investments held in violation of the bill within 180 days of the bill's effective date. Every year thereafter, the director is required to report on all investments divested in accordance with the bill. The bill requires the State to indemnify and hold harmless members and employees of the State Investment Council from all claims, liability, losses, and damages that council members, and State officers and employees, may sustain because of a decision to divest investments prohibited by the bill. ||In Committee | | |[A2799](/billdetail/1454705) |Requires DHS to take appropriate action to exempt veterans from benefits time limit applicable to able-bodied adults without dependents under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. || This bill would require the Commissioner of Human Services to take appropriate action to exempt veterans from the special work requirements and benefits limitations that apply to able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) under the State's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Federal law prohibits ABAWDs from obtaining SNAP food assistance benefits for more than three months in a three year period, unless such ABAWDs are actively employed, or are participating in a work or workfare program, or are exempted from these special ABAWD work requirements. A State may obtain a federal waiver of the three-month SNAP benefits time limit for a particular group of ABAWDs, if the United States Secretary of Agriculture determines that the area in which the individuals reside (either throughout the State, or in a particular area of the State) has an unemployment rate of over 10 percent, or does not have a sufficient number of jobs to provide employment for the individuals. Each state also has broad discretion to provide individual exemptions from the SNAP benefits time limit, as the state sees fit, provided that the number of exemptions does not exceed 15 percent of the total number of ABAWDs in the state who are ineligible for food assistance benefits as a result of the benefits time limit. During the economic downturn that resulted from the Great Recession, requests for statewide federal waivers of the ABAWD benefits time limit were consistently approved by the Secretary of Agriculture for many different states, including New Jersey. However, as a result of the recent economic upturn and nationwide recovery from the Great Recession, the federal Department of Agriculture has indicated that fewer states will now be eligible for waiver on a statewide basis. In New Jersey, the most recent Statewide waiver of the benefits time limit expired in 2016. Although New Jersey's Statewide economy and job market have generally improved in the years since the Great Recession began, and preliminary estimates indicate that the State's general unemployment rate, as of October 2016, has declined to 5.2 percent, the unemployment rate among the State's veteran population remains unusually high. In early 2016, the United States Department of Labor released a report, which found that veterans in New Jersey suffered from a nearly 11 percent unemployment rate in 2015 - a rate that is nearly double the national average of 5.8 percent unemployment for this group of people. Veterans also face a number of unique challenges in securing appropriate employment, and the limited availability and inconsistency of work and workfare programs throughout the State further imposes a hardship on this group of people. Because it would be wrong to deny these courageous service members a basic necessity like food, particularly when this group faces unique challenges in finding work, and continues to suffer from a high level of unemployment in New Jersey, it is both reasonable and necessary for able-bodied veterans without dependents to continue to be excepted from the SNAP benefits time limit that is otherwise applicable to ABAWDs under federal law. The bill would further require the commissioner, within 180 days after the bill's effective date, to: (1) assess all ABAWD veterans in the State to determine whether they are physically or mentally unfit for employment; and (2) refer these veterans for further services, as deemed to be appropriate, based on that assessment. As provided by federal law, if the commissioner determines that an ABAWD veteran is medically certified as being physically or mentally unfit for employment, such veteran will no longer be deemed to be an ABAWD, and will be automatically exempted from the three-month SNAP benefits time limit, as well as all other special work requirements applicable to ABAWDs. The bill further specifies, in accordance with federal law, that the State will not be required to use its 15 percent exemption authority when granting an exemption to such a veteran. ||In Committee | | |[A2797](/billdetail/1454706) |Revises requirements for sale of tobacco and vapor products; increases penalties for prohibited sales; increases fees for cigarette and vapor business licensure. || This bill increases the penalties that apply to any retailer that sells tobacco or vapor products to a person younger than 21 years of age. Current law provides that a person who violates the prohibition against underage sales is liable to a civil penalty of not less than $250 for a first offense, not less than $500 for a second offense, and $500 for a third or subsequent offense. In addition, a person's cigarette retail dealer license may be suspended following a first violation or revoked following a second or subsequent violation, based on the recommendation of the municipality and following a hearing, provided that the current law allows for the imposition of an administrative penalty in lieu of suspension or revocation. The bill will increase these penalties to $500 for a first offense, $1,000 for a second offense, and $2,000 for a third or subsequent offense, and clarify that all penalties are assessed against the retailer where the prohibited sale is made, and not against an employee who makes a prohibited sale. The bill further provides for mandatory three-year suspension of a retail dealer or vapor business license following a third and each subsequent violation, except that a license may be revoked following a fourth or subsequent violation, based on the recommendation of the municipality. A retailer subject to adverse licensure action will also be subject to administrative penalties. The bill removes language authorizing the assessment of an administrative penalty in lieu of license suspension or revocation. The bill does not revise the penalties that apply to sales of adult use cannabis items to persons under 21 years of age. Current law also provides that a person who sells a tobacco or vapor product to a person under 21 years of age is liable to the $500 fine applicable to petty disorderly persons offenses, which fine is doubled for a subsequent offense. The bill increases this fine by providing that a retailer that makes a prohibited underage sale is liable to the $1,000 fine applicable to disorderly persons offenses, which fine will still be doubled for a subsequent violation. Current law provides that a person who purchases tobacco products for someone younger than 21 years of age is guilty of a petty disorderly persons offense, which offense is punishable by imprisonment for up to 30 days, a fine of up to $500, or both. The bill provides that the offense also applies to the purchase of vapor products for someone younger than 21 years of age. The bill requires that, no later than 90 days after the effective date of the bill, all tobacco and vapor product retailers are to acquire and begin using an electronic age verification system to prevent sales of tobacco and vapor products to persons under age 21. The bill additionally requires that, unless the retailer restricts access to the retailer's establishment to persons age 21 years and older, all tobacco and vapor products are to be maintained in a manner that restricts public access to the products, which may include maintaining the products behind the sales counter, in a locked cabinet, or in an area of the establishment that is restricted to employees only. Current law requires all cigarette sales to take place in a face-to-face transaction unless the seller has ensured that all State taxes have been paid on the cigarettes and takes certain enumerated steps to verify that the purchaser is over 21 years of age. The bill establishes identical requirements for vapor products and adds a new requirement for mail order cigarettes and vapor products requiring age verification at the time of delivery. The bill revises the current requirement that vaping liquids be sold in child-resistant containers to additionally: (1) prohibit the sale of vaping liquids that contain nicotine in a concentration of more than two percent; (2) prohibit the sale of vaping liquids products that were mixed with any other substance by any entity other than the manufacturer; and (3) prohibit the sale of any vapor product that is not included in the database to be established pursuant to the bill. The current penalties for sale of a vaping liquid that is not in a child-resistant container are $250 for a first violation, $500 for a second violation, and $1,000 for a third or subsequent violation, in addition to possible license suspension or revocation. The bill makes these penalties applicable to any sale prohibited under the bill, and doubles the penalties to $500 for a first offense, $1,000 for a second offense, and $2,000 for a third or subsequent offense. In addition, a retailer will be subject to a mandatory three-year license suspension following a third and each subsequent violation, and a potential license revocation following a fourth or subsequent violation, if recommended by the municipality. Violators subject to adverse licensure action will also be subject to administrative penalties. The bill prohibits the sale of electronic smoking devices that are designed to mimic the appearance of another object, when the appearance of the electronic smoking device makes it difficult for the average person to determine, based on casual observance, whether the item is the object it is designed to mimic or an electronic smoking device. Prohibited designs will include, but not be limited to, devices designed to resemble a pen or other writing utensil, flash drive or universal serial bus drive, mobile phone, clothing, jewelry, cosmetic product, eating utensil, or personal hygiene product; however, it will not be prohibited to sell an electronic smoking device designed to resemble a product traditionally used for the consumption of tobacco, such as a cigarette, cigarette pack, pipe, cigar, or hookah. A violation of this prohibition will be punishable by a civil penalty of $1,000 for a first offense and $2,000 for a second or subsequent offense, plus a mandatory three-year license suspension following a third and each subsequent violation, and a possible license revocation following a fourth or subsequent violation, if recommended by the municipality. Violators subject to adverse licensure action will also be subject to administrative penalties. The bill clarifies that the various restrictions on the sale of tobacco and vapor products do not apply to any medical cannabis, paraphernalia, or related supplies dispensed to or on behalf of a registered medical cannabis patient by an alternative treatment center under the \"Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act,\" P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.). The bill requires the Commissioner of Health to establish standards for compliance inspections, including undercover compliance purchases, conducted by the Department of Health and by local boards of health, which may include annual reporting concerning the results of compliance inspections. Current law provides for a $50 licensure fee for tobacco retail dealers and vapor businesses. The bill increases these licensure fees to $500. The bill further authorizes municipalities to assess an additional permit fee against vapor businesses, provided that the full amount of any permit fees collected, less administrative costs, are to be used to fund compliance inspections, including undercover compliance purchases, made by the local health agency. The bill prohibits pharmacy practice sites, and business entities that have a pharmacy practice site located on the premises, from selling or offering for sale any tobacco product, including vapor products. A violation of this prohibition will be punishable by a civil penalty of $1,000 for a first offense and $2,000 for a second or subsequent offense. In addition, pharmacy practice sites will be subject to disciplinary action by the Board of Pharmacy, and business entities with a pharmacy practice site located on the premises will be subject to disciplinary action by any agency, board, or office having jurisdiction. The prohibition will not apply to smoking cessation products approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration, and will not restrict the dispensing of medical cannabis and related supplies if the pharmacy holds a medical cannabis dispensary permit. The bill requires the Director of the Division of Taxation to adopt, by regulation, requirements for the establishment of an electronic database that will be used to track all vapor products sold in New Jersey for the purpose of ensuring product integrity and compliance with State and federal law. Additionally, the director will be required to adopt requirements for the development of a standardized tracking feature to be included on all vapor products sold in the State that may be used to identify illicit, counterfeit, adulterated, or otherwise illegal or unsafe vapor products in the State. ||In Committee | | |[A2005](/billdetail/1422227) |Establishes database containing information on traffic stops by certain law enforcement officers. || This bill would require the Attorney General to establish a public, searchable database of information pertaining to traffic law enforcement by State and local law enforcement officers. The information entered in the database will include the driver's identifying characteristics, such as race or ethnicity, approximate age, and gender and will pertain to all interactions with traffic law enforcement, even those stops that result only in an oral warning. The wide range of specific information contained within this database will allow for increased public oversight of traffic law enforcement practices by providing a tool to prevent pernicious enforcement of these laws, including racial and gender profiling. ||In Committee | | |[A2024](/billdetail/1421086) |Requires certain public utilities to publicize information concerning bill payment assistance programs. || This bill requires every electric, gas, sewer, and water public utility (utility) to establish a public awareness campaign to inform its customers about the availability of bill payment assistance programs for service provided by that utility. The public awareness campaign is to include, at a minimum, a list of bill payment assistance programs that may be available to its customers, information concerning the general application process and who may qualify for assistance under each program, and information on the entity a potentially qualified customer can contact to receive further information on an assistance program. As part of the campaign, a utility is required to provide for the development of printed educational materials and public service announcements in both English and Spanish, and to disseminate information for distribution to its customers, through a variety of entities and mediums as provided in the bill. ||In Committee | | |[A3903](/billdetail/1482814) |Directs installation of hydrogen refueling stations at service areas on State's toll roads. || This bill directs the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the South Jersey Transportation Authority to equip service areas along the toll roads under their jurisdictions with hydrogen refueling stations that would fuel hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The authorities are directed to recover costs associated with the refueling stations from motorists who use the stations, in proportion to the motorists' use. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are electrically powered and they produce only water vapor as an emission. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles typically have a longer range than battery-powered electric vehicles and they can be refueled in approximately the same time and manner as a gasoline-powered vehicle. This bill would encourage New Jersey residents to purchase hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by ensuring that there are facilities available to refuel them. ||In Committee | | |[AR140](/billdetail/1483805) |Urges FDA to develop standardized front of package food labeling system. ||Urges FDA to develop standardized front of package food labeling system. ||In Committee | | |[A3967](/billdetail/1483813) |Establishes \"End 9-1-1 Fund Diversion Now Act\"; directs Treasurer to issue report concerning prevention of diversion of funds from \"9-1-1 System and Emergency Response Trust Fund Account\" to conform with federal law. || This bill requires the State Treasurer, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, to study and prepare a written report concerning the diversion of funds from the \"9-1-1 System and Emergency Response Trust Fund Account\" (fund). The report is to include but not be limited to: 1) an account of the annual revenue of the fund since the fund's establishment; 2) an account of the annual expenditures from the fund and whether these expenditures comply with permitted uses established pursuant to 47 U.S.C. s.615a-1; and 3) recommendations, including recommendations for legislation, to align State expenditures from the fund with the permitted uses established pursuant to federal law. Within 180 days of the bill's effective date, the Treasurer is to submit a detailed written report of the study's findings and recommendations to the Governor and to the Legislature. The federal government requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to annually submit a report to Congress entitled State Collection and Distribution of 911 and Enhanced 911 Fees and Charges (report). In the latest report, dated December 31, 2021, which compiled state information from between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the FCC found that New Jersey collected $127,370,000 in 9-1-1 funds and diverted $104,548,000, or 82.1 percent, to purposes other than those related to 9-1-1 services. The diversion of these funds may have negative consequences concerning the advancement of the State's public safety services and, as a result, will put New Jerseyans at risk of not receiving timely aid in a crisis. ||In Committee | | |[A4278](/billdetail/1488796) |Establishes NJ Task Force on Coordination Among Nonprofit Social Service Organizations. || This bill establishes the New Jersey Task Force on Coordination Among Nonprofit Social Service Organizations. The purpose of the task force is to develop recommendations, through collaboration among representatives of State government and social service organizations in the State, to support efforts to effectively coordinate and streamline services provided by social service organizations in the State by: promoting shared services to reduce administrative costs; forming alliances among social service organizations to eliminate duplication of services; and establishing procedures for the uniform reporting of expenditures by social service organizations to policy makers and the public.

Specifically, the bill will require the Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund to assist with the cost of medical cannabis for a child who is eligible for assistance from the program who is a registered qualifying patient under the State medical cannabis program, subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund Commission and the availability of monies in the fund. Under the PAAD and Senior Gold programs, at the time of each purchase of medical cannabis, the eligible person or the eligible person's caregiver will be required to pay a copayment that may not be waived, discounted, or rebated in whole or in part. The State will then reimburse the medical cannabis dispensary or clinical registrant for the balance of the purchase price of the medical cannabis, which purchase price will be the price listed on the medical cannabis dispensary's or clinical registrant's website as required pursuant to subsection h. of section 7 of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-7) less any applicable discounts or price reductions. Under the PAAD program, the copayment will be $7. Under the Senior Gold program, the copayment will be equal to: 1) $15 plus 50 percent of the remaining amount of the cost of the medical cannabis, or the cost of the medical cannabis, whichever is less; or 2) $15, or the cost of the medical cannabis, whichever is less, in the case of an eligible person who has incurred out-of-pocket expenditures, including copayments and deductibles, for the purchase of prescription drugs and medical cannabis, which are not reimbursable by any other plan of assistance or insurance and are credited to that person's account for each 12-month period of eligibility in accordance with procedures established by the Commissioner of Human Services, in the following amounts: $2,000 for a single person and $3,000 for a married couple. These out-of-pocket expense amounts will include only expenses incurred on or after the date that the person received proof of eligibility for the program. An eligible person whose medical cannabis costs are covered in part by any other program or plan of assistance or insurance may be required to receive reduced assistance under the PAAD and Senior Gold programs. Under the PAAD program, if an eligible person's medical cannabis costs are covered in whole by any other program or plan of assistance or insurance, the person will be ineligible for PAAD assistance; under the Senior Gold program, if an eligible person's medical cannabis costs are covered in whole or in part by another plan of assistance or insurance, the Senior Gold program will be the payer of last resort. The Commissioner of Human Services, in consultation with the Cannabis Regulatory Commission, may establish limits on the maximum quantity of medical cannabis that may be purchased by or on behalf of an eligible person in a 30-day period under the PAAD and Senior Gold programs, which limits may be in an amount lower than the maximum quantities of medical cannabis that may be dispensed to or on behalf of a registered qualifying patient pursuant to subsection f. of section 10 of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-10). The bill provides that eligible persons under the PAAD and Senior Gold programs may be reimbursed for 50 percent of the cost of medical cannabis purchased by or on behalf of that person in an amount that exceeds the required copayment, during the period commencing 30 days after the person's properly completed application was received by the department and ending on the date on which the person received proof of eligibility from the department; except that no reimbursement may be made for medical cannabis purchased prior to the effective date of the bill. This bill requires the Victims of Crime Compensation Office (VCCO) to include the costs associated with the medical use of cannabis as an expense for which a victim may receive compensation, an emergency award, or a supplemental award. Under current law, victims of certain crimes are eligible to receive compensation from the VCCO for certain expenses, including unreimbursed and unreimbursable expenses reasonably incurred for medical care or other services necessary as a result of the victim's injury. This bill provides that the expenses that are eligible for compensation from the VCCO will include the cost of medical cannabis dispensed to or on behalf of a victim who is a registered qualifying patient. Current law also provides that the VCCO may make an emergency award to an applicant pending final determination of a case when the office determines that compensation is likely to be provided and that the applicant will suffer undue hardship if funds are not made immediately available. Under current law, the funds are only permitted to be used to cover immediate costs of essential shelter, food, or medical expenses. The bill provides that medical expenses are to include the cost of medical cannabis dispensed to or on behalf of an applicant who is a registered qualifying patient. In addition, current law provides that certain crime victims who are catastrophically injured are eligible to receive an additional, supplemental award to be used for certain rehabilitative services, including prescription drugs and medical supplies. This bill provides that the cost of medical cannabis dispensed to or on behalf of a catastrophically-injured crime victim who is a registered qualifying patient will be included as a rehabilitative service for which the victim may receive a supplemental award. The bill specifies that the VCCO, in consultation with the Cannabis Regulatory Commission, may establish limits on the maximum quantity of medical cannabis that will be eligible for coverage, payment, or reimbursement from the VCCO under these various programs for an individual in a 30-day period. These limits may be in an amount lower than the maximum quantities of medical cannabis that may be dispensed to or on behalf of a registered qualifying patient pursuant to subsection f. of section 10 of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-10). ||In Committee | | |[A3904](/billdetail/1482703) |Provides corporation business tax credits and gross income tax credits for purchase of certain hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. || This bill provides corporation business tax credits and gross income tax credits for the purchase of certain hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The credits are available to both businesses and individuals. The credits are available for the taxpayer tax periods beginning in calendar years 2023, 2024 and 2025. For hydrogen fuel cell vehicles purchased in 2023 tax periods, a taxpayer will be allowed a credit in an amount of 25 percent of the cost, up to $15,000 per vehicle. For vehicles purchased and installed in 2024 tax periods, the credit is 15 percent of the cost, up to $9,000 per vehicle. For a vehicle purchased and installed in 2025 tax periods, the credit is eight percent of the cost, up to $5,000 per vehicle. To qualify for the bill's tax credits, the taxpayer must file an application for a certification with the Commissioner of Environmental Protection that the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle purchased by the taxpayer is a qualified hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are electrically powered and they produce only water vapor as an emission. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles typically have a longer range than battery-powered electric vehicles and they can be refueled in approximately the same time and manner as a gasoline-powered vehicle. This bill would encourage New Jersey businesses to purchase hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by defraying their purchase costs. ||In Committee | | |[A3854](/billdetail/1482730) |Requires menstrual products include ingredient list; requires toxic shock syndrome warnings be printed on tampon package. || This bill requires menstrual products to include an ingredient list and requires tampon packaging to contain printed warnings concerning the risk of toxic shock syndrome.

A violation of the bill's provisions would be an unlawful practice under the consumer fraud act, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.). An unlawful practice is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense. In addition, a violation can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured. ||In Committee | | |[A3911](/billdetail/1482772) |Requires post-secondary educational institutions to collect and report employment data for certain graduates. || This bill requires post-secondary educational institutions to collect and report certain employment data for recent graduates.

Under the bill, the Commissioner of Health (commissioner) is to appoint a State Emergency Medical Services Medical Director to the Office of Emergency Medical Services. The State Emergency Medical Services Medical Director is to be a licensed physician in this State and board certified in emergency medicine with leadership experience in the medical oversight of emergency medical services, specifically in advanced life support, basic life support, critical care transport, and emergency medical services dispatching. In selecting the State Emergency Medical Services Medical Director, the commissioner is to give preference to a candidate who is board certified in emergency medical services. The State Emergency Medical Services Medical Director is not to be permitted to be employed as an agency EMS medical director while serving as State Emergency Medical Services Medical Director. The State Emergency Medical Services Medical Director is to be coequal with the Director of Emergency Medical Services. The State Emergency Medical Services Medical Director is to have primary responsibility for the oversight, regulation, and discipline related to clinical issues pertaining to the provision of emergency medical services in New Jersey, and the Director of Emergency Medical Services is to have primary responsibility for the oversight of non-clinical issues related to the provision of emergency medical services in New Jersey. The State Emergency Medical Services Medical Director is to additionally be responsible for aiding the commissioner in promulgating rules and regulations establishing the scope of practice for providers of emergency medical services, including new standards for basic and advanced life support based on the National EMS Scope of Practice Model and the recommendations of the mobile intensive care advisory council. The bill provides that the mobile intensive care advisory council, which is established under current law, is to: (1) advise the Department of Health on all matters of advanced life support, (2) directly provide recommendations to the commissioner for clinical updates; (3) annually review advanced life support scope of practice; (4) be chaired by the State Emergency Medical Services Medical Director; (5) establish new by-laws; and (6) select a vice-chair from among its members. The bill makes various amendments and additions to statutory definitions within Section 1 of P.L.1984, c.146 (C.26:2K-7). The bill amends section 2 of P.L.1984, c.146 (C.26:2K-8) to provide that a mobile intensive care paramedic is to obtain licensure, as opposed to certification, as is provided under current law, from the commissioner to provide advanced life support. In addition, the amendments remove a provision regarding the commissioner's certification of a candidate who provides satisfactory evidence of the successful completion of an educational program approved by the commissioner for the training of mobile intensive care paramedics and who passes an examination in the provision of advance life support services. The amendments provide that the commissioner is to approve licensure for a candidate for a mobile intensive care paramedic who has equivalent military training or experience in any branch of the active duty or reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard of any state if the commissioner determines that the candidate's military training and experience exceed or are equivalent to the licensure standards established by the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians. The commissioner is to approve the licensure of a candidate for a mobile intensive care paramedic who is registered as a paramedic with the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians. The bill amends section 4 of P.L.1984, c.146 (C.26:2K-10) to remove a section that provides that a telemetered electrocardiogram is to be monitored when deemed appropriate by the licensed physician or when required by written rules and regulations established by the mobile intensive care hospital and approved by the commissioner. The amendments provide that a mobile intensive care paramedic may deliver advanced life support services, or any other services within the approved scope of practice for mobile intensive care paramedics, in a pre-hospital setting, in a mobile integrated health care setting, health care specialty setting, or any other hospital-controlled setting, through an approved mobile intensive care hospital, as determined by the commissioner and as authorized by the agency EMS medical director. A mobile intensive care paramedic is to be permitted to provide advanced life support services when operating outside of a mobile intensive care unit in situations directly related to EMS first response or mobile integrated health as authorized by the mobile intensive care paramedic's agency EMS medical director. A single mobile intensive care paramedic is not to be acknowledged as a mobile intensive care unit. The authorized services provided under a mobile integrated health program are to be determined by the agency EMS medical director overseeing the program, and may include, but need not be limited to: providing paramedicine care, chronic disease management, preventive care, and post-discharge follow-up visits; or providing referrals and transportation assistance to appropriate care and services to patients requiring health care services who do not require hospital-based treatment. The bill amends section 6 of P.L.1984, c.146 (C.26:2K-12) to provide that a mobile intensive care unit, when in service, is to be staffed by a minimum of two persons, which two persons may be two mobile intensive care paramedics, two registered professional nurses trained in advanced life support nursing, one mobile intensive care paramedic and one registered professional nurse trained in advanced life support nursing, or one emergency medical technician and one mobile intensive care paramedic or registered professional nurse trained in advanced life support nursing. Any individual providing advanced life support as provided in the bill is to be authorized to render care within that individual's scope of practice based on the agency EMS medical director's determination of competency. In the case of a mobile intensive care unit staffed by one emergency medical technician and one mobile intensive care paramedic or registered professional nurse trained in advanced life support nursing treating a patient in need of advanced life support services, the mobile intensive care paramedic or registered professional nurse trained in advanced life support nursing is to provide primary patient care. A mobile intensive care unit is not to be staffed by an emergency medical technician, as provided in the bill, unless approved by the agency EMS medical director, based on the EMS medical director's determination of the competency of the mobile intensive care paramedic or registered professional nurse trained in advanced life support nursing and the emergency medical technician to work together to provide mobile intensive care services. Agency EMS medical directors are to have the authority to establish advanced life support protocols, within the scope of practice for advanced life support providers established by the commissioner, which protocols are to include, but not be limited to, protocols concerning medications, equipment, procedures, and clinical practice. Aspects of clinical practice that exceed the scope established by commissioner are to be submitted by an agency EMS medical director to the mobile intensive care advisory council for review and recommendation to the commissioner. A hospital with a mobile intensive care unit may authorize a board-certified or board-eligible emergency medicine physician, advanced practice nurse, or physician assistant, who has successfully completed an in-house practical competency-based EMS orientation and training guided by respective relevant professional standards and approved by the agency EMS medical director, and is employed by the hospital to deliver care within the approved scope of practice of the board certified or board eligible emergency medicine physician, advanced practice nurse, or physician assistant in a prehospital setting or an interfacility setting, as determined by the agency EMS medical director. The bill amends section 8 of P.L.1984, c.146 (C.26:2K-14) to provide that no emergency medical technician, registered nurse, advanced practice nurse, physician assistant, or other employees of the hospital, first aid, emergency medical service or rescue squad, licensed emergency medical service agency, or officers and members of a first aid, emergency medical service or rescue squad are to be liable for any civil damages as the result of an act or the omission of an act committed while in training for or in the rendering of basic and advanced life support services in good faith. Finally, nothing in the bill is to be construed to alter the scope of practice of any licensed health care professional under Title 45 of the Revised Statutes or the scope or authority of any agency, board, department, or other entity in this State that is responsible for licensing health care workers. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A3249](/billdetail/1464165) |Expands school breakfast program to all schools with five percent or more of students eligible for free or reduced price meals. || This bill requires a public school operated by a local or regional school district of the State in which five percent or more of the students enrolled in the school on or before the last school day before October 16 of the preceding school year were eligible for free or reduced price meals under the federal School Lunch Program or the federal School Breakfast Program to establish a school breakfast program in the school. Under existing State statutes, a school with five percent or more of such eligible students must have a school lunch program; however a school is only required to have a school breakfast program if it has 20 percent or more of such eligible students. The new requirements established by the bill are modeled on the State's existing breakfast program planning and implementation requirements. Specifically, the bill would provide for a school breakfast program to be implemented, by September 1, 2023, in covered schools that provide instruction in Kindergarten through sixth grades, and by September 1, 2024, in covered schools that provide instruction in other grades. An initial program plan for each school is to be submitted to the Department of Agriculture for approval. If a school district fails to submit a plan by the date specified in the bill, the school district will be required to establish a school breakfast program, in each covered school, based on a model plan provided by the department. The bill would authorize a school district to seek and obtain, from the Department of Agriculture, a one-year waiver of the bill's requirements in certain cases. The bill would additionally provide for the State to annually appropriate necessary funds, to the Department of Agriculture, to finance the State's share of costs for the school breakfast programs being established under the bill. ||In Committee | | |[A3537](/billdetail/1469090) |Requires boards of education to ensure that all staff are trained in care of students with epilepsy and seizure disorders every two years. ||Requires boards of education to ensure that all staff are trained in care of students with epilepsy and seizure disorders every two years. ||In Committee | | |[AJR150](/billdetail/1470900) |Designates May of each year as \"Arthritis Awareness Month\" in New Jersey. ||Designates May of each year as \"Arthritis Awareness Month\" in New Jersey. ||In Committee | | |[AR147](/billdetail/1487156) |Urges Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to increase access to skilled nursing facility and home office data. ||Urges Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to increase access to skilled nursing facility and home office data. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A3805](/billdetail/1475185) |Requires DEP to study indoor air quality at public schools, develop list of common indoor air contaminants at public schools, and establish guidance regarding potential mitigation measures. || This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), within one year after the bill's effective date, and in cooperation and consultation with the Department of Education (DOE), the Rutgers Center for Green Building, and any other organization deemed by the DEP to be appropriate, to conduct a public school indoor air quality study using a representative sampling of public schools in the State. The representative sampling of schools would be required to include: (1) schools that represent diverse regions of the State and provide varying levels of education to students of all ages, including at least one preschool, one kindergarten, one elementary school, one middle school, and one high school located in each of the northern, central, and southern regions of the State; and (2) schools of varying ages, including, to the extent practicable, at least: one school constructed within the five year period immediately preceding the bill's effective date; one school constructed not less than five years, nor more than 10 years, prior to the bill's effective date; one school constructed not less than 10 years, nor more than 15 years, prior to the bill's effective date; one school constructed not less than 15 years, nor more than 25 years, prior to the bill's effective date; one school constructed not less than 25 years, nor more than 50 years, prior to the bill's effective date; and one school constructed more than 50 years prior to the bill's effective date. In conducting the public school indoor air quality study, the DEP would be required to: (1) identify, for each school in the representative sample, the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), hazardous air pollutants, and other indoor air contaminants that are present in the indoor air at each such school, and extrapolate, from the representative sampling, the total number of public schools in the State where each such indoor air contaminant is present and the estimated level of each such indoor air contaminant at each public school in the State; (2) compile a list of the most common indoor air contaminants in public schools; and (3) develop and publish guidance documents for public schools and school districts describing the ways in which such schools may take action to reduce the presence or mitigate the effects of indoor air contaminants identified on the DEP's list. In developing these guidance documents, the DEP would be required to consider and incorporate, as deemed appropriate, any existing guidance on this issue that has been published by the Department of Health or the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The bill would require the DEP to provide the DOE with a copy of the list and guidance documents developed under the bill, and it would further require both the DEP and DOE to post a copy of the list and the guidance documents in a publicly accessible location on the respective department's Internet website. ||In Committee | | |[AR135](/billdetail/1482679) |Urges schools to implement share tables in order to reduce food waste and help alleviate food insecurity. ||Urges schools to implement share tables in order to reduce food waste and help alleviate food insecurity. ||In Committee | | |[A4060](/billdetail/1485198) |Establishes scholarship program for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers studying unidentified aerial phenomenon and extraterrestrial technological signatures; requires Secretary of Higher Education to establish grant program; appropriates $250,000. || This bill establishes a scholarship program for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a grant program for four-year institutions of higher education, to further the study of unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) and extraterrestrial technology civilizations (ETCs). On June 25, 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a report titled \"Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon.\" In its report, ODNI stated that the limited amount of high-quality reporting on UAP hampers the ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature of UAP. However, the report also declared that, in a limited number of incidents, UAPs reportedly appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics and that UAPs \"clearly pose a safety of flight and may pose a challenge to United States national security.\" Specifically, the report stated that \"some UAP appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernable means of propulsion.\" According to the report, in addition to flight safety, UAPs could pose a broader danger if some instances represent the sophisticated collection against United States military activities by a foreign government \"or demonstrate a breakthrough aerospace technology by a potential adversary.\" Given the ODNI's report, it is clear that UAPs - and the search for signatures of ETCs - require rigorous, academic study. The bill directs HESAA to administer a scholarship program for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers studying or conducting research in the State in the fields of unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) and technological signatures of extraterrestrial civilizations. Under the bill, the goal of the program is to: \u00b7 support the education and career development of scholars who seek to advance the search for UAPs and extraterrestrial technological signatures; and \u00b7 transform the search of UAPs and signatures of extraterrestrial technological civilizations from a subject of ridicule and anecdotal evidence into a mainstream, transparent, and scientifically-verifiable field of research. Under the program, HESAA will award ten scholarships in the amount of $12,500 each to qualified recipients enrolled in or employed by an institution of higher education in the State. Under the bill, HESAA will appoint a three-member selection committee to review scholarship applications and make final determinations on scholarship awards. Under the bill, $125,000 will be appropriated to HESAA for the purposes of this act. The bill also requires the Secretary of Higher Education to develop a grant program for four-year institutions of higher education to establish a program for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers studying or conducting research in the State in the fields of UAP and ETCs. The purpose of the program is to provide grant funding to an institution to purchase the scientific equipment necessary, including but not limited to, calibrated instrumentation, sensors, cameras, telescopes, and computer hardware and software, to conduct transparent and scientifically-verifiable research in UAP and ETCs. Under the bill, an application is required to include information concerning the institution's proposed program, including its plan to: \u00b7 obtain high-resolution images of UAP using multiple detectors to discover their nature; \u00b7 conduct in-depth research on unexplained interstellar objects and phenomena; and \u00b7 search for potential ETC satellites. The secretary will select one four-year institution of higher education to participate in the program. Under the bill, $125,000 will be appropriated to the secretary for the purposes of this act. ||In Committee | | |[A4064](/billdetail/1485209) |Directs BPU to adopt rules and regulations concerning small modular nuclear reactors; authorizes EDA to incentivize construction and operation of such reactors. || This bill would direct the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to adopt rules and regulations concerning the construction and operation of small modular nuclear reactors in the State. The bill would also authorize the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) to incentivize the construction and operation of small modular nuclear reactors using moneys in the \"Global Warming Solutions Fund\" established pursuant to P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-45 et al.). As defined by the bill, \"small modular nuclear reactor\" means a nuclear fission reactor that: (1) has a rated electric generating capacity of not more than 300 megawatts; (2) is capable of being construction and operated either alone or in combination with one or more similar reactors if additional reactors are or become necessary at a single site; and (3) is required to be licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The bill would require the BPU, whenever it considers a petition by an electric power supplier or basic generation service provider for the construction, purchase, or lease of a small modular nuclear reactor, to consider: (1) whether, and to what extent, the small modular nuclear reactor proposed by the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider will replace a loss of generating capacity in the State, resulting from the retirement or planned retirement of one or more existing electric generating facilities, which are located in New Jersey and which use coal or natural gas a fuel source; and (2) whether the small modular nuclear reactor that will replace an existing facility will be located on the same site as, or near, the existing facility and, if so, potential opportunities for the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider to make use of any land and existing infrastructure or facilities already owned or under the control of the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider, or create new employment opportunities for workers who have been, or would be, displaced as a result of the retirement of the existing facility. The bill would also establish other requirements for the operation of small modular nuclear reactors, as enumerated in subsections c. through e. of section 3 of the bill, including a requirement that a person that owns or operates a small modular nuclear reactor in the State may not store spent nuclear fuel or high level radioactive waste from the small modular nuclear reactor on the site of the small modular nuclear reactor without first meeting all applicable requirements of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ||In Committee | | |[A4062](/billdetail/1485213) |Requires instruction on voting in curriculum of students in grade 12 as part of implementation of New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Social Studies. || This bill requires that each board of education of a school district, as applicable, incorporate instruction on voting in an appropriate place in the curriculum for students in grade 12 as part of the school district's implementation of the New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Social Studies. The instruction will provide students with information on: the importance of voting, including the role and responsibilities of citizens as voters; voter registration, including eligibility requirements, and information on the pre-registration and registration processes; and how to vote, including locating polling places or requesting an absentee ballot. School districts may collaborate with election officials to develop the instruction on voting. School districts may also collaborate with local boards of elections to assist in providing students with voter pre-registration or registration forms. ||In Committee | | |[A4091](/billdetail/1486034) |Makes County Option Hospital Fee Pilot Program permanent and expands definition of \"participating county\" under program. || This bill makes the County Option Hospital Fee Pilot Program permanent and expands the definition of \"participating county\" under the program. The County Option Hospital Fee Program was established in November 2018 to support local hospitals in designated high-need areas to ensure continued access to critical healthcare services for vulnerable populations. To effectuate this goal, the program authorizes participating counties, and hospitals within those counties, to partner with the State through a provider assessment mechanism that enhances financial support through the Medicaid program. Under existing law, the program is to be pilot program, expiring five years after each participating county has collected a local health care-related fee, or Fall of 2026. Under the bill, the program becomes permanent. The bill, while maintaining the existing statutory definition of \"participating county,\" also expands the definition of \"participating county\" to mean, based on the 2019 ACS 5 Year Survey Data, (1) excluding counties with a municipality with a population greater than 125,000, and (2) excluding counties with a population less than 150,000, and (3) excluding counties with a median income greater than $110,000, and (4) counties must have a municipality with a population greater than 30,000 whose 2020 Municipal Revitalization Index Distress score is greater than or equal to 35; and which chooses to participate in the program. Currently the following counties participate in the program: Atlantic, Camden, Essex, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, and Passaic. Existing law limits the program to seven counties, a provision that is removed under this bill. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A466](/billdetail/1422462) |Prohibits dumping dredge spoils on and around islands without municipal approval. || This bill would prohibit the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) from approving any dumping of dredge spoils on any portion of a Delaware River island owned or controlled by the State or a political subdivision of the State, including riparian land, located on a Delaware River island controlled in whole or in part by a Board of Island Managers established by the Legislature. This prohibition would not apply if: (1) the DEP petitions each municipality owning land on that island to authorize the dumping of dredge spoils on or around the island; and (2) each municipality petitioned by the DEP adopts an ordinance authorizing the dumping of dredge spoils on or around the island. The bill would be applicable to all dumping of dredge spoils, including any proposed dumping on an existing dredge spoil bank. ||In Committee | | |[A4116](/billdetail/1487047) |Prohibits modification of mufflers and exhaust systems to produce audible sounds; requires inspection of mufflers and exhaust systems. || This bill prohibits the installation or modification of the muffler or exhaust system of a motor vehicle in a manner which amplifies or increases the noise emitted by the muffler or exhaust system of the motor vehicle above that emitted by the muffler or exhaust system originally installed on the vehicle. The penalty for violating the provisions of the bill is a fine not exceeding $500, or imprisonment not exceeding 30 days, or both. The bill also requires motor vehicle inspections to include the inspection of mufflers and exhaust systems for excessive or unusual noise. Under current law, the penalty for the unauthorized installation of a device that causes the exhaust system to emit an audible sound and the failure to have a muffler in good working order to prevent excessive or usual sound is $25. Additionally, motor vehicle inspections are currently only required to include the inspection of emissions and emission-related items such as emission control equipment and on-board diagnostics. ||In Committee | | |[A4111](/billdetail/1487054) |Extends existing plug-in electric vehicle incentives to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. || State law at P.L.2019, c.362 (C.48:25-1 et seq.) currently authorizes the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to offer financial incentives to consumers in the State to encourage their purchase or lease of light duty plug-in electric vehicles. This bill would expand this existing incentive program in order to additionally authorize the BPU to make financial incentives available to consumers to encourage their purchase or lease of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The bill defines \"hydrogen fuel cell vehicle\" as a zero emission vehicle, as defined in section 11 of P.L.2003, c. 266 (C.54:32B-8.55), that is fueled primarily by hydrogen, but that may also have off-vehicle charge capability. The term would include any passenger car, station wagon, or other motor vehicle that is propelled by power derived from one or more cells that convert chemical energy directly into electricity by combining oxygen with hydrogen fuel. Under the bill's provisions, incentives offered for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are to be limited to a maximum amount of $5,000 per eligible vehicle and are to be calculated in a manner deemed appropriate by the board. Like the light duty plug-in electric vehicle incentives currently offered under the State's vehicle incentive program, the new hydrogen fuel cell vehicle incentives are to be made available under the program until June 30 of the tenth year following the original date of the program's establishment under P.L.2019, c.362. In addition to the new incentives established in the bill, receipts from the sale of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are also exempt under existing law, from the State Sales and Use Tax, pursuant to the current exemption for zero emission vehicles established by section 11 of P.L.2003, c.266 (C.54:32B-8.55). ||In Committee | | |[A5555](/billdetail/1445278) |Requires BPU to designate solar portion of critical renewable microgrid as solar energy project under Community Solar Energy Program; requires Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness to designate certain microgrids as assets of importance. ||This bill would require, no later than three months after the bill is enacted into law, the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to develop a program that would allow certain solar energy systems that are connected to a critical renewable microgrid to be designated as solar energy projects and eligible for incentives under the permanent Community Solar Energy Program, established pursuant to subsection f. of section 5 of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.11). A solar energy system that is approved for designation in the program would be eligible for SREC-IIs at the monetary value designated for low- or moderate-income customers and may have a rated capacity larger than five megawatts. As defined in the bill, \"microgrid\" means a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the electric grid, which can connect and disconnect from the electric grid to enable it to operate both connected to, or independent of, the electric grid. As also defined in the bill, \"critical renewable microgrid\" means a microgrid that utilizes renewable energy as its primary source of energy, to the largest extent technically and economically feasible, and that serves a critical function in protecting the State's economy, public health and safety, and transportation sector during power outages caused by natural or man-made disasters. In order for a solar energy system to receive this designation, and therefore be eligible for incentives under the permanent Community Solar Energy Program, the solar energy system would be required to: (1) demonstrate that the solar energy system will devote at least 75 percent of its energy output to low- or moderate-income customers, at a price that is at least 20 percent lower than the value of a community solar credit provided on a community solar program subscriber's utility bill; and (2) meet the eligibility requirements, as developed by the BPU. In developing the program pursuant to this bill, the BPU would be required to establish eligibility criteria for solar energy systems that are connected to a critical renewable microgrid and an application and approval process for such systems. The bill would also: (1) limit the total annual capacity of approved solar energy systems that are connected to a critical renewable microgrid to no more than 100 megawatts per year; (2) provide that solar energy systems' participation in the program would be for a term of 25 years; (3) require that approved solar energy systems that are projected to have a total rated capacity of greater than 15 megawatts are constructed in a manner to add a rated capacity of no more than 15 megawatts per year; (4) establish a process, in a form and manner determined by the BPU, for municipalities to partner with, support, and acquire customers for a solar energy system that is connected to a critical renewable microgrid, which may include the use of automatic enrollment of customers to participate in the solar energy system as long as the customers are notified of their enrollment and ability to opt-out; (5) provide that any incentives, including SREC-IIs, provided to a solar energy system that is approved for designation in the program and is designated as part of an asset of importance for homeland security pursuant to section 2 of this bill would not be subject to the Class I renewable energy requirement cost cap established by paragraph (2) of subsection d. of section 38 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-87); and (6) provide that any solar energy system that meets the eligibility requirements would be eligible to participate in the program, and that the owners or operators of the system may apply or reapply until accepted into the program. The solar capacity of solar energy systems that are connected to critical renewable microgrids and designated by the BPU as community solar projects would be in addition to the capacity of community solar projects approved by the BPU pursuant to the permanent Community Solar Energy Program. The bill would also require, no later than six months after the bill's effective date, the Director of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (director) to develop standards for designating a critical renewable microgrid as an asset of importance for homeland security. If a critical renewable microgrid is so designated by the director, the State incentives provided for the solar energy system connected to the critical renewable microgrid, pursuant to the bill, would not be subject to the Class I renewable energy requirement cost cap established by paragraph (2) of subsection d. of section 38 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-87). Microgrids can provide a multitude of benefits to the State, such as improving electric reliability, enhancing energy resilience, lowering energy costs, strengthening the central electric grid, bolstering cybersecurity, and improving overall community well-being. Hurricane Sandy caused tens of billions of dollars of damage to New Jersey, and caused the curtailment or loss or of vital infrastructure protecting the economy, the environment, public health, public safety, and transportation. Several other unusual weather events have caused widespread and long-lasting power outages in the State during recent years. The frequency and intensity of such events is expected to increase as a result of global warming. In response, many state and local governmental entities and quasi-governmental entities plan to develop microgrids to provide resilient power to facilities providing critical public functions. Microgrids can play a vital role in protecting the State's economy, environment, public health, public safety, and transportation during future widespread power outages. The planning and development of renewable microgrids is essential in providing resilient power throughout the State and in combating the adverse effects of climate change. For these reasons, solar energy systems that are connected to critical renewable microgrids should be eligible for incentives under the Community Solar Energy Program. ||In Committee | | |[A2246](/billdetail/1447791) |Establishes New Jersey Homebuyer Tax Credit Program under gross income tax for certain home purchases during qualified periods by first-time homebuyers. || This bill establishes the New Jersey Homebuyer Tax Credit Program under the gross income tax. To qualify for the credit, a taxpayer is required to: (1) be a first-time homebuyer; and (2) enter into a contract of sale on a qualified home purchase within certain prescribed dates. For qualifying new home purchases, a taxpayer has 18 months from the contract of sale in which to complete the purchase. For qualifying previously occupied homes, a taxpayer has 12 months from the contract of sale in which to complete the purchase. The taxpayer is also required to occupy the property as her or his principal residence for at least three consecutive years after the date of the purchase. The tax credit provided by the bill is refundable and is allowed for up to $15,000 or five percent of the purchase price, whichever is less. The total credits available are capped at $100 million, with up to $25 million allocated for qualified home purchases made between the effective date of the bill and up to one year thereafter; and up to $25 million allocated for qualified home purchases made after one year, but before two years, after the effective date of the bill. If the tax credit program is renewed, up to $25 million is available for qualified home purchases made up to one year after the renewal date; and up to $25 million is available for qualified purchases made between one year, but before two years, after the date the program is renewed. For each year the program is in effect, up to $18.75 million is allocated for purchases of newly constructed homes not previously occupied, and up to $6.25 million is allocated for purchases of previously occupied homes. The credit is only available to taxpayers who are New Jersey residents, are natural persons, and have not previously owned qualified residential property. Moreover, the New Jersey reported gross income of the taxpayer, combined with the New Jersey reported gross income of other individuals expected to be permanent residents of the property (domiciled for more than 180 days of the year), cannot exceed: (1) $118,000 for households with up to two persons; and (2) $135,000 for households with three or more persons. The value of the qualified residential property likewise cannot exceed $560,000. The credit is provided on a first-come, first-serve basis, and the claiming of the credit for personal income tax filing purposes will be divided into three equal credit amounts claimed over three taxable years. The terms of the credit require that the home continue to be occupied as the taxpayer's principal residence for three years. If the taxpayer fails to use the home as his or her principal residence for at least 36 months next following the date of the qualified home purchase, then the taxpayer must pay back the full amount of the credit received. Likewise, if the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury determines that a taxpayer has used a strawman to make more than one qualified home purchase, in order to \"flip houses\" and claim multiple credits pursuant to the bill, then the taxpayer is required to pay back the full amount of all credits received; this prohibition is not intended to preclude the use of a real estate agent or broker in facilitating a qualified home purchase. In the event the taxpayer dies during the 36 months the qualified residential property is required to be used as the taxpayer's principal residence, then any heirs to whom the property has been bequeathed are required to: (1) meet the definition of \"first-time homebuyer taxpayer\"; and (2) use the property as that heir's or heirs' principal residence for the balance of the 36 months; otherwise, the credit is disallowed for all tax years beginning after the death of the original purchaser/taxpayer. After the end of the second year in which this program is operational, the Office of Revenue and Economic Analysis in the Department of the Treasury is required to prepare and submit a report to the Governor and Legislature to study the efficacy of the tax credit program. This report, at a minimum, is required to include: (1) the impact of the tax credit program on State revenue; (2) the extent to which home purchases by first time homebuyers (including purchases of new qualified residential property) increased during the period the tax credits were available; (3) whether the data suggests that a two year extension of the tax credit program may have a material, positive impact on the State's construction, real estate, and any other sectors of the State economy; and (4) whether the fiscal condition and outlook of the State has materially changed in way that materially affect the purpose underlying the program to promote home ownership and strengthen key sectors of the State's economy. Upon receipt of this report, the Legislature may adopt, and the Governor may sign, a joint resolution that extends the program for two additional years. The effective date of this bill is the first day of the sixth month next following the date of enactment. The bill is intended to create a substantial and immediate incentive for potential homebuyers. Recognizing that much direct and indirect economic activity is generated through new home construction and home resales, this incentive is expected not only to strengthen homebuilding industry in this State, but also to stimulate economic growth through indirect related spending, including boosting State and local government revenue collections generated by this activity. ||In Committee | | |[A3668](/billdetail/1471700) |Makes FY 2022 supplemental appropriation to provide State military impact aid to certain school districts. || This bill provides a supplemental appropriation from the Property Tax Relief Fund in the amount of $1,529,089 to provide State aid to certain military-impacted districts. This amount is added to the fiscal year (FY) 2022 appropriation for Stabilization Aid in the Department of Education. The FY 2022 appropriations act includes $50 million for Stabilization Aid. Budgetary footnote language stipulates that, of the amount appropriated for Stabilization Aid, such amounts as are necessary will be allocated to provide State aid to military-impacted school districts. The footnote language stipulating the eligibility criteria for, and the calculation of, the State military impact aid were codified in State law as P.L.2021, c.283. Under the footnote language and P.L.2021, c.283, a school district is eligible for military impact aid if it received a Basic Support Payment of federal Impact Aid in the prior fiscal year and the district provides free public education to federally connected children whose parents are on active duty in the uniformed services. To determine the amount of aid a district would receive, a per pupil general fund tax levy amount would be calculated by dividing the prior fiscal year general fund tax levy by resident enrollment, without the inclusion of federally connected children whose parents are on active duty in the uniformed services. A per pupil federal impact aid amount would also be calculated by dividing the amount of a school district's federal Basic Support Payment received in the prior fiscal year by the number of federally connected children whose parents are on active duty in the uniformed services. The difference between these two per pupil amounts would then be multiplied by the number of federally connected children whose parents are on active duty in the uniformed services. If the difference is calculated as negative, then a school district would not receive military impact aid. This supplemental appropriation would be provided to ensure that the Rockaway Township School District and the Tinton Falls School District, both of which have not yet received military impact aid in FY 2022, are allocated military impact aid in the amounts of $776,515 and $752,574, respectively. ||In Committee | | |[A3672](/billdetail/1473004) |Provides that sterile syringe access programs are inherently beneficial uses. || This bill would revise the definition of \"inherently beneficial use in the \"Municipal Land Use Law,\" P.L.1975, (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) (MLUL) include a sterile syringe access program. Under the MLUL, if a use is deemed inherently beneficial it presumptively satisfies the positive criteria for the grant of a use variance under subsection d. of section 57 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55-70). Sterile syringe access programs are designed to prevent the spread of HIV, hepatitis C, and other blood borne pathogens, and have been proven effective in reducing the spread of these pathogens without adverse social impacts or an increase in drug abuse. Additionally, the programs provide drug users with a bridge to treatment and other social services. This bill would make it easier for the programs to be established, providing more individuals with access to the program benefits. ||In Committee | | |[A3678](/billdetail/1473077) |Requires DHS to conduct annual Medicaid eligibility redeterminations. || This bill requires the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in the Department of Human Services or a county welfare agency to conduct eligibility redeterminations for Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare beneficiaries no less than every 365 days. The bill additionally requires that the Commissioner of Human Services is to determine the means and method by which the annual eligibility redetermination is to be conducted. Currently, New Jersey statute does not specify the frequency with which Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare eligibility redeterminations are to occur. The bill further requires the commissioner, to the extent permitted under federal law and regulation, to provide for 12 months of continuous Medicaid eligibility, without imposing reporting requirements for changes of income or resources, for adult beneficiary groups, regardless of the delivery system through which the beneficiary receives benefits. The State has temporarily paused Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare eligibility redeterminations pursuant to the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (Pub.L.116-127). This law requires that the State, as a condition for receipt of an enhanced federal matching percentage under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, continue Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare coverage for all individuals enrolled on or after March 18, 2020, until the last day of the month in which the federal public health emergency period ends, regardless of any changes in the individual's circumstances that would otherwise result in termination from the program. On January 14, 2022, the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services extended the federal public health emergency for an additional 90 days. It is the intent of the bill's sponsor to reduce the frequency of coverage disruptions and coverage loss among Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare beneficiaries, a process known as \"churn,\" by limiting the frequency with which Medicaid eligibility redeterminations are conducted. Research shows that reductions in churn among Medicaid beneficiaries lowers states' administrative costs and may be associated with a reduction in beneficiary medical costs. ||In Committee | | |[AR90](/billdetail/1454284) |Urges FDA to make naloxone available over the counter. ||Urges FDA to make naloxone available over the counter. ||In Committee | | |[A3906](/billdetail/1482606) |Prohibits sale and use of gas-powered lawn equipment in NJ; provides CBT and gross income tax credits for purchase of certain zero-emission lawn equipment. || This bill would prohibit, beginning three years after the bill's effective date, the sale or distribution of gas-powered lawn equipment within the State for use or operation in New Jersey. The bill would also prohibit, beginning five years after the bill's effective date, the use of gas-powered lawn equipment within the State. The bill would authorize the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to extend the timeframe of the prohibitions established by the bill if it finds that prohibiting the sale or use of the equipment is not cost-effective or technologically feasible. As defined in the bill, \"lawn equipment\" means any mechanically powered equipment or device that is used for, or intended to be used for, the mowing of grass, the cutting or chipping of trees, tree roots, or tree branches, or the clearing of leaves or other vegetation from lawns, sidewalks, public streets or public highways. Under the bill, \"lawn equipment\" would include, but not be limited to, lawn mowers and lawn mower attachments, lawn edgers, leaf mulchers, chippers, pruners, trimmers, chainsaws, power washers, and snow blowers. As defined in the bill, \"gas-powered lawn equipment\" means lawn equipment that has a two-stroke or four-stroke engine and uses gasoline or a gasoline and oil blend as fuel and \"zero-emission lawn equipment\" means lawn equipment that is powered by a battery, fuel cell, or other means of energy production that does not result in the emission of carbon dioxide. Any person who violates the bill's provisions would be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 for each offense. In the case of a continuing violation, each day during which the violation continues would constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense. The bill authorizes State and local law enforcement agencies to have the exclusive authority of enforcing the bill's provisions. The bill also incentivizes the enforcement of the bill's provisions by permitting any penalty recovered to be retained by the enforcing government entity. The bill would allow the DEP to extend the timeframe of any prohibitions provided for in the bill for additional periods not to exceed one year upon a finding, adopted by rule or regulation, that it is not cost-effective or technologically feasible to prohibit the sale or use of gas-powered lawn equipment within the timeframe required pursuant to the bill's provisions. An extension would expire after one year unless the DEP determines another extension is necessary. The bill would require the DEP to adopt, no later than three years after the bill's effective date, rules and regulations, consistent with federal law, as necessary to implement the bill's provisions. The bill would require the DEP to consider the following when determining cost-effectiveness or technological feasibility: (1) total emissions from gas-powered lawn equipment within the State; (2) expected timelines for zero-emission lawn equipment development; (3) increased electricity demand from added charging requirements from zero-emission lawn equipment; (4) demand and usage of lawn equipment by both commercial and residential lawn and garden users; and (5) expected availability and affordability of zero-emission lawn equipment. The bill would also provide a tax credit under the corporation business tax and the gross income tax for certain costs incurred in the purchase of zero-emission lawn equipment. The tax credit would be made available for a period of five years. Specifically, the amount of credit allowed to a taxpayer pursuant to the bill would be as follows: (1) for the purchase of an electric-powered trimmer, pruner, leaf blower, or power washer, 25 percent of the cost of the zero-emission lawn equipment device or $50, whichever is less; (2) for the purchase of an electric-powered chainsaw, 25 percent of the cost of the zero-emission lawn equipment device or $100, whichever is less; and (3) for the purchase of an electric-powered walk behind lawn mower or snow blower, 25 percent of the cost of the zero-emission lawn equipment device or $150, whichever is less. To qualify for a credit under the bill, a taxpayer would be required to apply to the DEP for a certification that provides: (1) that the lawn equipment device purchased by the taxpayer is a zero-emission lawn equipment device and is eligible for the tax credit; and (2) the amount of the tax credit. The bill would require the DEP, in consultation with the Director of the Division of Taxation, to adopt rules and regulations as are necessary to implement the bill's provisions. The bill would also limit the cumulative total of tax credits awarded pursuant to the bill to $500,000. Finally, the bill would require, no later than four years after the effective of the tax credits provided pursuant to the bill, the DEP to prepare and submit to the Governor, the State Treasurer, and the Legislature a report that, at a minimum, summarizes the effectiveness of the tax credit in incentivizing the purchase of zero-emission lawn equipment and provides recommendations for whether or not the tax credit should be extended. Gas-powered lawn equipment emits high levels of air pollutants, including but not limited to, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons, unburnt gasoline, and fine particulate matter. The emissions from certain gas-powered lawn equipment contribute to the formation of ozone, smog, and acid rain and can even exceed the emissions from vehicles used for the same time amount of time. In addition to environmental consequences, gas-powered lawn equipment is also associated with certain adverse health effects including heart and lung disease. Certain gas-powered lawn equipment, including leaf blowers, are also associated with occupational health concerns. For example, gas-powered leaf blowers generate noise at a decibel level capable of causing hearing loss in a short amount of time. There are affordable alternatives to certain gas-powered lawn equipment that are less polluting and safer to operate. Technology is also advancing to develop zero-emission equivalents to all gas-powered lawn equipment. The bill's phase-in of its provisions would also provide time for zero-emission lawn equipment technology to improve prior to the bill's prohibitions on the sale and use of gas-powered lawn equipment taking effect. ||In Committee | | |[A2796](/billdetail/1454345) |Requires hospitals to provide certain resources to certain patients and to ask patients if patients have completed advance directive or practitioner orders for life-sustaining treatment form. || This bill requires hospitals to make an affirmative inquiry of patients as to whether a patient has completed an advance directive or a practitioner orders for life-sustaining treatment (POLST) form. Under current law, \"advance directive\" means a writing executed in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1991, c.201. An \"advance directive\" may include a proxy directive or an instruction directive, or both. A POLST form complements an advance directive by converting a person's wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment into a medical order. Under the bill, upon the discharge of a patient from a hospital, each hospital is to make an affirmative inquiry of the patient to determine if the patient has completed an advance directive or a POLST form if there is not a current advance directive or POLST form in the patient's medical records. A hospital is to offer to provide the patient a paper copy of a POLST form and a link to advance directive and POLST form resources available through the Department of Health's Internet website if there is not an advance directive or POLST form in the patient's medical records or if the patient indicates that the patient's advance directive or POLST form is not current. ||In Committee | | |[A3905](/billdetail/1482702) |Expands eligibility for veterans' civil service preference; creates additional preference benefits. || This bill would expand eligibility for veterans' hiring preference in the civil service so that individuals who are eligible for veterans' preference in the federal civil service, but are not eligible for preference in the State civil service, would receive additional points above the individual's earned score on State civil service examinations. To receive the additional points, an individual must meet the eligibility requirements in section 2108 of Title 5, United States Code, as may be amended and supplemented. This means that an honorable or general discharge is necessary. National Guard and Reserve active duty for training purposes would not qualify. Under the bill, five points would be added to the passing examination score of an individual who is not eligible for State veterans' hiring preference, but served: -During the period December 7, 1941, to July 1, 1955; or -For more than 180 consecutive days, any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976; or -During the Gulf War from August 2, 1990 through January 2, 1992; or -In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized, including El Salvador, Grenada, Haiti, Lebanon, Panama, Somalia, Southwest Asia, Bosnia, and the Global War on Terrorism. Ten points would be added to the passing examination score of an individual who is not eligible for State disabled veterans' hiring preference, but who served at any time and (1) has a present service-connected disability or (2) is receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or a pension from the federal military or the Department of Veterans Affairs. The application of this new benefit to disabled veterans who did not serve in a time of war would apply only if an amendment to the State constitution is approved by the voters to permit such disabled veterans to receive the benefit. ||In Committee | | |[A2802](/billdetail/1454435) |Requires all personal audio players distributed in New Jersey to contain warning about volume and hearing loss. || This bill is in response to the harmful volume levels at which users of portable audio players (e.g., MP3 players or iPods) are able to listen. Many of these portable audio players can be listened to at volumes of up to 130 decibels. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States Department of Labor has stated that significant hearing loss can occur in 15 minutes at a volume of 115 decibels. This bill prohibits a manufacturer from distributing a personal audio player in this State unless the manufacturer affixes a warning label on the personal audio player that reads as follows: \"WARNING: This product may cause hearing damage. A volume level of 115 decibels may cause permanent hearing damage after 15 minutes of exposure.\" The bill defines a \"personal audio player\" as a personal, electronic device that allows the user to listen to audio while mobile. The bill further provides that any person who violates the provisions of the bill is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each offense. ||In Committee | | |[A2789](/billdetail/1454495) |Requires hospital, bio-analytical, and clinical laboratories to provide information and offer of HIV screening to patients living in areas with high prevalence of HIV. || This bill requires hospital, bio-analytical, and clinical laboratories, pursuant to a standing order issued by the chief medical officer of the laboratory, to provide individuals who reside in an area with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with a verbal and written statement of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) policy regarding HIV, and offer to provide an HIV screening test to that individual. If the individual consents to undergo an HIV screening test, the laboratory is to perform the test and transmit the test results to the health care provider rendering the referral for laboratory services. In the case of a hospital laboratory, the standing order will be required to designate a process for an appropriate member of the hospital staff to contact an individual who tests positive for HIV, so as to advise the individual of the test results, provide the individual with information concerning counseling services, resources, and programs, and to encourage the individual to seek appropriate follow-up care. Diagnosed cases of HIV are to be reported to, and held confidential by, the Department of Health (DOH) in accordance with current law as set forth at P.L.1989, c.303 (C.26:5C-5 et seq.). Nothing in the bill will affect the scope of practice of any health care professional or diminish any authority or legal or professional obligation of any health care professional to offer an HIV screening test, or to provide services or health care for an individual who receives an HIV screening test. A hospital, bio-analytical, or clinical laboratory will not be required to provide an individual with a statement of CDC policy regarding HIV screening and offer to provide an HIV screening test to the individual pursuant to the bill if, upon a review of the laboratory's records, it is determined the individual was tested for HIV within the past four months. In the event that a laboratory that performs an HIV screening test under the bill is out-of-network with respect to a covered person's health benefits plan, the carrier is to reimburse the laboratory for the cost of the screening test at the carrier's in-network rate, or in any other reasonable amount as agreed upon by the laboratory and the carrier, less any applicable copayment, coinsurance, or deductible. In no case may a laboratory bill a covered person for the screening test, except for the covered person's applicable copayment, coinsurance, or deductible. The Commissioner of Health will be required to review HIV incidence rates throughout the State and generate a list of locations in the State with a high prevalence of HIV infection. The list is to be updated quarterly or at such other intervals as the commissioner deems appropriate, and will be made available through the DOH Internet website for laboratories to use for the purpose of determining whether to provide an individual with a statement of CDC policy regarding HIV screening and offer to provide an HIV screening test pursuant to the bill. The commissioner will be required to evaluate the impact of the bill with respect to the number of individuals who are screened for HIV and the number of individuals who have accessed health care, counseling, or other resources, programs, or services following a positive test. No later than one year after the effective date of the bill, the commissioner will be required to submit a report of the evaluation to the Governor and to the Legislature. ||In Committee | | |[A2800](/billdetail/1454586) |Requires pharmacies to sell hypodermic syringes and needles to any customer over the age of 18 and post sign concerning consumer right to purchase clean syringes and needles. || This bill requires pharmacies to sell hypodermic needles and syringes to any customer over the age of 18. Under current law, needles and syringes may be sold in quantities of up to 10 without a prescription, and in quantities of more than 10 only with a valid prescription. Current law provides that over-the-counter sales of needles and syringes is allowed, but not required. This bill will make such sales mandatory, and will additionally require pharmacies to post a sign at the pharmacy sales counter advising consumers of the right to purchase needles and syringes pursuant to the bill. The ability to purchase up to 10 hypodermic syringes or needles without a prescription first took effect in 2011, with the enactment of P.L.2011, c.183 (C.2C:36-6.2 et seq.). The 2011 law was designed both to facilitate access to individuals who use syringes or needles to administer medication, such as diabetic insulin users, as well as to help make clean syringes and needles available to intravenous drug users, thereby helping prevent the spread of bloodborne diseases such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Under the 2011 law, pharmacies selling needles and syringes are required to make information concerning the safe disposal of used syringes and needles and information concerning substance abuse treatment available to all purchasers. It is the sponsor's belief that requiring pharmacies to sell hypodermic syringes and needles to any consumer over the age of 18 and to a post a sign notifying consumers of their rights with regard to purchasing clean hypodermic syringes and needles will help promote the public health interests that the original 2011 law sought to advance. ||In Committee | | |[A2801](/billdetail/1454754) |Requires 60 day notice concerning tuition rate changes by licensed child care centers. || This bill requires child care centers licensed pursuant to P.L.1983, c.492 (C.30:5B-1 et seq.) to prepare and make available a notice of any change in the tuition rate charged by the center, 60 days prior to the change, to every parent or legal guardian of a child attending the center. The notice would be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested or by receipted first class mail addressed to the parent or legal guardian at the last known address identified in the center's records, or delivered in person to the parent or legal guardian by a staff member of the center. The center would also be required to post the notice on its internet website or by other electronic means, and to display the notice in a prominent location within the center. The notice requirements will apply to rate changes occurring on or after the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment. ||In Committee | | |[A2788](/billdetail/1454765) |Requires hospitals and health care professionals to offer hepatitis C testing to certain individuals; authorizes certain laboratories to perform rapid hepatitis C testing. || This bill establishes requirements for individuals born between 1945 and 1965 to be offered testing for hepatitis C. Specifically, when providing health care services to an individual born between 1945 and 1965, a hospital or a health care professional will be required to offer a hepatitis C screening test to the individual, and a nursing home or other long-term care facility will be required to offer to arrange for the provision of a hepatitis C screening test to the individual. The requirement to offer testing or offer to arrange for testing will not apply if the health care professional who has primary responsibility for the treatment and care of the individual reasonably believes that the individual: 1) is being treated for a life threatening emergency; 2) has previously been offered or has been the subject of a hepatitis C screening test; or 3) lacks capacity to consent to a hepatitis C screening test. Offers of a hepatitis C screening test or to arrange for a test under the bill are to be culturally and linguistically appropriate, consistent with regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Health. If an individual accepts a hepatitis C testing offer under the bill, and the results of the hepatitis C screening test are positive, the person or entity performing the test will be required to provide appropriate follow-up care, including a confirmation test, or refer the patient to a health care professional to provide follow-up care. The bill further specifies that the general informed consent to medical care, which has been provided by a person who is offered a hepatitis C diagnostic or screening test, will constitute sufficient consent for the test, and no additional or separate consents, or any related documentation, will be required. The Commissioner of Health will be required to adopt regulations to implement the provisions of the bill, including developing regulations, in consultation with the Public Health Council in the Department of Health, to permit any laboratory site, which has a current Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments Certificate of Waiver from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to perform rapid point-of-care hepatitis C tests licensed by the federal Food and Drug Administration. The bill requires the Commissioner of Health to annually evaluate the impact of the bill with respect to the number of individuals who are screened for hepatitis C and the number of individuals who have accessed care following a positive test, and to submit an annual report of the evaluation to the Governor and the Legislature, commencing one year after the effective date of the bill and continuing each year that the bill is in effect. The bill will take effect on the first of January next following the date of enactment, and will expire on January 1 of the fifth year next following the date of enactment. ||In Committee | | |[A2012](/billdetail/1422258) |Requires school districts to provide instruction on dangers of electronic cigarette usage as part of New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education. || This bill would require each school district to incorporate instruction on the dangers of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) usage into the health education curriculum for students in grades six through 12 as part of the district's implementation of the New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education. The instruction would provide students with information on, at a minimum: the amount of nicotine that can be found in e-cigarettes manufactured by different companies; how the use of e-cigarettes during adolescence can lead to addiction; the physical health effects of inhaling certain chemicals that can be found in e-cigarette products; and the provisions of the \"New Jersey Smoke-Free Air Act.\" The use of e-cigarettes among middle school and high school students has become a major public health concern as the use of such devices has increased greatly over recent years. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Youth Tobacco Survey indicates that, in 2011, just 1.5 percent of high school students in the United States used e-cigarettes; in 2017, that number increased to 11.7 percent. Similarly, in 2011, just 0.6 percent of middle school students in the United States used e-cigarettes; in 2017, that number went up to 3.3 percent. While the use of e-cigarettes has become a popular trend among young people across the country, research indicates that using e-cigarettes during youth can have negative health effects. For one, most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is the addictive drug found in regular cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products. Reports have shown that nicotine levels in e-cigarettes are highly variable, with some reaching levels near regular cigarettes. A 2016 United States Surgeon General report asserted that using nicotine in adolescence can harm the developing brain and may increase the risk for future addiction to regular cigarettes, other tobacco products, and drugs. In addition, e-cigarettes can contain several other substances, including cannabidiol, tetrahydrocannabinol, diacetyl, and formaldehyde, which may be harmful to young users. Lastly, what many students using e-cigarettes on school grounds might not be aware of is that, pursuant to the \"New Jersey Smoke-Free Air Act,\" the use of e-cigarettes on school property is prohibited. ||In Committee | | |[A3978](/billdetail/1483892) |Authorizes home care for individuals who are disabled or elderly and requires health insurance coverage therefor. || This bill authorizes home care for individuals who are disabled or elderly and requires health insurance coverage therefor. Under the bill, a health care professional is to be permitted to provide care or treatment to an individual who is disabled or elderly in the home of the individual if the individual is unable to present for an in-person visit in a health care facility, as documented by a health care professional in the medical record of the individual based upon the good faith clinical judgment of the health care professional, and if the health care professional is able to provide adequate medical care or treatment in the home of the individual who is disabled or elderly in a manner that is consistent with the clinical standards for treatment in the applicable specialty. Further, the bill requires health insurance carriers, including insurance companies, health service corporations, hospital service corporations, medical service corporations, health maintenance organizations authorized to issue health benefits plans in New Jersey, and any entity contracted to administer health benefits in connection with the State Health Benefits Program or School Employees' Health Benefits Program, to cover home care. The bill defines \"home care\" to mean preventative, primary, specialty, or urgent care or treatment provided by a health care professional to an individual who is disabled or elderly in the home of the individual if the individual is unable to present for an in-person visit in a health care facility, as reasonably documented by a health care professional in the medical record of the individual based upon the good faith clinical judgment of the health care professional, and if the health care professional is able to provide adequate medical care or treatment in the home of the individual in a manner that is consistent with the clinical standards for treatment in the applicable specialty. \"Home care\" excludes custodial care. ||In Committee | | | | |[A3250](/billdetail/1464177) |Requires DHS to employ Transportation Planning Coordinator to oversee provision of transportation services. ||Requires DHS to employ Transportation Planning Coordinator to oversee provision of transportation services. ||Crossed Over | | |[AJR135](/billdetail/1464379) |Designates March as \"Triple Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\" ||Designates March as \"Triple Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\" ||In Committee | | |[ACR123](/billdetail/1464432) |Condemns all forms of anti-Semitism and rejects attempts to justify anti-Jewish hatred. ||Condemns all forms of anti-Semitism and rejects attempts to justify anti-Jewish hatred. ||In Committee | | |[AR106](/billdetail/1464491) |Calls upon federal government to permit use of SNAP and WIC benefits to pay for diaper purchases. ||Calls upon federal government to permit use of SNAP and WIC benefits to pay for diaper purchases. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[S2118](/billdetail/1466689) |Requires DHS to conduct annual Medicaid eligibility redeterminations. || This bill requires the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in the Department of Human Services or a county welfare agency to conduct eligibility redeterminations for Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare beneficiaries no less than every 365 days. The bill additionally requires that the Commissioner of Human Services is to determine the means and method by which the annual eligibility redetermination is to be conducted. Currently, New Jersey statute does not specify the frequency with which Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare eligibility redeterminations are to occur. The bill further requires the commissioner, to the extent permitted under federal law and regulation, to provide for 12 months of continuous Medicaid eligibility, without imposing reporting requirements for changes of income or resources, for adult beneficiary groups, regardless of the delivery system through which the beneficiary receives benefits. The State has temporarily paused Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare eligibility redeterminations pursuant to the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (Pub.L.116-127). This law requires that the State, as a condition for receipt of an enhanced federal matching percentage under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, continue Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare coverage for all individuals enrolled on or after March 18, 2020, until the last day of the month in which the federal public health emergency period ends, regardless of any changes in the individual's circumstances that would otherwise result in termination from the program. On January 14, 2022, the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services extended the federal public health emergency for an additional 90 days. It is the intent of the bill's sponsor to reduce the frequency of coverage disruptions and coverage loss among Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare beneficiaries, a process known as \"churn,\" by limiting the frequency with which Medicaid eligibility redeterminations are conducted. Research shows that reductions in churn among Medicaid beneficiaries lowers states' administrative costs and may be associated with a reduction in beneficiary medical costs. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[SJR71](/billdetail/1467094) |Designates May of each year as \"Arthritis Awareness Month\" in New Jersey. ||This joint resolution designates May of each year as \"Arthritis Awareness Month\" in New Jersey. Arthritis, which includes more than 100 rheumatic diseases and conditions affecting joints and surrounding tissue, causes pain, loss of movement, and limits everyday activities such as walking or dressing. Arthritis is a chronic health problem that is the nation's leading cause of physical disability among Americans and is most common among people with multiple chronic conditions. Arthritis costs are more than $304 billion each year, with $140 billion in direct medical care costs and $164 billion in lost wages. In New Jersey, there are more than 858,200 adults living with arthritis; in addition, 30.8 percent of adults with diabetes, 45.9 percent of adults with cardiovascular disease, and 31 percent of adults who are obese also have arthritis. One out of every three American veterans lives with arthritis, which is the leading cause of disability among veterans. Research supporting better prevention strategies, interventions, and treatments is crucial to reducing the number of veterans and others who suffer from arthritis. Designates May of each year as \"Arthritis Awareness Month\" in New Jersey. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A3512](/billdetail/1468598) |Prohibits sale of certain diet pills and dietary supplements for muscle building to persons under 18 years of age under certain circumstances. ||Prohibits sale of certain diet pills and dietary supplements for muscle building to persons under 18 years of age under certain circumstances. ||In Committee | | |[A3523](/billdetail/1468633) |Requires health insurers to cover colorectal cancer screenings recommended by United States Preventive Services Task Force and eliminates cost-sharing requirements for certain colonoscopies. ||Requires health insurers to cover colorectal cancer screenings recommended by United States Preventive Services Task Force and eliminates cost-sharing requirements for certain colonoscopies. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A3511](/billdetail/1468757) |Requires workers' compensation, PIP, and health insurance coverage for the medical use of cannabis under certain circumstances. || This bill requires workers' compensation, personal injury protection (PIP), and health insurance coverage for the medical use of cannabis under certain circumstances. The bill provides that personal injury protection automobile insurance benefits, workers' compensation benefits, and health benefits plans must include coverage for costs associated with the medical use of cannabis, provided that the insured, employee, or covered person is a qualifying patient authorized for the medical use of cannabis pursuant to the \"Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act,\" P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al). In addition, the bill provides that an employer or workers' compensation insurance carrier, private passenger automobile insurance carrier, or health insurance carrier is not required to provide coverage or benefits for costs associated with the medical use of cannabis upon intervention by the federal government to enforce of the federal \"Controlled Substances Act\" (21 U.S.C. s.802 et seq.). Lastly, the bill provides that an employer, insurer, or health insurance carrier shall, if for any reason payment by the employer, insurer, or health insurance carrier to the medical cannabis dispensary is not feasible, remit directly to the insured, employee, or covered person the costs for any benefits associated with the medical use of cannabis upon proof of payment by the insured, employee, or covered person to the medical cannabis dispensary. ||In Committee | | |[A1994](/billdetail/1422569) |Requires DOH to establish maternity care evaluation protocols. || This bill requires the Commissioner of Health to develop comprehensive policies and procedures to be followed by every hospital providing inpatient maternity services, and every birthing center licensed in the State pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.), in the State, for the collection and dissemination of data on maternity care. The bill would require the Department of Health (DOH) to establish a maternity care evaluation protocol that every hospital and every birthing center would be required to follow in order to collect hospital discharge data relevant to maternity care, including, but not limited to de-identified information outlined under the bill. The Department of Health must evaluate the data collected under the maternity care evaluation protocol for the purposes of: facilitating a data-based review of the provision of maternity care services in the State in order to identify potential improvements in the provisions of such services; generating Statewide perinatal and provider-level quality metrics; establishing Statewide and regional objective benchmarks that promote improvements in maternal health outcomes and the quality of maternity care, and comparing the performance every hospital and birthing center in the State to such benchmarks; identifying data quality issues that may directly impact the performance of hospitals and birthing centers in providing maternity care services; encouraging hospitals and birthing centers that provide inpatient maternity services to participate in quality improvement collaboratives; and researching the association between clinical practices, the quality of maternal care, and maternal health care outcomes. No later than one year after the enactment of the bill, and every year after, the commissioner would report to the Governor and the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), on the findings of the evaluation required pursuant to the bill. The report would include any recommendations for legislative action that the commissioner deems appropriate. The quality of a hospital's or birthing center's data system can have a substantial impact on a state's ability to improve the quality of maternity care and reduce the causes and incidences of maternal mortality. Although the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed a national pregnancy surveillance system, states face challenges in accessing state-level data on maternal outcomes due to a lack of consistent, standardized data tracking and state-level surveillance. ||In Committee | | |[S1929](/billdetail/1463737) |Makes FY 2022 supplemental appropriation to provide State military impact aid to certain school districts. ||Makes FY 2022 supplemental appropriation to provide State military impact aid to certain school districts. ||Signed/Enacted | | |[A686](/billdetail/1422564) |Establishes \"Trenton Makes Commission.\" || This bill establishes the \"Trenton Makes Commission\" (commission). The permanent commission is established to research and implement the best ways to incentivize manufacturing businesses to come into New Jersey, while also focusing on strengthening the current manufacturing business sector already established within the State. The commission is to consist of 13 voting members, including members appointed by the Governor, legislative leaders, and relevant associations and agencies. The appointed members are to serve terms ranging from two to four years. The commission is tasked with studying and analyzing approaches other states have utilized to incentivize and strengthen the manufacturing business sector in those states, identifying cost-effective techniques to incentivize and support both new and existing manufacturing businesses within the State, consulting with the scientific and academic community for expertise and input, and reporting its findings and recommendations to the Governor and Legislature. ||In Committee | | |[A2007](/billdetail/1421108) |Requires students and certain other children to be annually vaccinated for influenza as condition of enrollment at public and private K-12 schools, preschools, child care centers, and institutions of higher education. || This bill requires students who attend a public or private K-12 school, preschool, child care center, or institution of higher education to be annually vaccinated for influenza as a condition of enrollment and continued attendance at the school or center. Commencing with the 2020-2021 school year: 1) a principal, director, or other person in charge of a public or private school in this State will be prohibited from knowingly admitting or retaining in grades K through 12 a child whose parent or guardian has not submitted acceptable evidence, by December 31 of the relevant school year, showing that the child has received an annual vaccination for influenza; 2) an executive director, administrator, or other person in charge of a preschool or child care center will be prohibited from knowingly admitting or retaining in the preschool or child care center a child whose parent or guardian has not submitted acceptable evidence, by December 31 of the relevant school year, showing that the child has received an annual vaccination for influenza; and 3) an administrator or other person in charge of an institution of higher education in this State will be prohibited from knowingly admitting or retaining a student who has not submitted acceptable evidence, by December 31 of the relevant school year, showing that the student has received an annual vaccination for influenza. Consistent with existing laws pertaining to the mandatory vaccination of children and students, the bill would provide that a child or student will be exempt from the bill's vaccination requirements if: 1) a written statement is submitted to the K-12 school, preschool, child care center, or institution of higher education by a licensed physician indicating that the vaccine is medically contraindicated for a specific period of time and the reasons for the medical contraindication, which are to be valid medical reasons as determined by regulation of the commissioner. Such statement will exempt the child or student from the vaccination for the period of time stated therein; or 2) a written statement is submitted to the K-12 school, preschool, or child care center by the child's or student's parent or guardian, if the child or student is a minor, or by the student, if the student is 18 years of age or older, explaining how the administration of the vaccine conflicts with the bona fide religious tenets or practices of the child or student, or of the parent or guardian, as the case may be, except that a general philosophical or moral objection to the vaccination will not be sufficient for an exemption to be granted on religious grounds. Children attending public or private K-12 schools, child care centers, and preschools in New Jersey are already required by existing law to be vaccinated for various contagious and dangerous diseases, including diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, pertussis, pneumococcal disease, polio, rubella, tetanus, and varicella, as a condition of attendance at the institution. Students of higher education are further required to verify their receipt of these vaccinations as a condition of their attendance at an institute of higher education. Although children in New Jersey who are between six and 59 months of age and who are attending a child-care center or preschool facility are additionally required by the State Sanitary Code to receive an annual vaccination for influenza, this requirement is not codified in the statutory law. In March 2020, Governor Murphy issued Executive Order No. 103, which declared a public health emergency and state of emergency in New Jersey in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a newly discovered and highly contagious pandemic-level disease that has spread quickly throughout the world, nation, and State, and against which humans have no natural immunity. It is associated with a wide range of symptoms, including, but not limited to, fever, cough, difficulty breathing, chills, sudden loss of smell or taste, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, many of which overlap with the symptoms of seasonal influenza. It is also possible for a person to become simultaneously infected with both COVID-19 and influenza, which may not only cause the person to experience more severe symptoms, but may also cause problems both for health care providers, in relation to their ability to provide the patient with an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, and for administrators of schools, preschools, and child care centers, in relation to their ability to identify and appropriately respond to outbreaks occurring at those institutions. The vaccination of children and students for influenza will significantly reduce the number of children and students in the State who experience severe flu symptoms or a severe combination of flu and COVID-19 symptoms, will help reduce competition among flu and COVID-19 patients for similar medical resources, and will result in fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to influenza, thereby enabling the State to preserve its hospital capacity and emergency and intensive care resources for patients who are infected with COVID-19 or other severe diseases and ailments. Preschools, child care centers, and K-12 schools, where children come into close contact with and freely mingle with each other and adult faculty and staff members, and institutions of higher education, where students often live in communal settings and come into close contact with thousands of other students, faculty, and other staff in dormitories, lecture halls, sports arenas, and other large, on-campus venues, are the types of institutions that may facilitate the quick and uncontrollable spread of COVID-19; however, because these institutions operate during flu season, it may be difficult for these institutions and for health care officials to quickly determine, for the purposes of implementing preventative and responsive measures, whether an outbreak of illness at the institution is occurring as a result of the spread of COVID-19 or influenza. By requiring the vaccination of children and students for influenza, the State can make it easier for these institutions to identify which children or students, if any, are showing signs of COVID-19 infection. Because of the severe, unprecedented, and unpredictable nature of COVID-19, the fact that there is currently no vaccine or preventative treatment for COVID-19, the commonalities that exist between COVID-19 and influenza, the fact that a person may simultaneously be infected with both diseases, the fact that patients with influenza will compete with COVID-19 patients and other severely ill patients for hospital space and resources, and the unique characteristics of public and private K-12 schools, preschools, child care centers, and institutions of higher education, it is both reasonable and necessary for the Legislature to require children and students at these institutions to be annually vaccinated for influenza, as a condition of their continued enrollment and attendance at the institution, in each year going forward. ||In Committee | | |[A1092](/billdetail/1421132) |Requires county to provide extraordinary special education aid to school districts located in county for students with costs over $55,000 and State to reimburse county. || Under current law, a school district is eligible to receive extraordinary special education State aid when the cost of providing direct instructional and support services for an individual classified pupil exceeds $40,000 or $55,000 depending on the pupil's placement. A school district submits an application to the Department of Education detailing those costs and, upon approval of its application, is reimbursed for either 90% or 75% of the amount that exceeds those thresholds, again depending on the nature of the placement. This bill provides that in those instances in which the cost of providing direct instructional and support services to an individual classified pupil exceeds $40,000, but is no more than $55,000, a school district will receive 100% of the amount of the excess paid to it directly by the State. In those instances in which the cost of providing direct instructional and support services for an individual classified pupil exceeds $55,000, a school district will receive 100% of the amount of the excess paid to it directly by the county in which the school district is located. The bill provides that the State will reimburse the county for the amount of extraordinary special education aid paid by the county to school districts. The bill establishes a county tax levy cap exclusion in order to accommodate the payment by the county of extraordinary special education aid to school districts. The bill also requires that all property tax bills include a separate line that indicates the amount of tax levy being raised to support extraordinary special education aid. ||In Committee | | |[A2020](/billdetail/1422533) |Establishes \"Kidney Disease Prevention and Education Task Force.\" || This bill establishes the Kidney Disease Prevention and Education Task Force. The purpose of this task force is to: 1) develop and implement a public awareness campaign about the benefits of the early detection and treatment of kidney disease that includes, but is not limited to, health education programs, preventative screenings, and social media, television, and radio outreach; (2) examine racial disparities in the rates of chronic kidney disease, kidney transplantations, and living and deceased kidney donations and identify opportunities to promote health equity; and (3) make recommendations in the implementation of a cost-effective plan for early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic kidney disease Statewide. The task force will consist of 11 members as follows: one member of the General Assembly, appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly, who shall serve as co-chairperson; one member of the General Assembly, appointed by the Assembly Minority Leader; one member of the Senate, appointed by the President of the Senate, who shall serve as co-chairperson; one member of the Senate, appointed by the Senate Minority Leader; the Commissioner of Health or the commissioner's designee, who shall serve ex officio; the Director of the Office of Minority and Multicultural Health or the director's designee, who shall serve ex officio; and five public members, who will be appointed by the Governor, that include: one nephrologist; one primary care physician; one member who is a pharmaceutical representative that works with existing kidney medication; one member who is a representative from a leading dialysis center; and one member who has chronic kidney disease between Stages 2-4 that is healthy enough to participate and is not already in one of the previous membership categories listed. The task force will present a report of its findings and recommendations to the Governor to the Legislature no later than two years after the organization of the task force. The task force will expire 30 days after the issuance of its report. ||In Committee | | |[A2006](/billdetail/1422246) |Requires school districts to include instruction on racial discrimination and social justice as part of implementation of New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Social Studies for middle school students. || This bill would require school districts to provide to middle school students instruction on racial discrimination and social justice in an appropriate place in the curriculum of middle school students as part of the districts' implementation of the New Jersey Learning Standards in Social Studies. Under the bill, the Commissioner of Education, in consultation with the Amistad Commission, will provide school districts with age-appropriate sample learning activities and resources designed to enhance students' overall understanding of issues surrounding racial discrimination and social justice. ||In Committee | "}
