On December 17, 2021, [the FDA approved](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=FRYmIFJ9rcu4droXfUYQuV_MT2a5105EJpV9PwRsfWd5dkpoKgrIRDOUgRZHSb2mQwk9qH4f1OyahxV8jHwcHt-G47_HyTtAKoNK6_wVX6OpYgRTFlQsC2pNA57_i0L-I2sNYdEMnKRDnt0uIID0S_Os8seHPM0XMEjFpoZXyyHaWVK9k1PaRUIygdua2GQBYW4uCDG_w8LZkzplPDQJ5w==) Oxbryta (voxelotor) tablets for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) in children ages 4 to less than 12 years - expanding the previously approved use of Oxbryta to treat SCD in patients ages 12 years and older in the U.S. The FDA also approved Oxbryta tablets for oral suspension, the new dispersible tablet dosage form suitable for patients ages 4 to less than 12 years. Oxbryta is the first and only approved medicine that directly targets sickle hemoglobin polymerization, the root cause of the sickling and destruction of red blood cells in SCD. \"The sickle cell disease community needs more innovative, safe and effective treatment options for this disease - a fact central to GBT's mission,\" said Kim Smith-Whitley, M.D., executive vice president and head of research and development at GBT. \"The FDA's recent approval of the new dispersible tablet dosage form of Oxbryta is an important advance for people and families affected by this devastating disease, and we are pleased to make this new dosage form available to patients by prescription. We are grateful to all those involved in ensuring that more sickle cell disease patients who need treatment with Oxbryta have access to it.\" Oxbryta is now available by prescription in two dosage forms for patients 4 years and older based on the patient's age, weight, and ability to swallow tablets: 500 mg tablets and 300 mg tablets for oral suspension. The 300 mg dispersible tablets for oral suspension are available in bottles of 60 and 90 tablets. The dispersible tablets include grape flavoring and are intended to be dispersed in room-temperature clear drinks for ease of swallowing (such as drinking water or clear soda), making Oxbryta easier to take for patients who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets, particularly younger children. GBT is committed to ensuring that patients who are prescribed Oxbryta can access their medicine. GBT Source Solutions\u00ae was established by GBT as a comprehensive program for patients who are prescribed Oxbryta that provides a wide range of practical, educational and financial support customized to each patient's needs. GBT Source Solutions provides support by reviewing insurance coverage options and explaining benefits; explaining specialty pharmacy benefits and working with the specialty pharmacies that coordinate shipments of Oxbryta; helping eligible, commercially insured patients with co-pay assistance; and helping appropriate patients stay on treatment with a nurse support team.

About Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects more than 100,000 people in the United States,1 an estimated 52,000 people in Europe,2 and millions of people throughout the world, particularly among those whose ancestors are from sub-Saharan Africa.3 It also affects people of Hispanic, South Asian, Southern European and Middle Eastern ancestry.3 SCD is a lifelong inherited rare blood disorder that impacts hemoglobin, a protein carried by red blood cells that delivers oxygen to tissues and organs throughout the body.4 Due to a genetic mutation, individuals with SCD form abnormal hemoglobin known as sickle hemoglobin. Through a process called hemoglobin polymerization, red blood cells become sickled - deoxygenated, crescent-shaped and rigid.4-6 The sickling process causes hemolytic anemia (low hemoglobin due to red blood cell destruction) and blockages in capillaries and small blood vessels, which impede the flow of blood and oxygen throughout the body. The diminished oxygen delivery to tissues and organs can lead to life-threatening complications, including stroke and irreversible organ damage.5-8 Complications of SCD begin in early childhood and can include neurocognitive impairment, acute chest syndrome, and silent and overt stroke, among other serious issues.9 About Oxbryta\u00ae (voxelotor) Tablets and Tablets for Oral Suspension Oxbryta (voxelotor) is an oral, once-daily therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Oxbryta works by increasing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. Since oxygenated sickle hemoglobin does not polymerize, Oxbryta inhibits sickle hemoglobin polymerization and the resultant sickling and destruction of red blood cells leading to hemolysis and hemolytic anemia, which are primary pathologies faced by every single person living with SCD. Through addressing hemolytic anemia and improving oxygen delivery throughout the body, GBT believes that Oxbryta has the potential to modify the course of SCD. In November 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for Oxbryta tablets for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older, and in December 2021, the U.S. FDA expanded the approved use of Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD in patients 4 years of age and older.10 As a condition of accelerated approval for patients ages 4 and older in the United States, GBT will continue to study Oxbryta in the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, a post-approval confirmatory study using transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow velocity to assess the ability of the therapy to decrease stroke risk in children 2 to 14 years of age. In recognition of the critical need for new SCD treatments, the FDA granted Oxbryta Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations for the treatment of patients with SCD. Additionally, Oxbryta has been granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Oxbryta was designated by the European Commission (EC) as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of patients with SCD, and Oxbryta was granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation in the United Kingdom from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). In December 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Oxbryta in Europe for the treatment of hemolytic anemia due to SCD in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea). The Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has granted marketing authorization for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Important Safety Information Oxbryta should not be taken if the patient has had an allergic reaction to voxelotor or any of the ingredients in Oxbryta. See the end of the patient leaflet for a list of the ingredients in Oxbryta. Oxbryta can cause serious side effects, including serious allergic reactions. Patients should tell their healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away if they get rash, hives, shortness of breath (difficult breathing) or swelling of the face. The most common side effects of Oxbryta include headache, diarrhea, stomach-area (abdominal) pain, nausea, rash or hives, and fever. The most common side effects of Oxbryta in children ages 4 to less than 12 years of age include fever, vomiting, rash, stomach-area (abdominal) pain, diarrhea, and headache. These are not all the possible side effects of Oxbryta. Before taking Oxbryta, patients should tell their healthcare provider about all medical conditions, including if they have liver problems; if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant as it is not known if Oxbryta can harm an unborn baby; or if they are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed as it is not known if Oxbryta can pass into breastmilk or if it can harm a baby. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment with Oxbryta and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how Oxbryta works. Oxbryta may also affect how other medicines work and may affect the results of certain blood tests. Patients are advised to call their doctor for medical advice about side effects. Side effects can be reported to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Side effects can also be reported to Global Blood Therapeutics at 1-833-428-4968 (1-833-GBT-4YOU).
