It can be a useful antidote to stress and is often recommended as a supplemental resource for a number of health and wellness concerns. During meditation the body shifts into a state of restful awareness in which we relax the fight or flight stress response, improve sleep, relieve feelings of anxiety and depression, decrease blood pressure, and, among other potential benefits. Meditation isn't just a tool to support mental health and stress (though, it is that, too). Meditation enhances our awareness, improves the attention span, and increases focus. When practiced regularly meditation can awaken creativity, healing, and transformation. Whether you've been practicing meditation for years, are interested in trying it for the first time, or find yourself somewhere in between - there's a place for you here. Virtual Group Meditation Sessions Meditation practices at the University Health Center will explore a variety of meditative tools and techniques, all designed to cultivate self-compassion, mindful awareness, and the ease that can arise as you meditate.

It is more than prayer and believing in a higher being. A spiritually well person seeks harmony with the universe, expresses compassion towards others, and practices gratitude and self-reflection. When we integrate practices of spiritual wellness we are able to connect in mind, body, and soul. For many, meditation is an important part of their spiritual wellness. Whether you are practicing a secular form of meditation, or one that is closely connected to your faith, meditation is a deeply spiritual practice and has the power to impact all dimensions of wellness. The University Health Center practices a secular form of meditation, not connected to a religious practice, and we honor and respect the spiritual roots and traditions of this ancient practice. There is no single origin story of meditation. The practice of meditation has connections to India and Africa and appears in visual depictions and written scriptures dating back thousands of years. Many religions and spiritual practices have some form of meditation practice. To learn more about the spiritual roots of meditation we recommend connecting with the [Memorial Chapel](https://stamp.umd.edu/centers/memorial_chapel) or a librarian at the [University Libraries](https://www.lib.umd.edu). Understanding the Science of Meditation and Mindfulness Meditation is a specific practice with various spiritual and cultural origins, where an individual uses a technique such as loving kindness (also known as Metta), breathing, visualization, or others - to slow down the body and mind. Meditation often involves setting aside time to engage with the practice. For those new to meditation, we recommend starting with a small amount of time, anywhere from two to ten minutes, at any time of the time of the day, in a location where you can feel comfortable and supported. Mindfulness, on the other hand, is an overarching intention to pay attention in the moment. Mindfulness can be attached to a variety of physical, mental, or day-to-day practices. It's important to note that neither meditation or mindfulness is a \"cure-all\" practice. Neither eliminate hardships, or systemic issues. Both, however, can be supportive wellness practices that can alter the way we approach certain situations. Scientific fields like psychology and neuroscience, for example, have helped us understand how the brain is affected by meditation practices. As we learn more about meditation we continue to discover more and more benefits, including, but not limited to: stress relief, mental health support, improved focus, enhanced sleep quality, increased creativity, and more.
