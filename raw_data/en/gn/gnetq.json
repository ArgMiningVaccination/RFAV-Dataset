Lewald deplored the physical state of the German population as a consequence of the lost war. Two million of the physically and mentally strongest German men had been killed, while millions of German men, women, and children were permanently physically weakened as a result of starvation during the war and the allied hunger blockade after the armistice. To make matters worse, the hygienic benefits of military service that had guaranteed the physical strength and fitness of male youth had been lost. Prior to the war about 500,000 men had served in the German army or navy where they had learned regimens of cleanliness, order, and discipline. According to Lewald, by limiting the size of the German army to 100,000 men, the victorious allies had not only weakened Germany militarily, but they had also tried to paralyze Germany economically by permanently weakening the \"strength of the German people\" (deutsche Volkskraft).1 - Type - Research Article - Information [Volume 41](/core/journals/central-european-history/volume/C30673CFCA4A1BEB15A36F0BA9110E8D), [Issue 3](/core/journals/central-european-history/issue/52E8833D090BEB2BFF9D6867F00CB8AD), September 2008 381 - 412 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 Conference Group for Central European History of the American Historical Association 2008 References 1 Lewald, and the organizational framework of the Weimar sports movement, see Eisenberg, 3 For such a broad conceptualization of biopolitics as a central aspect of German modernity, see Dickinson, Edward Ross, \"Biopolitics, Fascism, Democracy: Some Reflections on Our Discourse about Modernity,\" Central European History 37 (2004): 1-47 [CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156916104322888989) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Biopolitics%2C+Fascism%2C+Democracy%3A+Some+Reflections+on+Our+Discourse+about+Modernity&author=Dickinson+Edward+Ross&publication+year=2004&journal=Central+European+History&volume=37&doi=10.1163%2F156916104322888989&pages=1-47).

The promotion of Breitensport was one of the main purposes of the \"Hochschule\" from the outset. It was more than a compensation for the lack of a good research profile, as Eisenberg claims. Eisenberg, \"English Sports\" und deutsche B\u00fcrger, 362. 11 Diem (1882-1962) was the most important German sports official during the first half of the twentieth century. Starting out as a journalist, he was already a major figure in the German sports movement during the Kaiserreich. After World War II, he became the founder and first director of the German Sports University (Deutsche Sporthochschule) in Cologne. Because of his collaboration with Nazism as general secretary of the organization committee for the 1936 Olympics, he remains a controversial figure. For a recent assessment of the political debate about Diem's role during Nazism, see Kluge, Volker, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Zum+aktuellen+Stand+der+Diem+Debatte&author=Kluge+Volker&publication+year=2002&journal=Kurier.+Informationen+der+Deutschen+Sporthochschule+K%C3%B6ln&volume=25&pages=1-4). Frank Becker is currently working on a Diem biography; see Becker, president of the 1936 organizing committee was Lewald, a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1924-1936, whose position was rather tenuous because he was partially Jewish. The Nazi regime drew on the international reputations of Lewald and Diem in order to deflect criticism of Nazi racial policies in the lead-up to the games. After 1936, Lewald was forced to retire and resign his post as IOC member. On Lewald, see On Diem and Lewald's roles in the organization of the 1936 games, see Large, David Clay, Nazi Games: The Olympics of 1936 (New York: Norton, 2007) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Nazi+Games%3A+The+Olympics+of+1936&author=Large+David+Clay&publication+year=2007); and Teichler, Hans 203. 14 The DRAL's socialist counterpart, the Central Commission for Sports and Physical Care (Zentralkommission f\u00fcr Sport und K\u00f6rperpflege, ZAK) was significantly smaller, in part because many workers were members of the b\u00fcrgerliche sports associations. The DRAL represented about 6.5 million members of sports and gymnastics federations in 1929. Eisenberg, \"Massensport,\" 147. In 1929, the ZAK represented about 1.2 million workers practicing sports, gymnastics, and/or other forms of physical exercise such as hiking. Wildung, Fritz, Arbeitersport 1924/25 almost thirty-four percent of the budget came from the Reich, in 1928/29 almost forty-eight percent, in 1929/1930 about forty-four percent. 16 Mallwitz, Arthur, \"Arbeit und Sport, Nr. 585 (continued), 77. 18 Beyer, Erich, \"Sport in Weimarer Republik,\" in Geschichte Carl Diem, in \"W\u00f6rtliches Stenogramm,\" negotiations October Nr. 16. 21 CULDA, Sachakte Nr. 16. The survey lists all in all 123 municipalities that either had a Stadtamt f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen or smaller committees or departments of youth welfare offices concerned with the support and administration of local sporting activities. It also listed twenty-four cities that planned to create such offices or departments. 22 Dr. Wagner, in \"W\u00f6rtliches Stenogramm,\" negotiations in Breslau, October 14, Andermann, 1927), 35-40 [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Die+deutschen+Leibes%C3%BCbungen.+Grosses+Handbuch+f%C3%BCr+Turnen%2C+Spiel+und+Sport&author=Lewald+Theodor&author=Neuendorff+Edmund&publication+year=1927&pages=35-40). 24 The DRAL commissioned expert reports by sixteen leading medical professors and public health officials in support of such claims. Among them were the surgeons August Bier (Berlin), Ferdinand Sauerbruch (Munich), K\u00fcmmell (Hamburg), the city medical councilor of Berlin Karl von Drigalski, the Berlin medical professors for hygiene Hahn and Max Rubner (the director of the first medical clinic of the Charit\u00e9 and the KWIA), Wilhelm His, and the Hamburg neurologist Max Nonne. Bier and Sauberbruch were among the most well-known medical professors in Germany. Both also lent their reputation to the DRAL by serving as directors of the DHfL from 1920 to 1932 (Bier) and 1932 to 1934 (Sauerbruch). Lewald, Sport, Wirtschaft, 9-23. In the view of Max Nonne sports would strengthen people's ability and will to work. Nonne, best known for his hypnotic treatment of war neurotics, evaluated nervous and disability claims in Hamburg. He was committed to exposing false pension claims by so-called pension neurotics. Lerner, Hysterical Men, 229. Killen, Berlin and 18f. Hoske cited statistics from the Reichspost and a large Berlin company that in his view demonstrated that exercise breaks significantly reduced sick days. 25 Lewald, \"Leibes\u00fcbungen und Volksgesundheit,\" 37ff. 26 Landesarchiv Berlin A Rep 001-02, Nr. 585 (continued), citations 19 and 21. 27 Ibid., citation 106 VS. 28 Ibid., 53, 77, 78, and 110VS. At stake were the three million RM for the support of Leibes\u00fcbungen within the Youth Welfare Fund mentioned above. The Landtag provided these funds unanimously, which is an indication of the high priority given to the support of Leibes\u00fcbungen among all political parties. B\u00f6\u00df himself was a member of the German Democratic Party (DDP). 29 Poensgen, Ernst, On the Ge-So-Lei and other Weimar hygiene exhibitions, see Hau, Michael, The Cult of Health and Beauty in Germany: A Social History, 1890-1930 (Chicago: University of Fraenkel, 321-355. Most of the exhibitions were by men. Women, however, demonstrated their skills in apparatus gymnastics, horseback riding, waterskiing, and swimming, as well as in rhythmic gymnastics. 31 98-105, citation 98 [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Betriebssport+zwischen+Arbeitgeberinteressen+und+Arbeitnehmerbed%C3%BCrfnissen.+Eine+historische+Analyse+vom+Kaiserreich+bis+zur+Gegenwart&author=Luh+Andreas&publication+year=1998&pages=98-105). 32 There is already a quite extensive literature on European physiology and work physiology. See, for example, Sarasin, Fatigue, and the Origins of Modernity (New York: Basic Books, 1990) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=The+Human+Motor%3A+Energy%2C+Fatigue%2C+and+the+Origins+of+Modernity&author=Rabinbach+Anson&publication+year=1990).

As the following discussion shows, however, the relationship between labor rationalization and sports was more complicated than a simple association between piecework rates (Akkord) and sports records (Rekord) would suggest.

Here I would disagree with John Hoberman who has characterized medical opposition to exaggerated performance enhancement in sports as part of a pre-modern attitude. This is in my opinion not helpful, because the \"modernity\" of such attitudes depends on their context. By adhering to hygienic prescriptions of moderation in exercise, scientists such as Herbst did not express pre-modern skepticism about the possibilities of scientific performance enhancement in sports. Hoberman, John M., \"The Early Development of Sports Medicine in Germany,\" in Sport and Exercise Science: Essays in the History of Medicine, ed. Berryman, John W. and Park, Roberta J. (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1992), 233-282, especially has shown for German criminologists that German eugenicists did not always adhere to a strict genetic determinism; see Wetzell, Richard F., Inventing the Criminal: A History of German Criminology, 1880-1945 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000) [Google 49 see Angelika, \"Der ist 50 On Kretschmer's constitutional typology and Weimar culture, see Hau, Michael, \"The Holistic Gaze in German Medicine, 1890-1930,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 52 During the Weimar years, the renowned German Psychiatric Institute in Munich, which would become notorious after 1933 for its promotion of Nazi racial hygiene under its director Ernst R\u00fcdin, received considerable sums of Rockefeller Foundation money, as did the Brain Research Institute of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Society in Berlin. Because of the prevalence of hereditarian assumptions in psychiatry, the research at both institutions had strong eugenic implications.

During the Nazi period these surveys were part of the admission process, and they were used to exclude students from university studies if they were considered \"physically inferior\"; see Bod\u00f3, B\u00e9la, \"The Medical Examination and Biological Selection of University Students in Nazi Germany,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 76 (2002): 719-748 [CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/bhm.2002.0160) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=The+Medical+Examination+and+Biological+Selection+of+University+Students+in+Nazi+Germany&author=Bod%C3%B3+B%C3%A9la&publication+year=2002&journal=Bulletin+of+the+History+of+Medicine&volume=76&doi=10.1353%2Fbhm.2002.0160&pages=719-748) [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12446977). This is not to say that the physicians cited here rejected eugenics. According to Rautmann, eugenics (Rassenhygiene), better living conditions, and physical exercise were all important factors for the improvement of the physical performance potential of German students in the long run, because some physical deficits were based on hereditary predispositions. Rautmann's main emphasis, however, was on programs of remedial or therapeutic exercise. He did not specify how racial hygiene was supposed to improve the physical condition of students.

According to an incomplete list by F. W. von der Linde of the Union of German Employer Associations, there were more than 100 plants of major corporations or mid-sized firms that supported sporting facilities or company sports clubs.
