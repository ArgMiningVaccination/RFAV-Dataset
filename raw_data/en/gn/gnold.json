We are passionate about our ingredients, so it's important to us to share the facts about their impact Since 2022, we've partnered with Provenance\u00ae to help us share credible, compelling and fact-checked social and environmental impact information with our customers. Provenance\u00ae is the global leader in sustainability marketing technology, and exists to drive positive change through transparency. They're protecting shoppers from greenwashing using their product and brand Proof Point technology, connecting 'green' claims to evidence from the supply chain or third-party verification. Proof Points are interactive icons representing a claim about our brand and products. Each Proof Point is part of the Provenance Framework, a collection of 50+ jargon-free claims about social and environmental impact. You will notice these sitting across all of our product pages representing a claim about us that is supported by real data. See an example below highlighted in the green box - you can simply toggle between Product and Brand to see our array of proof points, and all you need to do is click the claim you're interested in, for example Natrue Natural, to find out more: We also publish our sustainability credentials on the Provenance beauty Directory.
