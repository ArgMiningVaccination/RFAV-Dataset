The Douglas County Detoxification program offers services to individuals aged 19 and older who may benefit from medical support in a safe environment during withdrawal from alcohol or other drugs. We are located at 1490 North 16th Street ( [entrance is on 17th Street just north of the Siena Francis House](/images/detox_entrance_map.png)). The 24/7 staff includes Psychiatric Technicians and a nurse who has access to a physician. The program consists of two distinct services: Voluntary and Involuntary Detox. Voluntary Detox Individuals admitted into Voluntary Detox may stay up to five days. Although alcohol is the most common substance, other substances may include cocaine, meth, or prescription medications. In addition to medical monitoring, the individual works with staff to determine priorities and supports they wish to focus on as they prepare for discharge. These supports may include shelter, community supports, chemical dependency assessment, outpatient or residential treatment. Voluntary Detox is often used as a support for someone who is unable to remain sober long enough for admission into a treatment program, to attend a court hearing, etc. If the potential client takes any medications, he or she will be required to bring them at the time of admission. Involuntary Detox The state of Nebraska's Civil Protective Custody statue provides a way to offer medically monitored care for someone who is in a public or quasi-public place, who is intoxicated and presents as a danger to themselves or others. This Involuntary program is provided in partnership with law enforcement. It is important to note that although an individual is signed into the program by law enforcement, this is not an arrest or citation. With the ability to stay up to 24 hours, the staff use this opportunity to provide the individual with information on community supports, treatment programs, area shelters, etc. If you feel that someone you know who is currently intoxicated would benefit from this program, you may call the police or bring them to "}
