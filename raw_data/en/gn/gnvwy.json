Vaccines are the best defense against the virus and individuals are encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible, and ensure they receive all the doses recommended for the best protection. The vaccine is also available from medical clinics, pharmacies and other locations. Use the [Vaccine Finder](#finder) to find a convenient location. You can make your vaccine appointment at some sites [online](https://patient.petal-health.com/login?groupId=6032) or by calling 1-844-626-8222.

A primary series consists of two or three doses depending on the vaccine product. Booster doses are not available for this age group at this time. Children must be at least six months of age at the time of their immunization appointment. There are two products authorized for children 6 months to 4 years: - Moderna: The primary series consists of 2 doses. The interval between the first and second dose for most children is eight weeks. - Pfizer: The primary series consists of 3 doses. The interval between doses for most children is eight weeks. It is recommended to start and finish the primary series with the same product if available. Parents/guardians who want their child to receive their next dose sooner (before eight weeks) should discuss the risks and benefits with their immunizer or health care provider before vaccination, to ensure the parent/guardian understands the risks of an earlier second dose. A longer time period between doses provides a stronger immune response. For more information on the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommendations, please go to the [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-26-covid-19-vaccine.html). Vaccine Eligibility for Children aged 5 to 11 Children in this age group are eligible to receive a primary COVID-19 vaccine series and a first booster dose. There are Moderna and Pfizer vaccines authorized for children 5-11 years old. Children must be five years old at the time of their immunization appointment. The recommended time between first and second doses for most children is eight weeks. Parents/guardians who want their child to receive their second dose sooner (after 21 days for Pfizer or after 28 days for Moderna but before eight weeks for either vaccine) should discuss the risks and benefits with their immunizer or health care provider before vaccination. This will ensure the parent/guardian understands the risks of an earlier second dose as a longer time period between doses provides a stronger immune response. Children 5 years of age are only eligible to receive a booster dose with the pediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Children ages 6 to 11 are eligible to receive a booster dose with the pediatric Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. It is recommended to wait 6 months after completing the primary series or COVID-19 infection before receiving a booster dose. A booster dose is recommended for children 5 to 11 years of age, who have a health condition that increases their risk of severe illness from COVID-19. For more information on NACIs recommendations, please see COVID:19 vaccine: [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-26-covid-19-vaccine.html) Vaccine Eligibility for Youth and Adults aged 12 and Older It is recommended that everyone aged 12 and older receive a primary COVID-19 vaccine series and booster doses. A primary series consists of two doses. The time between the first and second dose is eight weeks. Individuals who wish to receive their second dose sooner (after 21 days for Pfizer or 28 days for Moderna but before eight weeks for either vaccine) should discuss the risks and benefits with their immunizer or health care provider before vaccination. Doing so ensures they understand the risks of an earlier second dose, because a longer time period between doses provides a stronger immune response. NACI recommends the bivalent omicron-containing mRNA COVID-19 vaccines as the preferred booster products for people aged 12 and older. Youth aged 12 to 17: The Pfizer vaccine is recommended for all doses in the primary series due to a lower risk of myocarditis/pericarditis with this vaccine as compared to the Moderna vaccine for this age group. The Pfizer bivalent vaccine is the recommended vaccine as a booster. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) also recommends: - All youth should be offered a fall booster dose, regardless of the number of booster doses they have previously received. - Youth at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 are strongly encouraged to receive a fall booster dose. For more information on NACI's recommendations, please see COVID-19 vaccine: [Canadian Immunization Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-4-active-vaccines/page-26-covid-19-vaccine.html). Adults aged 18 years and older: For the primary series, it is recommended to get the same mRNA vaccine, if available. However, a combination of mRNA vaccines is both safe and effective, and either (Pfizer or Moderna) can be offered if: - the same mRNA vaccine is not available, - your previous dose was with a non-mRNA vaccine (e.g. AstraZeneca, Janssen), or - the last dose is unknown. If you have completed your primary series, all adults are eligible for a fall booster dose, regardless of the number of booster doses previously received. Additionally, the following high-risk individuals may choose to receive a spring 2023 booster dose: - Adults age 65 and older - Indigenous people age 45 and older, including First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples, regardless of place of residence - Residents of long term care (LTC), assisted living or supportive housing facilities - Adults age 18 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised Six months is the minimum interval after the last dose of the primary series or between booster doses. Vaccine effectiveness increases with longer duration between doses. It is also recommended to wait at least six months between COVID-19 infection and receiving a booster dose. You should be aware a spring booster dose may result in a delay of your eligibility for a fall booster dose and a less robust immune response if a fall booster dose is administered at a shorter interval (i.e. less than six months from the previous dose). Bivalent vaccines have been developed to protect against the original strain of COVID-19 as well as the omicron strain. This type of vaccine provides a broader immune response and may also protect against future variants of concern. The bivalent booster is recommended for all individuals 12 years of age and older. - The Moderna bivalent vaccine is authorized as a booster dose for individuals 6 years of age and older. - The Pfizer bivalent vaccine is authorized as a booster dose for individuals 5 years of age and older. Note: there is no evidence indicating one bivalent vaccine is more effective than the other. Vaccine Eligibility for Infants, Children, Youth and Adults who are Moderately to Severely Immunocompromised For the purposes of COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, the following individuals are considered moderately to severely immunocompromised due to a medical condition and/or treatment: - are receiving active chemotherapy (or immunotherapy) for cancer; - have received a solid organ transplant and are currently receiving chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy; - were born with moderate or severe dysfunction of their immune system; - are living with untreated or advanced HIV-AIDS; or - are taking certain medications that severely affect the immune system. The following people should talk to their doctor to see whether they are considered to be immunocompromised: - receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis; - are on the list to receive a solid organ transplant; or - have a ventricular assist device (VAD). Most individuals who are eligible for a COVID vaccine get two doses for their primary series. Infants, children, youth and adults who are moderately to severely immunocompromised are recommended to receive an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine to complete their primary series. For infants 6 month to four years who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, NACI strongly recommends a 3-dose primary series of Moderna. If the Moderna vaccine is not readily available, a 4-dose primary series with the Pfizer vaccine may be offered. The interval between each dose in a 3- or 4-dose series is 4 to 8 weeks. For individual 5 years and older, the interval between the first and the second dose is eight weeks. The interval between the second and third dose is four to eight weeks. Individuals who wish to receive their second dose sooner (after 21 days for Pfizer or after 28 days for Moderna but before eight weeks) should discuss the risks and benefits with their immunizer or health care provider before vaccination, to ensure they understand the risks of an earlier second dose. A longer time period between doses provides a stronger immune response. The additional dose in the primary series requires a prescription if given outside of a physician or pharmacists office and must be given at least 28 days after the second dose. NACI strongly recommends that everyone 5 years and older who is at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should be offered a fall COVID-19 vaccine booster dose regardless of the number of booster doses previously received. It is recommended to wait six months after the last dose of the primary series (or after a previous booster dose) before getting a booster dose. It is also recommended for individuals to wait six months since their last COVID-19 infection before getting a booster dose. At minimum, they need to be fully recovered before receiving a booster dose. Refer to the appropriate section above for more information on booster doses for children, youth and adults. Immunization after a COVID-19 infection It is possible that people will get COVID-19 before starting or completing their COVID-19 vaccine primary series. In this case, it is recommended to wait two months before getting your next dose in the primary series. If someone gets COVID-19 before getting their booster dose, it is recommended to wait six months before receiving their booster dose. At minimum, they need to be symptom free and no longer isolating before receiving a booster dose. Recommendations may be different if you are moderately to severely immunocompromised. Please speak to your health care provider to get the best advice on when to get your next vaccine dose after a COVID-19 infection.

Organizing a Workplace Clinic Manitoba expanded access to workplaces to help their staff get immunized against COVID-19. There are a number of ways that workplaces can coordinate immunizations. - Employers with occupational health services that normally include immunization or intramuscular injections can apply to the Independent Immunization Partner (IIP) program. This allows them to order and administer COVID-19 vaccines similar to a seasonal flu campaign. Visit this page for [more information](vaccination-partner-program.html)and to apply. - Employers can arrange to have vaccinations provided on site with a participating pharmacy or medical clinic. Employers and can reach out directly to make arrangements. - Group bookings are available at vaccine clinics located throughout the province. - If a medical clinic or pharmacy isn't available, employers can contact their regional health authority and request a focused immunization team to come on site and administer vaccines on a particular day. |Region||Contact| |Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority|| Wendy Fontaine | Authority|| Leslie | |Winnipeg Regional Health Authority|| Donna Jacobs | Workplace COVID-19 Resources for Employers and Workplaces [https://manitoba.ca/asset_library/en/covid/workplace-covid-documents.pdf](https://manitoba.ca/asset_library/en/covid/workplace-covid-documents.pdf) How to Report your COVID-19 Vaccine and Update your Immunization Records If you received a COVID-19 vaccine outside of Manitoba, you should report them so your Manitoba immunization record is up to date. In order to do this, you will need proof of immunization from the jurisdiction where you received your vaccine. Once you have your vaccination record that needs to be added, please use [this online form](https://forms.gov.mb.ca/immunization-update-request/) to submit it, and your information will be updated once your immunization record is validated. You will be notified once your immunization record is updated. After your information has been updated, you can request your immunization record online. The e-form process will make it faster and easier to make changes to your vaccination record. It will also help your primary care physician and our public health teams to view your full immunization history. Alternatively, people can call 1-844-MAN-VACC (1-844-626-8222) and follow the call centre prompts to get the update process started. Immunization Records In order to show your immunization status, residents of Manitoba can request a Canadian Proof of Vaccination Credential (PVC) (valid throughout Canada and internationally). As of March 1, 2022, Manitoba's proof of vaccination requirement is no longer mandatory. Canadian Proof of Vaccination Credential (PVC) The Canadian COVID-19 Proof of Vaccination Credential (PVC) is a secure and reliable way to show your proof of COVID-19 vaccination history. The only medical information contained in this document is related to your COVID-19 vaccination history. The PVC, and associated QR code, contains your name, date of birth, date of immunization, brand of vaccine received and lot number. If your information is scanned by a verifier app it will be subject to open data collection. The PVC can be used for travel within Canada and internationally and is a recognized and trusted document with international partners. It is important to confirm the immunization requirements for your travel destination and any stops along the way before departing to confirm what type of proof is accepted. Request Your PVC You can request your PVC online at [immunizationcard.manitoba.ca](https://immunizationcard.manitoba.ca/) or through the Manitoba Immunization Card app available in the Apple App Store or on Google Play. You can also call the province's call centre at 1 844 MAN VACC (1 844 626 8222) for more information about the process. Your PVC will contain any international COVID-19 vaccines you received if they are part of Health Canada's accepted list of World Health Organization (WHO) approved COVID-19 vaccines. The list of WHO approved COVID-19 vaccines can be found at: [COVID-19 Vaccines with WHO Emergency Use Listing | WHO - Prequalification of Medical Products (IVDs, Medicines, Vaccines and Immunization Devices, Vector Control)](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/vaccinescovid-19-vaccine-eul-issued). If you received a vaccine that is not on the accepted list, it may still appear on the PVC but with limited information. The PVC is available digitally on your smart phone/device or you can select to receive it by email and you can then print a hard copy of the PDF. If you would like to have your PVC available on multiple devices, you must request the PVC on each individual device. The app only stores the information for your PVC while you are logged in. Once logged out, the app will erase your PVC. You will have to request it again the next time you log in. It is NOT available as a wallet certificate at this time. The PVC follows the SMART Health Card standard. It provides a safe and secure way to share limited information about your COVID-19 vaccination history. Any scanner that has the ability to read a SMART Health Card QR code will be able to read the QR code on your PVC. You can keep a digital copy of your proof of vaccination on any smart phone/device. More information on the PVC and SMART Health Cards is available at [canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/vaccines/vaccine-proof.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/vaccines/vaccine-proof.html) Immunization Records (All vaccinations) An immunization record is a personal medical record used by the provincial health care system that identifies the vaccinations that you have received that were recorded by health care providers in Manitoba. Manitobans can access their own COVID-19 immunization records online, which show the dates you received COVID-19 vaccines and the type of vaccines received. It is helpful to know when you received your previous doses of COVID-19 vaccine and the type of vaccine you received. If you do not recall this information and you have a Manitoba health card, you can locate it at: [sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/test-results/](https://sharedhealthmb.ca/covid19/test-results/). If your immunization record is incomplete or incorrect, or you received a COVID-19 vaccination outside of Manitoba, you can have your file updated by completing and submitting [this e-form](https://forms.gov.mb.ca/immunization-update-request/). For a copy of your full immunization record, please contact your [local public health office.](https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/offices.html) Further information on immunization records can be found at: [Your Immunization Record Matters | Communicable Disease Control | Public Health | Manitoba Health | Province of Manitoba (gov.mb.ca)](https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/div/records.html) Please be aware that your immunization record, including the COVID-19 immunization record, may not be an acceptable form of proof of vaccination for the purposes of travel. It is recommended to obtain your Canadian Proof of Vaccination Credential (PVC) for travel purposes.
