Do you find value in this show? If so, support the podcast. SUPPORT THIS PODCAST viaPatreon Friends, Here is a ep 2 in a series of on occult & esoteric christianity, an evolving tradition that offers vitalizing insight into how to move forward. Across these episodes, I'll be talking about various streams and fruits of occult & esoteric christianity, as well as some of its key figures. Rather than presenting the typically dogmatic, dominating, and totalizing christianity \u2014 which is always in danger of being seized by people, especially conservatives, with power \u2014 this series will present a different and truer form. Open, wounded, individuated, and powerless; a tradition that relates to other spiritual paths without seeking to control or diminish them. The first in the series, AEWCH 220, featured Rev. Jonah Evans. With the episode, I'll continue on with questions for the Christian Community, one of the only religious streams of esoteric christianity, with Jonah's close colleague and co-host of The Light In Every Thingpodcast, Rev. Patrick Kennedy. Patrick was last on the show on AEWCH 181, and is a reverend in The Christian Community, the gathering of Christians in service and ritual informed by Rudolf Steiner. WHAT OTHER AEWCH EPISODE YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO? Though it's a bit of a sideways connection here, AEWCH 198 with philosopher of religions and culture, Federico Campagna, has quite a bit about looking at reality carefully and allowing the rest of life to come from that view. MORE ON PATRICK Patrick has a patreon which offers early access to each episode of The Light in Every Thing and other benefits. And one of the best ways to understand some of what Patrick and that is to see if there's a service near youand then attend one. Nothing will be expected of you, no one will try to get you \"in\" to the group. You'll just encounter what all encounter: the baseline of the service is always the same; the Act of Consecration of Man. And then some talking afterward. Welcome to the How To Live Beyond series of eps on AEWCH! To open 2023, each episode in this series will consider a set of tools or way of thinking that are useful but that we're ready to go beyond in 2023. We'll be looking at abundance and manifestation, wellness and self development, entheogens, paganism, and more. The first episode (AEWCH 208) featured Mitch Horowitz on How To Live: Beyond the New Age. These are the techniques and traditions we use to cope with and confront the challenges of our time, but risk - if we can't consider them deeply - getting us stuck in those challenges or worse, funneling their strengths back into those challenges. Theseepisodesaren'tacalltoforgetaboutthesetechniquesandtraditions,butinsteadacalltobringforwardwhatthey'veoffered without the barbs of the problems they're tangled up with. Thistime: It seems like everywhere we turn, we're bombarded by messages about why psychedelics are good for you, and how we can magic ourselves into a better planet or against capitalism etc etc. It could be Graham Hancock advising ayahuasca use to see reality, or Michael Pollan detailing hallucigenic health benefits. And there's #WItchesOfInstagram + leftist spiritual podcasts and books on using magic to survive and combat capitalism.Techies are microdosing to support their lives and by extension gentrification and class war, feminists are reclaiming witchcraft, Marxists are spellcasting, gay men are turning to Aleister Crowley for inspiration. And to make matters worse, people who condemn using magic and mushrooms are even worse than all that. Religious fundamentalists, tankie materialist leftists, conservative fascists, edgelords saying magic is \"woke,\" new age \"seekers\" none of whom seem to have bearings in spiritual truth. What is going on here, and does any of it lead to real and liberating spiritual inspiration, or are we just getting driven deeper and deeper into materialistic culture, politics, and economy? To talk about all of this and how to get beyond it, I asked spiritual teacher and writer Lisa Romero onto the show. This is the deepest I've ever gone on the topic, and I think it throughly illustrates the dangers of sorcery and psychedelics, and how to think about them without becoming a foot-stomping fascist or a tech-hippie psychonaut enthusiast. What's useful? What's outdated? What spiritual techniques need to be allowed to die (and be reborn)? Lisa's latest appearance on the show was on AEWCH 200 where she and I talked with Duncan Trussell where the three of us investigated this topic. This is a natural continuation, but we go much, much deeper, using the idea that accessing and commanding the beings in the realm of magic and psychedelics - the astral realm - is the adolescence of humanity. And we also go into what we can do and how to approach the astral realm... and go beyond it. SHOW NOTES WHAT OTHER EPISODE SHOULD YOU LISTEN TO One of my favorite episodes on elemental beings, which we talk about at length on this episode, is AEWCH 188 with artist and spiritual teacher, Marko Poganik. Marko and Lisa have a lot in common, and I hope to get them in conversation with each other sometime. For now, listening to the two episodes can bring them into conversation within and with you. WHAT BOOK SHOULD YOU READ? Conor McPherson's play The Weir, is one of the finest expressions of encounters with the astral realm and the Otherworld (and how not to deal with them). Of course it's best to see it, but unless you're lucky enough to have a production going on nearby, reading it is the next best thing. It's in this collection of his plays.

SUPPORT THIS PODCAST viaPatreon Friends, In the midst of 2022, so many of us are seeking peace and meaning. So here's my series on one meaning-rich tradition and religious stream: Christianity. But this will be a different sort of Christianity: occult and esoteric Christianity. Some of it might look familiar. Some might seem absolutely bizarre. All of it, I hope will stir a feeling of warmth and depth of meaning for you, whether you feel any affinity with Christianity or the occult. The first episode in the series is AEWCH 181, featuring Rev. Patrick Kennedy from the Christian Community - a religious tradition informed by occultism. The second, AEWCH 182, was on with writer and spiritual teacher Lisa Romero. And the third is AEWCH 183 on Christ and technology with tech worker-turned-spiritual-philosopher Andrew Linnell. For this episode, I turn to the value of esoteric christianity and friendship and its opposite: Nazism. Alfred Bergel was a painter murdered in Auschwitz - a wonderful artist, actually, whose work might be largely disappeared by his murders had Anne and a few others done the work of reconstructing his presence here. Anne did this via research at the Karl K\u00f6nig Institute since Bergel was close friends with K\u00f6nig, the Jewish anthroposophist who started - through his guidance, encounters, and inspiration from Rudolf Steiner - Camphhill Communities, where people with what many of us would call \"disabilities\" live around the world. Camphill Communities are among esoteric christianity's most beautiful offerings to the world. Follow links below for more information. Through K\u00f6nig's archives and Anne's work, Bergel's life can be reconstructed and revitalized in part. Anne found mentions of him in Konig's letters and family diaries, in poems and stories. She found other holocaust survivors and the notes of others who had died in the holocaust about Bergel. She also, on the journey (and in her book) in revealed instances of others in the camps comforted by esoteric christianity and anthroposophy (indeed some of the people in the camps were put they because they were anthroposophists). This is an episode rooted in history, relevant for today, in both its picture of friendship and Christ, as well as its revelation of the inverse and how evil works. SHOW NOTES WHAT BOOK YOU SHOULD READ? I was moved and disturbed by Peter Tradowsky's short book, Christ and Antichrist: Understanding the Events of Our Time and Recognizing Our Tasks. It's a portrait of the presence of evil in the second World War, as well as the challenges that face us in our moment. I only ask that you keep yourself in a feeling of protection and love before you read it; it's intense. There are some points of contention between Tradowsky and what Anne says on this episode; I find them helpful to think about. WHAT OTHER AEWCH EPISODE YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO? I did an episode of the show with my best friend, Jeb Havens:AEWCH 161 and I'd say that's the best outline of a spiritual friendship I can offer. WHAT SHOULD YOU LOOK INTO FURTHER? Camphill Communities - developed by Alfred Bergel's friend, Karl K\u00f6nig, with guidance and inspiration from Rudolf Steiner - are among the most beautiful contributions of esoteric christianity to our world today. The idea of Camphill is that people with \"disabilities\" are whole people. To put it in the words of Rudolf Steiner in 1924: \"The only possible grounds we can have for speaking of the normality or abnormality of the child's life of soul, or indeed the life of soul of any human being, is that we have in mind something that is normal in the sense of being average. At present there is really no other criterion. That is why the conclusions people come to are so very confused. When they have in this way ascertained the existence of 'abnormality,' they begin to do - heaven knows what - believing they are thereby helping to get rid of the abnormality, while all the time they are driving out a fragment of genius.\" Friends, In the midst of 2022, so many of us are seeking peace and meaning. So here's my series on one meaning-rich tradition and religious stream: Christianity. But this will be a different sort of Christianity: occult and esoteric Christianity. Some of it might look familiar. Some might seem absolutely bizarre. All of it, I hope will stir a feeling of warmth and depth of meaning for you, whether you feel any affinity with Christianity or the occult. The first episode in the series was AEWCH 181, featuring Rev. Patrick Kennedy from the Christian Community - a religious tradition informed by occultism. So... how is esoteric Christianity used? Or put differently, how does it work into and through our being and then act on the world? How can we form a new picture of reality out of it and proceed into thinking, feeling, and willing a new one into being? To discuss this, I spent some time in rural Ireland with spiritual teacher and writer Lisa Romero. Lisa last appeared on the show three years ago on AEWCH 68 to discuss the occult picture of sex and sexuality. It was a profound conversation for me, but it barely approaches this one in terms of depth and breadth. We talk about Christianity at work in us, around us, and in the world. We discuss why esoteric symbols are used (why, for instance, is a star shape important and not just arbitrary?). And we discuss so much more. This is one of my very favorite episodes, I'm so happy to share it with you. SHOW NOTES WHATBOOKYOUSHOULDREAD?If you'd like to spend some time with one of the great Christian mystics, a good place to start is The Interior Castleby St. Teresa of Avila. WHATOTHERAEWCHEPISODEYOUSHOULDLISTENTO?For another look at forgiveness and understanding, a great episode is AEWCH162withDr.GwenAdshead, who works with violent offenders and seeks to greet them with compassion. It's a powerful episode and Gwen's work is so utterly moving to me. WHATSHOULDYOULOOKINTOFURTHER?Lisa mentions St. John of the Cross, and there's a great series of episodes about him on the podcast Turning To The Mystics. There's so much there and so many episodes, so I suggest you start with this one. Against Everyone With Conner Habib is funded exclusively by listeners like you. Do you find value in this show? If so, support the podcast. SUPPORT THIS PODCAST viaPatreon Friends, Now in the midst of 2022, so many of us are seeking peace and meaning. But one of the primary sources of meaning, religion, can feel outdated or even cruel and anti-peace if judged by its historical pathways of violence. Yet many of us find the longing to connect with religious traditions that fascinated us, comforted us, or even just interested us at other points in our lives. So I'm going to spend the next few episodes connecting us with one religious stream: Christianity. But this will be a different sort of Christianity: occult and esoteric Christianity. Some of it might look familiar. Some might seem absolutely bizarre. All of it, I hope will stir a feeling of warmth and depth of meaning for you, whether you feel any affinity with Christianity or the occult. The aim is to discuss how to revitalize the spirit of any endeavor or phenomenon - religion, the natural world, technology, social justice, history, and politics - with the profound mystery secrets of Christianity. The main headquarters, so to speak, of this exploration, will be the approach to the world developed by late 18th/early 19th Century philosopher/spiritual teacher/scientist/artist Rudolf Steiner, called anthroposophy. First up in the series is Reverend Patrick Kennedy, who along with Rev. Jonah Evans, hosts one of my favorite podcasts, The Light In Everything. Patrick is a reverend in The Christian Community, the gathering of Christians in service and ritual informed by Rudolf Steiner's guidance and Rosicrucianism. He's extremely thoughtful, warm, and his voice is a beautiful light in the world. SHOW NOTES WHATBOOKYOUSHOULDREAD?One of the best books on Christianity seen from an esoteric point of view is Wilt Thou Be Made Whole: Healings in the Gospels by Georg K\u00fchlewind. It's a beautiful book that will both lead you through all the instances of healing in the Bible, and also lead you into the experience of them through meditation and contemplation. WHATOTHERAEWCHEPISODEYOUSHOULDLISTENTO?In this series, I'll be focusing mostly on esoteric Christianity inspired by anthroposophy and the work of Rudolf Steiner. But there are other valuable and potent esoteric Christianity streams that deserve everyone's attentiveness. One can be found in the work of Daskalos and the Researchers of Truth, which I go into in-depth on AEWCH 67 with one of Daskalos's students, Daniel Joseph. WHATSHOULDYOULOOKINTOFURTHER?Well, the Christian Community, of course! One of the best ways to do that is to see if there's a service near youand then attend one. Nothing will be expected of you, no one will try to get you \"in\" to the group. You'll just encounter what all encounter: the baseline of the service is always the same; the Act of Consecration of Man. And then some talking afterward.

Friends, I sometimes think about the concept of world change, of political and economic change is getting ahead of ourselves. Why? Because we haven't even begun to consider ourselves, consider what it means to be human, what thought is, what thinking is, and what consciousness is. If we can't hold a single thought, how can we create new structures for us to live in and dissolve the old?And it's not helpful that everyone, from capitalists to communists to anarchists, generally think that questions of consciousness are fine to leap past and into creating theoretical abstractions to change the world. Everything - everything - is tethered to the experience of thought and thinking.Don't think so? Well, where did that thought come from? Have a theory about how thinking and thought is not the groundswell of existence? Well, where did that come from? Even the thought that consciousness is an illusion comes from thinking, of course. So there's no way to get outside of thinking. My idea has been: let's start building from that, let's get into the experience of consciousness and let our political, economic, and cultural work come from there. I wanted to talk about this, and I wanted to talk about it early in this new year of incredible opportunity and trouble. So I asked therapist and author Michael Lipson on the show. Michael is the author of Stairway of Surprise: Six Steps to a Creative Life and Group Meditation. For nearly a decade, he worked with children with HIV and AIDS in New York City. Now he has his own practice and runs group meditation meetings each week via michaellipson.org. We discuss so much on this episode, and I'm so excited to share it with you. ON THIS EPISODE The way belief in materialism destroys freedom Why solipsism is correct, but unrefined Our everyday knowledge as an obstacle to seeing things as they are Dissolving materialism is a spiritual path That time I saw the pizza-being (Um, what?) - but don't take my word for it! The difference between spiritual substance and spiritual state How to redeem the spiritual over Zoom Why absorption matters How psychoanalysis without spirituality necessitates law, and how its focus on childhood is a description of karma Emily Dickinson wrote, \"A letter always feels to me like immortality because it is the mind alone without corporeal friend. Indebted in our talk to attitude and accent, there seems a spectral power in thought that walks alone.\" Here's more on her letters. One of my first conversations at the top of the global crisis - and consequently, one of the first I did remotely - was with writer and theorist Mark O'Connell on AEWCH 105 about apocalypse, of course. You can learn more about David Spangler's work of incarnational spirituality and work with elemental beings via his organization, The Lorian Association. I talk about the problem of certainty in 2021 on AEWCH 136 and about nothingness on AEWCH 116 with Are Thoressen. \"Who pours out like a spring, knowing knows him: and leads him delighted through the bright creation, that often ends with the start, and begins with the end.\" - Rainer Maria Rilke Here's Rudolf Steiner's quote on faithfulness:\"Let your loyalty to another human being come about in this way: there will be moments \u2014 quickly passing by \u2014 when he will seem to you filled and illumined by the true, primal image of his spirit. Then can come, yes, will come, long stretches of time when your fellow-being seems clouded, even darkened. But learn at these times to say to yourself: The spirit will strengthen me; I will remember the true, unchanging image that I once saw. Nothing at all \u2014 neither deception nor disguise \u2014 can take it away from me.Struggle again and again for the true picture that you saw. The struggle itself is your faithfulness. And in those efforts to be faithful and to trust, a human being will come close to another as if with an angel's power of protection.\" (by the way, I had Duncan Trussell read this waaaay back on AEWCH 16!) Friends, Is it enough to just think new thoughts to change the world? Is it a matter of having the right knowledge, the right perspective, the right information? The answer may seem unfortunate given the urgency of our times: Absolutely not. What we need instead is to actually change our thinking. That's a completely different task, and one that's much more difficult. But it's also much more gratifying and powerful and transformative. I knew that I'd have to talk to someone about this on the show, and I knew that one of the most capable and thinking-filled people to talk about this with was Scott Eliiot Hicks. Scott is one of a small group of teachers worldwide who have used Rudolf Steiner's book The Philosophy of Freedom (also known as Intuitive Thinking As A Spiritual Path) as it was intended - that is, as a living guide through occult development.What happens on this path is that you start to get in touch with not just your thoughts, but the actual direction, flow, and livingness of thinking. Scott's books are dense and dizzying and totally worth the journey. They include The Resurrection of Thinking: Steiner's Anthroposophy & the Postmodernism of Badiou, Deleuze, Derrida & Levinas(available through bookshop.org - you can see how this title would appeal to me!), and two books only available via Amazon, Earthly, Transcendental, & Spiritual Logic: From Husserl's Phenomenology to Steiner's Anthroposophy and his novel The Shattering Light of Stars. We go deep on this episode, and I'm so excited to share it with you. ON THIS EPISODE Why thought is not enough and we must change thinking Being stuck in a \"spiritual eggshell\" or \"shell hell\" after death The unappealing-ness of doing spiritual work and why we can/should overcome it Why do some spiritual events and encounters show up for some people out of nowhere? The darker spirits we're all full of Why clairvoyance is often just a disguise for materialism How to see what objects really are if they're not material Why you should forgive yourself when you move out of your spiritual developments Why spiritual experiences are difficult to hold in memory Language as boom tube - and how a new language arises when you are spoken by the spiritual world Sex as an occult encounter and why sex is so \"dark\" Why love cannot exist without the antichrist The need for forming constellations of spiritual seekers I talked a bit about the difference between thinking and thought way back on AEWCH 20 with rogue anthropologist David Shorter. And I discuss anthroposophy directly on AEWCH 116 with Are Thoresen and AEWCH 68 with Lisa Romero. For more on the spiritual double, check out the booklist for this episode. I love Scott's expression of language creating \"positive voids\" like boom tubes in DC Comics. In spite of giving him a hard time on this ep, I like Jacques Lacan quite a bit, and discuss his work and psychoanalysis in general with Todd McGowan on AEWCH 47. Yeshayahu Ben-Aharon's work comes up a lot on this episode. I suggest you look into his work, which centers around what he calls \"cognitive yoga.\" Friends, How does evil - created by culture and our own deeds - affect us? You've heard me discuss spiritual topics on the show before, but I don't think I've ever pulled you all into the deep end with me like this, nor steered the conversation towards the topic of, well, demons. And not the metaphorical kind. Demons as actual entities - as well as why we need to talk about spiritual beings asbeings - and how they affect our health and our lives. My guest, Are Thoresen is a a Christian occultist, author, veterinarian, and acupuncturist who lives in Norway. His writing details (sometimes in the same book) his decades-long career in healing as well as his own spiritual experiences, encounters, and events. Unlike other episodes, I let myself get lost a bit in this one, because Are and I have some overlapping spiritual experiences, and I don't want to halt the conversational pathwork to explain everything. To that end, I give some guidance with the terms we use (elementals, Lucifer/Ahriman, etc) at the top of the show. We start off with evil and we end with the Nothingness of the Christ. In between, there are dinosaurs, translocating demons, sick pets, a planet made of bad deeds, and more. This is a wide-ranging episode that has its own life. If it knocks you over, that's okay. Hit those fifteen-seconds-back buttons and listen through again. ON THIS EPISODE The lure of evil when we talk about it, and the protection of the heart healing Why Are considers the fact that he had coronavirus a blessing How negative feelings and thoughts echo up into the cosmos The 8th Sphere The Northern Way, Southern Way, and Middle Way of initiation "}
