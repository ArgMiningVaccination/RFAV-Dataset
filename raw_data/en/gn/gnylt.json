An Ecological Approach to Language Renewal 301Mark FettesContributors 319 6iv Teaching Indigenous LanguagesIntroduction Teaching Indigenous Languages contains a selection of papers presentedat the Fourth Annual Stabilizing Indigenous Languages Symposium \"SharingEffective Language Renewal Practices\" held at Northern Arizona University(NAU) on May 1, 2, and 3, 1997. This conference brought together nearly threehundred indigenous language experts, teachers, and community activists to shareinformation on how indigenous languages can best be taught at home and atschool. The goals of the fourth symposium were to:To bring together American Indian language educators and activiststo share ideas and experiences on how to effectively teach Ameri-can Indian languages in and out of the classroom.To provide a forum for the exchange of scholarly research on teach-ing American Indian languages.To disseminate though a monograph recent research and thinkingon best practices to promote, preserve, and protect American Indianlanguages.There is a pressing need for sharing successful practices since despite the pas-sage of tribal language policies and the 1990 Native American Languages Act,fewer and fewer children are speaking American Indian languages. While thelegal right to maintain tribal languages has been obtained, the effective rightstill has yet to be achieved. More needs to be done to disseminate effectivenative language teaching methods and materials. For example, Dr. RichardLittlebear, participant in all four symposia, noted that the ability to speak anIndian language is often incorrectly seen as all that is needed to teach the lan-guage effectively in schools.The first symposium held in November 1994 at NAU featured some theleading figures in the field of minority language preservation. The second sym-posium held in May 1995 at NAU also included many tribal educators fromthroughout Arizona. The third symposium was held in Anchorage, Alaska, inFebruary 1996 and brought together mostly Alaskan Native educators. The pro-ceedings of the first two symposia were collected and edited by Dr. Gina Cantoniand published in 1996 under the title Stabilizing Indigenous Languages.The importance of maintaining and renewing indigenous languagesI have written on this subject of maintaining and renewing indigenous lan-guages before (see e.g., Reyhner, 1990, 1992, 1995, 1996; Reyhner & Tennant,1995), but the recent work of Dr. Evangline Parsons Yazzie and Dr. RichardLittlebear, who both spoke at the fourth symposium, has crystallized for me thecentrality of this effort for the survival of indigenous peoples. For her doctoral 7 Teaching Indigenous Languagesdissertation, Parsons Yazzie (1995)interviewed Navajo elders about their lan-guage. Their responses included the following:Truly, it is through our language that safety is reachedJ. Manybeads (p. 2) Older people who speak only N a v a j o are alone . ..E. Manybeads (p. 4)When learning Navajo, children are just learning nouns without verbsor without the whole sentence, because of it children don't think toodeep, their minds cannot grasp difficult concepts... Culture can onlybe taught in Navajo; without language, knowledge cannot be transmit-ted.E. Guy (p. 2)Another infomant said,You are asking questions about the reasons that we are moving outof our language, I know the reason. The television is robbing our chil-dren of language...It is not only at school that there are teachings, teachings are aroundus and from us there are also teachings. Our children should not sitaround the television. Those who are mothers and fathers should haveheld their children close to themselves and taught them well, then ourgrandchildren would have picked up our language. (p. 135)Parsons Yazzie found in her research that, \"Elder Navajos want to pass ontheir knowledge and wisdom to the younger generation. Originally, this was theolder people's responsibility. Today the younger generation does not know thelanguage and is unable to accept the words of wisdom\" (1995, p. 1).She contin-ues, \"The use of the native tongue is like therapy, specific native words expresslove and caring... Knowing the language presents one with a strong self-iden-tity, a culture with which to identify, and a sense of wellness\" (1995, p. 3).Dr. Littlebear(1994)quotes Northern Cheyenne elders expressing similarthoughts:It's scary the way we're losing our Cheyenne language.Cheyenne language is us; it is who we are; we talk it, we live it. We areit and it is us.How much does the Cheyenne language weigh? How much does theCheyenne language cost? How much room does the Cheyenne languageoccupy? How does the Cheyenne language feel, taste, or smell? Whatdoes it look like? If the Cheyenne language can be put into those quan-8vi Teaching Indigenous Languagestifiable terms, then the more prevalent white society may understandthe total impact of what it means to be losing the Cheyenne language.But we will never be able to weigh the Cheyenne language.Cheyennes who are coming toward us are being denied by us the rightto acquire that central aspect of what it means to be Cheyenne becausewe are not teaching them to talk Cheyenne. When they reach us, whenthey are born, they are going to be relegated to being mere husks, emptyshells. They are going to look Cheyenne, have Cheyenne parents butthey won't have the language which is going to make them truly Chey-enne.The voices of these Navajo and Northern Cheyenne elders add to the sense ofurgency surrounding the issue of maintaining and renewing native languages.The purpose of this collection of 25 papers is to disseminate information aboutwhat is being done so that we can all be more knowledgable in our efforts tokeep indigenous languages and cultures alive and well. The papers are dividedinto six categories: tribal and school roles, teaching students, teacher educa-tion, curriculum and materials development, language attitudes and promotion,and a summing up of thoughts about indigenous language stabilization. A briefsummary of each paper is given below by category.Tribal and school rolesThe first two papers describe some of the roles that schools and tribes canplay in promoting the use of indigenous languages. In \"Keeping Minority Lan-guages Alive: The School's Responsibility,\" NAU regents professor GinaCantoni discusses the need for systematic and school-wide support of the useof indigenous languages among those who learn them at home and of appropri-ate instruction in the same languages for those who do not. It focuses on therelationship of indigenous language curriculum with the entire school's officialand hidden curricula. In \"A Tribal Approach to Language and Literacy Devel-opment,\" Arizona State University Center for Indian Education DirectorOctaviana V. Trujillo gives an overview of the efforts of her Pascua Yaqui Tribeto develop a tribal response to the language development needs of its people.She examines the tribe's effort to assume responsibility for coordinating anddirecting all programs and activities initiated by its own as well as other publiceducation agencies to meet the long range needs and interests of the tribal com-munity. It also examines the significance of language usage both on educa-tional achievement as well as in the larger cultural milieu in which tribal mem-bers live. A historical perspective traces the efforts to better understand theconceptual underpinnings of current programs and the tribal planning under-way to expand those efforts. Her case study approach conveys the story of thePascua Yaqui Tribe in order to focus on universal variables and constraints thatare relevant to the language development of all indigenous groups. vii Teaching Indigenous LanguagesTeaching studentsThe next group of papers describe various efforts to teach indigenous lan-guages. The first paper, \"Going Beyond Words: The Arapaho Immersion Pro-gram\" by Steve Greymorning of the University of Montana describes theArapaho language immersion program on the Wind River Reservation in Wyo-ming. He examines the growth and development of the Arapaho language im-mersion program and discusses the language revitalization strategies and lev-els of success that the Arapaho Language Lodge staff have achieved as theyhave worked to establish a new generation of Arapaho speaking children.Veronica Carpenter's \"Teaching Children to 'Unlearn' the Sounds of En-glish\" discusses the incorporation of linguistics into an American Indian lan-guage program. Rather than focusing on teaching any particular indigenouslanguage or dialect, she concentrates on teaching children and adults to recog-nize how the sounds of the English language interfere with learning the correctpronunciation of tribal languages.Alice Taff's \"Learning Ancestral Languages by Telephone\" is a progressreport on a group of adults who have been connecting by phone to learn tospeak Deg Xinag, the language of the Deg Hit' an (Ingalik Athabaskan). A one-credit distance delivery class was organized because the number of Deg Xinagspeakers, all elders, is less than twenty and the learners, young adults, are toodispersed to get together face-to-face.In \"Coyote as Reading Teacher: Oral Tradition in the Classroom,\" ArmandoHeredia and Norbert Francis describe how legends, myths, folk tales, and sto-ries have long been an important aspect of the history and culture of indigenouspeople and can be used as vehicles to teach historical events, ethics, and valuesto the young and old.\"Revernacularizing Classical Nahuatl Through Danza (Dance) Azteca-Chichimeca\" relates how traditional Danza Azteca-Chichimeca can be used forthe intergenerational re-vernacularization of an indigenous language. The ef-forts of several Danza groups in Los Angeles, California, to bring back Classi-cal Nahuatl into daily use are described.In \"The KinderApache Song and Dance Project,\" Trevor Shanklin, CarlaPaciotto, and Greg Prater report how using Apache song and dance in a kinder-garten classroom helped students gain knowledge of and pride in their cultureand begin to sing spontaneously the songs they were taught. In addition, theproject reinforced the image of the school as a focal point of the community.Teacher educationThe first paper in this third section describes the American Indian Lan-guage Development Institute and the second paper describes the professionaltraining needed by indigenous language teachers. In considering what can bedone to reverse language shift, many look to schools as primary resources. Butschool-based language renewal programs have been criticized for transferringresponsibility for mother tongue transmission away from its necessary domainthe family. In \"School-Community-University Collaborations: The Americanviii Teaching Indigenous LanguagesIndian Language Development Institute AILDI]\" Teresa McCarty, AkiraYamamoto, Lucille Watahomigie, and Ofelia Zepeda present one model forconnecting school, community, and university resources to strengthen indig-enous languages. AILDI has raised consciousness about the linguistic and cul-tural stakes at risk, facilitated the development of indigenous literatures and acadre of native-speaking teachers, and influenced federal policy through agrassroots network of indigenous language advocates. The authors look at theprogram's development, provide recommendations for developing similar in-stitutes, and suggest specific strategies for strengthening indigenous languagesin the contexts of community, home, and school. AILDI is currently held everysummer at the University of Arizona in Tucson.A profession has a defined area of competence, an organized and impor-tant body of knowledge, identification as a career field, controlled access forcompetent individuals, principles and practices supported by research, profes-sionals involved in academic programs, a program of continuing education,and graduates who exercise independent judgment. Joyce A. Silverthorne's paper\"Language Preservation and Human Resources Development\" takes each ofthese areas in turn and examines them for indigenous languages teachers withthe view of documenting that they are in a profession worthy of recognitionand certification by states and tribes.Curriculum and materials developmentThe first two papers in the fourth section describe the development of anApache language textbook. The first paper by Willem de Reuse describes theexperience from a linguists point of view while the second paper by BernadetteAdley-SantaMaria reflects on the same effort from the Apache speakers pointof view. De Reuse's paper \"Issues in Language Textbook Development: TheCase of Western Apache\" describes two experimental language learning text-books developed in collaboration with Apache speaking scholars from the SanCarlos and White Mountain reservations. One was written in the grammar-translation tradition and modeled after Wilson's Conversational Navajo Work-book and Zepeda's Papago Grammar. The other text was a guide to teachingApache with the Total Physical Response (TPR) method. Finally, de Reusecalls for a dialogue between linguists and native experts to decide how muchlinguistic terminology can be handled in each particular curriculum.Adley-SantaMaria's \"White Mountain Apache Language: Issues in Lan-guage Shift, Textbook Development, and Native Speaker-University Collabo-ration\" is an overview of topics covered during two presentations at the FourthAnnual Stabilizing Indigenous Languages Symposium from the perspective ofa native speaker of Apache. She describes her master's thesis on White Moun-tain Apache language shift, including her recommendations for further researchstudies on the White Mountain Apache language, and comments on her workwith de Reuse on an Apache language textbook.\"Science Explorers Translation Project\" by Dolores Jacobs describes a pi-lot project of Los Alamos National Laboratory to translate science educationix Nt Teaching Indigenous Languagescurriculum developed by Argonne National Laboratory into Navajo. In \"Incor-porating Technology into a Hawaiian Language Curriculum,\" MakalapuaKa' awa and Emily Hawkins describe Hawaiian language courses developed atthe University of Hawaii at Manoa that incorporate computer technology in theteaching of Hawaiian. The last contribution to this section titled \"It Really Works:Cultural Communication Proficiency,\" edited by Ruth Bennett, is an exampleof an actual indigenous language teaching guide.Language attitudes and promotionThe fifth section contains four papers centered around peoples attitudestowards indigenous languages. The first paper \"Marketing the Maori tribes in NewZealand. He describes the need to \"market\" indigenous languages so that theycan hold their own against English. He relates how despite the fact that theNew Zealand Government currently spends millions of dollars to teach Maoriin preschool language nests, Maori total immersion primary schools, and else-where, its language policies are not likely to succeed because it has failed topromoted Maori among Maori and non-Maori to the extent that the languagehas a sufficiently good image. The results of a market research study and thepromotion of the 1995 Maori Language Year indicate that the passive toleranceof the Maori language by New Zealanders in contemporary New Zealand soci-ety will allow a more active and explicit promotion of Maori.\"Tuning in to Navajo: The Role of Radio in Native Language Maintenance\"by Leighton C. Peterson discusses the realities of radio in indigenous languagemaintenance with a case study of KTNN, a Navajo language radio station. Therelationship between audience, language, and programming is analyzed, andmore effective uses of radio are suggested.In \"The Wordpath Show\" Alice Anderton describes the efforts of the non-profit Intertribal Wordpath Society to promote the teaching, status, awareness,and use of Oklahoma Indian languages. The Society produces Wordpath, aweekly 30 minute public access television show about Oklahoma Indian lan-guages and the people who are teaching and preserving them.\"The Echota Cherokee Language: Current Use and Opinions About Re-vival\" by Stacye Hathorn describes the efforts of the Echota Cherokee Tribeand Auburn University to establish a database on tribal language resources andattitudes. A survey was designed to gather information on Native Americanlanguage knowledge, language attitudes, and potential language use in order tolay the groundwork for the language revitalization efforts. The ultimate goal ofEchota leaders is to offer instruction in the Cherokee language through theAlabama public school system. In \"An Initial Exploration of the Navajo Nation'sLanguage and Culture Initiative,\" Ann Batchelder and Sherry Markel describethe results of a survey of attitudes about the implementation of the NavajoTribe's mandate to teach Navajo language and culture in all schools in the Na-vajo Nation. The survey indicated there was widespread support for teaching .2 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesNavajo language and culture in schools and that they should be infused through-out the curriculum.Summing upThe last section contains five papers. The first paper by Dawn Stiles, anadult educator for the Cocopah Tribe in Southwestern Arizona, compares Cree,Hualapai, Maori, and Hawaiian indigenous language programs currently in ex-istence and describes common components and problems of implementation inorder to help provide guidance for other indigenous groups looking to starttheir own language revitalization programs. Stiles concludes that successfulprograms need to link language and culture, need written teaching materials,and need community support and parental involvement and that successful pro-grams can fight gang activity, alcohol and drug abuse, and a high dropout ratesin indigenous communities.Scott Palmer in \"Language of Work: The Critical Link Between EconomicChange and Language Shift\" theorizes that there has been a widespread changein the language of work and that this quite possibly is a common cause of muchof the indigenous language shift that is becoming increasingly noticeable in theTwentieth Century. This language-of-work hypothesis is summarized as a causalchain leading from a shift in the structure of work to a shift in language of thehome. Palmer concludes that communities in which parents train their childrenfor life in an indigenous language dominated work force are less likely to expe-rience language shift in the home.Robert St. Clair in \"The Invisible Doors Between Cultures\" discusses theconcept of cultural awareness within the context of three recent cultural changesthat have taken place since the turn of the century in America: the constructionof the consumer culture, the urbanization of America, and the marketing ofAmerica. Those who are not aware of these changes risk the chance of becom-ing overwhelmed by them, and for them, the doors between their culture andthe business cultures of America remain invisible. However, awareness on thepart of indigenous peoples of the surrounding dominant cultures and these\"doors\" can help them insulate themselves from linguistic and cultural loss.Barbara Burnaby's \"Personal Thoughts on Indigenous Language Stabili-zation\" describes the author's personal, intuitive reflections on the preserva-tion and stabilization of indigenous languages in North America based on herextensive experience with Canadian First Nations' language maintenance andrenewal efforts. She explores the complications that conflicting goals and agen-das bring to the development of community control, the recruiting of humanresources and motivating community action, and the small size of many indig-enous language communities. She argues that we need to develop the rightstrategies for different size language communities and to pay attention to theamount and variety of language use actually going on in communities. Sheconcludes that local priorities must be respected; local leadership must be fos-tered; the forces that create negativity must be met with healing; and recentaccomplishments must be appreciated.-4, 3 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesFinally, in \"Stabilizing What? An Ecological Approach to Language Re-newal,\" Mark Fettes develops a speaker-centered view of language as an alter-native to the monolithic, decontextualized abstractions favored by modern lin-guistics. Successful language renewal requires the interweaving of critical lit-eracy in the dominant language with local knowledge and living relationshipsexpressed through the local language. The stabilization of indigenous languagesforms part of a broader movement to reestablish societies on a human scale thatare in balance with nature.The papers presented here give a sample of the many different efforts cur-rently being made worldwide to keep the world's indigenous languages alive inthe belief that by sharing these experiences language experts, activists, andteachers can develop more effective indigenous language programs for theircommunities. I want to thank all the presenters and attendees at the FourthAnnual Stabilizing Indigenous Languages Symposium who made the confer-ence a success as well as the staff of the Center for Excellence in Education'sDivision of Educational Services and NAU's du Bois Conference Center fortheir help.Jon ReyhnerNorthern Arizona Richard (Ve'kesohnestooe).

Cantoni This paper discusses the need for systematic school-wide supportof the use of indigenous languages among those who learn them athome and of appropriate instruction in the same languages for thosewho do not. The paper does not deal with native language teachingand learning per se, for that is best done by members of the group whoown the language and advocate its maintenance; it focuses instead onthe relationship of this instructional component with the entire schooland its official and hidden curricula. Many Native parents expect the schools, which in the past had contributedto the eradication of their tribal languages, to help maintain or restore theselanguages. Can the schools do it? It depends. Keeping minority languages aliverequires more than the addition of a native language component to the existingcurriculum; it requires a pervasive change in the entire school system.Generally speaking, schools have been increasingly successful in meetingthe official curricular goals established for Native students: English proficiencyand academic competence. What should be faced now is the hiddenassimilationist curriculum that brings to mind the days when children had theirmouths washed out with soap for speaking their own language. It is the entireschool's responsibility to identify the beliefs and attitudes that underlie themarginalization of the students' languages and cultures. These include the mis-conception that learning more than one language could retard a child's devel-opment and cause confusion and the perception that English is more valuablethan an indigenous language.American schools are not alone in having contributed to the decline ofhome languages. Remembering the frustration they had suffered in school be-cause they could not understand the teacher's language, parents all over theworld have tried to protect their children from a similar ordeal. Instead of teach-ing them the language of their home, they made the effort and sacrifice of usingonly the language of the school. The Native families who decided to speak onlyEnglish around their children in hopes of facilitating their academic progresshave succeeded, in most instances, in raising a generation of monolingual speak-ers of English. They have, unknowingly and unintentionally, deprived theirchildren of the cognitive advantages of bilingualism. Moreover, they have be-come unable to transmit cultural knowledge that has no equivalent in the world-view and language of outsiders. The children of these families have been de-prived of their rightful linguistic and cultural heritage.15 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThe many parents who made this kind of decision had their children's well-being at heart and are not to blame for the societal attitudes of their time. Theseparents are now turning to the schools for help and leadership in keeping homelanguages alive. A school-wide initiative in support of Native language mainte-nance must include the following components: dissemination of information,attitudinal change, and sustained action.Cognitive advantages of bilingualismMastery of more than one linguistic code results in a special kind of cogni-tive flexibility, such as the awareness that the same thought can be expressed inmore than one way and some words and expressions have no exact equivalentin another language. These abilities relate to an early realization that a symbolis not the same as the item it refers to; for example, the words \"dog,\" \"chien,\"and \"perro\" all refer to the same kind of animal, but they are not the animalitself.Unfortunately, the cognitive abilities related to the mastery of more thanone language are not covered by most of the tests used to measure academicachievement or predict academic success. We know that language minority stu-dents have experienced difficulties in school and have performed less well thantheir monolingual peers on various oral and written tests. In the early part ofthis century researchers came to the conclusion that bilingualism caused cogni-tive problems and language handicaps. Many schools made serious efforts torepress the children's use of their home language, believing that it created aca-demic difficulties and interfered with their learning of English.The phenomenon is a familiar one in the United States. It is the story ofcountless American immigrant and native children and adults who have losttheir ethnic languages in the process of becoming linguistically assimilatedinto the English-speaking world of school and society. Few American-born chil-dren of immigrant parents are fully proficient in their ethnic language, even if itwas the only language they spoke when they first entered school. Once thesechildren learn English, they tend not to maintain or develop the language spo-ken at home, even if it is the only one their parents know. This has been thestory of past immigrant groups, and it is the story of the present ones, but theprocess is taking place much more rapidly today as indigenous communitiesbecome less physically isolated and more exposed to television and other massmedia.A negative view of bilingualism persists among many educators and mem-bers of the general public. Yet, as early as 1962, Peal and Lambert came todifferent conclusions. A rigorous comparison of monolingual and bilingual chil-dren showed that the bilinguals had a cognitive advantage. The bilinguals' ex-periences with two languages seemed to result in mental flexibility, greaterskill at forming concepts, and a more diversified set of mental abilities. Bycontrast, the monolinguals appeared to have rather unitary cognitive structures,which restricted their problem-solving ability. Many subsequent studies with Teaching Indigenous Languagesbilingual children have substantiated have reported that bilingualism may have a posi-tive effect on general cognitive abilities as measured by nonverbal intelligencetests. The children in these later studies were adding a second language at nodetriment to their first (Lambert, 1975). In conclusion, research on the aca-demic, linguistic, and cognitive effects of bilingualism indicates that an addi-tive development of oral and written second language has no adverse effectsand actually seems to provide important metalinguistic, academic, and intel-lectual benefits. These conclusions are confirmed by rigorous and extensivestudies by Cummins (1989), Ramirez (1991), Collier (1992), Lindholm andAclan (1991) and many others.For those who worry that teaching the home language may interfere withthe development of English skills, there is abundant evidence that the oppositeoccurs (Cummins, 1987). Instruction that promotes proficiency in one's firstlanguage (L1) also promotes proficiency in the second language (L2), providedthere is an adequate amount of exposure to L2 and motivation to learn it. Bothlanguages are manifestations of a common underlying proficiency (CUP). TheCUP model indicates that concepts and abilities acquired through L1 transferto L2. For example, bilingual education for Spanish-speaking minorities learn-ing English as a second language leads to higher abilities in both languages,even with limited direct instruction in English (Cummins & Swain, 1986). Astudent who has mastered a concept or skill in one language does not need torelearn it in his second language; all he needs is to learn new words and struc-tures. These conclusions apply to the study of subjects such as algebra or his-tory as well as to the acquisition of literacy.According to Heath (1986, p. 144), \"For all children, academic successdepends less on the specific language they know than on the ways of using thelanguage they know.\" The school can promote academic and vocational suc-cess for all children regardless of their first-language background by providingthe greatest possible range of oral and written language uses. A wide range ofpossible language uses can be compared to a rich wardrobe to fit all occasions.One does not usually dress in the same kind of clothes for a wedding and for afootball game, for winter and for summer. Instead of throwing away wool socksand fuzzy earmuffs because summer is here, one stores them for use when theweather turns cold again. Dressing appropriately for a variety of occasions andneeds requires a certain amount of diversity in our wardrobe so that we canmake suitable choices, just as a rich variety of linguistic tools allows us toselect the language and style that is most likely to achieve the desired results ina given situation at a particular time.Attitudinal changeAlthough minority children are no longer subjected to corporal punish-ment for using their home language, they are often the target of other, moresubtle forms of rejection and ostracism on the part of teachers, administrators,3 I. Teaching Indigenous Languages and peers. That the acquisition of more than one langauge is an asset and not ahandicap is well known to scholars (Saunders, 1988); however, fears of confu-sion and other problems persist in many families, especially when one of thelanguages (e.g., English) has more prestige than the other (e.g., Navajo) withina community. When we talk about prestige, we are dealing with attitudes, andthese are much harder to correct than misconceptions.A study of language shift among language-minority children in the UnitedStates indicates that the loss of primary languages is a national phenomenon,which can be very costly not only to the families and communities that aredirectly involved, but to society as a whole (Fillmore, 1991). It is not easy toexplain or understand why these children are dropping their home language asthey learn English, since second-language learning does not necessarily resultin the loss of the primary language. However, most language-minority childrenencounter powerful pressures for assimilation and conformity to the norms ofthe mainstream American youth culture even before they enter school. Theybegin to see themselves as different in language, appearance, and behavior, andthey come to regard these differences as undesirable because they impede theireasy participation in the society around them. If they want to be accepted, theyhave to learn English, because others are not going to learn their language.English is the high-status prestige language in the United States and Canada (asis Spanish in most of Latin America), and although young children do not yetcare about prestige and status, they do need belonging and acceptance. As theylearn the prestige language, they stop using their primary language. If the par-ents or grandparents have not yet mastered English, what is lost is the vehiclefor imparting values to the next generation, enabling the children to become thekind of men and women their families want them to be.Parsons Yazzie (1995) documented this kind of situation on the NavajoReservation. She identified ten children from Rocky Ridge Boarding Schoolwhose scores on the Window Rock Oral Language Test (WROLT) indicatedthat their fluency in Navajo was very limited or nonexistent. The children weresurrounded by an extended family that used Navajo routinely; some of the el-ders did not even know English. The adults considered Navajo a very impor-tant source of identity, strength, and sacredness, and they viewed the loss oftheir language as leading to social dysfunction, erosion of identity and beliefs,disappearance of sacred ceremonies, and abandonment of traditional teachings.Being a native and longtime resident of the area, Parsons Yazzie was ableto conduct a series of unobtrusive observations in settings such as trading posts,homes, chapter houses, and waiting rooms. She heard a lot of Navajo spokenall around her but noted that when family groups consisting of adults (parents,grandparents, aunts, and uncles) initiated a conversation in Navajo with a child,the child responded in English. Sometimes this would mark the end of the ex-change; sometimes the code-switching pattern would continue. Yazzie did notwitness any attempt on the adults' part to ask or encourage the child to useNavajo. She states, \"It appeared...that the child was the one in each case whodictated what language was spoken,\" and the language was English (1995, p.is 4 Teaching Indigenous Languages38). This is a startling conclusion in view of the parents' overt assertions oftheir allegiance to Navajo and their awareness of the moral and social conse-quences of its neglect.The tragic results of the intergenerational breakdown in communicationhave been documented not only in the case of Native American groups, butalso in the case of Hispanic, Asian, and other minority groups where juvenilegang behavior and drug abuse are increasing. What should or can be done aboutit is still poorly understood, but there is no doubt that language minority chil-dren and their families are paying a very high price for admission into Ameri-can society.Children are sensitive to social approval or disapproval long before theyenter school. They are surrounded by messages that promote the majority cul-ture and its language and ignore all others, even if they do not explicitly down-grade them. Overt put-downs are most likely to come from older siblings whoare ashamed of their own ethnicity. Having been ridiculed and called deroga-tory nicknames, they inflict the same treatment on others. If the school candevelop better attitudes among its students, the benefits may filter down to thepreschoolers and to children yet to be born.The following recommendations were made at the Symposia on Stabiliz-ing Indigenous Languages held at Northern Arizona University in 1994 and1995 (Cantoni, 1996):All educators must show greater respect and appreciation for thecultures of their students' parents.All educators should not criticize those who use the native languagein school.There should be no put-downs of people who use the tribal lan-guage on the part of anyone who does not know that language.Perceptions that English is better than the local language should notbe accepted or transmitted.All educators (including the school principal) should try to learn thestudents' home language; even if they do not become very profi-cient, they will have indicated a certain degree of interest and re-spect.All educators must realize that, although they alone cannot be re-sponsible for the intergenerational transmission of a language, theycan do much to encourage positive attitudes towards it.To counteract the extinction of home languages, school boards and schooladministrators need to do much more than develop native language programsand hire qualified, literate teachers to implement them, for these teachers arefew in number and control only a small portion of each student's time. Nativelanguage and culture offerings tend to be isolated from the rest of the curricu-lum, from subjects taught in English, and from the majority of teachers andpupils. This amounts to a form of segregation. What the entire educational es- 5 Teaching Indigenous Languagestablishment must do, instead, is to actively and systematically promote linguis-tic diversity rather than conformity. This would be feasible if it was requiredthat all English-speaking teachers become fluent in another language. If theydo, they will gain very rewarding experiences and personal growth. However,let us be realistic; we are talking about attitudes, not about some unreasonablestandard of proficiency.Sustained actionEducators can play a significant role not only in promoting positive atti-tudes towards the local native language but in creating opportunities for peopleto use it. School personnel and community members together can create andsupport participation in such initiatives.Many years ago I was invited to the traditional Crow Arrow Games bysome friends from Lodge Grass, and it was an unforgettable experience. Thespectators sat around the huge playing field, each family gathered under anawning or a big umbrella, enjoying refreshments and conversation. The an-nouncements and the talk were all in Crow, but from time to time someonewould take me aside and whisper a quick English summary of what was beingsaid. This kind of event included adults as well as children, and this is where alot of language learning and practice was taking place. The school providedadditional instruction, including reading and writing from an impressive col-lection of Crow language materials. Many schools have similar programs forNative students, but the Arrow Games are a unique and exemplary model ofcommunity involvement.It is important to keep in mind that if a language is learned as an academicsubject, it may enjoy high prestige and yet never be used for meaningful com-munication in authentic social interactions. This is what happened when I wastaught Latin in Italy, where I obtained most of my education. I began to studyLatin in a public school when I was ten and continued until the end of college.In class we read the classics as well as later documents by medieval scholars,we did a lot of translation and grammar exercises, and eventually we wrotecompositions. We hardly ever used the language orally in class, but outside ofschool we heard it in church, for this was before the Vatican allowed the use ofmodern languages in Catholic services. What we heard during Mass and otherceremonies was entirely formulaic and ritualistic, either read aloud or recitedfrom memory. We learned what the holy texts meant during religious instruc-tion classes, but the discussion was conducted in Italian, not in Latin. The onlytimes I heard Latin used for communication were when priests from differentcountries used it with each other when they had no other common language.For us students, the language was a reminder that we were descended fromthe Romans, who had once conquered the world. Our ability to decipher in-scriptions in churches, monuments, and graveyards identified us as membersof the educated class, so that the language had prestige and was greatly valued,but everyone knew that it was dead. i:2\u00a96 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesTo keep native languages alive, it is not enough to value them; it is essen-tial to use them. If their use is declining, it is necessary to identify specialoccasions and designate special times and places where it makes sense not touse English. The community must provide direction, but unless the school sys-tem participates in the effort, it may lack credibility in the eyes of today's so-phisticated youth.In addition, all teachers should develop an integrated approach to languageacross the curriculum, building on what the learners bring to the classroomfrom their out-of-school experiences and from other classes, especially thoseon Native language and culture. Teachers can also identify and collect supple-mentary materials that highlight diversity as a desirable worldwide phenom-enon. This is particularly important in the case of schools located in isolatedareas. Although technology and the media bring the outside world into theirhome, students may not pay attention to what does not relate directly to theirown interests, and the teachers must act as mediators and interpreters. Onesource of such materials is the Curriculum Resource Program available fromthe editors of Cultural Survival (1997)1. The program covers a wide range ofthemes, from contemporary issues in Native North America to internationalcase-specific studies of ethnic conflict. Resource packets for teachers includebibliographies, videos, lists of speakers and artisans, and suggestions for class-room activities and further learning.Teachers need some guidance and administrative support about how toimplement the changes they may be willing to try, but, as competent profes-sionals, they should also assume responsibility for their own informed deci-sions. The enormous differences in contexts, cultures, backgrounds, ages, andachievement levels that exist in every classroom call for flexibility, adaptabil-ity, and creativity, rather than passive submission to a syllabus developed andimposed by someone else.The higher principle one can invoke in support of this pedagogy is a hu-manistic respect for teachers as well as learners. To encourage these initiativesso that they become more than lip-service, school districts could engage inaction research projects, possibly in collaboration with a college or universitythat would offer them academic credit. The goal of action research is the devel-opment of a better understanding of a local issue in order to bring about improvement. The participants research their own classroom, department, pro-gram, school system, or community, not someone else's, and can do so in afairly informal, relaxed, and natural way. The projects are best conducted ascooperative efforts involving colleagues, students, staff, parents, and other ap-propriate collaborators. One possible project could be aimed at increasing theintegration of traditional and academic knowledge into thematic units and shouldbe a collaborative effort between Native instructors and other teachers. An-other project could explore whether learning about the advantages of bilingual-(Cultural Survival, 96 Mount Auburn Street, Cambridge, MA 02138.

After reflecting on the situation and deciding to focus on oneitem of manageable size, they should seek as much relevant information aspossible from various sources such as professional literature, consultants, andcommunity representatives. The next steps consist of collecting data such asreports, diaries, videotapes, and questionnaires and then analyzing them to iden-tify what needs changing. Planning and implementing change leads to a newcycle of observation, reflection, and revision.Motivated teachers have always tried to modify their mode of delivery aswell as the content of their lessons to achieve better results, but they have notalways done it systematically, reflectively, and with careful documentation. Theyhave often been alone in their struggles to understand and alleviate problems,and when they have succeeded, they have seldom been given the opportunity toshare their findings with others. Considering the importance of the changesinvolved in resolving the indigenous language issue and doing away with aharmful hidden curriculum, it seems appropriate to have the process imple-mented in a professional manner and to generate models that might be useful inother schools.In conclusion, a school that downgrades home languages and encouragesconformity instead of diversity emphasizes social differences and leads to elit-ism and intolerance for some and low self-esteem and inner conflict for others.Children can be pointed in either direction; the school must, therefore, be heldaccountable by parents and communities for making ethical and responsiblechoices in these matters. The school can and must become a strong promoter ofminority language preservation and transmission instead of continuing to beone of the main agents of its endangerment.

Trujillo This paper is an overview of the efforts of the Pascua Yaqui Tribeto develop a tribal response to the language development needs of itspeople. It examines the tribe's effort to assume responsibility for coor-dinating and directing all programs and activities initiated by its own,as well as other public education agencies, to meet the long rangeneeds and interests of the tribal community. It also examines the sig-nificance of language usage both on educational attainment as wellas in the larger cultural milieu in which tribal members live. A histori-cal perspective traces the efforts to date to better understand the con-ceptual underpinnings of current programs and the tribal planningunderway to expand that effort. This case study approach conveys thestory of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in order to focus on universal vari-ables and constraints that are relevant to the language developmentof all indigenous groups. The language competency of the members of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe en-compasses, to varying degrees, the Yaqui language as well as community dia-lects of both Spanish and English. Even though this unique trilingual linguisticpattern has been functional for their survival needs, it has also served as a bar-rier to educational achievement where competency in the standard forms ofSpanish and English is required. Because of the considerable discontinuitiesthat exist between the sphere of public educational institutions and those of theYaqui community, many Yaquis have not acquired functional literacy in any oftheir three languages.In responding to the broader educational and social needs of its members,the Tribe has focused its educational program development efforts on revivingand encouraging the use of the Yaqui language in order to promote a languageand cultural renaissance, encompassing both the desire to reassert the role ofthe language in the culture, as well as to provide a vehicle for enhancing theattainment of improved English and Spanish skills.Many indigenous groups have had to undergo pronounced bilingual andbicultural adaptation, particularly in the urban setting, as a result of their prox-imity to a dominant European American cultural presence. Yaqui communitieshave a third, Hispanic, cultural variable, making them trilingual and triculturalin character. 2410 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesHistorical backgroundTo understand the underpinnings of Pascua Yaqui's unique cultural setting,it is imperative to briefly retrace the historical antecedents in the southern re-gion of the state of Sonora, Mexico, the traditional homeland of the Yaqui. Thephenomenon of the bilingual and bicultural adaptation of Native Americans ismuch older than the history of Native American/non-indigenous American con-tact. Many Yaquis, as was the case with other indigenous groups, knew thelanguages of some of their neighbors. This was important to the conduct oftrade and regional stability. Contact with Europeans, on the other hand, hasoccupied a relatively short period in the Native American social experience.This latter contact has been unique in Native American history in that it hasspawned the profound cultural and linguistic diversity that characterizes thecontemporary social landscape.The first non-indigenous influence in North America was a result of theestablishment of the Spanish colony in the Valley of Mexico, from whom theYaqui steadfastly maintained an almost singular isolation in comparison withother tribes in the region. Yet significant inroads were eventually made intotraditional Yaqui culture as a result of their adoption and adaptation of Catholi-cism, introduced to them by the Spanish Jesuit missionaries during their longjourneys north into the present day western United States (Rivas, 1968). Thisalso provided the common thread that culturally, if not socially, would eventu-ally link them to the growing racially and culturally mixed Mexican populationneighboring their homelands.The ensuing cultural adaptation was also reflected in the Yaqui language.Spanish words were added to the Yaqui lexicon to accommodate cultural innova-tions (Spicer, 1943). Even the morphology and syntax were influenced by Span-ish. Yaqui speakers readily incorporated Spanish words as well as grammaticalstructure to accommodate new things and concepts introduced by the missionar-ies, rather than coin new Yaqui terminology or even translate the Spanish wordsinto Yaqui. This phenomenon is a characteristic of the early intercultural period,before the Yaqui began to feel cultural coercion and oppression (Dozier, 1956).Gradually some Yaquis became literate both in Spanish and Yaqui. Yaquileaders wrote to their Mexican contemporaries in Spanish and to their literateYaqui friends who had relocated to other parts of Sonora in Yaqui. As churchceremonies were written in Spanish and Yaqui for all to use, a Yaqui writtenrecord appeared (Barber, 1973). The majority of Yaqui were literate, althoughwith little formal schooling, and many spoke several languages (Spicer, 1980). Intheir own minds, the Yaquis considered themselves more civilized than Mexi-cans and other indigenous groups and equal, except in technical skills, to Euro-pean Americans.The Yaqui experience in the United StatesAlthough Yaquis began to cross the border into the United States as early as1887, they were not strangers to the northern region. Yaqui oral history tells oftheir presence in the area of what is today the southern U.S. from time immemo- 114 0 Teaching Indigenous Languagesrial (Senate, 1994). The major migration of the historical era came during theyears 1900-1910. By the 1950's, there were approximately 4,000 in Arizona. Forthe most part, they were escaping deportation by the Mexican government toYucatan, or seeking employment when conditions in Sonora became extremelydifficult. As many Yaquis in Sonora were doing, those coming to Arizona estab-lished themselves in barrios at the edges of cities or in work camps, neither as-similating into the dominant society nor returning to their homeland permanently(Spicer, 1961).The Yaquis were refugees and their earliest settlements bore universal refu-gee characteristics of inadequate food, shelter, and sanitation. They were intrud-ers who had no legal status. They owned no land and were forced to establishthemselves as squatters. During the early years, they were fearful of being iden-tified as Yaquis and being sent back to Sonora, so they operated primarily withintheir own micro-cosmic cultural enclave as a defense mechanism to the perceivedthreat of deportation. Because of this, Yaqui identity, language, and religious prac-tices were outwardly suppressed. They had as little contact as possible with gov-ernment officials so that nearly fifteen years passed before the Yaquis becameaware that they had been afforded political asylum and that in the United Statesreligious freedom was upheld regardless of political or social status.European American and Mexican communities were already well estab-lished in Arizona by the time the Yaquis settled there. As in Mexico, they werefaced with the cultural diversity that was anything but democratic. While theMexican majority in Sonora had essentially relegated them to second class sta-tus in their homeland, in the United States their social status was diminishedfurther by the Mexican Americans who were, themselves, already enduringthat status relative to the \"Anglo\" population. The trilingual characteristic ofthe contemporary Arizona Yaqui community is a cross-cultural legacy of thedynamics of their living many decades in proximity to ever increasing numbersof non-indigenous language speaking neighbors flanking both their Mexicanand U.S. communities.Despite considerable success in trilingual and tricultural adaptation, theYaqui continue to be financially the poorest of any single population in south-ern Arizona. This is largely attributable to extraordinary low levels of formaleducational attainment. Only about two-thirds have completed the eighth grade,less than one-fifth have completed high school or the equivalency, and lessthan one percent have graduated from an institution of higher education. Eco-nomic indicators show that over 60% are unemployed and that of the employed,less than 25% are employed full-time. Based on national standards, approxi-mately 85% of the tribal population live below the poverty level (Yaqui, 1989).Although it was not uncommon for Yaquis in the traditional homeland toknow other languages, Spanish'panish was the first truly foreign language with whichthey would be compelled to contend in terms of cultural adaptation. The Yaquishistorically adapted to the changes in Mexico by learning the cultural \"vocabu-lary\" as well as the vernacular of the Mexicans. By the time of the migrationsto Arizona, Spanish was widely used by the Yaqui residents in all their deal- 12 Teaching Indigenous Languagesings, economic and social, with the population of Mexicans and Mexican Ameri-cans that surrounded them. But a new cultural vocabulary and vernacular hadto be acquired to survive in the Anglo dominant society they found in Arizona.The trilingual character of Arizona Yaqui society todaySpanish is the dominant language today among the Arizona Yaqui. Its isspoken in the majority of all Yaqui homes, roughly 70% percent of the time onaverage. Yaqui is spoken approximately 20% of the time on average (usuallyby older family members) with the remainder consisting of English (usuallyyounger family members) (Culture, 1979). Many Yaquis over age 50 speak atleast some Yaqui, although primarily among those of their own generation.Most also speak a regional Spanish dialect, in which they have steadily becomedominant.The population of Arizona Yaquis today is young, almost half of them arein school. Their language abilities are mixed. The children of today typicallylearn Spanish as their first language, since this is the predominant lingua francaof most Yaqui communities. The trend is, nevertheless, toward an ever greaterpercentage of children learning English as their first language, although this isoften a non-standard English dialect. It is now common for parents to speak totheir children in Spanish and have the children respond in English. Only a fewadolescents maintain a passive knowledge of spoken Yaqui, but virtually nonespeak it fluently. An ever increasing number of children speak only English,with perhaps passive receptive knowledge of Spanish.The particular character of the linguistic competence of Yaquis is unique.They, as most Native Americans, speak a dialect variant of English that bears astrong influence from the native language. Since individuals who are raised inan indigenous or minority community usually learn English from other mem-bers of that community, the linguistic patterns of their English dialect continuethat influence (Leap, 1977). In the case of the Yaqui, however, there existsanother dimension to their linguistic culture, since they have gone through thissame process earlier in learning Spanish as a second language. The majorityacquired English as dominant Yaqui dialect Spanish speakers. That is, many ofthe grammatical patterns and items of vocabulary differ in form and meaningfrom those used in the \"standard\" form of both English and Spanish (Leap,1977).The Yaqui educational experience in ArizonaYaquis, like most Native Americans, have been impacted by the disconti-nuity between the school and the community and the implicit institutional \"hid-den curriculum\" predicated on a deficit model of them as learners. This hasbeen generalized to both language and culture. That is to say, that the Yaquisare somehow assumed to be culturally and linguistically lacking. Given thatlearning occurs in a context of positive interaction, mutual intelligibility, andshared meaning, the Yaquis have been marginalized institutionally by this hid- 132?, Teaching Indigenous Languagesden curriculum. They share this experience with most linguistic and culturalminorities.The public schools have perpetuated both the social distance and contex-tual effects that perpetuate inequality. This has been largely owing to the failureof many school district personnel to perceive their own lack of understandingof cultural \"literacy\" and the implications that has for education (Chilcott, 1987).This scenario has provided the impetus for the Yaqui Tribe's various initiativesto assume leadership and control of programmatic efforts to address the lan-guage development needs of its constituency.For many years no bilingual instruction was provided and no appropriateassessment was used to ascertain the educational needs of the Yaqui childrenby any of the public school districts serving them. In 1971, the communitybased Guadalupe Organization (GO) took action to correct the situation of mis-diagnosing and mislabeling Guadalupe's non-English proficient students byfiling a class action lawsuit against the Tempe Elementary School District. Atthe time, over 67 percent of the children in special education classes were Yaquiand Mexican, although they constituted only 17 percent of the district studentpopulation.The following year, the district was ordered to develop a desegregationplan as a result of the U.S. Office of Civil Rights (OCR) citing a 97 percentminority enrollment at the local elementary school in Guadalupe. In response,the Guadalupe Organization opened I'tom Escuela, \"Our School\" in Yaqui, in achurch community center 15 volunteer teachers and 200 students (Retzlaff,1982). l'tom Escuela was financed by rummage and bake sales, car washes,contributions from community groups, and by fund-raising campaigns. Its teach-ers were paid through money received from Volunteers in Service to America(VISTA). The alternative school prided itself on building on the cultural heri-tage students brought from home. The instructional program was not orientedto tests or grades, rather it helped students establish positive self-conceptsthrough learning about their own and other cultures. Three languages weretaught: English, Spanish, and Yaqui. The curriculum included the unseen com-ponents of language that structure the way people view themselves, each other,and the world around them. It also addressed many injustices, the most glaringbeing the placement of children in classes for the mentally retarded on the basisof intelligence tests administered in English.After ten years of providing a trilingual/tricultural curriculum for the stu-dents of Guadalupe, l'tom Escuela closed its doors owing to financial instabil-ity. A primary barrier to their seeking federal funds for continuing this uniqueschool was owing, ironically, to their resistance to busing and boycott of a civilrights desegregation plan.The 1973 lawsuit against the Tempe Elementary School District by theGuadalupe Organization brought about change in regard to language and stu-dent assessment. The Guadalupe Decision was incorporated into Arizona De-partment of Education policy on assessment, which now states that the primarylanguage of each student must be determined and then the student's proficiency2814 Teaching Indigenous Languagesmust be tested in that language. As a class action suit, the Guadalupe Decisionensured that all children in the state of Arizona will be assessed in their nativelanguage (Trujillo, 1992).The Tucson Unified School District and the Pascua Yaqui Tribe enteredinto an agreement to develop and implement the Yaqui/English Bilingual Edu-cation Project in 1981 with funding from the U.S. Department of Education,Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs. The goal of theproject was to develop curriculum materials incorporating the Yaqui cultureand language for grades K-5. To meet this project goal, it was necessary todevelop guidelines for the use of cultural information and the development ofan orthography for the Yaqui Language. These guidelines were first establishedby the Parent Advisory Committee to the Title VII Yaqui English Project, andwere later reflected in the tribe's language policy.The adoption of a tribal language policyIn September, 1984, the tribal council officially adopted the Pascua YaquiTribe Language Policy. The basis for this policy is contained in the policy dec-laration stating:The Yaqui Language is a gift from 'tom Achai, the Creator, to ourpeople and, therefore, shall be treated with respect. Our ancient lan-guage is the foundation of our cultural and spiritual heritage withoutwhich we could not exist in the manner that our Creator intended.Education is the transmission of culture and values, therefore, we de-clare that Yaqui education shall be the means for the transmission ofthe Yaqui language and spiritual and cultural heritage. We further de-clare that all aspects of the educational process shall reflect the beautyof our Yaqui language, culture and values.It shall be the policy of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe that no member ofthe tribe shall be coerced by any outside non-Yaqui Tribe authority orsystem to deny or debase the Yaqui language. We declare that the Yaquilanguage policies shall manifest consideration of the whole personincorporating high academic achievement with the spiritual, mental,physical and cultural aspects of the individual within the Yaqui familyand the Pascua Yaqui Tribe. This shall be the Yaqui standard for excel-lence in education.We declare that the Yaqui people must have genuine freedom ofaccess to excellence in education and that we shall carry out our obli-gation to uphold the Yaqui code of ethics which will enable our presentand future generation to survive.This policy incorporates statements in reaffirmation of the tribe's commitmentto the promotion, protection, preservation, and enhancement of the Yaqui lan-guage, culture, and tradition. These statements encompass the tribe's authorityto establish policies regarding the status of the Yaqui language, the role of pa- 15 Teaching Indigenous Languagesrental and organizational involvement, the recognition of eminent persons andelders, the recognition of the Yaqui language as an integral part of all schoolcurricula, the requirement of tribal approval for all external research and stud-ies, provision for the copyright of publications and reproductions of ceremo-nial artifacts, the sanctioning of the Pascua Yaqui orthography, guidelines forteacher training, the establishment of the Yaqui Language and Culture Com-mission, and the provision of funding to support Yaqui language development(Pascua Yaqui Tribe, 1984).Yaqui attitudes on language development and usageThe possession of multiple operating cultures is the ability to act and be-have appropriately in accordance with alternative sets of standards. The abilityto demonstrate competence in more than one set of standards or to engage mul-tiple operating cultures constitutes a wider field of shared cultural competence.The Yaquis distinctive identity within their respective communities in the U.S.and Mexico, where they must coexist with \"dominant\" cultures, has been rein-forced as a consequence of both positive and negative factors.Languages are generally not viewed by the Yaqui community as systemsof communicative competence, but rather as vehicles of access to the socioeco-nomic cultural domains they symbolize. The Yaqui language is perceived moreas a repository for culture and heritage in a static sense, not viewed as an equallyvalid and viable medium for intellectual and contemporary social development.English, however, is imbued with such qualities and thereby becomes thegatekeeper for success in the Euro-American dominated national culture.A study of Yaqui viewpoints on language and literacy conducted in 1989found that cultural conflict exists in education and language learning. Culturalconflict in education reflects a dichotomy of cultural survival versus functionalsurvival within the multiple operating cultures. The decline of the Yaqui lan-guage in Arizona is expressed by Yaquis in terms of cultural change and adap-tation to the dominant culture (Trujillo, 1991). Yet paradoxically, their histori-cal marginalization by the dominant society and its institutions such as theschools, as well as by the Mexican American community, has served to keepthat identity strong.Yaqui students' native language skills in either Yaqui or Spanish are stillnot being developed in the public schools, and because their primary languageskills are not being fully exploited to assist in the acquisition of English, theiroverall linguistic development is being shortchanged. While language is seenas a critical aspect of cultural pluralism and the study of the languages of devel-oped or exotic societies is widely encouraged, there continues to be a stigmati-zation associated with indigenous languages or, as in the case of Spanish, withlanguages that are locally associated primarily with culturally and economi-cally marginalized groups. Spanish study is viewed favorably, on the other hand,for native English speaking European American students who may, for example,seek to participate in an exchange program in Spain. Yet it is viewed quite3016 Teaching Indigenous Languagesdifferently when it is offered for minority students who come from Spanishspeaking homes.Few people will regularly choose to use a stigmatized language without astrong ideological commitment. This has provided a strong impetus for manyYaquis to seek to ensure that their children learn English as a primary languageas early as possible. Often this is done even to the detriment of commensurateSpanish and/or Yaqui skills development.Development and maintenance of language skills demand the use of thelanguage in significant and useful ways as part of normal real life activities, notjust in structured language lessons. Full language acquisition necessitates avail-ability of the total range of communicative possibilities by which the learnermay selectively recreate the language in a natural order (Chomsky, 1965). Thisis why dominant languages always prevail while minority languages are con-tinually retreating in their path.Tribal responses to language development needsThe Yaqui Family Literacy Partnership Program (YFLPP) was funded in1988 by the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs(OBEMLA) of the U.S. Department of Education, to initiate a family literacyprogram utilizing the rich oral tradition and cultural heritage of Yaqui people inthe teaching-learning process. This project represented a partnership of thePascua Yaqui Tribe Education Department, Pima Community College, and theTucson Unified School District. As such, it united the efforts of these educa-tional agencies in a collaborative effort to create a family milieu literacy pro-gram for the Yaqui people. The program focused upon utilization of existingforms of language and literacy to build new dimensions of linguistic compe-tence. The broad range goal of the project was to increase learning outcomesfor Yaqui children enrolled in bilingual education programs by increasing theliteracy levels of their parents and older, out-of-school siblings.The initial eight-week classes were initiated at three sites in April. Eachclass met one evening per week, usually for two hours. Based on the projectassessed training needs and interests, the Spring 1989 classes included pre-GED literacy in New Pascua, pre-GED literacy and Yaqui language in OldPascua, Spanish Language in Yoem Pueblo (Marana). In-structional topics included history of the Yaqui people, discussion of signifi-cant Yaqui cultural themes, comparison between Yaqui lifeways in Arizona andSonora, comparison between Yaqui and European scientific perspectives, criti-cal reading of newspapers, oral and written reports, group discussions, and lan-guage-based work skills.The program's instructional services were enthusiastically received by thosefamily and community members who availed themselves of the opportunity.Participants and staff alike reported being pleased with the overall classroomaccomplishments.The widely claimed highlight of the project was the First InternationalYaqui Language and Family Literacy Conference held in July 1989 in Tucson. 17,3 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesWhile this unprecedented event featured a range of unique and timely themesand topics, it was the historic convergence of Arizona and Sonora Yaquis thatimpressed the greatest number of participants. Many extolled the historic andcultural significance of this important event.The conference was the symbolic departure point for the Yaqui FamilyLiteracy Partnership Program. It was the Conference that brought YFLPP tothe forefront of attention for most tribal members, both those living within andthose living outside of communities targeted for project services. Widespreadinterest was expressed for having this conference activity be institutionalizedas a regular annual tribal activity.In terms of the YFLPP project, the most significant result of the confer-ence was that it represented the point in time when the project changed itsperceptual ownership. From that point it was widely felt to be a Yaqui program,belonging to the people who it is intended to serve. The last session of theConference in particular, the open forum, was the point at which the peoplebegan to identify and articulate in their own terms the meaning of the event andwhat it signified.Following up closely on that phenomenon and taking advantage of themomentum of the occasion, an in-depth study designed to get at the very coreof Yaqui perceptions on language and educational issues was initiated by theauthor. The findings were the subject of her doctoral dissertation, Yaqui View-points on Language and Literacy (Trujillo, 1991). The study utilized ethno-graphic interviewing for exploring the perceptual underpinnings of tribal mem-bers attitudes that shape their responses to language acquisition, educationalattainment, and in the broadest sense, Yaqui cultural development.The language viewpoint study provided a framework for addressing thetribe's language development desires and needs. One of the outcomes of thestudy was the determination that any meaningful effort to impact the languagedevelopment needs of the tribe would have to come through a \"whole commu-nity\" approach. Specifically, a family-centered milieu was identified as the mostappropriate method to address the community's needs in light of the uniquecharacter of their communicative competence.With the author's election as the Pascua Yaqui Tribal Council Vice-Chair-woman, the responsibility for initiating education projects was delegated toher. One of her first acts was the establishment of a tribal education departmentto oversee all educational activities in a comprehensive and unified manner.In 1993, utilizing the personnel of the various programs under the newtribal education department, a comprehensive community survey was devel-oped at the reservation community of New Pascua. This was devised to elicitcomprehensive information regarding living patterns, educational attainmentlevels, language abilities, employment, and various other kinds of data fromthe entire community.The results of the community survey have been utilized for refining subse-quent project intervention services as well as planning additional programs deal-ing with language development. Extensive coordination with local tribal and.3218 Teaching Indigenous Languagesschool personnel and agencies was conducted regarding the instruments, theimplementation protocols, and the assessment timeline. Approximately two-thirds of the entire reservation community were surveyed, 957 adults and 922children. The survey showed that over 80% of both adults and children speakEnglish, and, while over 75% of adults speak Spanish, less than half of thechildren do. Less than 25% of adults and 10% of children speak Yaqui.Project Kaateme, one of the first new programs undertaken by the neweducation department, is the Pascua Yaqui Even Start Family Literacy Pro-gram, an intergenerational project of the tribal Education Department that ad-dresses the needs of Yaqui parents, their preschool children, and other familymembers who have not completed school. The goal of the project is to increaselearning outcomes for Yaqui children while increasing adult training and em-ployment opportunities through raising the literacy levels of their parents andolder, out-of-school siblings.Project Kaateme incorporates a parent-as-tutor strategy based on a non-deficit family approach. This method emphasizes the strengths of the Yaquifamily. The non-deficit perspective helps increase the self-confidence of par-ents and fosters their participation in school settings. The meaningful partici-pation of parents in the academic progress of their children has a direct rela-tionship to the children's academic achievement. Out-of-school youth also par-ticipate in order to achieve increased literacy skills that offer them a new rangeof possibilities in both the job market and for further education. They also serveas role models for younger children who continue to face great challenges inthe school environment.Educational activities are provided in tribal education facilities on the res-ervation and are built around culturally relevant themes. Yaqui culture, tradi-tions, and language serve as the medium, context, and subject of learning expe-riences, carefully designed to foster and stimulate the acquisition of additionallinguistic competencies. Family literacy creates a base from which to increasethe effectiveness of education for all. The project emphasizes the use of theexisting linguistic characteristics of the community as a base for additive com-petencies, while addressing the concerns of parents that their children acquirethe standard American academic form of English in order to enhance their ac-cess to a good education.The program focuses on the utilization of existing forms of language andliteracy to build new dimensions of linguistic competence. Commensurate withdeveloping effective learning outcomes for educational and occupational ad-vancement, the project also addresses the need to promote the enhancement ofYaqui cultural knowledge. Yaqui culture is, therefore, the primary content ve-hicle for training activities for all family members.Project Kaateme places equal emphasis on two generations and two goals,maximizing the effects of early education for children and literacy instructionfor adults. The synergy of reciprocal learning and teaching among family mem-bers creates a home environment that supports and enhances learning. The un-derlying premise that parental involvement in the education process of children 1933 Teaching Indigenous Languagesleads to academic achievement and increased self-esteem is expanded in thisproject to include total family involvement. This framework that builds uponfamily interrelationship to produce positive learning experiences provides ben-efits not only to the basic family unit but also the community and tribe.The tribe is now offering Yaqui as a second language classes for adultsthrough the auspices of Pima Community College. The class is taught by one ofthe Project Kaateme staff members, who is also providing Yaqui as a secondlanguage instruction to preschoolers.Educational opportunities have increased markedly only recently, as a re-sult of revenues generated through the tribe's gaming operation. Benefits arenow offered by the tribe to its administrative and casino employees. The ca-sino, which only began operation in 1994, employs more tribal members thanall other tribal enterprises combined. The tribe is currently in the process ofconstructing a new learning center with casino revenues. This will bring to-gether under one roof the early childhood learning programs, represented todayby the Head Start and Project Kaateme programs, as well as future integratedlanguage and culture educational projects.This is the situation Yaqui community leaders confront as they attempt todevelop community education programs that address language and culture. His-torically, the cultural and linguistic adaptation of the Yaqui has been primarilyreactive, in an effort to ensure that they would survive. The focus has nowshifted to reflect the awareness that in a democratic multicultural society it isthe right of every culture, as it is with every individual, to thrive. ReferencesBarber, Carroll G.

Thus the teaching ofNative languages has had little or no effect upon reversing the steadydecline of the number of speakers of indigenous languages. A problemthat has consistently plagued Native efforts to teach Native languagesto successive generations is not having well defined examples and aclear understanding of methods that can actually yield successfulspeakers. To provide one such example, this paper examines the growthand development of the Arapaho language immersion program anddiscusses language revitalization strategies and methods and levels ofsuccess that the Arapaho Language Lodge staff have achieved as theyhave steadily worked to establish a new generation of Arapaho speak-ing children on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. From the late eighteen hundreds to the middle nineteen hundreds, theArapaho people, along with most other Indigenous peoples of North America,were led to believe that if they and their children were to become \"valued\"American citizens they would have to abandon their Arapaho language. Duringthis period, boarding school personnel, backed by government support, aggres-sively worked toward replacing the languages of Indigenous peoples with En-glish as the standard language of communication. The result of this effort haslead to the steady decline of Indigenous languages throughout North America.As Indigenous people prepare themselves for the challenges of the twenty-first century, many will face the problems of language loss as their greatestchallenge. Typically, the pattern of language loss usually begins with youngadults becoming bilingual, speaking both their Indigenous language and thelanguage of the majority population. Their children then become monolingual,speaking only the language of the majority population, until eventually onlythe older people are left as speakers of an Indigenous language that has becomea minority language. Left unattended or neglected, the process of language losscontinues until the last indigenous speaker dies.Long before an indigenous language actually slips into extinction, it slowlydecays through the loss of its grammatical complexities, the loss of native wordsforgotten by native speakers, and the loss through the incorporation of foreignvocabulary and foreign grammatical features into the indigenous language. Aslanguage losses accumulate, they also bring about dramatic cultural losses. 22 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesAssessing the problem and developing a strategyThe future of any language lies in its ability to be passed on to successivegenerations. It is well documented that early childhood is the ideal time forlanguage learning; it is the time when language acquisition occurs in all cul-tures. In recognizing this, Elder Arapaho community members expressed con-cern over the fact that children had not learned to speak Arapaho for the past 40years. Out of this concern, Elders articulated their desire for children to be-come speakers of Arapaho. Faced with the lack of success schools were havingin teaching Arapaho, the Northern Plains Educational Foundation, a commu-nity group, asked me to direct a language and culture program within the reser-vation public schools.I began work in January 1993, and within the first week of my position Irealized that in spite of Arapaho having been taught in the schools since 1978,students only received an average of 45 hours of language instruction per aca-demic year; about the same amount of time an administrator devotes to his jobtasks in one week of work. This information made it that much more unsettlingwhen administrators and teaching staff consistently questioned why studentswere not developing Arapaho speaking skills. I then realized the magnitude ofour struggle to try and maintain our languages and cultures in the face of suchdeeply rooted colonialistic attitudes that still maintain, with the best of inten-tions, assimilation is the best course for \"Indians.\" This and the following sce-nario is most likely similar on many reservations. District superintendents, schoolprincipals, administrators, and perhaps 98% of teaching staff, from kindergar-ten to grade twelve, are neither natives of the culture nor native to the reserva-tions upon which they work and teach. My observations led me to realize that Iwould have to maneuver carefully.Taking advantage of the newness of my position, I suggested setting up akindergarten class to test what would be the impact of an hour-long languageclass, five days a week, over an eighteen week period. The school's principalacknowledged that this would be the first time anyone had attempted to accu-mulate statistical information on an Arapaho language class and endorsed theclass. After eighteen months the results were dramatic.Addressing the problem with an effective methodologyThe instruction of the Arapaho language within the Wyoming School Dis-trict was provided by six fluent Arapaho speakers. These Arapaho languageinstructors were hired on the basis of passing a review of Elder fluent speakerswho made up the Arapaho language commission, and it was their responsibilityto instruct the Arapaho language to students from kindergarten to the twelfthgrade. While none of the language instructors had actually begun their jobswith any teacher training, the school system had provided them with numerousin-services on teaching methods throughout their employment within the schoolsystem. In spite of this, the methods that they learned were not well suited forthe task of teaching Arapaho. 23 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesIn creating an hour-long Arapaho language kindergarten class, the strategywas to take five children from each of the three kindergarten classes to form aclass that would receive an hour of language instruction each day: The progressof this test class was then compared to the other three kindergarten classes,which received 15 minutes per day of language instruction throughout the schoolterm. The class was structure to accommodate 15 kindergarten children of vary-ing interests and attention spans who were divided into three groups of fivestudents, with each group assigned to a learning station. After 15 minutes at alearning station, each group rotated to a different station. After 45 minutes ofworking at the three different learning stations, all 15 students met as one groupfor the fourth 15 minute segment of the hour-long period. Each station covereda different aspect of language use. One station focused on word drills, a secondfocused on phrase drills, and the third focused on interactive conversationsbetween the children and instructor. At each station the children were led by adifferent instructor. When the three groups combined into one group for the last15 minute session, a fourth instructor came into the class and asked the chil-dren to respond to various commands and execute different tasks. The obviousstrength of this approach was in exposing the children to four different speak-ers who each focused on different aspects of language use.After twelve weeks had elapsed, 80% of the test class had mastered 162words and phrases. This included a list of 32 phrases such as stand up, sit down,come here, are you hungry, yes I am hungry, what are you doing, I am jumping,what is your name, my name is..., write your name, are you thirsty, I am thirsty,pick it up, throw it away, put it down, come in, throw it (for both animate andinanimate objects), go and get it, give it to me. In addition to the 32 phrases,they could name; 36 animals, 15 body parts, 12 different food items, eight dif-ferent types of clothing, nine colors, count to 30, and the following 20 miscel-laneous words; ball, plate, grandma, box, fork, grandpa, chair, spoon, mother,cup, tree, father, knife, rock, what, paper, river, hello, snow, and mountain. Bythe end of a school year the three control classes, in comparison, were assessedat having mastered a vocabulary of between 15 and 18 words.Implementing immersion classesI had already known that the best way to accomplish the long range goal ofproducing children who can fluently speak Arapaho was by placing them in asetting that paralleled the way fluent speakers acquired Arapaho, in other wordsby immersing them in the language. These thoughts were reinforced after Iattended a language conference in May 1993 that showcased the immersionefforts of the Hawaiians. Through my observations at this conference I assessedthat Hawaiian children were achieving an age appropriate level of fluency inHawaiian after being exposed to from 600 to 700 language contact hours. Thegoal then became to implement an immersion class in Arapaho.The results of the kindergarten test class were favorably received by theelementary school principal. On the basis of the documented results, a half dayimmersion kindergarten class was implemented at the school in September 1993.3824 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThe class was set up similar to how the hour-long kindergarten class had beenset up, with children learning at different language stations that focused ondifferent aspects of language use. Along with this initial effort, Arapaho lan-guage assessments were developed and implemented for children in kindergar-ten through fourth grade. The assessments charted what the students knew inArapaho at the start of the school year and then again between the seventh andeighth week of each successive nine week quarter. Using each documentedword/phrase count, a bar graph was created to illustrate each child's languagelevel growth rate.By the end of October I realized that the existing weakness in understand-ing language teaching methods, coupled with the severely limited amount oftime allotted for Arapaho language instruction, would not allow for any signifi-cant change to occur in what could actually be taught and learned. This realiza-tion led to an Arapaho pilot language immersion class being implemented inJanuary 1994 for preschool aged children within the Ethete community. One ofthe objectives of the preschool immersion project was to demonstrate how chil-dren could be guided toward achieving a speaking ability that would allowthem to interact with instructors and each other in Arapaho. Underlying theimplementation of the immersion class was the idea that if children could gainfluency before reaching elementary school then the task of language instruc-tors would shift to focusing on maintaining fluency rather than trying to createfluency under almost impossible conditions.The pilot immersion project ran for two hours a day, four days a week,from January to May 1994. During the course of this class children were ex-posed to 136 hours of Arapaho over a four month period. When comparing thenumber of language contact hours received in the pilot project to the number oflanguage contact hours a child received in the school system, it was assessedthat it would take a child three years of elementary school to attain the sameamount of language contact hours. In both cases, however, the number fell farshort of the 600 to 700 language contact hours projected as being needed forthe onset of fluency to occur. As expected, when comparing the language learn-ing that occurred between the kindergarten immersion class, which received540 language contact hours, and the preschool immersion class, the kindergar-ten class demonstrated an Arapaho language vocabulary and comprehensionlevel that greatly surpassed that of children in the preschool immersion class.In an attempt to address this, partial funding was acquiring from a private sourceto help with the operation of a summer immersion class.The summer immersion class could not operate, however, without findingadditional money. Parents of the children attending the immersion class de-cided that in order to make up the rest of the needed funds they would pay atuition to keep their children in the immersion class during the summer. Thesummer project ran for five weeks, three hours a day, three days a week on a$500 budget. Each parent paid a $20 tuition fee, and the instructors agreed towork for five dollars an hour. When realizing that the unemployment rate onthe reservation can exceed 80% during the summer months, the tuition paid by 25 Teaching Indigenous Languagesthe parents was probably one of the most significant acts of support ever givento a reservation program.Possibly impressed by the demonstration of parental support for the sum-mer class, the Wyoming Council for the Humanities agreed to fund the projectfrom September 1994 to mid-May 1995. The 1994/1995 project year ran threehours a day, Monday to Friday. It was calculated that the total number of lan-guage contact hours during this time period would amount to approximately456 hours. In spite of this increase, I was still very aware that if we hoped todevelop fluent speakers from among the children, the project needed to operateat least six hours a day. Satisfaction was nevertheless drawn from knowing thatthe increase in time reflected movement in the right direction.Troubleshooting problems and moving to a full-day immersion classOne of the problems that seems to face many of our language instructors isa belief that in order for students to learn an Indian language they have to al-ways be given English meanings for what is being said to them in \"Indian.\"This stood as a consistent problem with the language instructors in the Arapahoimmersion class. In spite of numerous explanations and signs announcing \"NoEnglish Spoken,\" each of the times I visited the class it was common for me tohear instructors speaking English. This made me speculate that although thelanguage instructors knew the project's goals, they still lacked a firm commit-ment to the methods needed to instruct within an immersion setting. I con-stantly tried to convince the instructors of the absolute necessity of not speak-ing English to the children. From their perspective, however, because they ob-served more Arapaho spoken by children in the immersion class than they hadever heard from any other child, they remained quietly convinced that it wasdue to their mixing English and Arapaho when they spoke to the children.In an attempt to get the children exposed to more Arapaho, the languageclass was expanded to six hours a day, made possible by grants from the Wyo-ming Council for the Humanities and Lannan Foundation. In addition, a direc-tor was hired to locally oversee the project. The primary goals of the expandedclass were for the instructors to use no English with the children and to get thechildren to achieve a higher level of language competency.After the class started, I was not able to observe how things were goinguntil mid-December 1995. When I walked into the class I was overwhelmed bythe children's speaking ability in Arapaho. In a matter of three and a half monthsthe children had mastered enough Arapaho that they could collectively interactwith the language instructors for ten to 15 minutes without speaking English. Iviewed the class with renewed enthusiasm and believed that by the end of theschool year children would surely be demonstrating speaking skills that bor-dered upon fluency.By the time April 1996 arrived it was clear that the children were not evenclose to fluency. After such demonstrated promise in December, the questionthat remained was: Why weren't the children on the threshold of fluency? Whilethe children possessed very impressive speaking abilities in Arapaho, abilities 2640 Teaching Indigenous Languagesthat enabled them to pray and respond to a wide range of questions, tasks, andcommands, they still did not possess an ability to speak Arapaho outside ofwhat was directly taught to them within the classroom. The task became toassess the problem and make corrections.What the children lacked was the ability to independently use and manipu-late new speech forms. Simply put, they lacked the ability to use Arapaho tospeak what was on their minds. They could only speak phrases that they hadbeen directly taught. Again it became clear that what was missing was an un-derstanding, implementation, and effective use of a methodology that couldguide language learners to true language acquisition and fluency. To addressthe problem I decided to bring in an immersion technician from the HawaiianPunana Leo language immersion system for the following school year. The des-ignated task of the \"immersion trainer\" was to observe the classroom on a dailybasis and then provide the staff with guidance and training in proven immer-sion techniques. The new problem this created was finding additional fundingsupport so the immersion trainer could be brought in.Expanding and strengthening the programIn January 1996, I was called by the Arapaho Tribal Council about theprospect of my writing and Administration for Native Americans (ANA) grant.I thus set myself to writing a grant proposal to start up a second language im-mersion class on another part of the reservation about seventeen miles away inthe Arapaho district. In addition to this grant proposal went the task of writinggrants for the continuation of the already existing immersion class in the Ethetedistrict and finding money to pay for the immersion trainer. Much to our reliefall grants were awarded and additional money was found to bring in the trainer.While it turned out to be a benefit to have two immersion classes operat-ing, it initially was difficult staffing them. Fortunately, an interview processhad been worked out in 1994 when the first half-day immersion class wereimplemented. In an effort to identify the strongest staff for the language posi-tions, people being interviewed were asked to teach a shortened version of animmersion class day. In their videotaped 40 minute demonstration lesson theywere told to speak only Arapaho. A plus was given for following the outlinedschedule of tasks or creatively leading the children through other tasks in Arapahoand a minus was given each time they spoke English. The pluses and minuseswere added up, and the individuals with the strongest scores were offered posi-tions. In spite of very promising demonstrations, over the years the need re-mained for proper training in the techniques of immersion. It was fortunatehowever that from out of those hired an individual emerged who had promisingnatural teaching skills and who had also filled in as a substitute from time totime for the Ethete immersion class. What resulted for the second class was avery dynamic instructor who was familiar with the philosophy and approach ofthe immersion effort who was joined by two other strong instructors.In the initial months of the immersion classes the trainer worked on layingdown a strong understanding of language instructional techniques that could 27 Teaching Indigenous Languageshelp move children attending the language classes toward fluency. His obser-vations revealed that the children in the newest class in the Arapaho districtwere making rapid advancements, and his comments led me to videotape theclass. I had been impressed with the progress of the Ethete class in December1995, but I was left speechless in November 1996 by the amount of Arapaho Iheard from the children attending the immersion class in the Arapaho district.The second class in the Arapaho district began operation on October 6. Iarrived four weeks later on November 7 to observe the class and during mythree hours of observations I assessed that the children had spent about 90% oftheir time speaking Arapaho. In addition to this I was greatly impressed by thefact that on a number of occasions I heard different children speaking Arapahoto one another without the assistance or intervention of the language instruc-tors. An example of this was that on one occasion when a child had been hurt,she ran crying to the instructor speaking Arapaho instead of English! On an-other occasion after a child had been hit by a large playground ball, he jumpedup and said to the child who had thrown the ball \"You're bad!\" in Arapaho.Each time I listened to the tape I became aware that children in the background,who were not the focus of the camera's lens, were using Arapaho phrases ontheir own and among themselves without the prompting of the instructors.The strong start of the class led me to hope that the elusive goal of fluencyamong the immersion class children would be realized. Unfortunately, as inprevious years, while the children of both immersion classes were speaking farmore Arapaho than children had mastered the year before, they still were onlyusing the language within the confines of what they had been exposed to, andthat, when compared to the fullness of the entire Arapaho language, was verylimited. Again, the key that seemed to be lacking was an understanding of thatfacet of language acquisition that allows children to begin to independently useand manipulate language on their own. Thus, it is not enough simply to teachchildren language phrases. If the objective is for children to acquire our nativelanguages, then children must be exposed to every facet of whatever nativelanguage they are meant to acquire. This means that by learning several hun-dred phrases we cannot expect that language learners will somehow magicallyacquire an ability to speak in a passive voice or to form questions in a negative,future or past tense if they have never been exposed to such speech forms.The only way to get children to speak in such a full manner is to systemati-cally expose them to speech forms in a way that requires them to not only hearthe usage of such forms but also requires them to verbally respond to suchspeech acts by using a full array of speech forms. Again, this does not meanthat they will some how magically begin to demonstrate a fluent use of speechforms if they are not systematically led to such forms of language use. Therealization of this means that one of the tasks of the instructor is to work withan absolutely thorough understanding of their own language, with all of itsnuances and complexities, so that the language instructor can very systemati-cally bring these speech forms out when speaking to developing speakers andgetting developing speakers to speak back to them. An example of this can be4228 Teaching Indigenous Languagesillustrated with the following. When giving one speech form, such as \"Are youhungry?\" Children are usually taught to respond by saying \"I am hungry.\" Buthow many of our language instructors go beyond this so that developing speak-ers learn how to express such things as \"I am hungry now but I am not going tobe hungry later\" or \"I am not hungry but I should eat\" or \"Yesterday when I wasasked if I was hungry I wasn't really hungry but after my teacher asked me I gothungry so I ate\" or \"When teacher asked my friend if he was hungry it made mehungry\" or \"I am not going to eat because I am not hungry\" or \"Yesterday Iwasn't hungry but I still ate, but tomorrow if I am not hungry I am not going toeat\" or \"Tomorrow I am going to eat even if I am not hungry because beforewhen I didn't eat I quickly got hungry.\" Thus, by having an absolute thoroughunderstanding of ones own language, a single phrase like; Are you hungry? cangenerate an almost endless array of speech forms that include expressions infirst, second, or third person singular and plural, conditional (\"They might helpus if we feed them first\"), and negative forms of statements such as \"Can't wego swimming\" or \"Why can't we go swimming?\" or \"I would have gone swim-ming but because one of them said I couldn't swim very fast and my girl friend'seyes were crossed I did not want to go with them.\"For those who would wonder why anyone should have to worry aboutwhether someone should actually be able to say such things, the response isthat it is because of the fact that a speaker possesses the ability to go beyondsaying isolated words and phrases to say such things, and much much more,that they are recognized as fluent. Furthermore, if we cannot pass on to ourdeveloping speakers this ability our languages will be lost. Therefore, if we areto maintain any hope of keeping our languages viable and alive, it remainsabsolutely essential that we shift our focus from teaching our children wordsand phrases to passing on to them the ability to think and effectively communi-cate in our native languages.The next stepBy May 1997 the immersion program had still not produced a child withany level of fluency in the Arapaho language. After assessing the class andother unsuccessful language efforts, it appears that having a clear understand-ing of how language is acquired is a crucial link in getting children to actuallyacquire the languages being taught. Thus, the need for effective teacher train-ing still remains a key issue in achieving a successful level of operation forlanguage immersion classes. In observing successful indigenous language im-mersion efforts, one of the factors that has consistently contributed to theirsuccess is that they are being primarily staffed by second language learners.This success is most likely the result of these individuals having effectivelyinternalized the language learning process based on their own experience andsuccess, a factor that seems to elude most speakers who have acquired theirlanguages as first language speakers.At the time of this writing, I am in New Zealand to examine the enormoussuccess of Maori immersion efforts. In a revitalization effort that states \"lan- 29 Teaching Indigenous Languagesguage from the breast,\" Maori people now have numerous examples of chil-dren who are speaking Maori as their first language. Much to their credit, theseachievements have not fostered complacency among them. In the course oftheir language revitalization work they have developed primary schools, sec-ondary schools, and even universities of their own in which Maori is the pri-mary language of communication. While here I have also learned of their in-tensive adult language immersion work, and it is here where I believe Indig-enous North Americans might receive the most benefit.As the Arapaho language immersion effort looks to move on to the nextstep, developing an arrangement with the Maori may be the natural thing to do.By offering very intensive week-long immersion classes at the end of eachmonth, the Maori have been very successful in developing waves of adult sec-ond language learners. The idea is that since these classes are so effective, thenby having an instructor attend a week-long class, with perhaps a second week-long follow-up class on actual methodology, our language instructors couldinternalize the methods that are enabling adults to become proficient languagespeakers as second language learners. The logic of such an approach wouldseem more favorable then trying to send our Elder speakers through a year ortwo of the standard university-level teacher training. I plan to attend one ofthese classes in October 1997 to assess the viability of using similar classes totrain Arapaho language instructors.The second approach stems from the Maori philosophy of language fromthe breast. This approach involves starting language classes for mothers andtheir 16 to 24 month old children. These immersion classes would focus on thelanguage needs of theinfants and their mothers in such a way as to develop thelanguage skills of both. Thus in a relatively short period of time the emergenceof the infant's language could serve as a motivational factor for the mothers toencourage them to develop their own language skills. By focusing on these twogroups of language learners, two things could occur. One, we could hope toprepare a younger group of fluent speakers to carry on as the next generation oflanguage teachers, and two, infants could emerge as first language speakerswho could serve to aid in the continued effort to reestablish our native languageas a viable and healthy language. 4430 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesTeaching Children to \"Unlearn\" the Sounds of EnglishVeronica Carpenter This paper discusses the incorporation of linguistics into an Ameri-can Indian language program. Second language teachers need to un-derstand the importance of methods and strategies that help studentsto recognize how the sounds and structure of their first language dif-fer from other languages, especially a tribal language they are at-tempting to learn. My focus is not on teaching any particular indig-enous language or dialect, but on teaching children and adults to rec-ognize how the sounds of the English language interfere with learningthe correct pronunciations of sounds in a tribal language they arelearning. Perhaps more than children, adults can benefit from thisapproach because of the unique issues of adult education, such thatclasses meet fewer times a week and minimal teacher availability. Thiscan result in adult students having more difficulty learning, retaining,and producing new language sounds. The majority of American Indian children are first language English speak-ers. English is being spoken in their homes, on the playground, and on televi-sion. Only remnants of indigenous language phrases are being carried on, andfewer children have much exposure to their ancestral language. The fact thatthe dominant language in this country is English and thai4children from coast tocoast are speaking it as a first language can offer us a unique strategy for teach-ing an indigenous language as a second language. By incorporating a formalintroduction to linguistics, we can practice methods to-help children \"unlearn\"English or aspects of English that interfere with second language acquisition.These methods can be shared with all indigenous language programs.When one learns a second language, the interference between the soundsand grammar of one's first language, usually English in the United States, andthe new language hinder progress in learning that new language. There arestrategies for children and adults that can enhance language retention and ad-dress the problem of how English influences an indigenous language beinglearned as a second language. The concept of incorporating linguistics in thelanguage class has exciting possibilities because the students become aware ofhow the brain and vocal tract work together to produce the specific characteris-tics of their own first language. This technique productively redirects that aware-ness to facilitate second language acquisition. These methods, as they are imple-mented and tested, can be shared with all indigenous language programs aroundthe country. BEST COPY AVAILABLE 31 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesLinguistic applicationLinguistics is the study of language, and its four major areas of study arephonology, morphology, semantics, and syntax. This paper examines the im-portance of incorporating phonetics and phonology into an American Indianlanguage program as the primary linguistic application for second languageacquisition. During the past three years, I visited several indigenous languageprograms, including the Houlton Band of Mis-sion School on the Rosebud Reservation, South Dakota; the Northern PoncaTribe of Nebraska in Niobrara, Nebraska; several families from the Santee Res-ervation in Nebraska; and the Hocak Culture and Language Center in Wiscon-sin Dells, Wisconsin. I informally interviewed residents, teachers, administra-tors, and language center directors. We discussed various issues and concernssurrounding their language programs. Whether the focus was in-place languageprograms or support for language revitalization programs, the primary concernwas for language preservation. The second concern was in preserving the lan-guage in its original form. Pronunciation, expression, and grammar are the ar-eas of speech most affected by the influence of a primary language. In myresearch, there were three common concerns expressed by the people I inter-viewed.First, there were concerns about family dynamics. Children are going homeand trying to \"speak Indian,\" but they do not speak it well enough to be under-stood by grandparents. Parents are not fluent speakers themselves and do notknow how to address the language barrier. Families become frustrated and con-fused, and children often refuse to speak for fear of rejection or ridicule. Sec-ond, there are application problem concerns. Children are leaving the class-room and trying to produce the indigenous language on their own (whether inreading aloud or play conversation) using the only rules for speech that theyknowthose for English. Third, are concerns about teacher availability. Adulteducation programs are being taught by non-indigenous language teachers whosefirst language is English. The teachers speak with English influencing theirintonation, pronunciation of consonant clusters, and stress placement. Studentsare therefore learning a new dialect rather than the language spoken by theirforefathers.These common problems have been discussed at length within the reserva-tions and tribal offices where I visited. All sites had established or were in theprocess of establishing indigenous language programs. Representatives of tribeswith established language programs who spoke dialects within the same lan-guage family supported and encouraged other related tribes who were just be-ginning their language revitalization program. By sharing their successes andfailures, different language programs were able to work to improve the qualityof their language instruction. 432 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesPhoneticsPhonetics is the study of how speech sounds are produced or articulated inthe vocal tract. A simple introduction to phonetics can help children distinguishbetween the sounds in their first and second languages. By teaching students toidentify the parts of the vocal tract such as the tongue, teeth, lips, vocal cords,alveolar ridge, palate, velum, nasal cavity, and so forth, children can identifythose sounds in tribal languages that are not a part of the English sound systemas well as those sounds that are a part of the English sound system. Even chil-dren who are in preschool can learn to identify the parts of the oral cavity aseasily as a one year old can identify where the eyes, nose, and mouth are lo-cated.The process of teaching phonetics can be modified in a language programfor each level of learning. During the early years of school, the obvious ap-proach would be games or activities. As a child begins to bring reading skillsinto the learning process, activity workbooks can be applied as a teachingmethod. By the time a child is at the high school level, a detailed phoneticscourse could be added to the language program. Why is it important for chil-dren to learn about the sound system? Simply put, languages around the globeare different. When a person begins to learn a second language during schoolyears, they will be learning from people who are explaining most of the courseor program in the primary language of the student. It is completely natural to leta first language influence the sounds and pronunciation of a second language.The problem is that the speaker is generally unaware that this phenomenon istaking place. This means that we often think we are producing sounds of alanguage as they are supposed to be pronounced but in fact, we are not.A well known example of this kind of language interference is how a Japa-nese speaker will pronounce an English /1/ as /r/. The sounds are not perceivedby a Japanese speaker as being different sounds because they do not discrimi-nate the two. Thus, the pronunciation of English words with /1/ or In becomesaltered. Other examples of this phenomenon is how a French speaker will pro-nounce an English /th/ as /d/, or how a Spanish speaker will pronounce anEnglish /v/ as /b/. Once again, these sounds are not perceived as being differentby the speaker.In keeping with language preservation, we must consider the effects thatperception can have on an indigenous language if speakers are not formallytaught how to recognize and produce those sounds that are not familiar to theEnglish language speaker. For a child who grows up learning only one lan-guage, categorical perception of language sounds is limited to the one languagethus making it difficult to learn new pronunciations during adulthood. How-ever, children who grow up bilingual or multilingual have a greater range ofcategorical perception and can learn to speak an additional language as adultswith little chance of an \"accent\" from their native language. Unfortunately, themajority of children in indigenous language programs are indeed monolingualand the adults in indigenous language programs face \"accent\" problems owingto the influence of English. 334-1 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesPhonologic acquisitionTo understand the importance of incorporating a formal introduction tophonetics and phonology in second language acquisition, we can turn to thework of Patricia Kuhl (see Kuhl et al., 1992) at the University of Washington.Her study involves human infants and the critical period in which children ab-sorb and retain the sounds of their environment. When human infants are born,they have the capacity to hear, retain, and eventually reproduce the sounds ofspeech in their linguistic environment. In other words, it doesn't matter if chil-dren are going to be monolingual, bilingual, or multilingual, they are capableof learning whatever sounds they will need to learn in order to communicate inthe language or languages of their environment.In her experiment, Dr. Kuhl tested six-month-old infants to determine ifthey are drawn to sounds from their linguistic experience. If they were able torecognize sounds within their linguistic experience or sounds in their languageenvironment, it was predicted that the infants would hear and respond to thesesounds. Sixty-four infants were tested, 32 in the United States and 32 in Swe-den. All components of the experiment remained the same in the two countries.The same computer equipment, experimenters, and speech testing apparatuswere used for all 64 infants. Two vowel sounds were used in this experiment.One from American English and one from Swedish. It was predicted that theAmerican infants would exhibit a stronger response for the American Englishvowel and the Swedish infants would exhibit a stronger response for the Swed-ish vowel.The results showed that indeed the infants at six-months-old recognizedthe sounds from their native language and were drawn to those vowel sounds intheir language environment. Their linguistic experience or the language of theirenvironment had altered their phonetic perception. Their categorical percep-tion for sounds needed for communication had already been established. Thus,infants at six months old have already learned and retained the sounds they willneed in their linguistic environment. At six months old, children can alreadyidentify and respond to sounds within their linguistic experience as those soundsare presented to them. With this kind of information, we can begin to under-stand how a native language can influence our ability to learn a second lan-guage. In other words, by the time a child is in preschool, their language soundsystem is well in place, which means that second language acquisition becomesa challenge particularly for children who have never been exposed to the sec-ond language being learned. Thus, the challenges for adults who are learning asecond language, in spite of the commitment to language preservation, becomemore apparent. Learning to produce sounds in the second language that are notwithin the sound system of the native language requires years of practice.PhonologyPhonology is the study of sound patterns in a language. The grammar oflanguage includes rules of phonology that determine how to pronounce soundsto form words. We have already learned that children are able to recognize 3443 Teaching Indigenous Languagessounds within the language of their environment very early in language acqui-sition. Now we can begin to examine how children acquire those sounds inspeech production. By understanding this process, we can learn to design anddevelop teaching methods giving students concrete information that will helpthem to be aware of and recognize the phonological rules that they use every-day.In order to teach native English speaking students about the phonologicalrules of the English language, it is important to review the primary stage of firstlanguage production. A brief review of the one-word stage can assist studentsin understanding how phonological rules of a first language are initially pro-duced. The following is a study of a 23 month old female subject whose speechproduction was in the one-word stage. Examples of phonologic production,omission, and substitution give a clear indication that this subject is demon-strating an understanding of phonological rules of the English language. Byreviewing the initial stages of language production, students can gain an in-creased awareness of how native language sound patterns are learned and howthey are distinct from other languages. The student can then learn to distinguishsound patterns between first and second languages, thereby diminishing theinfluence of the first language on second language acquisition.First, there is the one-word stage. When children are about three or fourmonths of age, they begin to coo and babble sounds. This manner of soundproduction continues until the child enters the next phase of sound productionbetween nine and twelve months. During this period there will usually be arecognizable rising and falling intonation in the sound production, but the bab-bling usually remains unrecognizable even to the parents. This does not meanthat the child is not communicating with the parents, on the contrary, it simplymeans that the child is not yet communicating with recognizable speech. Bythe time children reach their first year, they are usually beginning to utter theirfirst words and enter into the one-word stage. Some children stop the babblingphase when their first words appear, but some children continue to babble withwonderfully expressive intonation. Because of intonation cues, some recogniz-able sounds, and the one-word stage, parents become fluent in Child-Englishduring the first year of speech production. Children are seldom held back fromcommunicating their desires simply from lack of phrases. However, it does nottake long before children demonstrate knowledge of phonological rules in theirnative language during speech production.In 1993, I investigated the language abilities of Phoebe, a one year oldfemale, by recording her speech one week before her second birthday. I usedspontaneous production with Phoebe because she was very comfortable withme and seemed eager enough to speak freely. The recording was done in herhome with her family present. I spent a few minutes asking Phoebe to identifytoys from her toy box and then to identify animals from a book in her toy box.She did not know all of the animals from the book though she did repeat someof their names after I recited them. She did not attempt to repeat others such as\"giraffe,\" which I thought might be difficult sounds for her judging by the look 35. Teaching Indigenous Languageson her face when she tried to say the /j/ sound in \"giraffe.\" Phoebe becamebored with this identifying game and began to wander the house, talked to herbaby brother for a while, and then went outdoors where she demonstrated herability to recite one word phrases. This is where the tape ends.Although she was not able to pronounce all of the English speech sounds,she was very easy to understand. Phoebe substituted the (palatal liquid) In soundfor the (velar glide) /w/ sound. This was evident when she identified \"wabbit\"for \"rabbit.\" She also substituted the (alveolar liquid) /1/ sound for the (velarglide) /w/ sound when using the word \"milk\" which sounded like \"miwk.\"Phoebe did not produce such sounds as /j/ or /f/ as when I asked her to say theword \"giraffe\" (Her face looked as though she wanted to try but could notfigure the sounds out.). She also did not produce the (voiced interdental fricative)/th/ sound as it was omitted from her words \"bathing suit,\" which she herpronunciation of suit\" \"baying zoot.\" bilabial stops (\"mommy,\" \"baby,\" and \"poop\" were all very clear) nordid she have any problem with the velar stops, both voiced and voiceless (\"go\"and \"monkey\" were very clear).Phoebe was able to pronounce six of the twelve English vowel sounds andwas in the one-word stage. She easily identified many objects with individualwords and used many one word phrases such as \"no,\" \"uh-oh,\" \"don't,\" and\"yeah.\" Phoebe's ability to use single word phrases for many different circum-stances led me to believe that she was using words that have meaning. I believethat this was not a babbling phase that she was demonstrating. She showed nosigns of babbling at all. However, Phoebe did show signs of entering the two-word stage as when she said \"baby cute\" and \"Mommy, bathing suit,\" meaning\"Baby, you're cute\" I want my bathing suit.\" These were theonly exceptions of anything more than the one-word stage. She identified ob-jects with one word, let her feelings be known with one word (no!, Mommy!,yeah!), and called people to come to her with one word.During this taping, Phoebe did not babble to herself. However, when shedid speak she used expected intonation and stresses on her words. She correctlystressed the first syllable of \"horsie\" and \"pocketbook.\" She raised her voicewhen she was questioning, lowered her tone when she was identifying objects(declarative), and kept an even tone when she was forceful (\"No, don't\"). Sheeffectively communicated frustration, anger, command, nurturing, and happi-ness in the words that she chose and successfully made the transition frombabbling to the one-word stage. Her phonology seemed to be normal for herage group, and she communicated with a limited lexicon but effectively andaccurately for her needs. This taping seemed to indicate that Phoebe was com-prehending speech much faster than she was producing speech. At one weekfrom her second birthday, she effectively used the sounds of her language forcommunication.5036 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesBy observing her facial expressions, it was clear that certain sounds weredifficult for her and that she had not yet acquired them. However, she knewwhat sounds were needed for the words she wanted to use and produced a simi-lar sound in their place. This was clear when she used /w/ in (wabbit) for In in(rabbit). As with all language acquisition, it was just a matter of time and prac-tice before she acquired those sounds. Phoebe's language acquisition was farbeyond sound production although her vocal tract was not developed enough toaccommodate her understanding for the sounds of her language. She demon-strated an understanding of semantics (communicating meaning), pragmatics(conversation), and syntax.Second language acquisitionAs we learned above, an infant's ability to recognize the sounds of thelanguage of the environment happens very early in life. Their ability to producethose sounds becomes apparent within the next few years of life. There arealways temporary problems associated with sound production such as loss ofteeth and \"baby talk,\" but children establish native language rules of phonol-ogy, morphology, semantics, and syntax by the time they are in school. Thispresents good reason for teaching children about language. Linguistics can pro-vide the tools for helping children to realize what they already know aboutlanguage.Language realization is the key to preventing children learning a secondlanguage from being influenced by their first language. In second languageacquisition, children can often be confused by sounds, intonation, stress place-ments, and so forth and will often revert to English rules concerning these areaswithout an awareness that this phenomenon is taking place. There is often frus-tration, and sometimes classroom withdrawal can develop in second languagelearning simply because the child is not \"getting it\" in pronunciation, verb con-struction, or even just lexical memorization. It is important to teach a childwhat they do know about language and then help them to eliminate those partsof the English language that do not apply to the language being learned. Forexample, children know that /m/ does not start a consonant cluster at the begin-ning of a word in the English language. You cannot use an /m/ with an /1/ or a /g/ or a /k/. Children know this English phonological rule. However, in the West-ern Abenaki dialect (part of the Algonquian language family) you can start aword with a consonant cluster that starts with an /m/. A word can begin with an\"mk\" and that is unfamiliar to the English language. In learning Abenaki as asecond language, children would pronounce this consonant cluster as \"muk\"(this is known as a schwa insertion) as English rules of phonology would pre-dict, but the Abenaki word in its original form would be pronounced mmmmk(mmm as in \"MMM, that's good!\") with a /k/ sound on the end. Because this isan unfamiliar consonant cluster for a native English speaker, the rules of pho-nology from the English language would alter the Abenaki word from its origi-nal form. Thus, indigenous language word pronunciation is altered and influ- 3751 Teaching Indigenous Languagesenced by the way children first learned to pronounce the sounds of the Englishlanguage.I recently conducted an experiment in which a list of forty Abenaki wordswere given to native English, non-Indian speakers who were asked to read thewords aloud. Most of these words contain such consonant clusters as the \"MK\"phenomenon, and it was expected that the readers would insert a schwa soundas English rules of phonology would predict. The readings were taped. Theschwa insertion and other phonological rules of the English language were usedby the subjects as they read the Abenaki words as predicted. The consonantclusters and phoneme placements unfamiliar to the English language were in-deed influenced by English phonological rules. This experiment gives supportto the realities of indigenous languages (as second languages) being influencedand altered by native language rules. In order to preserve indigenous languagesin their original form, students must be taught an awareness for their nativelanguage. Students must understand what sounds from their native language donot transfer into the language being learned, and they must learn to recognizewhen the native language is interfering with the second language pronuncia-tion.Methods and strategiesIn education, especially for our purposes, there are three groups of stu-dents to consider when examining methods and strategies: preschoolers, read-ers, and adults. Preschoolers, categorized as nonreaders, require non-readingor beginning-reading activities and games for second language acquisition in-struction. For this purpose, a puppet that I designed specifically for secondlanguage learning has been used to help young students learn about the vocaltract. The mouth of the puppet is color-coded for easy identification for bothteacher and student. Students learn to identify the parts of the color-coded mouthbecause they will help the puppet to make sounds in English and in the newlanguage being learned. The tongue is detachable with bits of velcro attachedso that teachers and students can manipulate the tongue to those parts of themouth that it would touch when making certain sounds. Different shapes of lipsare also available for the student to choose from and attach to the mouth whenmaking different sounds.The teacher helps the students identify which sounds in English are not apart of the sound system of the indigenous language. For example, the pho-neme /a/ in English has many allophones (different sounds for a phoneme), butin an indigenous language there may be only one sound for the phoneme /a/.The students then learn what /a/ sounds are not part of the indigenous languageand therefore will not produce those sounds in later years when reading orspeaking in the indigenous language.When students begin to read, other methods can be used that produce thesame results. Workbooks can be used for the classroom that have Englishallophones of the phoneme /a/. For the student's benefit, pictures can be in-cluded that have the /a/ sound associated with it. For example, on a workbook5238 Teaching Indigenous Languagespage, students will have between two and four animal pictures to look at. Eachanimal has a different /a/ sound associated with it, such as alligator and swan.The student then determines which /a/ sound is not associated with the indig-enous language being learned and will 'successfully pronounce the second lan-guage vowel sounds without English vowel sound influence. Students shouldbe encouraged to create these workbooks in the classroom using characters,animals, or everyday items that are familiar to them. This will help the child tostimulate their imagination in recognizing vowel sounds in any words that theyencounter. The inevitable results will be that students will then be able to elimi-nate English sounds where they are not transferable into the indigenous lan-guage, thus preserving the second language sound system.ConclusionThe acquisition of a second language is highly dependent on the under-standing of the student's first language. It is critical to language preservation toexplicitly teach students the differences between the two languages being spo-ken. When children are learning a second language primarily in a school set-ting, the exposure to that language is minimal and the native language dominat-ing the acquisition of the second language is inevitable. Adult education facesthe same dilemma. Incorporating a linguistic background into a language cur-riculum can eliminate many delays. A simple phonetics and phonology pro-gram can give students of any age the mechanics of language production thatthey need to help eliminate the influence of English as they learn their triballanguage. The most important factor is that this method or curriculum, onceproven successful, can be utilized by any indigenous language program be-cause it addresses the English language and how to eliminate the influence ofEnglish from second language acquisition.

Sci-ence, 255, 606-608, 5339 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesLearning Ancestral Languages by Telephone:Creating Situations for Language UseAlice Taff This is a progress report on a group of adults who have been con-necting by phone to learn to speak Deg Xinag, of are the westernmostof peoples, living near the confluence of the Yukonand Innoko Rivers in Western Central Alaska. Since the number ofDeg Xinag speakers, all elders, is less than twenty and the learners,young adults, are spread amongst sites too distant to make it feasibleto get together face-to-face, we organized a one-credit distance deliv-ery class under the authority of the University of Alaska, Interior Cam-pusMcGrath Center. This paper describes the effort of a small lan-guage community to preserve its language orally, notes some of thebroader implications to be drawn from our experience, and tells astory or two. We have finished our second semester of teaching Deg Xinag by phone,meeting with fluent speakers for an hour once a week by audioconference. Ourspeakers provide us with phrases we don't yet know and guide us in pronounc-ing Deg Xinag. We call in from Anvik, Shageluk, McGrath, Fairbanks, andAnchorage in Alaska and Seattle, Washington.To set up the class, administrators at the McGrath campus advertised inrelevant communities, calling the schools and tribal offices. Interested studentsregistered by fax. Taking students' preferred meeting times into consideration,a weekly meeting schedule was set up with the Alaska Teleconferencing Net-work. This costs the University $18 per site. The student cost is $70 for this onecredit, but University of Alaska funding for Alaska Native Languages subsi-dized the course, reducing the cost to $25.Ideally, all class members in each community got to a central location andcalled the toll-free number using audioconference convening equipment, aspeaker box with microphones attached that is hooked to a phone jack. Alterna-tively, participants at one site used multiple handsets on one line in a house-hold. We found that speaker phones did not work well since their signal turnsoff and on during the speech stream. A good signal is very important since weare working with a language that relies heavily on its fifty consonants for ahigh percentage of its speech signal and some of the voiceless sounds such astth and tl did not come through very clearly.We started out our first semester with one speaker and learners in foursites. The first week we could hardly hear each other because the phone con-nection was so bad and we were not used to putting up with it. The next day our 5 440 Teaching Indigenous Languagesspeaker slipped on the ice outside her house, broke her ankle, was taken to thehospital, and was unavailable for the rest of the semester. The four learners inher village dropped the course owing to other crises there. Just before we wereto be shut down for low enrollment, two more speakers stepped in to help outso we were able to persevere. One met in Fairbanks with students calling infrom there, and the other met in Shageluk with those students. Students in theselocations had the advantage of contact with the speakers; they could really hearall the sounds of the language and get visual cues for pronunciation.The first semester we met twice a week for an hour and a half each session,but this proved difficult. Listening to a poor phone signal in a language we didnot understand for ninety minutes was a strain. In addition, people's scheduleswere too crowded to enable them to successfully meet three hours together andwork on homework six more hours per week. The second semester we metonce a week for a one hour class with two hours of homework per week, whichworked out better. The second semester the class was made up of four speakersworking with eight learners.Class activitiesWe started out by setting realistic individual language learning goals, tak-ing into account the actual time each person was able to devote to study. Stu-dents selected as their goals learning to perceive and produce the sounds of thelanguage in the context of common expressions and being able to use someexpressions in their daily routine.Basing our activities on the principle that children learn to talk withoutovert teaching of grammar and following the advice of another Athabaskanteacher, we limited our discussion of grammar. We did not learn lists of words,but concentrated instead on practicing whole phrases and sentences and usingthem in conversations. In other words, we chose to spend our time talking in-stead of analyzing how to talk or memorizing someone else's analysis.Each week we spent some time listening to our speakers converse so wehad a chance to hear real discourse taking place. After some weeks, we foundthat we began to understand some of what our speakers were saying to eachother. We practiced saying common conversational expressions following themodel of our fluent speakers. We have a literacy manual (Jerue, Maillelle, Hargus& Taff, 1993) with a list of common expressions that we used extensively thefirst semester to \"jump-start\" us. We used what we called a \"round table\" for-mat for this with everyone taking a turn at saying the word a number of speakers to model the words was especially valuable to ussince this gave us the opportunity to hear a range of possibilities for each utter-ance.Learners could \"pass up\" their turn if they chose, but they seldom did. Ourlanguage learning heroes are babies since they acquire language effortlessly sowe tried to follow their example and give ourselves plenty of time to listen toexpert speakers and treat our mispronunciations as acceptable babbling prac-tice, remembering that babies spend up to a year or so at this. Trying to developan environment in which learners were not afraid to make mistakes, we told thenewest members of our class the second semester that they were our babies. Wesaid, in effect, \"You are very important to us, and we don't expect you to beperfect. Just keep trying.\" Once we were practicing a form for 'no' that we hadfound difficult to remember and could not write even though it is short and hadseemed simple enough the previous week (It could be described as a long midlax front vowel with some nasalization that has an intonation peak followed bya glottal stop in its middle, similar to but not quite the same as an AmericanEnglish `uh, uh'). We had each taken our turn saying, \"Ehenh'eh,\" when weheard a tiny voice on the line chime in \" Ehenh'eh,\" right on cue. It was thetoddler of one of the class members, a real baby, listening and learning. We alllaughed in delight. Laughter set this word firmly in our memories. Now we donot need to write it to remember it. A baby helped us learn.When we had trouble repeating we asked \"Che yixudz didene.\" 'Pleasesay it again.' The round table repetition also helped clarify sounds that were cutoff as a result of imperfect phone connections. After many repeats, we couldpiece together all the words. These repetition drills served as warm-up exer-cises as we shifted from English to working with Deg Xinag. For warm-ups thesecond semester, we checked on forms from previous sessions that we were notsure of.After these round table warm-ups, we opened hiqi talk Deg Xinag), asking our speakers fortranslations so we could say the things we wanted to say to each other hear you.We used a few old phrases and a few new ones every week. By the end ofour hour, we were usually talking hard and did not want to hang up, but wewould say, r Teaching Indigenous LanguagesAgide yixudz. That's all.Ixudzan. Good-bye.Xisrigidisddhinh. I thank you.Then we frequently dialed each other so we could continue the conversation.Most class members took notes during class but had very little practicewith the writing system. I, as the teacher-of-record, who was really one of thelearners, summarized each class afterward in writing, included the new phraseswith their translations, checked spellings with the available resources, then faxedthis class summary to all students each week with an agenda for the next meet-ing. Every few weeks I compiled all the phrases into a list with translations,alphabetized the list for both Deg Xinag and English, and faxed this to stu-dents. We used these phrase lists to study from and to refer to during class tohelp us remember a phrase we had used before.Care with spelling was only important for us to make sure that we did notmiss any important sounds in the words. The relatively new writing systemrepresents each sound with a particular letter combination so spelling can helpwith pronunciation. However, we were not concentrating on learning to write`correctly.' We did not want to cripple the leaning process with too much writ-ing. A heavy dependence on writing can result in learners needing to visualizea word mentally in written form when they hear it before they can convert itssound to meaning. When they want to talk, writing dependent learners mayneed to 'write' and 'read' their utterances mentally before they can speak. Wemade speaking our primary activity and kept writing in the background. We didhave a few, brief discussions of grammar when we observed patterns arising inour phrases lists, for example, the order of subjects, objects, and verbs.The first semester we concluded by having students memorize a conversa-tion from Jerue et al. (1993) and perform it with a partner during the last class.The rationale for this was that students would be able to retain some large chunksof language to call on from memory.Second semester, each student chose an independent project. There was awide variety of projects since there was a wide range of both experience withthe language and personal interest in language use. Some of the projects were:Translation of a children's book from a sister language into DegXinag and publication of the book.Organizing some of the phrases we used in the class into coherentconversations in written form with audio recordings for future learn-ers.Making a list of twenty phrases to learn.Creating and taping a song to sing with children.The student with the song project had wanted for some time to find a DegXinag song she could sing with her child. When we brought this up during aclass, one of our speakers said, \"Well we can just make one up right now,\" and 43 Teaching Indigenous Languagesshe proceeded to do so. Our speaker reminded us that we are learning a livinglanguage, and we do not have to search history to find a song; we can createnew songs in Deg Xinag whenever we want.In addition to our speakers, the literacy manual Deg Xinag Dindlidik (Jerueet al., 1993) mentioned above, class summary faxes, and class phrase lists, wechecked words and phrases with a computerized stem list dictionary (Kari etal., in progress), a topical dictionary, Deg Xinag Noun Dictionary (Kari, 1978),and a computerized language learning program that focuses on sys-tem, Deg Xinag axa Nixodhil Ts'in' (Taff, 1994).EvaluationAt the end of the first semester, we reviewed our course goals to evaluateprogress. All students reported that they felt they had learned during the class.Some were using phrases with their children and with others in their villages,and some could pick out words when they had a chance to hear Deg Xinag.At the end of our second semester, we find ourselves gaining confidence inour improved pronunciation. We can extend greetings to each other and con-verse about the weather, inquire about and tell each other how we were feeling,and tell what we would like to eat (The class met right at suppertime). We areconversing about real concerns in our daily lives.Our most important resource is our speakers. Without them we could cer-tainly not be conducting the kind of learning experience where we can ask,\"How do I say...?\" Also invaluable is the telephone system that links us to-gether; we could not do without it, but that doesn't stop us from complainingthat it doesn't work perfectly! Our supportive university administrators haveenabled us to persist in this effort.The teaching material we have relied on most heavily is our literacy manual(Jerue et al., 1993), but we have learned that we could probably conduct theclass without any materials. We see that we are developing materials as we goalong by asking how to say what we want to say and recording these sentencesin our minds and on our tongues as well as on paper. We have discussed pos-sible ways to document all of our Deg Xinag conversations in audio and writ-ing for future users.Compared to a language learning environment where we have speakers ina community able to interact with us face-to-face, learning over the telephoneis a terrible situation. We cannot participate in physical activities. We cannotsee the faces, gestures, and other body language of our speakers. We have novisual cues about the meaning of the speech we are hearing and have to dependon translations into English to establish meaning for Deg Xinag utterances. Butcompared to no language learning situation, the telephone class experience iswonderful. It allows us the only opportunity most of us have to listen to andtalk with a group of fluent speakers.We recommend this distance delivery method as part of a larger languagelearning program or as a way of getting such a program started. Distance deliv- 344 Teaching Indigenous Languagesery language learning could be an effective method for follow-up after an in-tensive face-to-face class when participants disperse.ConclusionDuring our second semester, with inspiration drawn from the Fourth Stabi-lizing Indigenous Languages Symposium, we realized that we did more thanconduct a language class; we created a situation in which we speak Deg Xinag.In her discussion of Australian language revitalization, Jolly (1995) points outthat at the core of language revival efforts is the need for communities to estab-lish situations for language use. The value of this class as an opportunity tolearn Deg Xinag is probably overshadowed by the value of the class as anopportunity to use Deg Xinag. Reiterated throughout this conference has beenthe theme that communities faced with the loss of their ancestral language \"forthe first time,\" as remarked by keynote speaker Dick Littlebear, need to con-sciously create situations in which the language is used for real life activities.Talking on the phone is a real life activity.We are speaking Deg Xinag, not fluently and not often enough but morethan we would without our class. Our disadvantages include our separationfrom each other, less than perfect audio connections, and lack of time to com-mit to language learning. Our advantages are our desire to use Deg Xinag, ourkindly, tolerant speakers, the telephone system, our supportive university, andour written resources.The broader implication of our small effort is to recognize and encouragepossible situations for language use without waiting for outside experts to ana-lyze the language and develop materials. A simple solution to maintaining aspoken language is to speak it. The hard part, for many reasons addressed else-where, is getting ourselves to try.

Deg as Reading Teacher: Oral Tradition in the ClassroomArmando Heredia and Norbert Francis Legends, myths, folk tales, and stories have long been an impor-tant aspect of the history and culture of indigenous people; vehicles topreserve, carry, and teach historical events, religious beliefs, ethics,and values to the young and old. Ethnographers and students of folk-lore have described in detail and extensively analyzed the literary as-pects of oral tradition. However, despite the broad consensus on theartistic merits of traditional stories and the role they have played inthe linguistic and cultural continuity of indigenous peoples, they arelittle used in schools. This paper discusses the instructional uses oftraditional stories is meant to serve as a contribution to realizing theireducational potential. Story telling was a way of relating history, transmitting cultural knowl-edge, and giving expression to the esthetic and poetic endeavors of all NativeAmerican peoples. As Chief Standing Bear explained:Story-telling is an ancient profession, and these stories are among ouroldest possessions. For many years before the white man ever came toour homeland these legends were told over and over, and handed downfrom generation to generation. They were our books, our literature,and the memories of the storytellers were the leaves upon which theywere written. (quoted in Humishuma, 1990, p. 305)Erdoes and Ortiz (1984) refer to the 166 legends that they recorded as produc-tions from the heart and soul of the Native people of North America:Some have been told for thousands of years, and they are still beingtold and retold, reshaped and refitted to meet their audience's chang-ing needs, even created anew out of a contemporary man's or woman'svision. (p. xi)While authorship and possession were typically collective, as with all es-thetic and formal language use, special conditions and contexts of performance,the narrator's qualifications, and even, in some circumstances, strict require-ments of execution and replication were observed. For example, Plains Indiansfollowed prescribed procedures specifically identifying persons for conservingand sharing stories, who \"owned\" and protected individual story bundles. Whenthe time was right, transfer of the story bundles would be carefully transactedby a process that involved formal instruction and preparation (Lankford, 1987). 6 046 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesClearly, oral esthetic, ceremonial, and formal genres depart from the context-embedded registers of everyday casual conversation in a similar way that theirwritten counterparts differ from situation-dependent graphic messages.Oral tradition and writingIt is important to note that the indigenous cultures of the Americas werenot complete strangers to complex systems of graphic representation when theEuropeans introduced alphabetic writing in the 16th Century. The Maya wereevidently the most advanced in this area, with the Aztecs not far behind withtheir hybrid system that clearly was evolving toward true writing (the represen-tation of units of language in graphic form). Montemayor (1993) compares thetwo systems:Mayan writing, the closest to what we would define as a [true] writingsystem, and Nahuatl, had at and homonyms, or rather homophonic suffixes and endings.These pictographs and symbols not only represented ideas, but alsosounds and sound patterns, which presupposes the capacity not onlyto recognize parts of words, but also the ability to recognize homo-phonic relationships among these parts and among other words. Writ-ing was employed by priests, nobles and specialized scribes, and itsorigin and functions were closely tied to religion. (p. 22)At the time of the European contact, many of the tribes to the North had alreadyexperimented with various pictographic, iconic, and mnemonic systems.Lankford notes:Europeans had early commented on the wampum (bead) belts used byspeakers at formal councils to remind themselves of the historical ormythical episodes they were to tell; in the Plains the same deviceswere used, but they seem to have been more usually painted on skin.Both practices seem to have existed in the Southeast. (1987, p. 47)However, a full account of pre-Columbian writing will never be availablebecause of the massive destruction of bibliographical and archival data duringthe Conquest. While the greater part of the material was surely lost, significantportions of the historical record and much of the poetic and narrative traditionwas preserved orally.The interest in indigenous narratives and poetry actually dates to the pe-riod immediately following the Conquest as missionaries and religious schol-ars began to take stock of the devastating loss to scientific and cultural knowl-edge that had already been irrevocably consummated. The compilation, tran-scription, and publication of indigenous oral tradition has continued to this day.More recently with the resurgence of interest in preserving the Native languages 47 Teaching Indigenous Languagesof the Americans, original editions have begun to be prepared, in many cases,without translation.Critics of oral tradition transcription have pointed to the vastly differingcontexts of oral performance on the one hand and the conventions of writtenlanguage on the otherthe collective and interactive processes that mediatetext construction between narrator and audience versus the isolated anddecontextualized encoding of the writer. However, despite the modificationsthat transcription entails (adjusting, for example, for the absence of an immedi-ate and physically present audience and the loss of certain discourse resourcesavailable only to the narratorprosody, deixis, and so forth), both historicalevidence and our own experience in compilation and transcription have dem-onstrated, we believe, that the alleged discontinuities have been entirely over-stated. In any case, transcribed and edited versions of oral narrative are notmeant to capture the singularly interactive features of face-to-face performance.On the one hand, the formal and artistic genres of traditional cultures approxi-mate in significant ways the planned, and peculiarly structured discourse thatcharacterizes most (but, again, not all) written expression. And on the otherhand, edited versions, in print (which need not in any fundamental way implythe displacement of oral forms) offer the reader/listener new options that wewill briefly explore in the following sections.Narrative structure of the storiesThe very selective survey of coyote stories presented below highlights thevast classroom potential of this branch of oral tradition. Even a very introduc-tory study and analysis of their literary aspects by teachers would enrich anyreading and language arts program. But in particular, incorporating this aware-ness into teaching practice would be an essential component of bilingual lan-guage revitalization programs involving the teaching of indigenous languages.From our own rather summary examination of the material, teaching applica-tions would seem to fall into two broad areas of school-based language learn-ing: 1.the development of academic discourse proficienciesthe narra-tive being an \"early form\" in terms of its acquisition in youngchildren. Teaching language and reading comprehension skillsthrough sustained exposure and direct instruction is ideally real-ized in both the indigenous language (original versions) and thenational language, separately, and in the respective instructionalcontexts and classroom domains.''For many indigenous students, their first language has become the lan-guage of wider communication, the national language (Spanish, English,and so forth). In other cases, fewer and fewer in recent years, the indig-enous language remains the students' first language. 48 Teaching Indigenous Languages 2.the development of second language proficiency; in the originalversions for indigenous language revitalization purposes and intranslation for learning the national language by indigenous lan-guage dominant students.In our first example, the Colville-Okanogan story \"Coyote and the Buf-falo,\" scarcity of natural resources and their judicious exploitation is its theme.The reader/listener must infer from the character's actions which forces andtendencies they represent. Predictable conflicts and rivalries foreshadow theunstable resolution (Humishuma, 1990). The White Mountain Apache \"CoyoteGets Rich off the White Men\" (Erdoes & Ortiz, 1984) resembles a roller coasterride of crises and partial resolutions. One problem is solved only to be met withits sequel, each leaving one with the question: \"Have I been down this roadbefore?\" The series of unresolved conflicts maintains the required narrativetension typical of the coyote genre. From the literacy teaching point of view,forcing the reader/listener to reflect on the constant play of words and meta-phors, insinuation, half-truth, and outright deceit introduces an importantmetalinguistic activitydifferentiating between what characters say and mean(Torrence & Olson, 1987).Closely related to the say/mean distinction is the portrayal of Coyote'scomplex and ambiguous character. A literary feature usually associated withmodern fiction, especially the novel, is ambivalence and inner strife, a com-mon state of mind for our canine hero. Research on literacy development haspointed to the reader/listener's focus on and contemplation of characters' innerpsychological states, thoughts, and feelings as an important milestone towarddecontextualized comprehension strategies (Torrence & Olson, 1985). In \"TheStory of the Rabbit and his Uncle Coyote,\" (Sexton, 1992),and \"Coyote's Rabbit & Ortiz, 1984), the use of dra-matic irony presents but another opportunity for the emergent reader to recon-cile contradictions and disparities of all sorts.Heroism is unambiguously conferred upon our protagonist in the Dine ver-sion of \"Coy.ote Brings Fire\" (Newcomb & Zolbrod, 1993). The sequence ofbuilding conflicts and increasing tension, punctuated by the characteristic rhythmand tempo of the omnipresent parallel structures and recurring patterns, culmi-nates in Coyote's escape from the Fire Man. Throughout this and many othercoyote stories, the extensive recourse to metaphoric language (\"cloud of sparks,\"\"in the air waiting for a flame to blaze upward,\" \"showers of sparks\"), again,calls the reader/listener's attention to linguistic forms, the poetic functions ingeneral, and how words are good for more than just expressing referential mean-ing. Especially regarding the higher literacy proficiencies, the reader must beable to reflect on what words actually (i.e., that which is stipulated by the textitself) mean as opposed to the mere interpretation of what was intended, as incasual conversation (see Olson & Hildyard, 1983). 493 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesTwo contrasting examplesCoyote stories vary widely in their structural complexity, as well as the-matically. In this variability, precisely, lies their power as a genre, from thepedagogical point of view. We would like to call the reader's attention to twoparticularly illustrative examples, each exemplifying features that, respectively,lend themselves to our two broad language learning objectives: 1) the develop-ment of textual consciousness and literacy-related discourse competencies, and2) a source of second language comprehensible input.Coyote and the Shadow Peoplefor discourse competenceWhile the theme of the journey to the Land of the Dead in order to retrievea loved one is apparently universal among indigenous peoples, in \"Coyote andthe Shadow People\" coyote rises to truly heroic and humanlike proportions)The Death Spirit/Guide offers Coyote (who we find in the opening episodeweeping and lonely) the opportunity to be reunited with his wife. To our tragicfigure, he must repeat the classical admonition too many times: \"You must dowhatever I say, do not disobey\" (Ramsey, 1983).Guided through a series of images and illusions that Coyote (at first con-fused) must acknowledge as real, he is rewarded with the arrival at the longhousewhere he greets old friends. Upon being reunited with his wife and admonishedone last time not to touch her, he sets out on the return journey; the descentfrom the fifth mountain signaling the triumph over the Underworld. However,by the fourth encampment, the wife's apparition had become too attractive forCoyote to resist touching. Weeping at her loss, he vainly retraces his journey,reenacting the illusions of the first trip that are now so movingly useless, fi-nally he arrives back at the dusty prairie where he first encountered the Lodgeof the Shadows.Here, the teacher can take full advantage of the complex interplay betweenirony and foreshadowing. As Ramsey points out, \"in a sense, everything Coy-ote does in his quest foreshadows his failure, both for himself and his wife, andfor the great precedent of returning from death that he might establish. Specificprefigurements occur at every turn\" (1983, p. 53). This element of textual co-herence cannot be underestimated, and unfortunately in many elementary read-ing and language arts programs developing the ability to mentally construct it'The presentation and percipient literary criticism of this Nez Perce Orphicstory we owe to J. Ramsey (1983), whose analysis we follow closely. The mythof Orpheus and Euridice is surely one of the most prominent examples of theuniversality of traditional narrative themes. The recording, transcription, andtranslation of \"Coyote and the Shadow people\" forms part of the extensiveethnographic and literary work of A. Phinney of Columbia University and amember of the Nez-Perce tribe. Swadesh (1966) shares with us a Nutca versionwhere \"Orpheus\" travels by canoe and is counseled and guided by an elderlywoman from his tribe who he finds on a strange and unknown beach. 65o4 Teaching Indigenous Languagesis left for the student to somehow spontaneously acquire. This particular com-prehension skill becomes increasingly more useful as children's reading mate-rial becomes more difficult. Students in the upper grades will find school textsmore abstract and less transparent because predicting strategies based almostexclusively on general previous knowledge lose their universal applicability.The reader must rely to a greater extent on his or her ability to find in the textitself the cues, referents, causal relationships, and antecedents necessary forconstructing global meaning.Predicting strategies in reading have long been recognized as fundamentalto both decoding and comprehension (Smith, 1988). Expectation and anticipa-tion facilitate the processing of text at all levels. Perhaps at some levels, directteaching of the patterns may require relatively limited conscious attention onthe part of the teacher (e.g., sound patterns and grammar structures). However,at the higher levels, deliberate and systematic instruction plays a critical role inthe acquisition of the advanced text processing skills that are the mainstay oftextbook-type academic discourse.In \"Coyote and the Shadow People\" some of the cues are explicit. Afterlecturing the traveler extensively against his inclination to do foolish thingsand repeating: \"you must never, never touch her...but never touch her,\" in anaside, the Spirit says to himself \"I hope that he will do everything right.\" Othercues are more subtle. Upon arriving at the Lodge of the Shadows, Coyote sud-denly, and in apparent contradiction to his desire to take his wife back home,tells the Spirit that he wants to stay with his friends.Coyote's futile recapitulation of the failed first journey (pretending to seethe wild horses on the prairie, going through the motions of picking and eatingthe berries, and raising the door flap to the lodge) calls for special attention bythe teacher, even perhaps during reading, in mid-discourse. On the unconsciouslevel the young reader/listener experiences the effect of the different layers ofparallelism and symmetry in the narration. Contrast is artfully reiterated: dayand night, living world and shadow world, suffering (the heat and dust of theday) and celebration (the lodge reunion). The repetition of detail evokes theimages that bring narrator and listener closer, another of the many features thateveryday conversation and literature share (Tannen, 1989).But it is when students begin to consciously reflect upon these structuralaspects of the text that they are beginning to acquire the basic competencies ofwhat Cummins and Swain (1987) call Cognitive Academic Language Profi-ciency (CALP). In addition to the thematic and general content schemata, thestudents' network of previous knowledge will now call upon the powerful textorganizing tools that correspond to their newly acquired system of formal sche-mata (Carrell, 1989; Carrell & Eisterhold, 1983). The skillful teacher can guidetheir students in discovering, for themselves, these literary features and dis-course patterns. 51 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesTlacual uan coyotlfor second language learningOur second example comes from the oral tradition of the Nahuatl speakingcommunities of Central Mexico, where we were able to record a complete ver-sion of \"Tlacual uan Coyotl\" (The Opossum and the Coyote) from a middle-aged informant, native of San Isidro Buensuceso, Tlaxcala. Both thematicallyand structurally, the narrative falls at the opposite end of the continuum fromthe Nez Perce Orphic myth, although the particular context of the performance,an audience of young children, surely contributed to its simplification. But here,it is this characteristic that corresponds to the instructional objective in ques-tion: second language acquisition.Along the lines of another common theme, especially in Mexico (see\"Didxaguca' sti' lexu ne gueu,\" a Zapoteco version that attempts to account fora different natural phenomenon, de la Cruz & de la Cruz, 1990), Coyote arrivesat what he thinks is an agreement with God to eat all His children. God's con-federate, the opossum, submits the (in this case, outrageously) foolish coyoteto a series of outlandish deceptions and deservingly punishing pranks. If theyoung listeners do not begin to predict the outcome of the subsequent sequencesfrom the opening frame where the lowly coyote thinks he has actually made acontract with God, they may take note of opossum's patent lie in episode #2that Coyote wholeheartedly believes. Opossum assures Coyote that, \"God won'tsee [him]\" drink the pulque (the agreement was for Coyote to fast before hecould eat all the Earth's creatures). Seven episodes of opossum's craftiness andevasion at coyote's expense end with the latter hungry and alone, waiting for-ever for opossum to reemerge from his burrow.What \"Tlacual uan Coyotl\" may lack in universality of theme or structuralsophistication is more than compensated for in the series of repetitive struc-tures in close succession, with the pertinent referents in high-profile foreground.This is the ideal kind of sequence for second language learners. Each shortepisode begins with the same initial event: Coyote comes looking, running af-ter, wandering and (later) faltering; the repeated promise to devour Opossumwho, each time, shifts the responsibility of the deception to the pulque opos-sum, the shepherd opossum, the turkey opossum, and so forth, nicely recapitu-lating for the reader/listener the sequence of deceptions. True to the repetitivepattern, Coyote, pleadingly, demands to know, every time why Opossum is de-ceiving him so much. And every time he reminds himself of God's admonish-ment.The over-repetition of key content words (ToteotatzinOur God Father,niccuazeat up, amo nimitztelhuizI won't accuse you, otnechacacayayoudeceived me), signaled by the appropriate intonation markers, increases thecomprehensible input level. This feature makes the narrative even more acces-sible to the second language learner, in this case the Spanish speaking studentwhose Nahuatl language skills are still incipient or have suffered a degree oferosion.The singular merit, from the pedagogical standpoint, of the Nahuatl coyotestory and many others like it consists of the combination of simplified structure6652 Teaching Indigenous Languagesand authenticity. Too often authentic texts lack the necessary modificationsthat second language students depend on to be able to process textual materialin their weaker language. In fact, with appropriate visual context support (pup-pets of Opossum and Coyote and props that depict the seven action sequences)the performance of \"Tlacual uan coyotl\" could serve as a highly effective lan-guage and literacy instructional material for level one (or even level zero) be-ginners in Nahuatl. Here, the process of meaning construction is supported bythe key content word items, the limited concept load, repetitive action sequences,and the application of general previous knowledge.For language revitalization purposes this type of narrative genre is a criti-cal component of academic language input that, in turn, represents the rawmaterial for learning new vocabulary and acquiring or reinforcing the gram-matical structures of the indigenous language. Its complete and authentic char-acteristics facilitate learning the structural aspects of the language. Further-more, learning language in context not only contributes to the development ofhigher order comprehension skills but integrates the all important cultural com-ponent (more critical in situations of indigenous language loss) into the lan-guage arts curriculum. Geographical features and towns mentioned in the nar-rative are often concrete cultural referents that are tied to important historicalmoments and turning points. The introduction of certain characters often corre-spond to historically significant transitions in the domain of interethnic con-tact: the white man, the priest, and new non-indigenous institutions.For the monolingual indigenous language speaker, or beginner, transla-tions into Spanish or English of oral tradition material provide for many of thesame advantages outlined above. Reading and listening to the traditional sto-ries of one's community insure significant levels of top-down support for thedifficult second language decoding and processing tasks. And of course, thestraight forward temporal/sequential narrative schema (with elements of causal/logical organization) lends itself well for native level Nahuatl speaking chil-dren in their initial stages of literacy development.ConclusionThe popularity of indigenous oral tradition in translation, especially in re-gions of sustained intercultural contact, attests to the broad applicability of thevarious sub-genres (creation legends rivaling the coyote stories in both Englishand Spanish editions) for expanding non-indigenous students \"narrative aware-ness\" beyond the familiar patterns of their own traditional texts. The potentialof this indigenous literary form for enriching the reading and language artscurriculum has been realized only partially, even in the most favorable contextsof additive/developmental bilingual education. Our examination of the multi-tude of applications has focused on only a few examples in the area of reading.Without a doubt, applying the material to the area of developing students' writ-ing skills would be equally as productive. Coyote stories are basically vignettesin a never-ending story, prototypes of inexhaustible variations and permuta-tions. It is, in fact, the assimilation of a relatively limited set of text organiza- 53'6? Teaching Indigenous Languagestion schemata, mastery of basic narrative techniques, and a set of formulas thatthe traditional story teller has relied on in developing the extensive repertoiresof his or her art.In closing, it is important to emphasize that creativity depends on the writer'saccess to structures and patterns, the application of which are facilitated byhigh degrees of metacognitive awarenessfundamentally, on an awareness ofhow expression is constrained. These text construction frameworks and orga-nizers are consolidated by significant amounts of exposure to the pertinentmodels and reflective and deliberate examination of how they work (whichincludes reflection upon and feedback on one's own productions). Creativity, isalso expansive and divergent, and within the self-imposed limits of all goodliterature, Coyote can do, or at least try, anything. ReferencesCarrell, P.L. (1989).

Fishman, described the consensual require-ments for creating an environment where participants can interact inan intergenerational environment; can gain in prestige, friendship,and affection; and can participate in community building and spiri-tual centeringall of which provide the foundation for re-vernacularizing an indigenous language. This paper describes the ef-forts of several Danza groups in Los Angeles, California, to bringback Classical Ncihuatl into daily use. As we approach the new millennium indigenous languages around the worldhave little to rejoice over. Mass communication, transportation, and marketingare destroying indigenous languages, helping to bring the estimated 6,700 lan-guages of the world to no more than 3,000. Furthermore, 40% of the remaining3,000 languages are threatened from measurable declines as children fail tolearn their mother tongue. This leaves no more than 600 stable languages, only10% of world's languages. In North America approximately 155 indigenouslanguages survive, but 135 of them are in danger of becoming extinct within ageneration or two (Crawford, 1995; Kraus, 1992).The focus of this paper is Mexico, which has approximately 93 millionpeople. Mexico has approximately 295 languages of which 289 remain; 60 ofthose are listed as Uto-Aztecan and 28 as Aztecan (Grimes, 1996). The impor-tance of keeping these languages alive has been described by King (1994). Shestates how in one Huichol myth,the people and animals were dying of hunger because they did notknow the name for maize; in another, the ancestors and wise men wereturned into snakes, rats, and dogs because they did not know how toname the sun....Language permits not only the naming of the worldbut also the function of memory. In an oral culture, knowledge onceacquired has to be constantly repeated; otherwise it would be lost.Every culture, whether predominantly oral or literate, teaches futuregenerations not only how to speak but also how to think, receiving thecategories of classification imposed by language in its cultural con-text. (p. 111) 7056 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThis statement is a strong argument for the need to recover an original lan-guage and cultural constructs, and it necessitates that the organic symbols, tra-ditions, psycholinguistical constructs, and modes of viewing a cosmology stillexist within a community, whether pure or syncretized.What is the Nahuatl language?Classical Nahuatl is classified under Uto-Aztecan is Uto-Aztecan. The Proto Uto-Aztecan language family extendsover a vast area of the Western United States and Mexico. Uto-Aztecan, whilebeing variegated, has an anthropological record approximated at 5000 years. Inthe historical record this would put Proto Uto-Aztecan in the same time depthas Proto Indo-European According to Campbelland a latecomer into Meso-America.... Only a few centuriesbefore the Spanish conquest of Meso-America did the ancestors of theNahuatl-speaking people come down from the northwest into centralMexico, leaving behind them a trail of peoples to be \"extinct\" according to theSummer Institute of Linguistics' documentation (Grimes, 1996). However, es-tablishing the extinction of a language is a subjective and a pOlitical act be-cause no one calls Shakespeare's English, \"Classical English.\" Therefore, asCampbell and Karttunen have to talk about \"Classical Nahuatl\"and \"the modern dialects.\" This implies a gulf between immediatelypost-conquest Nahuatl and what is spoken today; yet the people whospeak Nahuatl today are the descendants of the people who spoke itfive centuries ago. (1989, p. 2)Traditional linguistics tend to classify languages into three types: isolat-ing, agglutinating, and inflecting. Examples of these types include Chinese asan isolate, Finnish as an agglutinate, and Indo-European as an inflected. Ac-cording to previous classifications, the Uto-Aztecan family, and thus Nahuatl,would belong to the agglutinating group. In the process of agglutinating Nahuatlcan create monosyllabic words such as \"ya:\" (to go) or more complex ones like\"xictlacachi:huaz\" (may you make him/her a person) through compoundingand derivation (Campbell & Karttunen, 1989).It is better to use a metaphor to explain the way word construction evolvesin Nahuatl morphology. The verb is much like the dancer in the circle. Thedancer is surrounded by prefixes and suffixes that have a fixed formulated mor-phological value and when analyzed and translated into what would be charac- 577 Teaching Indigenous Languagesterized in western thought as a word, in Nahuatl it would be \"tlahtolli.\" Look at\"xictlacachi:huaz\". Here, the center of the sentence/word is \"chi:hua\" (to make,the center of action, the dancer), \"tlaca\" is a noun, meaning person, used as anadjective, \"z\" is a suffix that states a time of future, \"xi\" is an optative mode ofspeaking and it signifies \"you,\" and finally \"c\" is the third person singularspecific object. This sentence/word would translate as \"(may) you-him/her-person-make-future,\" \"may you make him/her a person.\"Campbell Karttunen go on to present another metaphor, \"Nahuatl wordsnouns and verbsare something like onions, and what we need to do in orderto understand Nahuatl or to compose anything in the language is to be able topeel off the layers to get to the stem, orgiven the stemto be able to wrap itup in the right layers and in the right order\" (1989, p. 11). This is only a glimpseof the language, by no means an attempt to present the language [see Andrews(1975) and Campbell and Karttunen (1989) for more comprehensive presenta-tions of Nahuatl].ResistanceHow did these Mesoamericans resist what Guillermo Bonfil Batalla (1996)describes as the Imaginary Mexico, the internal-colonial vision for Mexico andhow did the Mexico Profundo, what Bonfil calls the residual indigenous visionof the world, survive the European military and cultural assault? These twocontradictory visions of Mexico, one an imaginary colonial model and the otheran indigenous model of living with the land and continuing the cultural con-structs of the indigenous survivors, are in a continued conflict. Batalla's threestep model of resistance, innovation, and appropriation can be applied to thetransformation of Nahuatl and the Nahua culture and how it has survived to itscurrent state.Resistance, the first step in Batalla's model, is a mechanism that has beenemployed overtly and covertly by all oppressed peoples around the world. Anexample of resistance includes the native who refuses to use fertilizer broughtin from outside of the communities, and communities such as the one locatedin Coahuila who in 1909 \"burned the school that had been built for them on thesame day it was to be inaugurated\" (Batalla, 1996). Other such examples aboundin the annals of history. The second mechanism in Batalla's model is innova-tion. Examples include the use of metal drills to create hair pipe, snuff lids tocreate jingles, old tires to create huaraches (sandals), and metal cans for drink-ing water. Appropriation has been the third survivalist tactic of all Native Ameri-can people. Every autochthonous group wants to have control over its technol-ogy. No one wants to be a slave to technology. Consider the appropriation ofthe horse into the North American life-style. Native Nahua people also haveappropriated the Catholic religion as a surface cover for their indigenous cus-toms, which they hide behind the face of Christian worship. We know fromhistory that the Mesoamerican central plateau was militarily conquered on Au-gust 13, 1521, but because of these survival strategies this conquest did not 7 2 58 Teaching Indigenous Languagesdirectly translate into a complete physical, cultural, and psychological surren-der that myth would have us believe.Lockhart's (1992) chronology of Spanish-Nahuatl contact validates BonfilBatalla's model of resistance. In Lockhart's first stage the Spanish conquerorstried to impose their will on the indigenous people by eliminating the old cul-ture both materially and spiritually (King, 1994). It follows that all the secularand religious activities would be handled through the language of the conqueror.However, the Spanish Crown was overwhelmed by the diversity of languages,the difficulty of transportation, and the isolation of many of the ethnic groups.The native people resisted the conqueror's language, and even though in 1550Charles V decreed that all the natives were to be taught in Spanish, it was virtu-ally impossible.One effect of the encomienda system (the practice of assigning tracts ofland and the indigenous inhabitants of that land to individual conquistadores)was that the natives were isolated from the rest of the Spaniards and only inter-acted through their priest. The church was unable to meet the needs of nativesand was left with no recourse but to turn a blind eye to the needs of the King(King, 1994).In 1534 the first printing press was introduced to the new world at therequest of Bishop Zumarraga. In 1539 the first book to be published was abilingual catechism in Spanish and Nahuatl. In the following years friars pro-duced what later would be recognized as the most important records of Nahuatland other Mexican indigenous languages. In 1547 Fray Andres de Olmos pro-duced the first Nahuatl grammar book. This was followed by Fray Alonso Rangelwho translated the Christian doctrine into \u00b0tonal. In 1558 and 1559 MaturinoGilberti produced the first Tarascan grammar and dictionary (King, 1994).This first stage can be seen as a period of intense resistance marked byRoyal decrees that went unenforced. The friars discovered it was easier to con-vert the natives in their indigenous language. This process allowed the pho-netic transcriptions of the indigenous languages to be written down and pre-served for posterity. Such action on the part of the friars forced the Crown toaccept Nahuatl and Mayan as the lingua franca of the natives. It was believedthat Nahuatl and Mayan contained grammar and morphology similar to otherlocal languages, and if people were converted in Nahuatl and Maya it wouldmake it easier on the natives to accept Christianity (King, 1994).The separation between stages one and two mirrored those events transpir-ing in Spain in the 1560's. In 1560 the Holy Office was established in NewSpain, marking a great ideological shift in regard to Native languages. Peoplesuch as Pedro Sanchez, a chronicler writing at that time, pointed out that thenatives referred to their painted codices which were kept hidden by the Indiansand read in their meetings. But even within the church itself there were thosewho questioned the suitability of native languages to transmit the essence ofthe scripture. In 1555, a group of friars from all three orders, the Franciscans,Dominicans, and Augustinians, became powerful enough to pressure the synodof Mexico to order the seizure of the collections of sermons in native languages. 59r Teaching Indigenous LanguagesMany of these documents were destroyed by the Holy Inquisition. Even up to1634 Philip IV was issuing orders for the clergy to devote themselves to teach-ing the natives Spanish so that they might better understand and adopt Spanishcustoms. The Indians themselves expressed no desire to learn Spanish, andlocal priests were content to teach Indians in their own languages, despite royaldecrees in 1771, 1776, and 1778 from Charles III ordering Indians to be taughtin Spanish. Meanwhile, in the secular arena the division of languages was stillmaintained. The Indian courts still dealt in native languages. This maintained acertain level of language maintenance, owing to the need for native scribes andtranslators (King, 1994).The division between stage two and stage three is marked by the indepen-dence of Mexican colonial elites from Spain. With independence indigenouspeople were declared citizens of Mexico, which meant not having a linguisticbuffer between the clergy and indigenous people. Such an event did away withthe native courts that had fostered the maintenance of native languages. Theseevents put the Mexico Profundo of the natives and the Imaginary Mexico of theelite in direct conflict, and the clergy could no longer act as a buffer betweenthe two worlds. This led to conflicts such as the Tzeltzal-Tzotzil Rebellion of1867, an uprising against local Mestizos. In 1870 and 1881 the Zapotec andZoque indigenous people took up arms to demand independence. While thesemovements were unsuccessful, they shattered the myth of the submissive Na-tive. Even up to the late 1800's government documents were still drawn up innative languages. One such example is a law passed in 1866 by Maximilianproviding communal lands to groups of people. The documents were drawn upin both Spanish and Nahuatl. Also, consider the work of Leon Portilla onEmiliano Zapata wrote his communiqu\u00e9s from Milpa Alta in Nahuatl (King,1994).The movement towards the Mexican Revolution, which began in the 1880's,marked a clear break from stage three. Here, the mestizo identity was formingwith such authors as Vasconcelos who perpetuated the dream of a new race,\"La Raza COsmica.\" This cosmic race did nothing more than try to furthererase any indigenous characteristics from Indian psyches. Its attempts werefocused on moving away from an original cultural perspective to one importedfrom the outside. Here the cientificos, the scientists, had imported a Europeancultural perspective and market economy. This was epitomized by Porfirio Diaz,of Zapotec blood, who powdered his face white every morning.The movement to erase Mexico Profundo was most effective through theuse of rural schools, and such efforts as those of Rafael Ramirez, who wrote\"Como dar a todo Mexico un idioma\" (How to provide a common language forall of Mexico). Ramirez warned rural teachers, \"You will begin by getting usedto the local language, then gradually you will start adopting local customs, thentheir inferior way of life, and finally you also will become an Indian\" (as quotedin King, 1994, p. 63).While the work of Lockhart (1992) and King (1994) has been used exten-sively to document language and its change in this paper, it is necessary to offer7460 Teaching Indigenous Languagesa fifth stage beyond what they discuss. One that appropriates the tools of edu-cation and self-determination. To not incorporate such a stage would be to ig-nore the model of resistance, even if the vision is against all odds.Stage five marks an overt clash of two visions, one indigenous (MexicoProfundo) and the other imaginary (Imaginary Mexico), as Bonfil Bata lla hasproposed. On the one hand, the state has a narcissistic perception of itself andwants to force its preferred marketable identity on the population, without re-gard to indigenous needs. This was pointed out by speeches of the Chamber ofDeputies from post-revolution to present as described by King (1994). At issuewas whether to incorporate or integrate indigenou people through linguisticunification (Castellanizacion, or the teaching of Spanish) or through accultura-tion. Little attention was paid to the needs of indigenous people or whetherthey were going to buy into such a solution.In 1936 the Autonomous Department of Indian affairs was established toadopt a more liberal stance on indigenous languages. Bilingual education wasproposed and the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) was hired to providethe technical expertise. In 1939, the first Assembly of Philologists and Lin-guists and the Consejo de Lenguas Indigenas again selected SIL to provideapplied linguistics literacy. In 1948, the National Indian Institute was createdto deal with Indian literacy and they continued to.use SIL for their literacy arm.SIL continued to provide literacy training up till the 1970's when they werediscredited by linguists such as Bravo Ahuja who,Analyzed a total of 883 literacy materials produced by the SIL be-tween 1935 and 1974. She found that, in the majority of cases, theprimers were both pedagogical and linguistically unsound in their ap-proach to teaching Spanish as a second language. Over two-thirds ofthe materials included in her sample introduced the language by meansof isolated words, grouped into semantically unconnected lists, hav-ing in common only the use of the same phoneme. (King, 1994, pp.116-117)During the mid 1960's anthropologist like Bonfil Bata lla began to developthe model of internal colonialism where \"Indian groups were not simply cul-tural remnants of the pre-Hispanic past but rather exploited groups in specificregional, identifiable by ethnic Indian regions\" (King, 1994, p. 65). Conscious-ness of the state of indigenous affairs and the educational system allowed theemergence of Indigenous organizations that challenged the Imaginary Mexico.Some of these individuals, the rural teachers and other community members,had originally been trained to serve as brokers between indigenous people andthe mestizo world, the Imaginary Mexico. Knowledge can lead to analysis, andthese individuals began to raise questions regarding indigenous education. Someof the demands now being made by indigenous groups over education are: 61 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesPlanning and instrumentation of a bilingual education that providesthe basis for economic development, cultural renovation, and eth-nic identity.Development of a specific Indigenous pedagogy, based on the his-tory and cosmology of each ethnic group.Promotion of ethnic and cultural pluralism in Mexico.Elaboration of bilingual methods and materials for Indigenous edu-cation.Definition of standard alphabets for the Indigenous languages.Design of a complete bilingual system from primary schooling tohigher education. (King, 1994)King concluded,If Mexico's ethnic groups are to survive as such, they must retain theirown languages, and if these are to compete on an equal status with theofficial language, they must develop a written form. With the exten-sion of the state apparatus and the increasing need for educationalqualifications for entry into the labor market, literacy has acquired aneconomic value. But is has been the reluctance to afford the Indianlanguages an equal place with Spanish in the educational context thathas posed the greatest threat to the survival in recent years. (1994, p.68)Here is where traditional Danza Azteca-Chichimeca comes in to help Nahuatland Nahua culture survive.What is Danza (Dance) Azteca-Chichimeca?The American Heritage Dictionary (1993) defines dance \"1. To move rhyth-mically usually to music, using prescribed or improvised steps and gestures.\"But this definition fails to capture the depth and breadth of indigenous dancepractices in the Nahua world. The modern archaeological practice of grave rob-bing has provided clues to the historical depth of Nahua dance practices amongstMesoamerican peoples. The finds of human figurines in dance stances fromZacatenco (1500 BC) give a timeline existence for Danza. The eloquent figu-rines from Tlatilco Morelos demonstrate a highly developed mortuary ceremo-nialism, including male figures with shaggy costumes associated with animals,suggesting shamanism. Female figurines dancing with cocoon leg rattles im-personated corn spirits (Kurath & Marti, 1964). These are but a small samplingof archeological evidence supporting the existence of Danza as an essentialpractice amongst Mesoamericans since time immemorial.One of the oldest indigenous oral versions of how the art of Danza andmusic came into being can be traced back in time through Tezcatlihpoca.Tezcatlihpoca brought Danza and music so human beings could be happy.Tezcatlihpoca commanded the wind to fetch Danza and music. He sent the 62 Teaching Indigenous Languageswind to the house of the sun where the singers, musicians, and composers lived.The wind was instructed to go by the seashore at dawn and call Tezcatlihpocas'sea animals, the whale and the sea tortoise. They would take the wind to thesun, just at the break of dawn. There, the wind would sing a special song to thesingers, and if they listened to his beautiful song they would have to follow himback to earth. In this way Danza and music were brought to earth to makehuman beings rejoice and be merry (Sten, 1990). Therefore, Danza is associ-ated with the divine. There exist two opposing feelings for Tezcatlihpoca byMesoamerican people. One is fear and the other respect, because Tezcatlihpocacan favor you one day and another day he could be your demise. For this reasonit was said that Tezcatlihpoca not only made the Toltecs dance, but he alsomade Huitzilopochtli (Patron of the Aztecs) dance.It is historically understood that Mesoamericans, along with other nativepeople of this continent, suffered breaks in the continuity of their ancient knowl-edge. In Mesoamerica, at conquest, the majority of the priest class, the warriorclans, and the intelligencia were slaughtered. This knowledge break has causedgreat confusion among all the descendants of this continent. The imposition ofan antagonistic and alien religion has done nothing more than to further con-fuse the masses. Anthropologists posthumously have been able to recreate whatthe colonizers had to destroy to justify the legitimacy of their imposition. Fromsuch anthropologists we get merely a glimpse of how these ancient civiliza-tions viewed their universe and their place in it. The documentation of DanzaNahua also suffers from this knowledge break. The Florentine Codex only leavesan external description of what such a tradition was and how it fit into the restof the cosmovision. What we know of the pre-conquest friars and Motolinia, whose open pur-pose was not to preserve but rather eliminate these traditions.The goals of Mesoamerican Danza are to obtain the benevolence of thecreator on behalf of the individual and the community and to obtain the fertilityof the earth and the abundance of corn, beans, chile, and other consumables, toprevent the dry seasons, to obtain rain and assure the warm of the sun for properagrarian growth, and to assure victory in war (Sten, 1990). Friars left us scat-tered information regarding the function of Danza. According to Kurath andMarti (1964), who wrote The Choreography and Music of Precortesian Dances,there were 18 ceremonies based on an ecological calendar. These ceremoniesdealt with rain, germination, ripening of corn, war victory, hunting, and tribaldead. More specifically, rain was the main objective of most of the ceremonies,especially during the winter season. The crops included beans, corn, flowers,and other domesticated consumables. Not only were the dances and ceremo-nies controlled by the agrarian calendar used through out Mesoamerica, butpeople's destinies were governed by the sign they were born under. Certainindividuals born under the sign of Ce: Ozomatli (one monkey) were predes-tined to be singers, dancers, or painters. The ability to dance allowed individu-als to acquire prestige. To be able to dance next to a noble was a great honorand privilege. But to falter in the dance movements was considered an offense 63 4 Teaching Indigenous Languagesto the creator punishable by death. Faltering also demonstrated lack of disci-pline within the originator's group. When one group wanted to find the weak-ness of their warring opponent they would send spies to find out how well andwhat movements were done in their dances. They could read the strength oftheir opponent by their ability to dance. In this manner Danza played a power-ful role in the lives of Mesoamericans (Sten, 1990).There were several types of dances, most notably were sacred dances andsecular dances. The sacred dances were performed in front of temples and al-ways for the maintenance of the relationship between human beings and thecreator. Sacred dances were also performed before and after a war engagement.The secular dances were performed in peoples houses or the market place andconcentrated more on merriment and agrarian activities. There was overlap-ping between agrarian ceremonies and the maintenance of the relationship be-tween human beings and their creator (Sten, 1990).Danza also had an immense outlook in the cosmovision of indigenouspeople. Facial paints such as red and yellow were connected with the sun, fer-tility, and rebirth of nature. The color blue honored Tlaloc (manifestation ofrain) and Xiuhteuctli (manifestation of fire), these colors signified abundance.Only men were allowed to paint themselves black. The color white, which isusually associated with death, was rarely found as a facial paint. Facial paint-ing was considered a great privilege because one emulated the manifestationsof the creator, because they too painted their faces and body parts. There weremany forms of dancing, but the general types were serpentines, circulars, andprocessions. Serpentine dances were grounded in fertility symbolism and werefor guarding the crops from the cold. The circular type were associated with themythical unification of people. The circle represents perfection, and the dancerin the center represents a singular point of perfection. Processions were mainlyexecuted when one visiting group arrived or left a ceremony. It was consideredrespectful to arrive in a marching formation, showing great humility and re-spect for the host. In such a manner the visiting group would put itself underthe orders of their host. Again, leaving in proper marching formation was alsoconsidered respectful. Within these forms there were mimetic and non-figura-tive dances. In the mimetic dances, dancers imitated animals, while in the non-figurative dances, dancers entered into altered states of consciousness (Sten,1990).According to missionary scholars, Danza served an economic and ceremo-nial function. The progress of the seasons, the status of the people, dance pat-terns, music, and spirituality were all holistically interwoven (Kurath & Marti,1964). Danza threatened Acosta and the Popefelt \"that the fiestas and celebrations of the Indians should be done in honor ofGod and the Saint whose feast day they were celebrating\" (Stone, 1975, p.196). The Synod of Mexico went on to say it was a, \"Matter of great shame andirreverence for men wearing masks and women's clothing to go before the Sa-cred Host dancing with obscene and lascivious gestures making noises thatinterfered with singing of hymns\" (Stone, 1975, p. 196). Duran, who was one 64 Teaching Indigenous Languagesof the more conservative of the chroniclers, \"Warned his readers that shouldthey see an Indian in better costume than the others, dancing a little apart fromhis companions and muttering unintelligibly they could be sure that the Indi-ans, while pretending to dance at the Christian fiesta, were actually honoringtheir pagan gods whose fiestas fell near the same date\" (Stone, 1975, p. 196).Stone, in her book At The Sign of Midnight, shares her findings regarding thefirst provincial hearing held in 1555 and the perception of Danza,In 1555 the First Provincial Council, meeting in Mexico City, ruledthat as the Indians are very inclined to dances, areitos, and other cer-emonies, they should not be permitted, while dancing, to use bannersor ancient masks that cause suspicions, or to sing songs of their an-cient rites or histories, unless said songs were first examined by reli-gious persons, or persons who understood the Indian language well.The Evangelical Ministers should see that such songs did not treat ofprofane things, but of Christian Doctrine. Also, the Indians should notbe permitted to dance before dawn, or before High Mass, and whenthe bell rang for vespers, they should leave off dancing and attend.Should the Indians fail to abide by these rules, the priests in chargeshould punish them. Furthermore, the Indians were not to be permit-ted to have processions on the fiesta date of their village or theirchurches unless the vicar or minister were present. (1975, p. 197)In the first 20 post-conquest years Danza was changed completely, leaving onlysyncretized vestiges of the old traditions.Consensus as to the origin of Danza among Danzantes does not exist. MostConchero, or religious dancers, only want to go back to the point of forcedChristianization, while academics have argued that Danza has come fromGuerrero, Tlaxcala, Queretaro, and still others believe Tlaltelolco (Stone, 1975).From the archeological, historical, oral, and cultural records it is impossible todeny the ancient origin of Danza.The third provincial council inNew Spain in 1585 prohibited the wearingof headdresses by the Indians when they danced because they manifested somesort of idolatry (Stone, 1975). Little is known about Danza owing to religiouspersecution. Most of the Danza knowledge was maintained by agraphic com-munities and even then only within selected group members. This means thatmuch of this knowledge does not exist in written form, and it is almost impos-sible to corroborate.Some information about Danza from the early 1800's was collected byMartha Stone (1975). Stone joined the Concheros (post-conquest dancers) dur-ing the 1940's and participated with them for over 25 years gaining the title ofCapitana de Comunidad under Capitan General Manuel Luna. She was able tocollect respectable ethnographic material by interviewing Captains of Danzafrom the 1940's to the 1960's. 65 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesFrom her findings, the changes in Mexico paralleled those of the Danza.During the revolutionary movement of 1880's Danza Captains were killed. Thiscaused a great break in the knowledge of Danza. It allowed for many opportu-nistic dancers to take on the emblems of Danza without having the knowledge.This led Vicente Marquez and Natalia Hidalgo to form the Corporation ofConcheros, which only recognized legitimate Danza Captains.During the Cristero war (1930) danzantes were forbidden to dance. In the1940's indigenista programs became more liberal. There were national attemptsto register Danzantes and to request of them licenses for dancing. This provedineffective, but it did relax the Conchero's religious hold. Now Captains likeNatividad Reyna and Manuel Pineda came out with fantasy dances that strayedaway from the usual religious expression. From the 1940's on many changesoccurred in Danza, such as the reintroduction of the leg rattles, called ayoyotl,and short outfits. In the 1940's Danza was introduced to the big screen by ManuelPinedo in an Argentine movie. The Huehuetl, a big hollowed out drum for whichpeople were punished for playing by having their hands cut off, was reintro-duced only in the last 30 years. These changes caused great concern among theold traditional Concheros, but it allowed Danza to grow and expand as it ap-pealed more to youth.In the 1960's the civil rights movement challenged the accepted notions ofacculturation, and many individuals of Mexican descent, especially the youth,began to question the imposed colonial structure. Among their concerns wasthe role the Roman Catholic religion played in the invasion of Mexico. TheCatholic form of spirituality was challenged, and many of these individualsbegan to view Danza Azteca-Chichimeca as an organic indigenous spiritualexpression. It was in this form that Danza was introduced into the United States.Florencio Yesca and Andres Segura (Armstrong, 1985) are two individuals ac-knowledged as having introduced Danza into the United States. While Yesca'spresentation of danza was more in a cultural context, Segura presented it in aConchero or traditional form. Yesca's form is concentrated in the SouthernCalifornia, San Diego, and Tijuana, while Segura's is more visible in the Texasborder region. From these two areas, Danza has expanded to Los Angeles, Sac-ramento, San Francisco, Oregon, New York, Arizona, New Mexico, and as faras Chicago.It is impossible to present a complete history of post-conquest Danza ow-ing to the persecution of marginal groups and the nature of Danza itself. How-ever, cultural residual evidence is observed with similarities encountered inmodern Danza practices that still exist on this continent. As early as 1894, theEagle dance was recognized to have similarities with those found in theMesoamerican Codices. Winged eagle dancers walking and kneeling move-ments are fashioned like the Mesoamerican gods, with sacrificial symbols,weeping eyes, and severed heads. Other dances were noticed to have maskedwarriors fighting head to head in the fashion of the Mesoamerican mimeticdances. The Eagle dance is practiced amongst Iroquois, Pawnee Hako, Mid-8066 Teaching Indigenous Languageswestern Calumet, and in the south it is known as the Death or Buzzard Cult.These dances have become popular on the Pow Wow circuit.The open round and serpentine dances are a product of the American con-tinent based on growing corn. Further similarities of dance forms are seen inPeru and Panama. The Incas and the Guaymis had serpentine dances related tothe protection of the corn crop from the cold and other elements. In the TohonoO'odham (formerly Papago) Wiikita or prayer stick festival, dancers-singersdance in a circle, carrying images of things wanted in abundance. The Anasaziof the Rio Grande River preserve harvest and corn dances that resembleMesoamerican hand waving. The famous snake dance of the Hopi in Arizona issimilar to the Aztec dance of Atamalqualiztli, where the priest chewed on snakes.The Guatemaltecans also have a ceremony involving snake handling by come-dians. The Creek, Seminole, Cherokee, and the Northern Iroquois have a secu-lar dance called the \"Stomp\" (Kurath & Marti, 1964).Thus we can still find original dance practices that have survived the con-quest. The Voladores de Papantla, the flyers of Papantla, appear in the earliestpre-conquest manuscripts. Kurath and Marti describe a ceremony,They climb the pole and sit on a platform at the top while a musicianinvokes the four points of the compass. On signal, the flyers descendon ropes with thirteen revolutions, dance on the grounds, and recede.Each stage of the ceremony has a special tune, played by one musicianand a single reed flute called pito and a small, double-headed drum. Atnight, everyone celebrates with aguardiente and huapangos to from Guerrero to Guanajuato.The members-by-bow hold private rituals to the four cardinal direc-tions, public processions with banners and floral decorations, invoca-tions with songs in a church, a battle of 'Los Rayados' (recalling theAztec term for striped ones).... The dance includes males and femalesfrom three to sixty. The best male dancers recall Moctezuma's profes-sionals, as they leap or bend back in kneeling position. Despite Euro-pean elements, such as the stringed concha instrument and some steps,they rightly aver their Aztec heritage. (1964, p. 162)How is danza executed?The organizational structure of Danza is much like a military organizatioas can be seen in the organizational chart from Armstrong on page 68 (1985, p.17). The function of the Capitan General is to conquer groups and have them beunder his roundtable or mesa. The captain under him manages over a localterritory. The second captain can substitute in the captain's place in case ofabsence. The sergeants are in charge of specific job functions. The sergeant of 67r- Teaching Indigenous Languagesthe altar is in charge of preparing the alter in every ceremony so that the altar iswell prepared and stocked with the appropriate necessities. The field sergeantis in charge of preparations for going on a march. He selects the people to go ona march, making sure of all their necessities. The capitanas take care of thewomen. They are organized in the same manner as the sergeants and serve thesame functions. Underneath this chain of command are the soldiers and womenwho are referred to as malinches or maquis Structure charge of the banner)de somador(in charge of incense burner) de Mesa (of the altar)de campo(field sergeant) Soldiers The most important part of a fiesta, march, or ceremony is the vigil. Thevigil is customarily held before a dance. Traditionally vigils started at midnightand would go on to the break of dawn when the dances would follow immedi-ately. Currently, the vigils begin at 8 to 9 p.m. and go till about 3 a.m. with arest period included. The nature of the vigils deal with esoteric aspects of Danza.Towards the end of the vigil individual dancers are given the honor of leadingthe dancing portion of the ceremony. A first and second Palabra (those whocarry the word or obligation) are selected by the sponsor of the ceremony. Theseindividuals lead the two main columns in a serpentine dance known as \"Pasode Camino\" or marching step. They will lead the columns and ask the fourdirections for permission to form the circle. Usually, the elders and childrenposition themselves in the inner circle and the rest of the soldiers are left on theoutside circle to protect. The third palabra will be in charge of distributing orselecting who will be given the honor of offering a dance. Between these threepalabras/words the ceremony is carried to its final stage. The success of theceremony will depend on their danza leadership abilities. The dance ceremonystage does not end until the three palabras are symbolically returned to thesponsor of the ceremony/fiesta.Dancers within the Danza circle are graded on the perceived level of\"Obligaccion,\" or how they fulfill a ceremony. Dancers endure and sacrificetheir body and energy to see that a ceremony is completed. Prestige does not8268 Teaching Indigenous Languagesfall on those who dance the hardest or fastest but rather on those dancers whodance from the heart, \"de Corazon.\"These are the traditions and obligations that our ancestors have left us; it isthe obligation of every danzante to fulfill the motto of \"Union, Conformidad, yConquista\", or Union, Conformity, and Conquest. This is the emblem of everydanzante. Wherever one goes one enters into union with their host group. If onehas chosen to be there it is based on their own will and with the understandingthat they must conform to the rules and structure of that particular Capitan.Therefore each ceremony, march, and engagement is a battle where only con-quest is the acceptable conclusion.What are the requirements for revernacularization?It was necessary to confirm the ancestral culture, spiritual transformation,and linguacide experienced by those that have inherited Danza Azteca-Chichimeca in addition to the different political phases of Mexico that havehad a dramatic effect on the lives of indigenous people and their descendants.Resistance and adaptation have maintained the Nahuatl language in its currentstate. The lack of appropriate educational structures have caused indigenouspeople within Mexico and outside to reach different the Los Angeles, California area) havefound alternatives; appropriate and innovate new ways of recovering an origi-nal culture as Danzantes. Historical truths and imposed circumstances requirea profound search for the meaning of Danza through its organic mode of ex-pression. Therefore, Danza should be conducted in its original languages.Nahuatl is one of the recognized languages. Having stated a legitimate right toreclaim such a resource, it is necessary to implement programs and visions thatwill revernacularize Nahuatl as one of the lingua francas of the Danza Azteca-Chichimeca. This vision requires a search for different methods, processes, andmodels for implementation and success. A framework for such a foundationwas introduced by Joshua Fishman (1996). Fishman's foundation begins byexpressing the need for vernaculars at the infancy phase within the infant'sfamily. These vernaculars are the first set of psycholinguist constructs receivedby the infant to begin building his/her world, starting from infancy and up tothe age five and before the child is enrolled in any education system.Schools teach and students are required to learn the prescribed curriculum.The school is programmed and not intergenerational. Mother-tongues areintergenerational and not programmed. The school deals with materials foreignto the indigenous child's environment. Intergenerational groups contain intactseniors who are an immense source of linguistic knowledge. Dr. Fishman fur-ther points out that,Vernacularization is the opposite of institutionalization.Revernacularization requires not only inter-generation language trans-mission, but societal change. More than a language is involved. If youE369 Teaching Indigenous Languagesare going to change the language, you have to change the society. Thatis, informal society must change its way of living during the long stretchfrom one generation to the next. Schools do not stretch that long, fromone generation to the next. Informal role relationships already estab-lished in a new language must come to be implanted in the old lan-guage, in order for the old language to be transmitted from parents tochildren. Parents are already speaking the new language; they have tochange themselves, and they need a society that is changing, too, forthem to transmit it to a newborn as a mother tongue. Informal topicsand places already associated with the new language must come to beassociated with the old language, if it is to be transmitted via intimacyand in infancy. (1996, p. 193)Fishman's research has shown him,that it is possible for small groups of quite atypical individuals to rear-range their lives individually and collectively exactly in this revolu-tionary way. The more dislocated the language is, the smaller thosegroups will be. A language that is far gone requires a great deal ofidiosyncratic support. (1996, p. 194)Dislocation causes these groups to depend on themselves entirely, rather thanoutside support. These groups may not succeed completely in achieving theirgoals, but in the process they are able to create a community of hope. Lan-guage-reversal requires an immense amount of hope. Change must involve in-formal conversions in status-gain, friendship-gain, and affection-gain.Grupos Unidos represents a coalition of Danzantes from different educa-tion levels and ages, from 2 to 76 years, in Los Angeles, California. FewDanzantes have any college education; the majority have limited education.Spanish is the primary language of most of the Danzantes. Few Danzantes un-derstand the mythical/ historical evolution of Danza. Most of the knowledge isconcentrated in a few individuals, usually the captain of the Danza group andother self-educated individuals.Fishman's prescription can be applied to the Danza Azteca-Chichimecaframework. Many of the current trends within Danza, as expressed within theUnited States, are focusing on intergenerational intimacy with children. Manyof the children of Danzantes are given names in Nahuatl such as Citlalli,Ilhuicamina, Tonatiuh, and the like. The act of dancing is always done in anintergenerational and coed environment. Individuals in Danza would be classi-fied as atypical groups of people that have rearranged their lives completelyaround Danza. It is estimated that 50 thousand to one million danzantes existswithin the United States and Mexico. These groups of people have devotedtheir lives around Danza. Danzantes travel from one ceremony to another ful-filling their obligations to the Danza. Danza also allows the acquiring of per-sonal benefits such as prestige from one's ability to dance. An extended family 7084 Teaching Indigenous Languagesis created through participation in Danza. A Danzantes' ability to execute cer-emony and Danza gives them recognizable status within the Danza groups. Inthis manner Danza fulfills Fishman's prescription for a contextual environmentfor language renewal.Fishman further requires that individuals have a consciousness of theircultural loss. About two years ago groups encountered dissatisfaction with thecurrent form of disseminating knowledge within Danza. Grupos Unidos cametogether and joined to implement classes to close the gap between those indi-viduals who had the knowledge and the novice Danzante. Among these classeswere lectures on:Nahua history from an indigenous perspective,A deeper understanding of Danza steps,Creation myths,Making and playing indigenous instruments, andClassical Nahuatl.With the ongoing lecture series on Classical Nahuatl being most important.The goals with these classes were to develop appropriate self-education andautonomy as Fishman has suggested. Those involved began a tedious processof research on their history, traditions, myths, and language. The resources usedwhere public libraries, university libraries, and elders from Mexico. The resultfrom the studying was a consensus that for Danzantes to penetrate into an or-ganic understanding of their traditions, it was required that Nahuatl berevernacularized.An informal survey of Danzantes from Grupos Unidos was done to deter-mine indigenous language membership based on point of origin. It was agreedthat Nahuatl was the dominate language. From this a decision needed to bemade as to what version of Nahuatl Grupos Unidos would be learning. Re-searching documentation from scholars like Campbell and Karttunen (1989)and Lockhart (1992) contributed towards determining that Classical Nahuatl(or Nahuatl at the point of European contact) was the root to understanding themodern variations. In fact, Classical Nahuatl is one of the most well docu-mented of indigenous languages from this continent. This element was neces-sary for a group of people who have been completely disconnected from theirindigenous language. Reaching this stage of consciousness established a con-sensual environment for language renewal necessary to begin implementingthe process, model, and pedagogy for revernacularizing of Classical Nahuatl.Through our research we found many classical methods used to acquire aforeign language. Included were elements such as comprehension, memoriza-tion, field theory, word morphology, mnemonic devices, grammar, and dictio-nary usage. Through a series of lectures that lasted over a period of a year, in1996, and continue to be given once or twice a month, processes listed previ-ously were used to introduce Danzantes to their original language. Class sizesvaried from 12 to 30 people. 71 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesA tool that was used extensively was comprehension (Nattinger, 1988). Aword list was provided to the student in Nahuatl, English, and Spanish. Everyword in the list was explained regarding its meaning and how it was used in asentence construction. Memorization was a requirement for vocabulary build-ing. Additionally, lists were given where words were paired associates. Imple-menting the tool of comprehension, the paired associates had sentences pre-sented to provide context and meaning. In the area of Field Theory, as pre-scribed by German linguist Trier in 1930's, under the assumption that wordscan be classified by field, we presented students with vocabulary lists withsome example field sets (Carter, 1988). Time adverbs:AchtopafirstprimeroQuantity:tepitzi:nlittle bitpoquitoInterrogativesca:ninwhere?Donde?Pronouns:nehhua:tlIYoNumbers:o:metwodosPlace adverbs:nica:nhereaquiIndefinite pronouns:AcahsomeonealguienNegation:ahmo:nonoAnimals:a:zcatlanthormigaPlants:xo:chitlflowerflorPeople:cihtligrandmotherabuelaAgents:a:mapo:huanireaderalguien que Huitztzilmazatzin's Schematic Grammar ofClassical Ncihuatl was used to present the grammar and word morphology.Whenever possible, loci, or cognitive mappings, were used to help with memo-rization. Danzas still maintain indigenous names, for example Mayahuel,Tezcatlihpoca, Huitzilopochtli, and Tonantzin, and the meaning of the nameswere explained.A model that has been extremely successful for language transmission hasbeen the Asher's (1996) Total Physical Response (TPR) method. The new lan-guage is introduced as a series of imperatives that link language with overtactions performed by Danzantes. Danza is a dramatic artform that lends itselfto Asher's Songs were recovered from Sahagun's Florentine Codexand the Canteres Mexicanos. These songs went through a process of retranslationand were arranged to be sung and danced. Some elements that needed to beconsidered were current styles of songs being sung today. Most of the musiccorpus of the Danzantes has been inherited from the Conchero style of singing.This style involves one individual singing a stanza, and the rest of the groupresponds with the same stanza. This method was used to insure transmission ofthe songs, and it only required one person to remember the song. This was acommon singing practice. The songs recovered where done in the same man- 72 Teaching Indigenous Languagesner. From this process of reintegrating Nahuatl songs, a song book was pro-duced that was distributed to the Danza Groups. At ceremonies individualsfrom Grupos Unidos would sing the new Nahuatl songs instead of the old styleConchero songs (alabanzas).One last tool that was used were dictionaries. As Della Summers (1988)has stated in her essay, \"The role of dictionaries in language learning,\"Dictionaries for language learning have been largely ignored in thewealth of books and articles on language learning by linguists, psy-chologists, and language teachers. There is a strong insistence thatwords should not be thought of individually, or 'in isolation', and dic-tionaries are seen as reinforcing the students' tendency to learn indi-vidual words when acquiring a second language. (p. 111)Dictionaries were used for differentiation of similar words, drawing the atten-tion of readers to similar words, and for examples of usage (see the Appendixfor a short bibliography of dictionaries). Most of the dictionaiies were no longerin print, and it became necessary to produce our own. Another problem withthe dictionaries was that most of them only went one way, Nahuatl to Englishor Nahuatl to Spanish, with the exception of Molina's dictionary, which alsohad Spanish to Nahuatl. We produced three dictionaries that where focused onusage: Nahuatl to English (16,917 to to Nahuatl (2,221 words). These dictionaries contained cross-ref-erenced words that exist in published dictionaries. Another important differ-ence is that our dictionaries are geared towards word production versus wordanalysis.Traditionally most language reversal projects have met with the problemof not being able to reach enough people and then stagnating. Danza Azteca-Chichimeca solves this problem with its inter-connectivity. Danzantes travelall the way from San Francisco, California, to Mexico City. In this manner thestructure of Danza lends itself extremely well to the dissemination of informa-tion, goods, and current dress styles. Grupos Unidos have been using this in-herent quality of Danza to disseminate songs, grammar books, self-produceddictionaries, and exercises north to San Francisco California, east to Texas, andsouth into Mexico.ConclusionEarly on, requirements were set for reacquiring a lost culture, spirituality,and language. Historical events form the foundation and reassure the rightful-ness in reclaiming an original cultural expression. There has been a disconnec-tion from an original language through the imposition of a conqueror's lan-guage that many continue to espouse through ignorance and conditioning. Anexternal spirituality continues to be defended that does not addressconnectiveness to the land. Again, ignorance perpetuates the minimization ofan organic culture, spirituality, and the lack of a truthful historical record. It is 73 Teaching Indigenous Languagesnecessary to move from the realm of mimicking to the realm of expressing adeep understanding of an organic culture. This will only be possible throughthe revernacularization of original languages. As it was pointed out in the 1995Stabilizing Indigenous Languages Symposium by Joshua Fishman (1996), criti-cal mass is the true measure of a successful language reversal program. WhileGrupos Unidos is unable to claim numerically the success of their programs,outside groups have recognized the validity of their programs. The indicatorsused to measure success are demonstrated when other groups have learned andsung the songs that were introduced a year before. It is impossible to restoreNahuatl as a full blown language, but at least we can hope for some measurablefunctional bilingualism. An attempt is being made to build a community ofhope through Danza circles, to become strong, to continue to resist, to continueto appropriate, and to innovate. These qualities along with the structures thatexist within the Danza will allow for hope to see the vision to fruition.

Republica Argentina, 076 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesKinder Apache Song and Dance ProjectM. Trevor Shank lin, Carla Paciotto, and Greg Prater This paper presents the results of the evaluation of theKinder Apache Song and Dance Project (KASDP) that was piloted ina kindergarten class at John E Kennedy Day School in Cedar Creekon the White Mountain Apache Reservation. The report illustrates theissues involved both in the implementation and the assessment of theproject. The following outcomes were observed: the children gainedknowledge of and pride in their culture, the children began to sing thesongs they had learned spontaneously, at least one child began to usethe Apache language outside the classroom, and the image of the schoolas a focal point of the community was reinforced. In the Winter 1995 special issue of the Bilingual Research Journal de-voted to language maintenance among various American Indian groups, theformer president of the Navajo Nation Peterson Zah is quoted as saying:It is a priority of the Navajo Nation President and a dream of the Na-vajo Division of Dine (Navajo) Education to some day take control oftheir own education. It is the mission of the Division of Education toassure that all Navajo people have the opportunity to be educated, andto be able to carry on the work of building the Navajo Nation. Navajoyoung people need to be proud that they are Navajo and hold respectfor the heritage, land, and people to which they belong. They need tobe able to build strength from their culture, language, and history, andhave faith in their own potential. (Begay et. al., 1995, pp. 136-137)This is in face of a dramatic decline in use of Navajo since the mid-1950's.Between 1980 and 1990 the proportion of English-only speakers, age 5 andolder, on the Navajo reservation doubled from 7.2 to 15 percent (Crawford,1995). The percentage of young children who are Navajo speakers has fallenfrom 95% in 1969 to 52% in 1993. In a special program introduced at FortDefiance Elementary in 1986, the researchers found that \"only a third of in-coming kindergartners had even passive knowledge of Navajo. Less that a tenthof the five-year-olds were reasonably competent speakers of Navajo\" (Holm &Holm, 1995).The developments on the Navajo Reservation are typical for the decline ofAmerican Indian languages in the last few decades. In all of Canada, \"only13% of children ages 5-14 speak their indigenous languages\" (Fteeman et al.,1995, p. 41). Nonetheless it is the expressed policy of the United States and anumber of tribal governments to arrest this language shift. The Native Ameri- 77 Teaching Indigenous Languagescan Languages Act of 1990 states, \"The status of the cultures and languages ofNative Americans is unique and the United States has the responsibility to acttogether with Native Americans to ensure the survival of these unique culturesand languages\" (as quoted in Reyhner & Tennant, 1995, p. 285). As the quotefrom the former president of the Navajo Nation illustrates, in addition, there isa strong pedagogical aspect to the issue of language maintenance, namely in-creasing the self-esteem of the indigenous student population. One reason forthis is summarized by Jordan in describing the history of the KEEP/RoughRock collaboration: \"Good education is made better when cultural knowledgeis used to inform the selection and development of educational practice\" (1995,p. 97). Another reason is the sense of culture conveyed by the language. AMohawk speaker noted that Mohawk teaches the core of the culture,' respectand thanksgiving...through the language one learns that what one does affectsoneself and everyone else, reinforcing a sense of being connected\" (Freeman etal., 1995, p. 63).A survey of bilingual education programs among Native American popu-lations in Canada concludes that \"the continuing sense of family and commu-nity [is] the primary route for indigenous language learning\" (Freeman et al.,1995, p. 46). But this is also a potential problem area in revitalizing a languagein a state of decline as \"finding Aboriginal language instructors has sometimesbeen a problem... Limited availability has meant that classes may not be of-fered as readily as desired\" (Freeman, et al., p. 57-58).Based on one of the author's experiences working in teacher-training pro-grams in Portugal and Hungary, the sense of culture and community is moststrongly expressed in the sharing of folk songs. The number of folks songs thatstudents and teachers know is phenomenal and songfests can continue until thelast person drops. This was also an avenue for sharing cultures; i.e. singingEnglish folk songs is an integral part of the English as a Foreign Language(EFL) community.Zepeda, who has done research on the Tohono 0' odham of Southern Ari-zona, writes how oral story-telling traditions are transmitted to the written En-glish works of the children. A special place is allotted for songs that are consid-ered as flowers for the ears.' Songs are stimulating and enjoyable in the oralmedium in the same way that objects and experiences are stimulating to otherhuman senses\" (Zepeda, 1995, p. 7).The proposal to introduce song and dance in the Kindergarten in the nativelanguage at John F. Kennedy (JFK) Day School could help foster a sense ofcommunity and pride in the culture and greater awareness of traditional values,in addition to serving as a handy language-learning device. A parent surveyindicates that there is strong community support for such a project, and a pro-cess of careful preparation was involved in choosing the songs and the dances.Project implementationUnfortunately, the problem of finding elders who are competent in the lan-guage, familiar with the traditions and available hampered the timely imple-C278 Teaching Indigenous Languagesmentation of the project. As of the first week in November 1996, when theproject was to have been reaching its conclusion, a medicine man had still notbeen found. In addition two key persons in the project, the kindergarten classteacher and the Apache teacher aide, left at the beginning of the school year,along with three other staff members. The Apache teacher aide was especiallycritical to the success of the project, and it seems that the school's financialconstraints also played a role in the inability to replace her.This supports a point made by the investigators of the successful RoughRock Elementary School bilingual program on the Navajo Reservation: \"noneof the changes described here is possible without the presence of a stable coreof local bilingual teachers\" (Begay et al., 1995, p. 133). They go on to say thata necessary condition for facilitating change is that \"there must be consistencyand longevity of local program personnel and staff development opportunities,along with a firm commitment to program goals\" (Begay et al., p. 135). We donot think the evidence from this paper supports this as a necessary condition:they are simply factors that were at hand or developed at Rough Rock. But thesituation at JFK illustrates that the same conditions that plague the communityalso strike back at attempts to nurture a culture conducive to fostering changeand building self-esteem.Research designWe were of the opinion that an evaluation of the project should measure itssuccess in terms of enthusiasm generated and success in mastering the skillstaught. As the kindergarten teacher stressed in a meeting on December 6, 1996,at JFK school, the children were expected to coordinate three separate skills:simultaneously, singing, dancing, and beating a rhythm. Their success at doingthis could best be evaluated by the kindergarten teacher and through video-tapes. In the December meeting we asked about a focus group discussion withparents and teachers (i.e. the kindergarten teacher and the Apache song anddance instructor). All present supported this concept. From the focus group, weplanned to obtain data that bore on the two issues highlighted above: enthusi-asm of the children and their success at mastering the skills. We agreed that thefocus group was to be audio-taped and the tape used as a basis to compare notestaken during the discussion.Results and discussionThe data analysis included analyzing the qualitative notes and the tabu-lated data. The video presented two main parts: extracts of a day-long field tripof the kindergarten class escorted by the bilingual and kindergarten teachersand led by a community elder knowledgeable in traditional Apache culture,and three hours of dance and song instruction. Three major themes of culturaltransmission, pupil involvement, and skill mastery emerged from the analysisof the qualitative notes and the tabulated data collected during the viewing ofthe video, demonstrating the extent of the relevance of the program in main-taining native Apache culture. 793 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThe high amount of cultural content transmitted during the field trip wasthe main feature in the interaction between the Apache elder and the kinder-gartners. The children were exposed to traditional cultural practices, such asthe building of a cairn for devotional purposes, and heard about the history ofthe sacred path where the cairn was going to be built. The elder also picked andshowed plants traditionally used for healing purposes and demonstrated how tomake a traditional drumstick for the song and dance program, and the bilingualteacher showed how the grinding stone was employed in past times by Apachegroups. Throughout the trip, the elder and the bilingual teacher spoke in Apacheand addressed objects and practices with their Apache names.The elder was able to keep the attention of the children with a gentle andnatural way of speaking and interacting. He pointed to traditional gender rulesin the different practices (\"girls used to grind\"), and he also emphasized theneed for \"not being in a hurry\" when making a drumstick and pointed at thebeauty of the drumstick's shape. In addition, the elder created a sense of conti-nuity between present and past history through his narrative of the sacred path.During the second part of the video, a majority of the children were dressedup in traditional clothes and demonstrated their awareness of the importance ofthe attire (e.g., a girl kept adjusting her dress in a very caring way) for thesinging and dance rehearsal that took place in the gym. Some boys appeared tobe very conscious of their good skills in mastering the Crown Dance. In one ofthe classroom instruction sessions, they were showing off their dance steps,while during the gym rehearsal they modeled the steps for less-skilled boys.The second theme that emerged from the video was the high level of in-volvement of the children throughout the field trip and song and dance instruc-tion. All of the children demonstrated their enjoyment of the activity by partici-pating in a very cooperative and sociable manner, always smiling and wellbehaved.Finally the third theme, the mastery of the various skills involved (i.e.,dancing, singing, and beating the drumsticks) in the instruction was evident. Itwas observed that the general mastery of the dances and songs was a functionof the difficulty of the overall task and of the pedagogical/instructional prac-tices. In general, the more complicated the task, the less likely the childrenwere able to master it.Specifically, when the children were given the opportunity to master oneskill at a time, they achieved a higher proficiency. When the teacher had thechildren sit in the formation of a choir in order to only sing, they all partici-pated and achieved a high level of skill mastery. Similarly, the children seemedto accomplish the tasks more skillfully when the teacher divided them intodifferent groups with separate tasks (i.e., a group played the drums while an-other danced around) in turn-taking fashion and often varied the songs anddances. In this way, the children also tended to stay on task for a longer periodof time.On the other hand, when the task was compounded by asking the studentsto perform the three skills at the same time, their level of skill mastery lessenedc: 480 Teaching Indigenous Languagesand one task overshadowed the others. In general, the singing was the mostdemanding task for the children to accomplish, and in the final rehearsal thechildren all danced and beat the drumsticks but failed to sing more than the firstverse.Final performance and focus groupThe setting for the final performance and focus group discussion was thegymnasium at JFK Elementary in Cedar Creek. A potluck dinner was held forparents and grandparents. The program evaluators, the Apache bilingual pro-gram coordinator and her husband, a first-grade Native American teacher, eightof the 17 children in the class (all dressed up, most traditionally), the principal,the kindergarten teacher, and the school counselor also attended.The Apache bilingual program coordinator sang and played the drum forthe dances. The children were extremely well behaved. They sang with gusto,especially an Apache version of Old McDonald. During the performance, manyparents were taking pictures. After the break, the children ended the perfor-mance with a circle dance where the three boys were sitting in a circle and thegirls dancing around them. All the girls but one would step back and dance in aline while the remaining girl continued to dance around the boys until she tappedone on the head, who would then get up and dance around with her arm-in-armbefore sitting down again.The kindergarten teacher started off the focus group discussion, after theinitial period of silence, by conveying his still very favorable impressions ofthe field trip. At first there was very little response, but gradually the parentsopened up to the evaluators and started responding to each other. We were verycareful not to comment on their observations but just to facilitate the discus-sion. When asked, those present were 100% in support of program (14 present).One participant said, and others showed their agreement, that they would likethe children to read and write in Apache (According to the Apache bilingualprogram coordinator, only 12 people know how to read and write Apache; theorthography was approved by the tribal council in the 70's). The issue of poten-tial language conflict arose. There seemed to be widespread agreement thatlearning (at least some) Apache would not impede students' English acquisi-tion.One person commented that she did not feel it would be a problem if thechildren learned the native plants in Apache; this would not hinder their devel-opment in English. Another woman added that she was sorry she did not findout from her mother and grandmother the names of the plants. The Apachebilingual program coordinator interjected that during the field trip a little girlsaid she would show the kindergarten teacher a plant that is used to make amedicinal tea with. When asked if the program should be extended, everyonenodded agreement. A grandmother expressed concern about the dances con-veying non-Christian religion as she would like her grandchildren to be broughtup as Christians. The Apache bilingual program coordinator, who said a prayerto start the potluck and who another participant observed had sung Christian 81S5 Teaching Indigenous Languageshymns in Apache, spoke softly and at some length of the distinction betweenlearning the songs and dance and the religious issue. The KASDP grant writer,a former teacher at JFK, ended the session by describing how she had watchedthe sense of Apache identity growing in the children and suggesting that ar-rangements should be made for the parents to watch the videotapes.Other views from project participantsConcerning the impact on language skills, the kindergarten teacher remarkedin the meeting on December 6 that \"he is starting to hear Apache words fromthe children and starting to learn some himself. Also the children sometimesspontaneously break out into song and dance.\" During our final visit, the kin-dergarten teacher once again informed us that the children often start spontane-ously singing some of the songs they have learned when engaged in other tasks.This is a quote from the focus group discussion:I think the project was very important for them as Apache childrenwho didn't know very much about their culture...They are singingthose songs now in the classroom as much as they sing \"Mary Had aLittle Lamb.\"...It just feels right to me.During the focus group discussion, the kindergarten teacher repeated his verypositive impressions of the early field trip that he had mentioned in our conver-sation from November:It was a wonderful day for me and for the children. It was informativeand interesting...The medicine man showed the vegetation and whatit was used for. He would take a few steps in any direction and show10 different plants. He managed to keep the children's attention evenat the age of 5.The Apache song and dance instructor noted in our December meeting that\"the songs were picked up easily by the children but retention was more diffi-cult for those pupils who were not being raised in an Apache-speaking home.\"Religious controversyIn a conversation in November 1996 the grant writer informed us that twoparents did not agree about the implementation of the project because of theirreligious beliefs. One child was pulled from the class for this reason. He washappy that the great majority of the parents had agreed to their children's par-ticipation. In our January meeting, the school psychologist also discussed thereligious controversy surrounding the project. She said:Children get confused because of religious conflict. Once, last year,an eighth grader brought a pamphlet from the...Church in which they j32 Teaching Indigenous Languagesshowed Heaven and Hellthe Crown Dancers were at the gates ofHell.She was concerned about the impact of the pamphlet on the self-esteem of thechild.SummaryThis brief description of the KASDP provided here documents the diffi-culties in implementation as well as the positive impact of the project on thechildren, the school, and the community. The impediments, many endemic to aproject of this nature, pay tribute to the success of the project by testing theideas that it embodies in the practicalities of actual school life. The children,school staff, and community all responded positively. The children were in-volved, enjoyed themselves, and took an obvious pride in their culture. Parentswere supportive as shown in their initial agreement to the project, the dressingup of the children for the videotaped performance in December, attendance atthe final performance, and the remarks shared with the focus-group facilitators.Some of those impediments were high staff turnover in the school, school bud-get constraints, difficulty in finding a facilitator, the lack of pedagogical exper-tise on the part of the facilitator, and the religious controversy in the commu-nity concerning traditional Apache dance.We think that it is quite likely that the project had the positive impact onself-esteem desired. For that really to be measured, similar projects need to beimplemented throughout the curriculum. There is widespread support for anextension of the project, and we can only hope that funds can be found to ac-complish this.Any extension of the project would be helped by building in a staff-devel-opment component to train facilitators and to assist the regular classroom in-structor in integrating such projects into the curriculum. For other facilitatorswe would recommend keeping in mind that the less difficult a task is, the greaterthe mastery by the children. Group work can easily be used. The children seemedto be on task when divided into several groups, with each group engaged in aseparate activity. This is aided by the fact that the children are very social, aswas strikingly seen during the break periods. Individual prompting also allowedthe facilitator to monitor which of the children were actually learning the songs.In individual groups some boys modeled the dancing for others. This kind ofpeer support can be encouraged.The value of the program extends beyond the positive effects seen on thechildren. As we have seen in the focus group, the school can become a centerfor an intergenerational meeting where community members can discuss issuesinvolved in the maintenance of their culture. When the Bilingual Program Co-ordinator responded to the religious concerns of some of the parents and grand-parents, the focus group session became a forum for reflection. As Fishmanwrites, we cannot rely only on the school for cultural transmission. However, 830 Teaching Indigenous Languagesthe school can be a focal point for this discussion, provided there is a strong,supportive community:these institutions should foster the language as links with the outsideworld, with the informal interactions that constitute the bulk of life,the crux of intergenerational mother-tongue transmission.

Watahomigie,Akira Y. Yamamoto, and Ofelia Zepeda In considering what can be done to reverse language shift, manylook to schools as primary resources. But school-based language re-newal programs also have been criticized for transferring responsi-bility for mother tongue transmission from its necessary domainsthe family and communityto a secondary or tertiary institution. Inthis paper, we present one model for connecting school, community,and university resources to strengthen indigenous languages: theAmerican Indian Language Development Institute. In 18 years of op-eration, AILDI has: 1) raised consciousness about the linguistic andcultural stakes at risk; 2) facilitated the development of indigenousliteratures and a cadre of native-speaking teachers; and 3) influencedfederal policy through a grassroots network of indigenous languageadvocates. Here, we look at the program's development, provide rec-ommendations for developing similar institutes, and suggest specificstrategies for strengthening indigenous languages in the contexts ofcommunity, home, and school. In the summer of 1978, 18 parents and elders representing Diguerio,Havasupai, Hualapai, Mohave, and Yavapai language communities traveled toSan Diego State University for the first Yuman Language Institute. There theyworked with academic linguists and bilingual educators who shared their inter-est in the literate forms of Yuman languages and a commitment to use linguisticknowledge to improve curriculum and practice in Indian schools. What hascome to be known as the American Indian Language Development Institute(AILDI) began with this small group and participants' desire to \"learn to readand write my language\" (Salas, 1982, p. 36). Their efforts ultimately wouldreach far beyond the Yuman language family to influence indigenous languageeducation throughout the United States, Canada, and Latin America.Conceived by Lucille Watahomigie (Hualapai), director of the nationallyrecognized &Yamamoto, Hinton, and the late John Rouillard(Sioux) of San Diego State University, the institute trained 18 native speakersof the five Yuman languages. The only program requirement, Hinton et al. (1982,p. 22) write, was that participants be native speakers interested in working withtheir respective languages. The focus of the first institute was \"Historical/Com-parative Linguistics: Syntax and Shoshone, Northern Ute, O'odham, Shoshone,Northern Ute, Yaqui, Yavapai Chemehuevi,Havasupai, Hualapai, Lakota, institutes were held; the institute at the University of Arizona was offered in conjunction with the Linguistic Society of America and Modem Language AssociationSummer Institute.I nu tLBEST COPY AVAILABIA Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThe following joined by the late Milo Kalecteca (Hopi), director ofthe Bilingual Education Service Center University (ASU), andlinguists Ofelia Zepeda (Tohono O'odham) and Akira Y. Yamamoto, the insti-tute teamed academic linguists with 50 native speakers in an intensive four-week training program. During that time institute participants examined theirlanguages, developed practical writing systems, designed curriculum, and cre-ated native language teaching materials. The focus of this second institute, whichincluded its inception in San Diego, the institute has been hosted by NorthernArizona University in Flagstaff, Southwest Polytechnic Institute in Albuquer-que, ASU in Tempe, and the University of Arizona in Tucson. Prior to 1990,AILDI faculty had to renegotiate institute summer sites each year. Since 1990,however, AILDI has been permanently housed at the University of Arizona.Over the years, the number and diversity of participants and language groupshave grown; in 1996, the institute enrolled 116 participants representing lan-guage groups throughout the United States and Canada and from Venezuelaand Brazil. Altogether, the institute has prepared over 1,000 parents and school-based educators to work as researchers, curriculum developers, and advocatesfor the conservation and development of indigenous languages and cultures.Most participants are native speakers of an indigenous language, but AILDIhas never turned away any applicant. Today, it is open to all who are interestedin the maintenance of indigenous languages and the application of linguisticand cultural knowledge to classroom practice.Institute goals and pedagogyI used to wonder why the students would just sit there when theteacher gave them all these verbal directions. 1 know now that it wasbecause they did not understand. I used to wonder why, when theteacher would ask the student to write a story about a city or an unfa-miliar place, they would only write one or two sentences... They wereonly trying to tell us that there was not anything of meaning to them.This will give you an idea of what I've learned at the institute.Bilingual teacher assistant and AILDI participantAILDI's overarching goal is to incorporate linguistic and cultural knowl-edge into curriculum in ways that democratize schooling for indigenous stu-dents and support the retention of their languages and cultures. The statistics onIndian students' school performance are well documented; they are significantlyoverrepresented in low-ability, skill-and-drill tracks, and experience the high-est school dropout rates in the nation (U.S. Department of Education, 1991).Equally well documented are the immediate causes underlying these outcomes:curriculum \"presented from a purely Western (European) perspective,\" low102.88 Teaching Indigenous Languageseducator expectations, loss of \"the wisdom of the older generations,\" and a\"lack of opportunity for parents and communities to develop a real sense ofparticipation\" (U.S. Department of Education 1991, pp. 7-8). Our hope is thatthrough their involvement in the institute, participants will return to their homecommunities with the knowledge, skills, and support necessary to challengethe English-only, deficit-driven pedagogies that have characterized Indian edu-cation and debilitated indigenous students academically. Just as important, weseek to heighten awareness of the preciousness of indigenous mother tonguesand assist participants in their struggle to maintain their languages and cul-tures. Finally, we aim to prepare academic professionals such as ourselves toengage in mutually beneficial research and teaching activities in indigenouscommunities.With these goals in mind, the AILDI holds this basic view of language andculture teaching:Language is not taught by mere word lists and grammatical drills. Andnative literature is not fully appreciated by pupils if it is presented intranslation. Language and literature can be taught most effectively byteachers who are native speakers of the language and are trained toteach in elementary and secondary schools with language materialsand literature produced by native speakers. (Watahomigie & Yamamoto1992, p. 12)Hence, AILDI emphasizes bilingual/bicultural education within a whole lan-guage paradigm (Goodman, 1986; Fox, 1992), experiential and interactive teach-ing strategies, alternative assessment such as literacy portfolios (Tiemey et al.,1991), and more generally what Cummins (1989, 1992) has called \"empower-ment\" pedagogies. Institute participants engage in collaborative research, dia-logue, critique, and bilingual materials developmentthe same types of learn-ing processes in which they might engage their own learners at home. \"Mylearning experiences at AILDI were very relevant to what is happening in realclassrooms,\" one participant reports; \"I learned skills that I can use in whateverI may do in the future.\"Sharing and cooperative work are central to institute coursework. A recentparticipant recalls \"sharing our creative writing in class, laughing andcrying.... We had fun learning together.\" Frequently participants from the sameschool or language group work on joint projects. When funds have permitted,elders have been invited to work with participants from their communities onlanguage teaching projects. Participants also observe, practice, and coach eachother in microteaching learning centers (discussed below), a forum for pilotingthe methods and materials developed over the course of four weeks.In sum, AILDI has adapted Cummins' (1989, 1992) framework of fourfoldempowerment: 1894 rye Teaching Indigenous Languages 1.An additive/enrichment approach: Schooling for indigenous children shouldadd to and enrichnot replacethe cultural and linguistic resources chil-dren bring to school.2.Local education control: Indigenous communities have great knowledgeof their language and culture which should be the foundation of children'slearning in school. The community should have input and control over theschool curriculum.3.Interactive and experiential language learning: The content and organiza-tion of instruction should motivate students to use language naturally andcreatively in meaningful contexts, enabling children to inquire, critique,and generate their own knowledge.4.Advocacy-oriented assessment: Assessment should be holistic and authen-tic, allowing children to display their full array of bilingual strengths, ratherthan justifying deficit labels and remedial \"treatments.\"Figure 1 below illustrates these pedagogical concepts.Figure 1: AILDI Empowerment Pedagogies Identity AffirmationLanguage and Culture Maintenance4 490 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesOrganizing institute experiencesI've learned that I have many skills, and it made me proud to be anIndian.Bilingual teacher and AILDI participantAILDI is a learning-teaching environment in which participants can affirmtheir identities and their power to act as change agents within their home com-munities. This occurs within a four-week summer residential experience in whichparticipants attend classes, work individually and in small groups on curricu-lum and linguistics projects, critique existing curricula, and develop new texts(thematic units, autobiographical and biographical literature, poetry, dictionar-ies, and children's storybooks) that they can use in their classrooms. Each yeara theme is selected around which coursework and guest speaker sessions areorganized (see Table 1). Participants choose from a suite of related linguisticsand educational methods courses, enrolling for a total of six semester hours.Classes run from approximately 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, andare complemented by special evening sessions featuring speakers and topicsrelated to the theme. A sample list of courses is given below:Weaving the Future of Indigenous Languages1995 AILDI COURSES (All 3 Semester Credits)LING/AINS 102: Linguistics 495A/595A: Navajo in Indigenous Languages English.LRC 501: Language & Culture in Indian Education.LRC 428/528: Bilingual Curriculum Development.LRC 415/515: Media in Reading Language Arts (Computers &Media in Indian Bilingual Settings).LRC 499/595D: Applications of Language & Literacy: Math &Science in Indian Bilingual Classrooms.TTE 497P/597P: Parents as Partners in Indian Education.One AILDI hallmark is microteaching, literally \"lessons in miniature\" byparticipants at the culmination of the institute. Microteaching is an opportunityfor participants to engage as both learners and teachers within a collegial envi-ronment. Individually or in teams, participants present a language learning ac-tivity based on their curriculum projects; participants are encouraged to con-duct their demonstrations in their native language. Several microteaching cen-ters operate concurrently, with individuals or teams demonstrating two con-secutive times. This allows participants to refine their practice following peerfeedback from the first demonstration and enables all participants to observe alarger number of centers. If funds and time permit, AILDI faculty and staff 6: Teaching Indigenous Languagesvideotape the demonstrations. The videotapes are used for subsequent consul-tations with participants to review the strengths of their lessons and strategiesfor improvement.Microteaching lasts a full two days. It is one of the most powerful learningexperiences in the institutea celebration of participants' work and a hands-onopportunity to exchange a multitude of language teaching ideas. \"I am a visuallearner,\" one teacher-participant states in a reflection on the benefits ofmicroteaching. Another says that from microteaching, \"I was able to pick upideas from other teachers.\"AILDI also facilitates the credentialing and endorsement of participatingeducators. All AILDI courses apply toward university degree programs andbilingual and English-as-a-second-language endorsements. Degree advisementworkshops and individual advisement are scheduled each week. \"I like the one-on-one meeting,\" a participant recently remarked; \"I was very able to ask ques-tions and state some concerns.\" In addition, post-institute advisement and peri-odic on-site courses taught by AILDI faculty enable AILDI participants to worktoward their teaching and graduate degrees during the regular academic year.AILDI is characterized by sharing and communal learning. Microteachingand other small- and large-group activities, including after-class gatherings, allaim to create a community of co-learners and co-teachers. \"The collaborationof other nations is tremendously resourceful,\" an AILDI participant writes, add-ing: \"Bonding with other Indian educators is my greatest strength to advocatelanguage and culture maintenance.\" The building of collegial relationships isenhanced by the fact that participants and guest faculty share housing in one ofseveral apartment complexes or dormitories. When institute enrollment wasstill relatively low, faculty members conducted evening tutorials at the dormi-tories to assist participants in their linguistic and curriculum projects. Today,such conferencing occurs directly after class at the university. Participants alsoare encouraged to bring their children, spouses, and other family members tothe institute. Family-style housing near the campus is arranged for this pur-pose.Institutionalizing AILDITo implement a bilingual program, we first have to have funding andadministrative support, then community support.'Bilingual teacher and AILDI participantAs this participant suggests, the keys to institutionalizing any program areadequate funding and an acknowledged \"place\" for the program within the hostinstitution and the larger community. AILDI has always enjoyed strong supportfrom tribes and indigenous communities, who have contributed to participants'attendance through tribal and school-based grants. However, paying for staff,faculty, guest speakers, promotional literature, teaching materials, and otherbasic operations requires a stable financial base and an institutional home. This 92406 Teaching Indigenous Languageshas been a major challenge for AILDI and its faculty. A brief review of AILDI'shistory illustrates those challenges and how they have been addressed.The original Yuman Language Institute was funded by a National Endow-ment for the Humanities grant to San Diego State University obtained byWatahomigie, Hinton, and Rouillard. As the institute evolved to include addi-tional language groups, it became the centerpiece of a federal Title VII (Bilin-gual Education Act) grant for parent training administered through the TitleVII funded Bilingual Education Service Center (BESC) at Arizona State Uni-versity in Tempe. Institute faculty included the service center staff as well asAILDI's original faculty. In 1982, the U.S. Congress reauthorized Title VII,transforming the BESC into the National Indian Bilingual Center (NIBC), whichserved American Indian bilingual programs nationwide. NIBC continued tosupport AILDI and 16 regional institutes until the NIBC contract was elimi-nated in 1986 by a subsequent Congressional reauthorization. For several yearsthereafter AILDI was administered by the Arizona Department of Educationand funded by federal grants obtained by that agency. While this allowed theinstitute to continue to offer courses at Arizona State University, AILDI's ad-ministration by an external agency created serious management difficulties andmitigated against the program's institutionalization within the university.Throughout the years, continuity in AILDI's curriculum, pedagogy, andgoals has been assured by the presence of a core faculty that included cofound-ers Watahomigie and Yamamoto, along with Ofelia Zepeda of the University ofArizona and Teresa McCarty, who worked both at NIBC and the Arizona De-partment of Education. In 1989, Zepeda and McCarty became colleagues at theUniversity of Arizona in Tucson. With long-standing interests in institutional-izing the institute, they assumed responsibility for co-directing AILDI, joiningthe resources of their respective departments and colleges to sponsor the 1990institute. AILDI has since been housed in the Department of Language, Read-ing and Culture within the College of Education, receiving support from thatdepartment as well as from American Indian Studies, Linguistics, the GraduateCollege, and the Office of Undergraduate Student Affairs.During this time, AILDI enrollments continued to rise (see Table 1), dem-onstrating the need for the program and participants' enthusiasm for its newlocation. University administrators voiced their approval of the institute, andthe heads of the cosponsoring departments and vice president for graduate studiesactively assisted Zepeda and McCarty in obtaining funds and graduate assis-tants to coordinate participant registration and housing. The Graduate Collegedean cited AILDI as one of the university's \"showcase\" programs, and in 1993it was recognized in a national study by the U.S. Department of Education asone of 10 exemplary programs serving teachers of language minority students(Leighton et al., 1995). Nonetheless, lacking office space, operational monies,and sustained clerical and administrative help, and dependent on funds for par-ticipant stipends that had to be renegotiated with diverse university offices eachyear, the program struggled to survive. These difficulties led to the cancellationof the 1992 institute. 93 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThe situation grew more desperate until pressure by AILDI's co-directorsand their department heads secured $25,000 in university funds for a full-timeprogram coordinator. The hiring in 1993 of AILDI coordinator Karen Francis-Begay and the provision of an office and equipment within the Department ofLanguage, Reading and Culture, breathed new life into the program. In 1995,an opportunity arose to apply for permanent state funds. That year, 17 yearsafter the institute began, AILDI was awarded a permanent annual budget of$75,000. This was indeed cause for celebration.The current budget supports the coordinator, a part-time secretary, sup-plies and operations, some participant stipends, and year-round communityoutreach, recruitment, and retention activities. We continue to seek additionalfunds each year for participant stipends and guest speakers. However, AILDI atlast has secured a financial base and a \"place\" within its host university.Institute impactsSpeaking two languages is better than one....As I go back home, Iwant to work with program directors, teachers, and my community tolet them know bilingual education works and how important it is.Teacher assistant and AILDI participantAILDI's most immediate impacts can be readily observed in indigenousschools, classrooms, and communities. Previously unwritten languages havebeen committed to writing and in some cases standardized. As institute partici-pants have returned to their home communities, they have refined and pub-lished their summer projects, creating a small but growing indigenous litera-ture. \"Writing in my own language to create lessons for classroom use\" is atypical participant response to questions about the most useful aspects of theirAILDI experience. The numerous materials developed in Hualapai, Havasupai,Tohono O'odham, Akimel O'odham, Western Apache, and Navajo are but afew examples of the ways in which institute coursework has been transformedinto locally relevant curricula (see Figure 2). Even more important, AILDI hasbeen an integral force in the credentialing and endorsement of native-speakingteachers, many of whom have assumed administrative and other leadershippositions within their local schools.All of this has the potential to bring indigenous students' experiences di-rectly into the classroom, building on their linguistic and cultural resourcesinstead of treating those as deficits, and engaging students in using their expe-riences to learn. While no comprehensive study has been undertaken to docu-ment the extent to which this has occurred, a 1988-89 Arizona Department ofEducation study of Arizona participants is worth noting. The study followed 25Indian and non- Indian AILDI participants from four reservation schools forone year (McCarty, 1993). Data included observational records and videotapesof classroom interactions, teachers' logs, student writing samples and achieve-ment records, and participants' responses to written questionnaires. At the con- c)94I Teaching Indigenous LanguagesFigure 2. Examples of Curriculum Materials Developed by AILDI OF POEM BYGOIAS CHILDREN Adobe Sings: An ofPoems by HazhenSil Hane'(*Navajo Blessingway\") BESTCOPYAVAILABLE95C Teaching Indigenous Languageselusion of the academic year, the study reported \"dramatic improvements instudents' oral and written language development\" associated with cooperativelearning strategies developed at the institute, greater involvement by parentsand grandparents in children's literacy and biliteracy experiences, and a will-ingness by teachers to relinquish English-dominated basal readers and work-books for locally meaningful materials (McCarty, 1993, p. 91). In one teacher'swords, \"the training finally gave me the courage to throw out the workbooksand get students involved in real reading and writing\" (McCarty, 1993, p. 91).This teacher's rewards were great: Student attendance improved, the qualityand quantity of her students' writing increased, and one student \"on the vergeof dropping out,\" remained to complete the school year (McCarty & Zepeda,1990, p. 4).These local-level changes occurred simultaneously with larger tribal andnational policy developments. During institutes centered on language policies(see Table 1), AILDI participants from several communities generated triballanguage policies. Within a few years, this led to the adoption of formal poli-cies for Tohono O'odham, Northern Ute, and Pascua Yaqui proclaiming thoselanguages as official within their respective communities. These and other codesand policies for Navajo and Northern Cheyenne advocate bilingual/biculturaleducation and call on schools to act \"as a vehicle for the language, whether it isrestoring, retaining, or maintaining it\" (Zepeda, 1990, p. 249).At the national level, AILDI participants and attendees at the 1987 NativeAmerican Language Issues (NALI) conference held in conjunction with AILDI,drafted a resolution addressing the endangered state of indigenous U.S. lan-guages and the need for federal support for their maintenance and perpetuation.The resolution was sent to key federal-level decision makers, including Sena-tor Daniel Inouye, then head of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.In 1988, Inouye succeeded in introducing the Native American Languages Actbased on this resolution. Signed into law in 1990 by President Bush, the Actdeclares the U.S. government's policy to \"preserve, protect, and promote therights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop NativeAmerican languages\" (Public Law 101-477, Sect. 104[1]). The Native Ameri-can Languages Act has propelled some of the boldest new initiatives in indig-enous language revitalization (see, e.g., Hinton, 1994; McCarty & Zepeda, inpress).Finally, AILDI has served as a model for the recruitment and retention ofindigenous students into the university and for revisioning how universities\"do\" teacher education. AILDI is the only program of its kind on campus, andthe only program in the state to offer an approved curriculum for bilingual andESL endorsements in American Indian languages. On a larger scale, it is theonly American Indian language program to provide a total multicultural, multi-lingual immersion experience. \"I had a wonderful experience [at the institute],\"an alumnus writes, \"largely because of the other participants.\" She continues:\"I knew that the immersion with people of other cultures would enrich me andit truly dideven more than I could have guessed.\" 96 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThese qualities and AILDI's direct relevance to tribal community needsmake it a natural vehicle for Indian student recruitment. \"AILDI is more fo-cused on our instructional needs,\" 'friendly' experience.\"Still others add: \"This institute is more relevant to my background...AILDIstands above any bilingual training!\" Such positive experiences lead many par-ticipants to continue their professional development in undergraduate and gradu-ate degree programs. In its first four summers at the University of Arizona,AILDI enrolled 162 undergraduates, most of whom were Indian teacher assis-tants. Of these, 12 or seven percent have matriculated in education degree pro-grams and four have graduated. During the same period, the institute enrolled181 graduate students; 35 have matriculated and 15 have graduated with master'sdegrees. Several of the latter now are pursuing education specialist and doc-toral degrees.It is perhaps for all these reasons that AILDI has been adapted and repli-cated in Indian communities throughout the U.S. Between 1983 and 1986, credit-bearing institutes based on the AILDI model were held for Northern Ute, Ojibwe,Navajo, Lakota, and Keresan language groups(Swisher & Led low, 1986). More recently, Yamamoto and his colleagues initi-ated the Oklahoma Native American Language Institute (ONALDI) strength of theinstitute model,\" Swisher and Led low (1986, p. 63) note, \"is that it presentsacademically sophisticated concepts to educational practitioners who ordinarilymight not have received such training. This is critical to American Indian bilin-gual projects, who necessarily develop their own curricula.\"AILDI and indigenous language maintenanceItscary how important language is....If I only had someone from myschool to help me, this is what I would do: Make a curriculum to ben-efit the students from kindergarten to eighth grade, speak just in mynative language to the kindergartners, and repeat this system everyyear until the kindergarten children are in the eighth grade.Bilingual teacher and AILDI participantOver the years AILDI has increased the value of the linguistic and culturalcapital brought to school by indigenous students through its facilitation of cur-ricula, programs, and personnel able to make use of that capital. Just as impor-tant, AILDI has helped transform indigenous linguistic and cultural resourcesinto political capital. Recognition of the importance of indigenous languagesand cultures more than validates them; it increases their value and the power ofthose who control those resources. By creating curricula and programs to ar-ticulate local resources with local schools and by simultaneously preparing and 971.1 t Teaching Indigenous Languagescredentialing local educators, AILDI has in fact empowered its alumni in theirschool systems. Moreover, AILDI has reinforced the collective power of itsalumni by building a network of indigenous educators committed to a sharedphilosophy for indigenous language maintenance. These educators not onlyhave strengthened threatened languages and built more effective school pro-grams, they have influenced federal policy toward these goals. A prime ex-ample of this is the Native American Languages Act.The teacher's statement above, however, suggests the limits of that power.Just as sustained funding and administrative support have been difficult forAILDI faculty to secure, such support and control over local curricula remainelusive for many AILDI participants. Hence, AILDI's influence on indigenousmother tongue maintenance is indirect and constrained by local circumstances.Key to language maintenance, Fishman (1991; 1996) insists, is intergenerationallanguage transmissionthe natural communicative processes in the home, fam-ily, and community through which succeeding generations replenish their speak-ers. Such processes are difficult for outside institutions such as schools anduniversity programs to create.Nevertheless, AILDI has been a catalyst in reinforcing these processes byplacing an overt moral and academic value on heritage languages and assistingpractitioners in establishing new contexts and genres for native language use.\"I would like to be an informed advocate for bilingual education,\" an alumnusstates, \"and convince fellow teachers, administrators, the school board, par-ents, and community members about the need for our language revitalization.\"Another says: \"I will be an inspiration and educator of language maintenancefor my students.\"While AILDI cannot \"save\" endangered indigenous languages, it has mo-bilized local efforts to stabilize them. \"I'd like to have my grandchildren learnour tribal language,\" a Hualapai elder recently told us, \"because if theydon't...nobody will ever speak Indian again.\" This elder presents an urgentcharge. AILDI has played a critical role in addressing that responsibility, but itcannot act alone. Ultimately it is local stakeholdersAILDI alumni and theircommunitieswho must identify and consciously shelter those domains whereindigenous languages remain unchallenged by the language of wider commu-nication. In most communities served by AILDI, these language planning ef-forts have only begun.Lessons learnedWhat have we learned from 18 years of involvement with the AmericanIndian Language Development Institute? In this section we reflect on what ourexperiences have taught us, in the hope that this information will be useful toothers engaged in similar work.Lesson 1: The need for focus and commitment. AILDI began not with theambition to be all things to all language groups, but with community-specificgoals for indigenous language and literacy development and a shared commit-ment to reforming local education practices. Though the institute now serves a 98112 Teaching Indigenous Languagesmuch larger constituency, it remains anchored to the needs of indigenous com-munities and educational personnel. This focus guides the development anddelivery of AILDI's curriculum and contributes to the successful integration oflinguistics and methods courses and their consistency over time. We have addednew courses as participants' interest in particular topics has evolved; courseson parent involvement, creative writing in indigenous languages, and mediaand computers are examples of this. However, core courses in linguistics andbilingual/bicultural curriculum development are offered each year, and all AILDIparticipants are assured of a learning experience that enables them to applylinguistic and cultural knowledge from their home communities directly to edu-cational practice.Coming to understand the experiences and struggles of fellow participantsis essential to the AILDI learning experience. At the same time, both partici-pants and faculty recognize the need to concentrate on specific issues and prob-lems within individual language communities. AILDI seeks to strike a balancebetween this concentration on local language issues and the opportunity to learnfrom the successes and problems experienced by others. The unique advantageof AILDI, however, clearly derives from the diversity of languages, communi-ties, participants, and faculty it represents.AILDI also has been characterized by a high degree of staff commitment.This is the virtue of its community-based focus: Because AILDI faculty andstaff are either members of indigenous communities or non-Indians with a longhistory of involvement in those communities, they have high expectations forthe communities' children and a vested interest in helping them succeed. Agreat part of children's school and life success, we believe, is a strong founda-tion in their language and culture. Yet we recognize that the institutional re-forms necessary to build this foundation do not occur simply or overnight. Theymust be cultivated over time from the community's human and material re-sources. AILDI and its faculty and staff are dedicated to that long-term process.Lesson 2. The need for outreach and local follow-up. AILDI is more than asummer program, though that is its center of activity. Languages have beenwritten and high-quality materials developed, however, because AILDI facultyand staff have continued to collaborate with institute participants throughoutthe school year. Collaboration has entailed site visits by faculty, designing andimplementing research projects, telephone consultations on linguistic questions,and co-involvement on materials development. Many participants return to theinstitute year after year. The personal relationships developed through this ex-tended contact have not only promoted local curriculum reform, but helpedestablish lasting ties between indigenous educators and AILDI faculty, and, byextension, between indigenous communities and the university. The overall effecthas been to generate widespread tribal support for the program and make theuniversity more approachable and \"user friendly.\" This mutually beneficial pro-cess has facilitated the certification and endorsement of indigenous educatorsand helped institutionalize the program within the university.399 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesLesson 3: The need for permanent funding and a home base. Like all In-dian education programs, AILDI has depended for most of its livelihood onexternal grants. Such short-term funding forced AILDI faculty to knit togethera program each year from disparate financial resources. Instability in fundingmitigated against institutionalization, creating a vicious cycle of uncertaintyand impermanence.Through dogged effort, AILDI at last secured a permanent budget and ahome. While no recipes exist for achieving such outcomes, we offer this ad-vice: Begin early in communicating the program's goals and organization toindividuals in positions to help. We met frequently with deans and departmentheads to familiarize them with the program, being careful to relate AILDI'sgoals to the larger university mission. Brief but informative narratives werehelpful, as were detailed budgets showing actual and anticipated expendituresand contributions from various departments and university offices. Most uni-versity administrators recognized the academic and outreach benefits of theprogram; when apprised of offers to help by colleagues in other departments,they usually found some funds with which to assist AILDI. We followed everycontribution with an invitation to meet and welcome participants on the institute'sopening day, and with letters clearly showing whom and how particular admin-istrative funds had helped. In the meantime, we sought and received funds fromexternal sources, including the National Endowment for the Humanities andthe Arizona Humanities Council.These measures served two purposes: They enabled AILDI to survive dur-ing its first years at the University of Arizona, and they made key administra-tors aware of the program and of the extent and urgency of its financial needs.Along the way we were allocated official space within an established depart-ment. This enhanced the program's visibility and credibility both within andoutside the university. When the Arizona legislature made it possible to applyfor permanent funds, AILDI already had a visible university presence, strongtribal support, and powerful advocates within the system to shepherd and pro-mote our funding request.The keys to institutionalizing AILDI, then, were these: perseverance, com-munication, a vision of where the program fits within the larger institutionalmission, and a firm commitment to program goals.Lesson 4. The need for administration from the inside-out. Institutionaliza-tion would not have occurred without the presence of tenure-eligible facultywithin the host institution. For years AILDI remained institutionally marginalizedbecause its faculty were guests from other institutions or were university staffof federally funded (hence, short-term) Indian education programs. Guest fac-ulty continue to serve the institute and provide much of its direction, depth, andbreadth. At the same time, administration by two regular faculty members and,since 1993, a permanent full-time coordinator, have been instrumental to AILDI'ssuccess. This has made it possible to work on a year-round basis from the in-side-out, and to permanently seat the program within the host institution.114loci Teaching Indigenous LanguagesConcluding thoughtsThe foregoing section highlights the logistical challenges faced by AILDI.Its greatest challenge, however, is more substantive and essential: the life-and-deathstruggle for survival of indigenous North American languages and cul-tures. Uniquely positioned by its community foundation, AILDI is prominentamong the field of forces for strengthening indigenous languages and cultures.Yet in the final analysis, their survival is dependent on language choices en-acted within native speakers' homes and communities. AILDI can light the path,but its participants must lead the way. Still, when we consider the path withoutthe light, we are reassured of the purpose and the value of AILDI.In conclusion, we share these suggestions for community-based languagerestoration work: 1.Talking about \"what to do\" to rescue endangered languages isimportant, but will not in itself reverse the shift toward English.Begin using the language nowat home, in the community,and everywhere.2.Don't criticize or ridicule errors.3.Be a risk-taker; look at your children and learn from them.4.Learning is fun; don't stifle it by making it overly difficult orboring.5.Through children, involve the parents; through parents, involvethe grandparents. Start small and expand the circle.6.Internal politics are best set aside for the benefit of the lan-guage restoration work at hand.7.Believe that your language is a gift, as many tribal languagepolicies openly state. If the language is not used and given lifeby its speakers, they are not fulfilling their responsibility. \"OurCreator has created the world for us through language,\" 1996AILDI participants and faculty observed; \"If we don't speak it,there is no world.\"8.This is the time for each person to do her or his part. We, notothers, must assume responsibility. The stakes are highdon'twait for someone else to begin.9.Finally, understand that others share your mission. Together,you can become a powerful team for positive change.The following poem, composed by AILDI participants, suggests the po-tential of such teamwork: 101 Teaching Indigenous Languages We are the enemies of our languageWe are speaking another languageWe don't engage in our native languagetoo lazydenialashamedtoo busyassimilatedsacrificedforsaken.TEACH OUR OWN CULTUREfor what?To LATE.Mothers are workingFathers in a HUD homeBut no native languageall English.Become friendsLearn to speak the native languageWrite, read, and listen.WALK THE TALKJUST DO IT.Speak, speak, speak, and speakSurround yourself with the native languageGeographicallyEnvironmentallyImmerse yourself in the native language.Instillthe child with self-esteem.Need supportive teachers, administrators, communities,tribal councilsandcommitted native language speakers.ALL OF US!11 3102 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesReferencesCummins, Jim.

Silverthorne And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as itshould.Desiderata Each profession is unique unto itself This is also true of those ofus who work in the field of preserving Native American languages. Weare an assortment of individuals who have come to this work either asa central career (linguists), a family heritage (fluent speakers). or adeveloped passion (language learners). This paper examines the fieldfrom the perspective of R. Wayne Pace, Phillip C. Smith, and GordonE. Mills ( 1991). They define a profession as having a defined area ofcompetence, an organized and important body of knowledge, identifi-cation as a career field, controlled access for competent individuals,principles and practices supported by research, professionals involvedin academic programs, a program of continuing education, and gradu-ates who exercise independent judgment. This paper takes each of theseareas in turn and examines them for indigenous languages teacherswith the view of documenting that they are in a profession worthy ofrecognition and certification by states and tribes. There are many topics in the field of language preservation. Each topicdeserves attention in and of itself, such as how is language taught, where islanguage taught, is ceremonial language included, and can we teach other sub-jects in this language. This paper addresses the professional preparation of teach-ers of indigenous languages.A defined area of competenceThe career field component of language education has long been domi-nated by the people who study language, linguists. Prior to incorporating Na-tive American language in the education of young people, the linguists devotedtheir lives to studying and making sense of the languages. There is a compo-nent of linguistic thought that has devoted itself to the preservation of the morethan four hundred Native American languages and dialects that were present inthis continent at the time of first European contact. Their work has been invalu-able to the people who are today attempting to bring language back into com-mon usage. Many extinct Native American dialects have volumes of informa-tion in dictionaries and grammars that were produced by field linguists. Thefield notes alone are integral pieces to reestablishing the older forms of thelanguages in their most complete detail. However, linguists have been frus- 105 Teaching Indigenous Languagestrated in their efforts to assist in language preservation. As any student who hastaken an introduction to linguistics can testify, the field is dependent on a tech-nical language of its own.The fluent speakers of language today are from families where the lan-guage survived despite direct federal government efforts to eradicate it. Amongthe Salish and Kootenai languages, the speakers of either language are olderthan nontraditional college students. At Salish Kootenai College the averagestudent is a single female, twenty-nine years old, with two and a half children.Most of our speakers are from 50 to 80 years old. Today, there are few fluentSalish younger speakers.Not all fluent speakers want to teach language. It is difficult for anyone togo into a classroom and face 20 to 30 bright energetic students and teach thema language that few of them have heard. One of the teachers of Kootenai lan-guage had the experience of a child telling him that he could not be in his classany longer, because his father said he did not want him to learn that language.That teacher is no longer teaching in the public schools, even though the lan-guage program he worked in only offered his class once a week for half an hourto kindergarten and first grade students. A negative experience while teachingis common to all of us who teach. To a fluent speaker, it is one more negative ina lifetime of negative attitude against the language of the home. For many, thisis unacceptable, and they leave teaching.The numbers of people who are developing a passion for learning NativeAmerican language is growing exponentially. Some, like me, have come to thispassion from a realization that language reeducation is an integral part of know-ing who we areidentity. When I began taking classes in Salish, it was thefulfillment of a promise casually made when I was in high school. A friend ofmine who was fluent said he would teach me if I wanted to learn. I promisedhim I would, but could not right then. That friend went on to the armed forces,business training, and became director of the Flathead Culture Committee untilhis death last year. My first class was with him as my teacher. It felt good tofulfill such a long ago promise. As my skill gained, I discovered how good itmade me feel in my 'heart of hearts' to begin understanding my heritage lan-guage.My mother was a full-bloodChippewa, Mohawk, Pottowatamie, andKickapoo fatherwas Salish and Welsh, enrolled on the Flathead Reservation. Although I havealways claimed my enrollment and affinity with my father's reservation, mymixed heritage has always been a source of internal conflict. I was unclearabout my heritage and unsure how I fit in on my home reservation. LearningSalish gave me the opportunity to explore my identity, come into contact withthe elders, and gain pride in learning to communicate. Salish language pro-vided insight into the culture in ways that books, work, and politics cannot do.In Salish there are no words that are equivalent to \"I'm sorry.\" A fluent speakerwould interpret that fact differently than someone who is from the dominantAmerican culture. To a fluent person, it implies that you live without a need to123106 Teaching Indigenous Languagessay \"I'm sorry.\" How different this country would be today had that one factguided all of usif we lived in such a way to not need to make apologies.Language preservation efforts place tremendous pressures on teachers oflanguage. The pressures of setting and students affect who will teach and theskills that are needed. There are people who teach every day and are not calledteachers. There are others who are called teachers who are unable to pass theirknowledge to more than a few of their students. This is true in all teachingfields, but even more of an issue in Native American language owing to thesmall numbers of fluent speakers, the task at hand, and the lack of clarity in thefield. Native American language teaching combines elements of foreign lan-guage methods, English as a second language (ESL), bilingual, and traditionalculture teaching styles and methods.An organized and important body of knowledgeAs the director and grant writer for the bilingual department at SalishKootenai College (SKC), I had a unique perspective into the complexity of thetask that language preservation poses. The original bilingual teacher trainingproposal was a joint effort with the University of Montana and SKC to theDepartment of Education, Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Lan-guages Affairs (OBEMLA). As work progressed, it became apparent the locusof control needed to be within the reservation. With more than misgivings, agrant application was prepared from SKC alone. During the six years of opera-tion under this funding, an Associate of Arts Degree was developed and institu-tionalized that met the criteria for OBEMLA programs.There are many facets to community development in a reservation setting,and if languages are to be preserved today, it will require the whole community.Although there have been many classes, the languages have been written, andmany elders have worked hard, we have not yet produced a body of newlyfluent speakers. Ignoring the controversy over the definition of fluency for themoment, language students are beginning to stay in the language and carry onconversations with each other or a fluent speaker. Only recently are we seeingnew speakers who can, after thought, create a sentence of their own; a skill thata two- to three-year old child acquires through loving acceptance of their babytalk by their parents. Even then, there is a need to have a fluent speaker verifyits accuracy. Even people who are recognized as fluent can be fearful of sayingthe \"wrong\" thing. Within this extensive body of knowledge, there are elevenidentified roles to be addressed in the community (Pace, Smith & Mills, 1991,p. 231):1. AdministratorThe administrative role assumes that there is an organi-zation (loosely defined) that will \"do\" language preservation. For the purposeof this paper, the tribal administration would fill this role. Within the tribe thereare two Culture Committees, one Salish and one Kootenai, whose function is topreserve and practice their respective cultures. These entities, with linguisticassistance, have developed writing systems for their languages. They teach and 107 Teaching Indigenous Languagesrecommend teachers when requested. Language is only one of many duties thatthe committees have been assigned.2. EvaluatorEvaluation of language preservation has not formally oc-curred. Everyone who is teaching, learning, or watching has an opinion abouthow well the process is progressing. Several years ago, the bilingual depart-ment conducted a language use survey that documented the \"self-reported\" re-sponses on language use by approximately ten percent (10%) of the voting agetribal member households. The survey indicated a high level of interest in learn-ing language, preferences in materials, classes, and teaching styles. It also indi-cated a high level of use at the most rudimentary language level that surprisedthe researchers. There are discussions that would best happen either prior tofurther evaluation, or as a product of evaluation, to clarify definitions, identifysuccess indicators, and communicate with the various entities involved.3. HRD ManagerHuman resource development management is moni-toring progress and interrelationships of the many components and roles in theorganization. In language preservation, an informal attempt is made to do thesame. There is a need to manage language preservation by centralizing knowl-edge and information for the various entities involved and monitoring progress.In most cases, language planning has not yet become an intentional effort.4. Individual Career Development AdvisorCareers in language develop-ment exist informally. Preservation is a community process without central co-ordination at this time. Teachers of language may be formally employed by thetribes, a department of the tribe, the college, a community group, or the publicschools. The college, the culture committee, and the education department ofthe tribe have provided advice to prospective teachers. All too often, advicedoes not incorporate all aspects of the profession. There is a need to coordinateand standardize career advising procedures for language preservation.5. Instructor/FacilitatorInstructor/facilitators are needed to teach languageto the community in many different settings and at all age levels. The functionof instruction is multilevel. Instructor/facilitators are needed to teach the teach-ers. The teaching of teachers is the crux of the current problem in languagepreservation. Who will teach? Being a fluent speaker alone does not guaranteea skillful teacher. How will they teach? Numerous teaching methods have beenpromoted. Unfortunately, each method has been introduced as if it were the\"best.\" When the current method in favor proves to be less than a miraculousturnaround for students, the method gains disfavor and is abandoned. An un-derstanding of the multitude of teaching methods, both contemporary and tra-ditional needs to be gained.6. MarketerLanguage preservation needs marketing skills! Both teach-ers and learners would benefit from knowing the benefits of dual languageskill. In the bilingual education field, Cognitive Academic Language Profi-ciency (CALP) and Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) are pro-moted. The distinctions are specific and integral to the recognition of personaland communal benefits of language acquisition. There are standard textbooksavailable such as Colin Baker's (1993) Foundations of Bilingual Education 1 2 208 Teaching Indigenous Languagesand Bilingualism that describe efforts at bilingual education worldwide andresearch works such as Joshua Fishman's (1991) Reversing Language Shift thatdescribe efforts to revitalize minority indigenous languages worldwide.7. Materials DeveloperMaterials in the native languages for reading andinstruction are needed. The process of developing written forms of indigenouslanguages is immense. Everything from alphabet material to the local newsneeds to have ongoing development. Students need to see and hear the lan-guage in all areas of life, or at least in some well defined areas of life that areimportant to them. Age and skill appropriate materials are needed.8. Needs analystFormal needs assessments and analyses of the field oflanguage reintroduction could provide valuable direction for each community.Pieces and segments of information and knowledge need to be compiled toassist language preservation efforts from the formal program aspect and theseldom documented traditional aspect. Learner expectations need to be assessedand compared to the goals of language instruction. Frequently, the nonnativelanguage student will surpass the native student in a class. The nonnative stu-dent has less fear and more reasonable expectationsless personal baggage.9. Organizational Change AgentLanguage preservation and reintroduc-tion is organizational change and community development for Native Ameri-cans. The centuries of cultural genocide and assimilation efforts are in directconflict with reintroduction of language. One of the appeals of this field to mepersonally is the belief in the impact of language to our communities. I believethe intentional demise of culture and language can be countered by intentionaleffort.10. Program DesignerGiven the complexity of language preservation,program designers are needed to strategize efforts, plan training of teachers,plan preservation, initiate research, and advise administrators. The wealth ofsource information has not been synthesized. Cross-curricular knowledge canbe organized to facilitate language preservation efforts in a community.11. ResearcherResearch is needed to better understand the current lan-guage dilemma. The field has been woefully neglected for Native Americans.This is ironic considering the volume of social research that is done with thesesame people. Several years ago, the Tribal Education Committee on the Flat-head Reservation proposed a resolution to the Tribal Council requiring all re-search involving Native American children be submitted for approval prior touse in the local schools. This policy was developed to reduce the high volumeof research being done with children that included false or stereotypical ques-tions or conclusions. To conduct language research will require knowledge ofthe players, the language, and the culture.The many roles in the field of language preservation have not been identi-fied and addressed well. Owing to the lack of paid positions, a few people haveattempted to be all things to all people and have done so with inadequate train-ing. The above mentioned roles will need to be addressed as communities en-deavor to bring native language back to full health. 1092 3 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesIdentified with a career fieldPerhaps the greatest benefit of the SKC Bilingual Department was to vali-date the study of teaching for Native American languages. SKC offered bothSalish and Kootenai languages since its founding in the 1970's. Teachers forthe classes were chosen from fluent speakers recommended by the culture com-mittees who were willing to come into a classroom. With the inclusion of thedegree program, many of the fluent speakers who taught looked to the programto produce people that would ease their burden. As it has become more ac-cepted to learn our native tongues, the demand for teachers escalated. Someteachers were trying to work with everyone from kindergarten to adult andbeginner to advanced. The Salish and Kootenai language alphabets were devel-oped in the late 1970's through the culture committees working with linguists.Many tribes in the Northwest United States are struggling with the sameprocess of preservation and reintroduction, and many of their languages arealso newly written. This does not imply that work has only begun. Ethnogra-phers have compiled language information since early European contact. Someof the best sources are from the missionaries in the region. Father Giorda, aJesuit priest, compiled a dictionary for the Kalispel language around the turn ofthe century. These obscure documents are difficult to access, and many are nolonger in print.There are various associations that are interested in language issues. Thelist that follows is not intended to be exhaustive, but will give a sample of thediversity of interest.International Native Languages Institute (INLI) [formerly the Na-tive American Languages Issues (NALI) Institute] is an organiza-tion of Natives involved in language preservation activities. Thereis usually an annual conference. The 15th annual institute was heldin Mille Lacs, Minnesota, in April, 1996.American Indian Language Development Institute (AILDI) is cur-rently located at the University of Arizona and offers a summersession devoted to classes in how to teach indigenous languagesand developing indigenous language curriculum (see McCarty etal., this volume).Stabilizing Indigenous Languages Symposiums (SILS) were spon-sored in 1994, 1995, and 1997 at Northern Arizona University tobring together native language educators and activists to share ideasto promote the use of their languages. The proceedings of the firsttwo symposium were published as the monograph Stabilizing In-digenous Languages (Cantoni, 1996).National Indian Education Association (NIEA) is an organizationof educators, and language is one of the many fields of educationin which they are interested.National Association of Bilingual Education (NABE) is an organi-zation of bilingual educators across the nation. Native Americanlanguage educators represent a small contingent within this orga- 124110 Teaching Indigenous Languagesnization. The Winter 1995 issue of their Bilingual Research Jour-nal was a special issue on Indigenous Language Education andLiteracy.Various colleges are also involved in varying degrees of language preser-vation activities. The majority that are working directly with Native Americanlanguage are in the SouthwestNorthern Arizona University, University ofNew Mexico, and Colorado State University. The Northern tribes in the East,such as the Ojibway, have worked with the University of Minnesota. In theNorthwest, the University of Washington has done some work. In Canada, thereare the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria. The workwith tribes seems to begin with the Linguistic or Native American Studies de-partments in a higher education unit. The department that initiates work tendsto then determine the kind of work that is done. Too often, it is not an interde-partmental effort to look at the whole situation.Tribal colleges in the past twenty years have taken a lead role in languageeducation. They are institutions accredited by the same entity that accreditsother higher education organizations, and many of them include language classes.Dine College (formerly Navajo Community College) has recently developed afour year teacher preparation program that includes a 21 credit Navajo lan-guage speaking/reading/writing/ teaching component. This program gives theirgraduates an Arizona bilingual teaching endorsement as well as an Arizonateaching certificate. Part of the difficulty in creating such a process, especiallyfor smaller tribes, is the lack of college educated people knowledgeable in lan-guage to teach the language and train others to teach. Many tribes, unlike theNavajo, are in the same situation as the Flathead Reservation, which is a con-federation of tribes with three dialects of Salish and one of the five dialects ofKootenai.Salish Kootenai College offered six different Native American languagesduring school yearSalish, Kootenai, Blackfoot, Cree, Assiniboine,and Northern Cheyenne. Two of the languages are not taught this year owing tostudents/teachers completing and moving back home. The four-year programsat the college require two quarters of a tribal language. I believe this is the onlyhigher education entity to have this volume of languages represented. TheSaskatchewan Federated College does offer coursework for Native Americanlinguists in Cree language.There are several linguistic associations that meet to discuss and shareinformation about Native American languages. The International Congress onSalish and Neighboring Languages (ICSNL) has been meeting for thirty-oneyears. At each meeting there are papers presented and discussed. Larry andTerry Thompson and Dale Kincaid are the linguists who founded the organiza-tion and are active in presentations and proceedings. Many other linguists areinvolved, including all of the linguists that have worked with the Salish andKootenai from the Flathead Reservation. The work is invaluable, but difficultto access. Linguistic studies need interpretation for the lay person, and even 111 Teaching Indigenous Languagessome Native American \"informants\" barely recognize work they helped coau-thor when the technical terminology is included. The Society for the Study ofIndigenous Languages (SSILA) provides news of other conferences and lan-guage groups, summaries of presentations, and professional direction. This or-ganization is sponsored through Victor Golla at Humbolt State University inCalifornia.After passage of the Native American Language Act of 1992, the Bureauof Indian Affairs (BIA) through its Administration for Native Americans (ANA)Department has awarded grants to tribes and entities working in language pres-ervation. The efforts have varied widely. As a proposal reader when the pro-gram began, I was encouraged that so many efforts were in progress. The de-mand for people to work in the ANA programs has increased pressure on fluentspeakers.The most important people to be working in language preservation are theelders of the tribes. The eldest speaker of the Salish dialect on the FlatheadReservation is one hundred years old. During his lifetime he has been forbid-den to use his first language, learned English, served in the armed forces inWorld War I, helped to build Kerr Dam on the Flathead River, and is now askedto guide tribal decision-making and language teaching. He now speaks mostlySalish once again with his daughter as interpreter. The tremendous change inattitude toward the use of Native American languages in the last few decades ishistorical information to language learners, but for many teachers, it is their lifeexperience.The question is not whether Native American Language Preservation is afield of study or not, it is the segment of the field for which each person is mostsuited and chooses to address.'Competent individuals enter the professionLinguists are highly specialized individuals with formal academic prepa-ration, programs, and associations. They contribute an invaluable service tolanguage preservation over time and in the preparation of historical and lan-guage materials.Fluent speakers gain their skill as children. By the time they consider teach-ing, they are so familiar with their language that it becomes challenging toexplain it to the novice learner. Last year the Montana Board of Public Instruc-tion created a Class 7 Specialist Certificate for Native American Language.Fluent speakers can file their form and fees with the blessing from their tribe toteach their language in the public schools. Each tribe is responsible for estab-lishing criteria by which they recommend speakers. In Montana there are sevenreservations with eleven different languages. The range of criteria begins withanyone who is recognized fluent on one reservation to a college degree onanother. The difference is in the \"health\" of the language they will teach. Thecollege degree program is required on the Crow reservation where there arestill children who learn the language as their first language before they beginschool.123.112 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesIt is difficult for the university philosophy to accommodate the needs ofNative American language teachers. For many reasons few fluent speakers havecollege training to enable them to teach at a university; some do not even havea General Equivalency Diploma (GED). Education has played a major role inthe demise of indigenous languages, and in spite of good intentions, it is notlikely that older speakers will pursue the formal academic approach. In the bestof all worlds, fluent speakers will be able to teach many academic subjectsthrough a Native American language.Principles and practices supported by researchThe various separate elements of foreign language methods, English as asecond language (ESL), and bilingual education have extensive historical andresearch foundations. Organizations such as the National Clearinghouse forBilingual Education (NCBE) and the Educational Resources Information Cen-ter (ERIC) have extensive collections of studies available for research and ap-plication. Traditional cultural teaching styles and methods are documented instories and the memories of elders, ethnography, and limited writings. To teachby storytelling is a central tenet of whole language instruction (see for exampleRoutman, 1988). Today's teachers study whole language, but are unaware ofNative American story telling. As schools struggle with de-emphasizing com-petition, the cooperative learning methodology has developed. Traditionally,young Native Americans were instructed in a group by an elder.Jim Cummins (1989) has worked extensively with language reintroduc-tion in Canada. Joshua Fishman (1991, 1996) has worked with Yiddish. StephenKrashen (see Krashen & Terrell, 1983) has been instrumental in the distinctionbetween learning and acquiring language. We are able to look to programs thatare working. Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, and Hawai i have paved the path forlanguage preservation. Michael Krauss (1996) of Alaska has done extensiveresearch on Native American languages. All of these examples are rich sup-porting puzzle pieces that are difficult to access for our elders. It is not a lack ofresearch, but the need to understand and share success that should guide re-search.Extensive research is available concerning the academic performance ofNative American students in public school. During the past year, the mediareported findings that indicate today's boarding schools provide a less thanaverage academic program. What is lacking is an analyses and synthesis of thevarious fields and methods.Involvement of professionals in academic programsEach tribe and language group have people working in language preserva-tion. The complexity of professional positions varies greatly depending on thehealth of the language. On the one extreme is Dine College offering Navajolanguage teacher training. On the other extreme is the newspaper report of thedeath of the last speaker of an Alaskan Native language group a little over a 11312 7 Teaching Indigenous Languagesyear ago. Most indigenous language groups are somewhere between these twoextremes.On the Flathead Reservation, classes are offered ranging from an earlychildhood immersion program to college courses. Ceremonial language is taughtin both languages through ceremony. A few families are again attempting toteach infants the Native language at least with English if not in place of En-glish. With radio and television in the homes, it is almost impossible to avoidEnglish usage. The more challenging task is for speakers to keep in the lan-guage. The pilot programs in immersion programs last summer demonstratedthis difficulty. SKC maintains the bilingual Associate of Arts (A.A.) degreeunder its current catalog and is offering coursework. The Flathead and KootenaiCulture Committees respectively offer informal courses in their respective lan-guages. Many gatherings utilize more and more language without translation.The Salish choir is active in the Catholic church and at tribal wakes and gather-ings. Materials are randomly developed in the public schools, the culture com-mittees, the college, Head Start, and other community groups. The college pre-pared a computer assisted instructional program utilizing traditional stories,drawing, and voice recordings.The demand for professionals to work in language preservation is increas-ing at the same time availability of fluent speakers is decreasing.A program of continuing educationThe Class 7 certificate in Montana is renewable like all other teachingcertificates. This means that each Class 7 specialist must take 60 renewal cred-its within five years of the first certificate to be eligible to renew. The contro-versy at this time is how they will pursue their renewal credits. The agreementis a unique compromise with the state giving certification without an academiccollege degree, and the tribes acknowledging the right of the state to certifytribal language teachers to teach in public schools.The skill of a \"traditional\" fluent speaker teacher can be validated as con-temporary methods that parallel their methods are explained. Most people whoassume a teaching role soon realize that children are not the same in someaspects as when they were children. All teachers need to understand the changesand learn skills to address these children. Morris Massey (1979) examines theinfluences that affect whole generations of people. His work is a thought-pro-voking look at values, generational programming, and gut-level biases. An ex-ample is the thriftiness exhibited by people who survived the \"great depres-sion.\" I believe there are parallel events in Native American history that haveimpacted generations, such as land allotment, boarding schools, and relocationprograms. The current generation is affected by the all-encompassing techno-logical world in which they live. As a teacher, I am grateful when new ideas toreach my students are shared. 12a114 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesGraduates who exercise independent judgmentPeople who are prepared to intentionally influence language preservationwill be challenged by the circumstances in which they are thrust. Proposinglanguage preservation as a profession provides some opportunities not previ-ously available. Synthesis of the various fields of knowledge that impact theeffort will validate and challenge the field. As we are prepared to meet thechallenge, teachers will need a \"bag of tools\" for language instruction to meetneeds of students of all ages and in many settings. As language revives in ourcommunities, more examples will be available and more challenges will be-come apparent.ConclusionLanguage preservation and human resource development are parallel pro-fessional fields. Human resource development is becoming a field of study anda profession. I believe language preservation is in its infancy, and yet, is bat-tling the looming extinction of rich cultural perspectives carried by the com-munity language. As indigenous language teachers and activists become moreknowledgeable in classroom instructional strategies and ways to energize com-munity efforts, they will become more effective. I am honored and excited tohave the opportunity to assist in this process of reviving and revitalizing Ameri-can Indian languages. ReferencesBaker, Colin. (1993).

One was written in the grammar-translation tradition and modeled after Wilson's Conversational Na-vajo Workbook and Zepeda's Papago Grammar. The other text was aguide to teaching Apache with the Total Physical Response (TPR)method, based on Asher's ( 1982) teacher's guidebook. Both approachesraised a variety of problems that can be partially solved by a judiciouscombination of the two approaches. For example, the classificatoryhandling verbs are best taught by a grammar-translation method,supplemented by TPR style exercises; straightforward syntactic struc-tures (at least in Apache), such as negation, and yes-no questions, canbe taught through TPR exercises and supplemented by grammaticalexplanations. Additionally, native experts should monitor any text toavoid culturally sensitive or politically inappropriate material. Finally,a dialogue between linguists and native experts needs to be estab-lished in order to decide how much linguistic terminology can behandled in each particular curriculum. Let me start with a few general remarks about the development of lan-guage textbooks as an effective language renewal practice. We all know intu-itively that books have never been efficient and sufficient aids towards lan-guage renewal. However, Hebrew would never have been revived as a firstlanguage if it was not for generation upon generation of Jewish scholars learn-ing the language from books. Then again, Native American cultures (with theexception of Maya culture) are not book cultures in the way Western culture isand therefore are justified in being suspicious of books as possible instrumentsof Western Imperialism. But, Native American cultures, as cultures have al-ways done, have successfully adopted and integrated foreign cultural elementsto their benefit. Examples would be the pickup truck for more efficient trans-portation and, more recently, the computer as a possible educational tool. Wouldit be wise to rely heavily on computer technology for language preservation?The point that I am trying to make is that we can go back and forth arguingabout whether textbooks are good tools for language renewal, and we will prob-ably never convince many people that they are useful. What I propose is thatwe start writing textbooks, knowing full well that they will only be useful tosome learners, and only part of the time. 1 3\u00b0116 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThere is no doubt, as has often been said at previous meetings of this Sym-posium, that the best way towards achieving successful language renewal is toconvince parents (and grandparents) to speak the language and nothing but thelanguage to their children. No textbook, no school curriculum program is evergoing to replace this. However, if we are going to have second language cur-ricula and second language textbooks, we should want to make them as effi-cient and attractive as we can.Three kinds of language textbooksA few general remarks about the language teaching textbook situation forNative American languages in the United States are in order. It is useful todistinguish between three kinds of texts: there exist 1) textbooks that teachNative speakers something about the grammar of the language, or teach themto read and write, but do not teach the speaking and listening skills necessaryfor oral communication; 2) second language textbooks that teach the languageto speakers of other languages but avoid grammar to some extent; and 3) text-books that try to do a little bit of both, i.e., they teach the language, but at thesame time try to be of interest to Native speakers or linguists by teaching some-thing about the grammar. It is my impression that in the United States, Type 1textbooks are not very common and often unpublished, while Type 2 and 3textbooks are more common, Type 2 being more often published than Type 3.Let me illustrate this situation with Navajo textbooks below. References withdates followed by asterisks are unpublished; complete references are given atthe end of this paper.Type 1 textbooks:Hale (1970-75)*Hale et al. Dennison (1978)Within Type 2, one can further distinguish those texts that provide verylittle grammatical discussion (Wilson, 1969, Wilson & Dennison, 1978), to thosewho provide a fair amount of grammar, particularly Goossen (1995), whichapproaches the amount provided in Type 3 texts. There are probably other Type2 materials, such as for L.D.S. (Mormon) missionaries, that I am unaware of.IA special case because it deals with the Navajo verb only. 117 et al. (1986)The other Native languages of the United States do not have this profusion ofmaterials, even though other languages, such as Lakota, might outdo Navajo interms of unpublished materials (see my bibliographies, de Reuse 1987, 1990).In Arizona, there is something available for all the Uto-Aztecan languages;Hopi has one Type 1 text (Masayesva-Jeanne & Hale, 1976), three Type 3 text-books, one published (Kalectaca & Langacker, 1978) and & Hill, 1995); Yaqui hasone Type 2 text (Molina, 1995), not counting the beautiful materials producedfor young speakers in Sonora, Mexico. O'odham (Pima-Papago) has one Type1 text (Willenbrink, 1935) and one Type 3 text (Zepeda, 1983), and I suspectthere are unpublished materials for the Uto-Aztecan languages of Arizona thatI am not aware of. I need more information about the Yuman languages ofArizona.Western Apache language textbooksAs first noted by Lewis (1989), the prognosis for the survival of WesternApache is not good. Very few parents speak the language to their preschoolchildren. In San Carlos and Whiteriver, the largest towns on the San Carlos andWhite Mountain Apache Reservations respectively, kindergarten playgroundsappear to be very much monolingual in English. Even though it is politicallyincorrect to say so, the Western Apache language is endangered and drasticsteps will have to be taken to preserve and renew it. In her own presentation inthis volume, Bernadette Adley-SantaMaria, who is a native speaker and wrotea master's thesis on White Mountain Apache language shift, will provide moredetail about the present-day sociolinguistic situation among the White Moun-tain Apache.Below are listed textbook materials for Western Apache, not including myown recent work in collaboration with Ms. Adley-SantaMaria.Type 1 textbooks:Goode (1985),* High School level.Johnson et al. (n.d.), Kindergarten level.Both of these are excellent for teaching speakers to read and write as well assomething about the grammar, but they would not be appropriate for non-speak-'In part a German translation of Goosen (1977).132118 Teaching Indigenous Languagesers. Incidentally, it should be noted that Western Apache, like most other Na-tive languages of the United States, has quite a few short booklets or pamphletsthat teach children or adults to read and write. These are not language text-books, and are not appropriate for non-speakers. A complete list of such mate-rials is:Antonio et al. (1983)Edgerton & Hill (1958)Steele, Smith, & Bunney (n.d.a)Steele, Smith, & Bunney (n.d.b)White Mountain Apache Culture Center (1972)White Mountain Apache Culture Center (1983)Wycliffe Bible Translators (n.d.)Type 2 textbooks:Casey et al. (1994), Head Start level.This last work teaches about seventy-seven words in the context of four simplesentence frames:This is aIs this aNo, this is aYes, this is aSuch contents might be appropriate for Head Start, but not for any other pur-poses.Type 3 textbooks:de Reuse (1994)*This last work was developed for a University-level class for linguistics stu-dents, as well as Navajo and Apache educators, and was used at the AmericanIndian Language Development Institute in June 1994 at the University of Ari-zona in Tucson. Speakers generally liked it, but it was a somewhat strange mixof very simple conversations with very complex linguistic explanations. It couldhardly be called a language teaching instrument.To conclude, Western Apache might be the only major Native language ofthe Southwest with no Type 2 textbooks at all for the adult level, and with noType 3 textbooks for any level.An introductory White Mountain Apache textbookMs. Adley-SantaMaria and I decided to remedy the situation described inthe previous paragraph by collaborating on a Type 3 textbook for non-speakersof Western Apache. We decided on a Type 3 textbook for the reasons below: Teaching Indigenous Languages 1. Could be used by non-speakers;2. Designed for high school and university levels who can benefitfrom some grammar instruction (Od lin, 1994); and3. Existence of several successful models Wilson'sConversational (Learning Apache): An introduc-tory textbook in the White Mountain Apache language for non-speakers (deReuse & Adley-SantaMaria, 1996). In addition to the body of thirty lessonsthat have been completed, the final version will contain two introductions, oneby myself and one by Ms. Adley-SantaMaria, acknowledgments, a pronuncia-tion and spelling section, a glossary, an index, and a paradigms appendix. Weused Wilson (1995) as a model for the first 20 Lessons. The lessons are writtenaround grammatical topics (such as locatives and possession) or around com-municative topics (such as health and body part terms), and the approach isbasically in the grammar-translation tradition. Each lesson has a vocabularylist and extensive grammatical explanation with illustrative sentences. The ex-ercises are predominantly in the shape of sentences to be translated into En-glish. In order to make the work more communicatively relevant, the sentencesto be translated are usually in the form of question-response dyads.4 Our col-laboration on this text raised a variety of ideological, practical, and culturalissues.Ideological issuesWhile the main purpose of our text is to teach elementary conversationalWestern Apache with some emphasis on reading and writing, I also wanted it tobe used to teach some of the linguistics of Western Apache to Apache studentsand speakers. In the next paragraphs, I explain the usefulness of linguistics toApache speakers. Ms. Adley-SantaMaria will also address some of these issuesin her own presentation in this volume.Linguistics is the scientific study of human language. To the layperson,linguistics often seems boring because it bears some resemblance to grammar.Everyone remembers English grammar from their elementary school or highschool years, and nobody liked it. The problem with traditional English gram-mar is that it did not seem to have a point, or maybe the only point was that ittold you what was \"good\" English and what was \"bad\" English, without reallyexplaining why. Linguistics tries to be a more responsible study of grammar, inthree ways. First, it tries to explain why things are the way they are, by trying todiscover general rules but recognizing that sometimes an explanation has not(yet) been found. Second, it tries to accurately describe the way people speak,without unduly worrying whether a particular utterance is \"correct\" or \"incor-rect.\" Third, linguistics is not committed to a particular language. Language isa universally human faculty, and linguistics is the study of what all languageshave in common and in which direction and to what extent they vary.134120 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThere are many educators who might be anxious to find out what they willlearn from the linguistics in this text and how it will be useful for their studentson the reservation. In my opinion, there are three basic ways in which linguis-tics can be useful to Native American educators. First, most educators inter-ested in the contents of this text deal with bilingual situations, i.e. situationswhere both the Native language and English are used. In such situations, oneobviously becomes aware of the differences between languages. Part of lin-guistics is a subfield called contrastive linguistics (sometimes erroneously calledcomparative linguistics, which should be reserved for the subfield that com-pares languages in order to determine their common historical origin). Con-trastive linguistics compares one or more languages, emphasizing the differ-ences in linguistic structure. It allows us to explain more accurately why cer-tain aspects of English, or of Western Apache, are hard to learn for speakers ofother languages. The practical applications to the educator are obvious. Ourdiscussions of Western Apache grammar will in effect be contrastive, since itwill be assumed that English grammar is different from it in many ways. I donot know of any works on the contrastive linguistics of Western Apache andEnglish. Ms. Adley-SantaMaria and I had to work on what our understandingof contrastive linguistics was. I would say that we had to explain a detail ofApache grammar really well, because the facts are complicated, and Ms. Adley-SantaMaria would respond, \"Why? It's not complicated to me!\" Indeed, whatis simple and natural to a Native speaker of Apache is not necessarily simple toa Native speaker of English, and vice-versa.Second, as pointed out by Ken Hale in several papers (n.d., 1972, 1970-1975, 1976), Native American languages form an ideal laboratory for teachingchildren about scientific inquiry. Native American languages have not beencodified in language academies or authoritative textbooks or dictionaries, whichmeans that children do not have preconceived ideas about what the \"correct\"language is. Like all speakers of a language, Native American children (whospeak their own language) do of course have an intuitive, largely unconsciousknowledge of the rules of the language. What the teacher can do is dialoguewith the children in order to help them discover, little by little, these uncon-scious rules. This process of discovery by dialogue is, as Hale convincinglypoints out, similar to the teacher-student dialogue occurring in a physics orchemistry class and just as scientific. The only difference is that no expensivesupplies are needed, just a chalkboard and the children's native speaker intui-tions. Thus, linguistics can be a tool for teaching the principles of scientificinquiry. In order to use linguistics this way, educators themselves need to knowsomething about the linguistic structure of their languages. Ms. Adley-SantaMaria was not convinced of this need, and I see her point, because it isprecisely the children who are rapidly losing their native competence and ac-quire, at best, a passive knowledge of Apache. A passive knowledge is certainlynot as good as an active knowledge for the purpose of discovering unconsciousrules. 121 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThe third and final motivation for teaching linguistics is to get Native Ameri-can students interested in the field. It has been pointed out several times (forexample in Hale, 1972) that Native American Linguistics has been a Euro-American type of venture. The Euro-American person comes to a reservation,identifies a \"vanishing Indian language\" to be rescued from \"oblivion,\" de-scribes it, and gets substantial academic recognition for his or her publications.The language is rescued from \"oblivion,\" yes, but only in the form of scholarlybooks, to be found on the shelves of museums and research libraries. Duringthat time, the language might well suffer conditions of oppression and becomeextinct among the people who spoke it. It is no surprise, then, that some reser-vation communities are resentful of linguists, who come in, do their research,leave, and achieve recognition thanks to data provided by members of the com-munity but do not do anything that would benefit that community. Therefore,the more Native Americans gain an understanding of what linguistics can dofor their communities, the easier it will be for them to prevent this type ofexploitative situation and identify ways in which linguistics can benefit theircommunities.Obviously, linguists should be careful of trying too hard to get Native Ameri-can students interested in linguistics. There will never be as much money inlinguistics as there is in law or medicine, and the study of linguistics, like base-ball or square-dancing, is definitely a matter of taste. Some love it; some don't.Nevertheless, I am convinced that the field of Native American linguistics willprogress substantially if only a few more Native American students develop ataste for it. Educators should be ready to recognize such students when theyspring up. Obviously, I encourage Native speakers to become linguists, so thatthey could go on and develop materials on their own.I realize that some people might feel there is something politically incor-rect about collaborating with a native speaker, rather than let him/her do it byhim/herself. Since Ms. Adley-SantaMaria's field is not linguistics, we had towork together. Considering the endangerment of the language, I do not think itis a good idea to wait for an Apache linguist to graduate before writing a text-book. Note also that the only other existing Apache textbook, which is on JicarillaApache of New Mexico, was written with a similar sort of collaboration (Wil-son & Vigil Martine, 1996).Practical and cultural issuesOn a more practical plane, Ms. Adley-SantaMaria and I had our disagree-ments about explaining complex morphology without presupposing a lot oflinguistic knowledge on the part of the learner; we compromised and will con-tinue doing so. For example, I agreed on not attempting to explain the subjectprefixes that must occur in the verb. The morphological and morphophonologicalfacts involved are just too complex. On the other hand, I would still like to keepmy discussion of the object prefixes that occur in transitive verbs. The gram-mar of the object prefixes is still not simple, but they are easier to learn torecognize than the subject prefixes. I prefer this approach to that of Wilson and 122I C.' r6u Teaching Indigenous LanguagesVigil Martine (1996) who do not discuss verb prefixes, except for three passingmentions on pages 35, 87, and 104 and a discussion of distributive plural da(a)-on pages 76 and 108, which must leave the moderately inquisitive learner rathercurious.Our collaboration was absolutely crucial in avoiding structures with cul-turally sensitive connotations, even though some of these would have beenuseful for purposes of grammatical illustration. We decided to avoid anythinghaving to do with sex and bodily functions, drug and alcohol abuse, child andspousal abuse, witchcraft, and traditional religious beliefs. Certain details ofclan nomenclature were also avoided. Consider the example sentences below:baa nadaa?What are you doing?/ What are you busy me.Naa naghaa.S/he is bothering you.All these seem nice examples of the construction with the postposition P-aaand the verb of motion nashaa/nadaa/naghaa. There are two usages to thisconstruction: the object of a postposition P-aa can be a thing, as in the first twosentences or the object of the postposition can be a human being. The usageexemplified in the last two sentences is problematic in that some people mightbe made uncomfortable by the sexual connotations they attach to it, so we areconsidering taking it out. However, we do want to retain the usage exemplifiedby the first two sentences above.The last ten lessons of the text are conversations on everyday topics withinterlinear translations and detailed lexical and grammatical notes inspired by(but not translated from) the section on conversations in Zepeda (1983, pp. 43-154). The conversations in these lessons were originally composed for me bytwo Apache educators from San Carlos, and then translated into the White Moun-tain dialect by Ms. Adley-SantaMaria and myself. In so doing we had to makesure the place names were relevant and had to create Apache proper names thatare realistic enough, while avoiding references to a real individual.Finally, it should be noted that I never attempted to create any Apachesentences or conversations by myself for the text, and I am happy I never triedto do that, since I would have been responsible for quite a few linguistic andcultural blunders. I always used sentences given by Ms. Adley-SantaMaria orby other speakers I had worked with earlier. If the sentences came from otherspeakers, Ms. Adley-SantaMaria would sometimes say, \"You can't say it thisway!,\" which just shows how much dialectal and stylistic variation there existswithin Western Apache. 123I Teaching Indigenous LanguagesA guide to teaching Apache with TPRAnother text I was instrumental in helping produce is Goode (1996), whichis not close to final shape. It is a translation of most of the sentences given inAsher's (1982) teacher's guidebook and, when my own commentary is inte-grated into it, will function as a fairly comprehensive guide to teaching Apachewith the Total Physical Response (TPR) method. The sentences were translatedinto the San Carlos variant of Western Apache by Philip Goode and were alsorecorded on cassette tape. Some problems already identified are the following.The TPR method relies heavily, especially in the beginning of a course, oncommands. English has a very simple verb form to express commands: it isbasically the verb stem. However, for commands, Apache uses an inflectedverb form, which has to be inflected for second person singular, dual, or plural.Therefore, the listener will have to hear three different commands and interpretthem correctly as singular, dual, or plural, whereas English will have the sameverb form, regardless of whether the command is given to one, two, or three ormore people. An Apache example is given below:HiziStand up.Holsi,i,.Stand up (to two people).DahoIskiStand up (to three or more people).The TPR method relies heavily on giving, putting down, and picking up ob-jects, which in Apache are translated by thirteen classificatory handling verbs(not counting verbs of throwing and dropping), a rich and subtle system whichwould place an unreasonable burden on the beginning learner if it was exclu-sively taught through TPR. With Witherspoon et al. (1986), I agree that usingTPR with classificatory handling verbs is very useful for review and reinforce-ment, but I would not advise teaching them through TPR only, as this wouldtake almost thirteen times as long as teaching the English equivalents.Finally, TPR relies heavily on touching and pointing activities, which areoften culturally inappropriate for Apaches. Thus, it would be unwise, to usecommands such as those below, all translated from Asher (1982):Miguel, and pinch her nose.Bits'in bich'(' danthiid.Point to her head.Notwithstanding these serious shortcomings, the TPR sentences revealed quitea few interesting and useful constructions which were not covered by the Ndeebiyciti' bigoch'il'aah text discussed earlier. 12413S Teaching Indigenous LanguagesConclusions and recommendationsWe suggest that the problems posed by the two preliminary Apache textswe discussed can be partially solved by a judicious combination of the twoapproaches. For example, the classificatory handling verbs are best taught by agrammar-translation method, supplemented by TPR style exercises. Straight-forward syntactic structures (at least in Apache), such as negation and yes-noquestions, can be taught through TPR exercises and supplemented by gram-matical explanations.Native experts should monitor any text to avoid culturally sensitive or po-litically inappropriate material. Finally, a dialogue between linguists and na-tive experts needs to be established, in order to decide how much linguisticterminology can be handled in each particular curriculum.One criticism I anticipate of this paper is that I am not aware of all theunpublished materials that have been developed, and such unpublished materi-als might have thought of everything mentioned above. This might well be trueand brings us to an important recurring problem. Many educators and textbookdevelopers, notwithstanding a symposium such as this one, still work in toomuch isolation and are shy of sharing their materials with others, partly for fearthat they will be criticized and partly for fear that they will be plagiarized orused for the wrong purposes. But in these times of urgent need for languagerenewal, the need to share should be more important than fear of criticism, andU.S. copyright laws protect one well against plagiarism. So, sharing unpub-lished materials, with due caution of course, should be encouraged.I have one last recommendation for Apache and other Athabaskan text-book developers: use pedagogical materials for Navajo as models, after secur-ing the proper permissions. Navajo is not so close to Apache that you won'thave any work left, but it is a lot easier to develop materials departing fromNavajo textbooks than it is when you depart from English, Spanish, French, oreven Cherokee textbooks.

The first section describes my master'sthesis on White Mountain Apache language shift, including my rec-ommendations for further research studies on the White MountainApache language.1 The second section is on the panel presentation on\"School-Community-University Collaborations in Language Resto-ration,\" in which I participated with the University of Arizona's Ameri-can Indian Language Development Institute faculty. The third part isa commentary on \"Issues in language textbook development: the caseof Western Apache,\" a paper by Willem J. de Reuse, UA linguisticanthropologist, on our collaborative grammar book project. Follow-ing these is a summary of some language learning methods, ideas,and other information previously described in various works that couldbe regarded as repetitious and \"preaching to the converted,\" but Iagree with Robert W. Rhodes in Nurturing Learning in Native Ameri-can Students (1994) who states that, \"being a little redundant servesto reinforce concepts... Since you will probably have a different mindsetat different times, the redundancy may serve a purpose\" (p. vi). Mynative speaker's perspective might, therefore, present and develop someideas, insight, and possibilities that may prove helpful for our topic oflanguage renewal. The White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT), located in east-central Ari-zona on 1.6 million acres, is the fourth largest reservation in Arizona with 12,500tribal members and is the third largest Arizona Indian tribe in population. Na-tionwide, the WMAT is in the top ten for land area and population of federally-recognized indigenous nations (Adley-SantaMaria, 1997). White MountainApache (WMA) is an Athabaskan language; Athabaskan language subgroupsare Northern, Pacific Coast, and Southern Athabaskan. Western Apache andEastern Apache are Southern Athabaskan languages. Eastern Apache varietiesBernadette Adley-SantaMaria. (1997). White Mountain Apache language shift:A perspective on causes, effects, and avenues for change. Unpublished master'sthesis. The University of Arizona, Tucson. 129143 SouthernTonto, and Yavapai-Apache language varieties (Adley-SantaMaria, 1997).Michael Krauss, president of the Native American Language Center at the Uni-versity of Alaska and a well-known language expert, places the Western Apacheand Navajo languages among those in Category A (indigenous languages stillspoken by children) of the threatened language categories (Krauss, 1992).At face value, Krauss's classification makes the prospects for preservingthe WMA language look good, but when one examines the rapidly-changingdynamics of shift to English occurring in these same speech communities, thereis cause for concern. That knowledge led me to select my thesis topic last year.The premise for my thesis, \"White Mountain Apache Language Shift: A Per-spective on Causes, Effects, and Avenues for Change,\" is that the illuminationof linguistic and non-linguistic causal factors that negatively affect transforma-tions in the White Mountain Apache language is a priority, not only to reversecontinued language shift to English, but also to preclude holistic changes inWhite Mountain Apache culture and society.The theory adopted in my thesis is that language is linked, directly andindirectly, to the content in cultural teachings of indigenous societies in theAmericas (Fishman, 1991; Woodbury, 1993). Therefore, language shift to thedominant language by indigenous societies creates not only monolingualism,but also impacts heavily on maintenance of cultural teachings thereby affectingthe indigenous peoples holistically. In applying this theory to the White Moun-tain Apaches specifically, the effects on their people encompass the psycho-logical, social, religious (spirituality beliefs), political, legal, educational, andother areas of life.Findings from research on the non-linguistic causal factors regarding theerosion and loss of the WMA language are similar to studies done on othertribes (Crawford, 1996; Watahomigie & McCarty, 1997). These include socio-economic factors, politicization of language, long-term effects of formal school-ing, mass media, the advent of technology, and changes in values. Anothercausal factor among WMAs includes attitudes towards their language (or lan-guage ideology) underlying decisions to pass on their language to the youngergenerations. To gather information about the attitudes, opinions, and beliefs ofWMAs and to illuminate the attitudes of educators and church leaders, I usedthree different evaluative instruments utilizing closed- and open-ended ques-tions: an Apache Language Survey questionnaire for adult WMA volunteer sub-jects and separate questionnaires for educators and church leaders on the WMAreservation. These questions were designed to elicit information on demograph-ics, tribal affiliation, background, Apache language ability, language transmis-sion, language use by domain, and attitudes on education, religious beliefs, andbeliefs about Apache language and culture. Linguistic causal factors include:monolingualism, code-switching, semilingualism, interlanguage, language trans-fer, use of nonstandard English (Apache-ized English), language policies, and Teaching Indigenous Languageslinguistic human rights. The foregoing topics were not researched in depth formy thesis; therefore, are briefly mentioned here.The subjectsAbout 3,000-4,000 of the total WMA tribal population is school aged, andapproximately one-half (6,500) of the total population are adults 18 and over,with about one-third (2,600) of these age 60 and over. I interviewed 41 (68%)females and 19 (32%) males (total: 60) adult WMAs between 18 to 91 years ofage from eight of the fifteen communities on the reservation. The average ageof respondents was 41 for females and 45 for males. The data by age groupswere: 18 to 29 year olds (16=27%); 30 to 49 year olds (26=43%); and 50+(18=30%). Of the 60 respondents, 40 (67%) claimed full WMA affiliation, 12(20%) claimed WMA/other tribe, and 8 (13%) claimed mixed heritage, WMAand/or other tribe and non-Indian.Regarding Apache language ability, most (95%) respondents 40 years ofage and over speak Apache, compared to 41% of respondents age 39 and under;88% of those 30 years and over speak Apache compared to 28% of those under30. The greatest difference (80%) in Apache language ability was predictablybetween the oldest and youngest age groups. A surprising finding was the dif-ference (31%) between the 20- and 30-year olds in that the older age group hadsuch a greater language ability than the younger group. More (43%) respond toparents/guardians in Apache only, while fewer (28%) speak to their children/grandchildren in Apache only. Between one-quarter to one-third (28-30%) ofthe total respondents speak bilingually to both parents/ guardians and children/grandchildren. About one-tenth of respondents speak English only. Some re-spondents (42%) believe that learning about Apache culture is affected bywhether an Apache understands/ speaks their language. Fully 100% of respon-dents respect Apache language and culture, but changes in values are nega-tively impacting Apache language preservation.Impact of missionariesResponses to my questionnaire revealed that a change in values has oc-curred as a result of the continuing practices of cultural genocide by Protestantmissionaries on the WMA reservation. This is a potentially controversial andsensitive topic but one that should be addressed by insiders of the communitiesand not by outsiders who may be resented. Many respondents (72%) were taughtby their Protestant churches not to attend Apache ceremonies and that tradi-tional Apache spirituality beliefs are wrong or paganistic. Interestingly, only16% of these respondents taught their children what their churches taught them.One-half (50%) of Protestants and most (83%) Roman Catholics believe thatChristian missionaries are incorrect to teach against attendance at Apache cer-emonies and spirituality beliefs. The Roman Catholic churches on the WMAreservation currently teach their parishioners to value their culture and Apachespirituality as \"gifts from God\" and more of those (72%) who were respon-dents in this study identified themselves as both Roman Catholic and believers 1311 Teaching Indigenous Languagesin the traditional Apache spirituality beliefs; none of the Protestant respondentsdid the same.Questions on religious affiliation and beliefs were included in this studybecause I suspected that there were adverse teachings against Apache spiritual-ity beliefs and ceremonies by some Christian fundamentalist churches on thereservation through anecdotal and experiential knowledge. These teachings af-fect the Apache culture (and thereby, language) negatively and the findingsfrom these types of questions confirmed my suspicions in addition to creatingmore questions which, I believe, should be addressed by tribal leaders with amore comprehensive survey of the Protestant church teachings on the reserva-tion for assessing and determining the extent of their impact on the WMA lan-guage and culture maintenance and with tribal constitutional rights already inplace.Recommendations for further studySince there is very little data or documented research on the language is-sues of the WMA Tribe, this small research survey constitutes a necessary be-ginning. The following are my condensed recommendations for further study.There is a need for: 1.Comprehensive studies to assess intergenerational language trans-mission.2.Studies to determine connections between the loss of language/culture and social problems on the reservation.3.In-depth analysis to evaluate the adequacy of bilingual/ biculturalcurriculum implementation in the educational system of the WMAreservation, and if lacking, to investigate successful community-controlled schools on other reservations that have developed bi-lingual programs to utilize for models.4.Compilation of information and solutions to Protestant churchteachings to minimize the adverse effects on Apache language/cultural beliefs.5.A study to determine language revitalization, maintenance, andpreservation programming needs.6.Development of Apache language materials for use by Apaches.7.Assistance in and advocacy for an Apache-speaking committee toresearch/compose a comprehensive tribal language policy to add/integrate with the section on language in the pending WMAT'sHeritage Preservation Ordinance.8.A feasibility study for establishing a tribal college that could be-come a center for teacher training, language revitalization andmaintenance programs, language materials development, languageclasses, bilingual/bicultural education classes, and a resource/ar-chives center. 1132 Teaching Indigenous Languages 9.Research and compiling useful information on various languagelearning methods and development of language materials.10. Advocacy, tribal support, and encouragement for more Apache-speaking students to become educators.Recommendations such as these can be accomplished by tribes with the techni-cal assistance of language experts and training of their educators by faculties ofprograms such as the American Indian Language Development Institute (AILDI)of the University of Arizona. The following section describes these types ofcollaborations.School-community-university collaborationsThe education of Native American youth is one of the major problemsfacing us in the 21st century. We have suffered historically in the Americaneducational system and it still is problematic. We discuss these issues to gener-ate insight into pressing problems of Indian education and to build consensusfor change. The erosion of indigenous community and family structures (therebythe language and cultural teachings) are not isolated problems with singularcauses. The common denominator of all the educational problems in regards tonative students is that they are systemic problems. They arise from a system ofpublic education that inevitably rests on theories of knowledge in the Westbased on reductionism, fragmenting complex phenomena into components, andbuilding up specialized knowledge of the parts.In regard to the theme of \"Sharing Effective Language Renewal Practices\"for this year's Stabilizing Indigenous Languages Symposium, our panel's' po-sition on School-Community-University Collaborations in Language Restora-tion is that while schools cannot be held solely responsible for reversing indig-enous language loss, their personnel must be prominent in efforts to maintainand revitalize those languages. The family and home still have the primaryresponsibility for language transmission to the younger generation in the indig-enous communities, but schools are where the children spend a large part oftheir time and should be a place where language and culture teaching is a natu-ral part of a young person's overall learning process with the involvement of allelements of the community: the family, the school, and the student.The traditional American educational process is based on competition andindividual learning, whereas competition was not stressed in native societiesand learning was connected with the common good and interdependence intheir holistic societies. The American process, founded on fragmentation andrivalry, starts in elementary school and continues right through university, get-ting worse and worse the further one \"progresses\" in higher education. Such aneducational process can never lay a solid foundation for understanding interde-'This panel presented at the Symposium on May 2, 1997, and consisted ofBernadette Adley-SantaMaria, Karen Francis-Begay, Teresa McCarty, OfeliaZepeda, and Lucille Watahomigie. 133147 Teaching Indigenous Languagespendency and for fostering genuine dialogue that integrates diverse points ofview such as the indigenous society's.Concerns today with public education focus on achievement relative totraditional standards. But the real problem lies with the relevance of the tradi-tional (or Western educational theoretical) standards themselves, especially tothe indigenous youth. In their traditional societies, indigenous people educatedthe youth in holistic ways teaching them that all of life is interconnected. Thoseteachings fell on the wayside along with many of our cultures and languagesa tragedy of our times. The more we revive and understand the traditional skills,knowledge, and beliefs needed to succeed in an interdependent world, the moreone sees the error of thinking that we can focus exclusively on the dominantsocietal education system and ignore our indigenous ways of teaching of thepast.Some sophisticated educators of the dominant society do not believe inbilingual/bicultural education and do not see the system as an interdependentwhole (as many natives do). They see only the piecesthe educational theo-ries, special education, traditional way of education, same age group in a class,and gifted and not-gifted children. Maybe it is simply because the professionaleducators have spent their whole lives in schools that have never taught the truehistory of this country and its oppressive practices against indigenous peoplesor history as seen from the perspective of the original inhabitants of this coun-try that is not in any school textbook. Maybe, despite their knowledge aboutlearning theory and research, some educators also have the hardest time seeingbeyond \"the way it's always been done,\" or understanding other cultures andperspectives of America's history. Some members of the dominant society areactually shocked when told that some of us (Native Americans) do not considerourselves Americans or a part of the dominant society and that some of us alsodo not believe ourselves to be a \"conquered\" people as taught in history texts.Some natives consider themselves spiritual caretakers of this land (no matterwho \"owns\" it now) and keepers of sacred knowledge for all.In spite of the fact that the majority of United States education has histori-cally been oppressive to Native Americans and that many educators are still nottruly educated about Native Americans, the leadership that will be needed mustcome from those of us (indigenous or non-indigenous) who know the issuesthe parents, communities, tribes, schools, educators, and universities collabo-rating for indigenous language/culture restoration in a sustained and mutuallysupportive relationship. The goal would be to benefit all children by teachingthem culturally-relevant curriculum in schools. Such ideas may seem naivelyidealistic, but that can be refuted with some contemporary examples of whathas been accomplished with such collaborations.In Arizona, examples include programs such as AILDI and its almost 20years of training reservation-based educators. After working at the AILDI of-fice at the University of Arizona (UA) for a year as a graduate assistant, I havegained invaluable firsthand experience and suggest that reservation-based edu-cators take advantage of their excellent summer institute. Another example is 134 Teaching Indigenous Languagesthe Rough Rock Community School, a Navajo community-controlled schoolin northeastern Arizona on the Navajo reservation that emphasizes teachingthrough Navajo language and culture. And another is the Hualapai bilingual/bicultural program at Peach Springs school founded by Lucille Watahomigie(also one of the founders of AILDI) on the Hualapai Reservation in northernArizona. The next section of this paper is on a project that is also an example ofuniversity-native speaker collaboration, although, as a UA doctoral student, Iam in the dual positions of being an Apache speaker and a member of the aca-demic community.Commentary on issues in language textbook developmentAs described above, collaboration between native speakers (or communi-ties), university personnel, and reservation schools is an important componentof planning for indigenous language renewal. The grammar textbook, NdeeBiyciti' Ngoch'il'aah (Learning Apache): An Introductory Textbook in the WhiteMountain Apache Language for Non-speakers (de Reuse & Adley-SantaMaria,1996) that Willem de Reuse and I worked on is an example of university-nativespeaker development of teaching material for language revitalization efforts.The involvement of native speakers is a critical element in this type ofcollaboration. In his article, \"Theoretical Linguistics in Relation to AmericanIndian Communities,\" Kenneth Hale, a well-known language expert from MIT,stated that,It has become increasingly clear in recent years...that many importantaspects of linguistic structure are essentially beyond the reach of schol-ars who are not native speakers of the language they study.... [and that]a native speaker's command [of the indigenous language] is critical inthe linguistic enterprise. (1976, pp. 35-36)This observation was made when indigenous language issues were fairly newto the academic community but is still true today. Though not trained in lin-guistics, I have knowledge from fluency in Apache, Spanish, and English, andfrom extensive experience working with de Reuse, I am also somewhat self-educated on aspects of linguistics. This section, therefore, is not meant as acritique of my coauthor, but as an example of how we native speakers can shareour knowledge and insight into language renewal practices in collaborationswith linguists, identifying and finding solutions for problems and assisting inshaping and defining how our languages can be taught and documented accu-rately for future generations.Linguists, anthropologists, and other scientists extol methods of scientificinquiry utilizing the Euro-Western philosophical underpinnings of the variousdisciplines in American academics. Linguistics seemed like anthropology, afield of study that did not have a good reputation among some of us NativeAmericans because of its connection with scientific inquiry that has exploitedindigenous societies and kept us rooted in the past. It seemed as if we native 135'I 4 Teaching Indigenous Languagespeople were like \"bugs\" on a microscopic slide for anthropologists (scientists)to examine and \"dissect\" into our varied parts: kinship patterns, material sub-sistence, cultural artifacts, marriage obligations, types of shelter, ceremoniallife, and so forth, all of the past, as if we are invisible in contemporary society.Some of us have long abhorred the tunnel vision of these disciplines that gener-ally do not consider non-Western societal world views as legitimate. As anundergraduate at the University of Arizona, I attempted an introductory lin-guistic course but found it vastly boring and dropped it quickly. Now I realizethat it might have been helpful, so the need to study linguistics is still an am-biguous subject.Differences in world view between the scientific disciplines and the indig-enous people is one obstacle in collaborations between the two, but practicaldifferences aside from ideological ones also emerged as a result of our work.One is the assumptions about language universals. Language is a universal hu-man ability (Comre, 1989; Yule, 1996), but one should not infer that all lan-guages have similar grammar rules from this. Those who speak English and anindigenous language will readily tell you that they are very dissimilar. Somelanguage experts (Comre, 1989; Greenberg, 1966) do not agree with assump-tions about language universals because they disagree with methodological ap-proaches to making such assumptions. One is that there has not been an ad-equate sample of languages included in making such assertions because theyare based on only a few languages researched in depth. I believe indigenouslanguages have innate grammar rules that defy generalizations and comparisonwith other world languages.Speakers of Chinese, Spanish, or other so-called \"world languages\" havenon-speakers who can always find a speech community even into the futurethat will be available to them if they want to learn their languages, but indig-enous languages are unique speech communities. Once our native speakers aregone and the younger generations become completely monolingual in English,the loss of our languages is permanent. The urgency of our mission is anotherreason I believe we should not wait for linguists to study our grammar rulesand document them before we begin revitalizing our languages.Another obstacle to learning indigenous languages is a lack of pedagogicalmaterials and one of the reasons for that lack is because some native peopleoppose having their languages written down or recorded. Elizabeth Brandt,professor of anthropology at Arizona State University (Tempe), in \"NativeAmerican Attitudes Toward Literacy and Recording in the Southwest\" discussesattitudes on language that are generalizable to many tribes, including the WMAs.She believes that the aversion to writing and recording our languages is\"grounded in religion\" (1981, p. 186). That is true to some extent, but \"reli-gion\" (we call it \"way of life\") in native societies permeates and is intercon-nected with all areas of our lives. That is a given.The reasons for opposition to writing and recording are deep and complex.Many of us do not discuss publicly or to non-indigenous peoples their reasonsbecause their revelation can be dangerous. There are those of us who respect150136 Teaching Indigenous Languageseach other's beliefs and resent the continuous probing by outsiders who wantanswers and knowledge for curiosity's sake, for exploitation, or for researchthat does not benefit us. Our wise elders tell us that there are things in this worldbest left uninvestigated, unsaid, and not revealed. My own feelings on this is-sue are ambiguous. On the one hand, I do not want our languages exploited andalso believe that study of our languages should be done only for our people whowant to learn their language and not for the wider audience. On the other hand,writing and video- and audio-recordings of our languages should be done forour tribal archives to be preserved for future generations of Apaches.When some native people express their opposition to exploitation of theirlanguages, some who regret this type of opposition and wish to study theselanguages denigrate this opposition as \"political correctness.\" I object to usingthis new terminology to describe concerns of indigenous peoples who haveinherent human rights to use and protect their languages and cultures that pre-date by centuries, if not millennia, today's ephemeral political labels.Brandt (1981) also writes that the lack of permanent means of recordingNative American language/information or opposition to it allows for \"struc-tural amnesia\" or \"selective forgetting\" by native people. This might be true toa certain extent but (also mentioned by Brandt) our creation stories and ritualwords are encoded in songs that have not changed for centuriesone way forpreservation of our languages. I believe that the real experts at selective forget-ting are the authors of the historical books who omit the true historical record ofthe genocidal and oppressive practices against Native Americans by the gov-ernment and dominant society. Meantime, the contentious issue of whether toallow our languages to be studied, written, and recorded will not be resolvedsoon.With the foregoing foundation of different cultural beliefs and world viewsthat form a basis to my own language philosophy, next are comments on severalpoints of contention that occurred in this project. After long hours, over days orweeks of note-gathering, translation, pronunciation, and compilation of gram-mar and sample sentences, de Reuse would input the lessons on the computer.Then I checked the rough draft and noted revisions on things I disagreed withor thought should be added/deleted. In this way, points of disagreement wereuncovered.One point of disagreement was that I viewed the Apache language as inter-connected with all aspects of the Apache society rather than the minutiae wealways focused on. As our work became more complex, I began to articulate tode Reuse that there is more to consider in speaking Apache and began relatingsome of the beliefs, attitudes, and opinions of Apache speakers about their lan-guage (language ideology) that put much more meaning contextually in thesyntax and structure of speech. Thus \"culturally sensitive connotations\" areactually differences in world views between the traditionally-raised indigenousperson and the Western-educated non-indigenous person. In my experience, thecross-cultural understanding of our indigenous lifeways by many non-indig- 1375 I Teaching Indigenous Languagesenous people is lacking no matter how well educated that person is in the for-mal education system.Another problem that came up as we worked extensively on WMA verbparadigms for another project was that I did not see why we needed to takeverbs apart and analyze them by verb stems, special constructions, subject andobject prefixes and affixes, and so forth, because in our language verb stems bythemselves make absolutely no sense and we would never think of them in thatcontext. Grammar rules seem innate in Apache speakers for they rarely makemistakes in grammar when they are fluent speakers, even among children. Notall Apaches (even those from the same speech communities) agree on how tosay something for there are individual differences between them, but these arestylistic and dialectical variations. Although, I probably exasperated my coau-thor at times with my objections on verbs, with this process, I did learn onethingthat Athabaskan languages are well known for their formidable verbmorphology. I agree with experts (Fishman, 1991; Hale, 1976; Hinton, 1994b)who state that literacy is not necessary to learn one's heritage language. All theemphasis for this project was on grammar, reading, and writing Apache whencomputers, dictionaries, grammatical discussions, texts, literacy, or even lin-guistic (scientific) study of indigenous languages should not be the focus oflanguage learning.Furthermore, there was confusion on my part on exactly who our audienceis. Even after we agreed on a high school and college-level audience, my coau-thor would seem to continue aiming at the linguistic academic audience in hisgrammatical explanations. On the one hand is my view that, although somebasic grammar is necessary, the technical linguistic grammatical explanationsfor this project are too extensive, complex, and unnecessary for the audience(the average young Apache) I envisioned, and on the other hand, de Reuse'sinclusion of in-depth grammatical explanations to teach elementary conversa-tional Western Apache seem necessary to him.Considering the foregoing statements, one might wonder why I becameinvolved in this project. When de Reuse first approached me to do translationwork from Western Apache to English, I agreed to participate not expectingremuneration but was later pleasantly surprised to find that his grant fundingprovides payment for consulting work. Anyone who has been a graduate stu-dent knows of the constant need for funds to cover basic living expenses, soone reason was financial. Following this we decided to work on this project butapparently with different expectations.Preserving indigenous languages for posterity is another reason. Because Ihad often heard my late maternal grandmother, my parents, and other Apacheelders complain that today's Apache youth are not learning their ancestor'slanguage, and therefore, not learning what it means to be Apache, I knew thatlanguage and culture loss was becoming an issue among some of our people.Those of us who are native speakers of indigenous languages need to share ourexpertise and to preserve our languages in any form we can. These forms in-clude pedagogical (instructional) materials, literature in native languages, and/52 138 Teaching Indigenous Languagesvideo and audio tapes of native speakers. Although I agree with language ex-perts who argue that literacy and grammatical explanation (linguistics) are notnecessary for language acquisition, I saw documentation of our languages as\"tools\" for the future because of the rapid acceleration of shift to English oc-curring in Western Apache and other indigenous languages.For these reasons, I do not believe that it is absolutely essential for nativespeakers to study linguistics. Although Apache students should be encouragedto seek degrees in linguistics to assist with future technical advice for theWMAT's language preservation efforts, they should first know their language.Some training (in language learning methods, developing teaching materials,and other literature) is necessary to teach the language even if one is a nativespeaker but that does not require formal higher education or linguistics degree.Language learning methods, especially if they have been successfully uti-lized, are important information for tribes to share in their language renewalefforts. There are a variety of educational approaches and methods aimed atlanguage acquisition. These programs include James Asher's (1996) Total Physi-cal Response (TPR) method. This method is based on language acquisition instages. At first, the instructor ask students to do various physical activities thatare modeled by the instructor. Learning a language with this method is similarto learning a first language with the following themes: subconscious pickingup, implicit/automatic, informal, use of cues, concrete experiences, active in-volvement by learner and teacher, non-corrective, praise/reinforcement, involve-ment of student-centered situational activities, and stresses use of right brainprocesses with a focus on ideas, meaning, and communication, not grammar ormechanics. This method was used by a San Carlos Apache consultant who alsocollaborated with de Reuse on a book project (de Reuse & Goode, 1996), but itis sometimes inappropriate in Apache culture if students are asked to toucheach other.Another language teaching method is Communication-Based Instruction(CBI), a five-step lesson planning method based on a view that function (whatlanguage is used for) should be emphasized rather than the forms of the lan-guage (correct grammatical or phonological structure). Lessons are constructedaround oral communication (Supahan, 1995).The grammar-translation method \"treats second, or foreign, language learn-ing like any other academic subject. Long lists of words and a set of grammati-cal rules have to be memorized, and the written language, rather than the spo-ken language is emphasized\" (Yule, 1996, p. 193). Learners of second lan-guages using this method in schools sometimes achieve high grades in a lan-guage class and then find themselves at a loss when it comes to actually usingthe language.The Master-Apprentice Language Learning Program (MALLP) was de-veloped by the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival with agoal of creating an immersion experience for one or two language learners witha master speaker trained in the development of communicative competence ina native language. This method includes no use of English or literacy, learning 139153 Teaching Indigenous Languagesto ask questions in target language, listening, reminders, use of nonverbal com-munication, use of pictures/objects, teaching in full sentences, learning aboutculture, doing activities together, use of audio and video taping, and use ofsocial skills (see Hinton 1994a).Immersion Programs, with many variations in use today, begin with thebasic premise that use of any language other than the target language is to bediscouraged based on the \"notion that people can learn second languages simi-larly to the way in which they learn first languages, through being immersed inan environment where the language is the dominant one being used\" (Hinton,1994b, p. 19).Many experts (Dick & McCarty, 1992; Fishman, 1991; Hale, 1976; Hinton,1994b) agree that the best means of achieving language renewal is for the olderand middle generations of indigenous people to speak to and teach their lan-guage to the younger generations (one of the definitions of intergenerationallanguage transmission). De Reuse agrees with that assertion, but the grammarof Western Apache remains a primary interest of his, which could prove benefi-cial for the Apache people in the long run because there are so few working onit.Hinton states unequivocally that \"people almost never learn how to speaka language fluently when writing and grammar are the focus\" and that \"to learnhow to speak a language fluently, writing and grammar are not as important asjust listening and talking, talking and listening,\" although she admits that gram-matical analysis and literacy in native languages might be useful in the long run(1994b, pp. 18-19). In applying her reasoning to the WMA speech community,I agree that the immediate concern should be convincing parents and grandpar-ents of Apache children to speak to and teach them in their language.The above descriptions of language learning methods leads into a discus-sion next of what would be best for the WMAT to use for their language revital-ization efforts. De Reuse suggests a combination of grammar-translation andTPR for Western Apache, but I believe that the literacy aspects of our languagecan come at a later time when the basics of oral communication in the languagehave been accomplished. I agree with Hinton's assertion that,reading and writing even gets in the way of learning to speak becausethe words you are going to learn should be recorded in your mindaccording to sound, not according to some visual system....If you needreminders of what you are learning, use recordings. (1991, p. 35)1 suggest that a combination of CBI, MALLP, and immersion methodswould probably work best for the WMA language learners. Taking myself as anexample, I learned Spanish and English as my second and third languages byimmersion and communicative ways and the reading and written forms camelater. I recently learned to read and write my first language that I had spokenfluently all my life because I sensed the complexities involved that have nowbeen verified through experience. By these negative comments, I do not mean 1405 Teaching Indigenous Languagesto discourage others from attempting it and would encourage other native speak-ers to become literate in their languages because it is interesting, an advantage,and useful for creative writing and reading (and understanding) papers and bookswritten by anthropologists and others earlier this century who gathered infor-mation from native informants. I recommend that native language learners uti-lize immersion and communicative approaches as primary means of languageacquisition and to enhance language renewal.SummaryResearch on my thesis topic and composition of my master's thesis hasopened my eyes as a native speaker to the complexity and importance of lan-guage renewal efforts for our people. I have learned that there is controversy onlanguage-learning and linguistic theoretical methodologies because various dis-ciplines involved in the study of language have opposing views and arguments.What is most often forgotten is the perspective of those of us who are nativespeakers who should be helping shape the inquiry on issues of indigenous lan-guage revival.The results of the questions on language ideology from a small segment ofmy tribe revealed that they value their language and culture and that there aremany causal factors for the erosion and loss of their language and a rapid shiftto English. Therefore, I have proposed that holistic changes are necessary forApaches to reverse the effects of language shift although some of these factorsare beyond their control. This study also revealed that more research and studyon various language issues are crucial for the WMAT's initiation of languagerevitalization, maintenance, and preservation program planning.We have established that school-university-community (tribal) collabora-tion in language restoration are important components to enhance and supportthe efforts of tribes to preserve their languages and cultures. The systemic prob-lems of traditional education in this country is a major problem that adverselyaffects Native Americans everywhere. Reservation-wide solutions \"to fix\" thingsfrom tribal governments are crucial for the future of all. However, the types ofcollaboration in bilingual/bicultural education for our communities describedin this paper should be expanded and continued.Most native people have lived in both worlds successfully; they under-stand and respect other cultures and sometimes take the best from both worlds.Dominant society members can choose to do the same. In these collaborationswith non-indigenous linguists, educators, researchers, language experts, andothers, native people need culturally-sensitive outsiders who do not have thetunnel vision created by Western education and who understand and value ourdifferent cultures.

It describes the pilot research for the proposed project, the man-ner in which the project was designed and is being implemented, andthe project results. The Life Sciences Division of NASA has sponsored a number of programsfor Native Americans. NASA's overall education interest lays in the dissemina-tion of information and materials about space flight and new materials devel-oped at Argonne National Laboratory that could be featured in a project thattargeted Native Americans. The materials developed by Argonne were part ofthe Science Explorers Program, a program series sponsored by the US Depart-ment of Energy and developed in collaboration with Bill Kurtis for broadcastover the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). The program series was designedto encourage minority pre-college students to consider careers in science, aswell as to choose more math and science classes in junior and senior high school.The program has served well over 100,000 students.Up to now, the minority students targeted by this science program havebeen mostly African American and Hispanic attending urban schools. Lack offunding and interest in providing any portion of the video or accompanyingteacher's guide in an American Indian language limited the possibility of ex-tending this program to Native American students, especially those living ingeographically remote areas.In the past Los Alamos and Argonne have collaborated on a number ofscience education programs, notably, the National Teacher EnhancementProjecta project that sought to develop the professional and science knowl-edge skills of elementary teachers. The scope of this project was based on theexcellent track record of the Science Education team for conducting K- 12 sci-ence, mathematics, engineering, and technology education programs. LosAlamos contributes resources for conducting these programs for students andteachers in an effort to broaden the nation's pool of qualified personnel and topromote public understanding and appreciation of science. Its programs arelocal as well as national, but our special emphasis is the northern New Mexicoregion, with its rural geography and high minority populations. Our programsplace a special emphasis on including minorities and women in an effort tohelp them achieve equal representation in scientific fields. 5 -.,3144 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesOne regional underserved population that Los Alamos strives to reach isthe Native American. For Los Alamos this means the diverse population in theFour Corners Area composed of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado,with particular emphasis on the Navajo Nation, the eight northern Pueblos, andthe Mescalero Apache in southern New Mexico. Los Alamos National Labora-tory has developed special interest in and capability for developing programsand products that address the needs of Native Americans, including recognitionof the special constraints for science education in those cultures. This providedus with the motivation for conducting the work described in this paper.Our pilot project consisted of developing a video, \"In Search of a KillerVirus,\" and teacher's guide on the 1993 hantavirus outbreak in the Four Cor-ners area. The video presents a medical mystery and tells the story of how thevirus was identified and treated. The focus of the story is the medical commu-nity, both regionally and nationally, how their methods contributed to the even-tual understanding of the environmental and physiological reasons for the out-break, and what the impact was on the community culturally, socially, and eco-nomically. The video contains geographical footage of the beautiful landscapein the Gallup/Shiprock areas and interviews with people from the community,doctors and researchers from the medical centers and Centers for Disease Con-trol, political figures, and glimpses of cultural activities in the Navajo Nation.The teacher guide contains activities for students to do in their classrooms.Its focus is not for the students to discover the cause of the mystery deaths, butinstead for the students to work through and understand the process of discov-ering the cause. The activities lead students through an investigation illustrat-ing the real issues that scientists face. Students receive information in formssuch as medical charts and reports, similar to other scientists. The activitiesalso emphasize group work that is modeled after the approach taken by thepeople in many areas who had to work together to solve the mystery of thedisease.Site selectionLos Alamos chose the Navajo community for several reasons. First, thevideo focuses on the Four Corners area as the scene of the crisis. The Labora-tory works on an informal basis with the Navajo Nation and its entities, re-sponding to requests for technical assistance in a variety of areas, and this rela-tionship provides us with an opportunity to conduct a unique project that canserve a community not being served in the same way by other Laboratories.Second, among our criteria for conducting the work is the need for broad dis-semination of the translated material. We sought a language that could be writ-ten and had a formal alphabet. We felt that the many language differences amongthe pueblos would require development of several versions of the work andwould reach only very small populations. This created an equity issue for us intrying to conduct a manageable project where very little funding could have abroad impact. Currently, the pueblos have formal agreements with Los Alamosthrough signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOU's) for resources and 145I 5 D' Teaching Indigenous Languagestechnical assistance based on defined needs that exist as a result of the pueblos'proximity to the Laboratory.Some statistics estimate the number of people who speak fluent Navajo inthe Navajo Nation at about one third of the population. These statistics weretaken from the studies conducted with primary school age children by linguistsPaul Platero and Wayne Holm. We have learned that the Navajo Nation is grow-ing increasingly concerned that its students are losing their ability to speaktheir native language. Teachers of these students are currently involved in trans-lating curriculum into the Navajo language for more effective use in the class-room. We are particularly aware of the work being done through Headstart andin the health field. Through our experience working with schools and individu-als in the Navajo Nation through other programs, we are developing an under-standing of the needs of the Navajo students and their teachers. Our decision totranslate the work into Navajo was based on those factors.Project designThis project provides a model for how to conduct the work described andcan be applied wherever there are resources and motivation to accomplish thework. The project is constructed around the following elements:Content provided by the New Explorers video episode \"In Searchof a Killer Virus;\"Activities provided by the Teacher Guide of Activities created toaccompany the video; andAn interactive multimedia product featuring translated text, voice,and graphicsThe development of a translated version of those three elements comprises thebasis for the products. Each element complements the others in a classroomsetting where the teacher facilitates the lessons. One element will be a Navajointerpretation of the teacher guide in written form to accompany the Englishversion, and both will be used together in the classroom. A second element willbe the creation of a Navajo language voice track for the video to accompany theguide. The third element will be an interactive multimedia product that utilizesHyperstudio authoring software to create a \"stack\" of translated content. Thecontent is the basis of the curriculum guide used for science instruction of Na-tive American students in grades 7-10.RecruitmentThe work began through discussions with an advisory group of teachersfrom the public schools in the Navajo Nation. The purpose of the discussionswas to establish an approach for reaching individuals inside and outside thecommunity who had the skills required to become members of a translationteam. The development team would include teachers, scientists, and a scienceeducation expert who possess a combination of the following four characteris- 146 Teaching Indigenous Languagestics: expertise with curriculum development and classroom teaching, familiar-ity with Navajo students and their culture, fluency and literacy in Navajo andcan translate the language, and education technology expertise (using a com-puter).We placed advertisements for translators in the Navajo Times and GallupIndependent newspapers announcing the project and inviting applications. Se-lections were made from applicants who were classroom teachers, science edu-cation specialists, education supervisors, and language specialists with experi-ence in K-12 education. Elementary teachers were encouraged to apply, butpreference was given to middle and high school science teachers who met thecriteria, primarily because the teacher guide and video were geared toward thoseaudiences. Ultimately the team involved five individuals. Two are teachers inthe public schools, and one is a linguist working on a Ph.D. One team memberis a patient advocate and translates medical procedures. One is a farmer andbusinessman whose interests lay in working with language and projects forNavajo youth.ImplementationTeam members had to be willing to attend training sessions at Los AlamosNational Laboratory in the use of the teacher guide and video and in the use ofHyperstudio software. They had to commit to working on the translation anequivalent of three weeks, or 120 hours, with much of the work to be done ontheir own and turned in on a regular schedule. They also had to commit tomeeting at least once each month in Gallup for a consensus workshop. Theentire team reviewed the work they did and agreed on the best, most reasonableNavajo language interpretation of the English work.The team members received several benefits from their work on this project.Each member received a stipend and travel expenses for the work and a copy ofthe New Explorers video and teacher guide for their own use. To complete theproject each member received a gift of a computer outfitted with necessarysoftware, including a modem, from excess Laboratory equipment. An agree-ment was made between each team member and the school of their choice thatthe computers would be given to the schools to be used by teachers in theirclassrooms when the translation is done. The computer gift was arranged throughMOU's between the school districts and the Laboratory. In addition, each mem-ber received an account through the Laboratory to communicate with me andwith one another via e-mail. Team members were trained in the use of all theirequipment as well as in the use of the software. They were offered technicalassistance through the Laboratory in case they had problems during the project.The project actually began in late August, 1996. The timeline for the workwas adjusted because work could not begin until the funding actually arrived.This work proved to be challenging in many respects. The first challenge wasbringing together a team of diverse people from various locations across theNavajo Nation. We elected to meet on Saturdays because it was the best day foreveryone to be there since one of the teachers could not meet during the week. 147 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesSaturday, however, created a problem for the patient advocate because Satur-day sessions with patients had to be rescheduled for a busy Friday. For onemember, the issue was just commuting the distance to Gallup from deep withinthe reservation. Travel created special transportation problems for her. Furtherproblems arose as a result of the team members' inability to connect throughtheir modems to the Laboratory account. The lack of a telephone line to thehome was another problem for one team member.An ongoing challenge was the translation work itself. One significant as-pect of this work was reaching consensus about the interpretation. The transla-tion team chose to design the interpreted version as a companion guide writtenin Navajo to complement the English version, rather than annotating the En-glish version or translating only segments of the guide. They wanted to makethe interpreted version very usable for classroom teachers while maximizingthe impact of the activities for the students. The team addressed issues of howmuch to interpretall or only some partsand they concluded that the onlysections that would not be translated were the sections with instructions for theteachers. All student activities and process explanations were translated intoNavajo. The linguist tended to write longer, more complex sentences. The teammembers who are teachers strongly believed that the phrasing should be shortphrases, more informal, to match the way students and teachers interact in theclassroom. Much discussion resulted in consensus over these issues; however,because the theme of the teacher guide and video takes primarily a scientificperspective, the patient advocate and his particular style of interpretation be-came a standard for the group. This worked well because we wanted to keepthe material scientifically accurate while gearing it toward a lay audience. Us-ing interpretations of medical vocabulary and explanations for lay people al-lowed us to maintain a consistent tone to the interpretation.The team proved to be diverse in other ways, as well. Some members pre-ferred to do their translation using the traditional methodpen and paper. Theyvaried in their level of expertise and motivation in using the computer, prefer-ring to write first and later transfer the work onto the computer to save on adisk. An impact on the team members caused by using a computer and learninghow to create work in Clarisworks and Hyperstudio was that their proficiencygrew very rapidly and individuals reported increased enjoyment in doing thetedious work of translating.The video and guide presented certain interesting design problems thatcreated a cultural challenge to the team's ability to work with the original ma-terial. An example of this is the pervasive theme of death that appears in theteacher guide. There are pictures of skulls and a death figure marking certainsections in the English version. Another section features an activity that con-tains a chart describing students who have received gifts. The teachers on theteam felt that the activity holds little interest for Navajo students and was moreof a generic urban example. The team felt that a more culturally appropriateexample should be used, and they chose to redo the activity entirely for the 1 e2148 Teaching Indigenous Languagestranslated version. The team wrote into the companion guide opportunities todiscuss these differences in the classroom whenever appropriate.Pilot phase and evaluationThe translated products will be piloted in the schools of approximatelyfive teachers. Teachers who participate will receive computers with the appro-priate software to run Clarisworks and Hyperstudio. We intend to have the stu-dents actually develop their own Hyperstudio versions of the activities and tobe able to add graphics, photos, and voice to their customized versions. Thiswill be the one area where the technology and the curriculum will merge tobecome an interactive experience for the students. Teachers will use the mate-rials with their students and provide us with feedback on the usefulness of thosematerials. They will conduct class sessions using both the English version andthe Navajo versions, side by side. Here are some things we hope to learn aboutthe translated version:Is there consistent use of terminology and usage?Does the interpretation remain science oriented?Is the mystery of the story preserved?Is there interest in the mystery approach to solving problems?Does the interpretation correct wrong information? examples: mapof Navajo Nation and knowledge of hoganDoes the interpretation correct misconceptions of culture?Is the work pitched to a level appropriate for mid and high schoolstudents?Is the design well organized and usable?How important is a translated version of the video to using the guide?How useful?We will informally evaluate the material according to these categories:quality of the translation, cultural issues, learning points, and the equivalencebetween the written text and the video and voice script. Of particular interest iswhether the translated text provides the intended student involvement in thelessons. Which lessons generated the most interest in the students and why?Which lessons did the students find the most difficult and why? The informalevaluation will utilize questionnaires and classroom observations, with the feed-back used only to prepare a final version of the translation and not to judgestudent performance.ConclusionAs a means for interesting students in scientific fields, particularly medi-cine or laboratory research, the team felt that the subject of the video is bothappropriate and controversial. Hantavirus certainly is not a neutral topic, andfor that reason, it has generated wide debate among the translation team mem-bers. The debate revealed points of contention across all areas of the subject,149 16.3, Teaching Indigenous Languagesfrom culture to education, and presented us with ways to be creative in order toovercome some of the barriers we faced. One barrier was the diverse ways inwhich the team members were educated, and therefore, how they interpretedsome terms and concepts. Some were products of BIA schools, others publicschools, and some Christian schools. It also mattered what part of the Reserva-tion they were from, as to how they interpreted particular details. To speak ofbarriers, I would be suggesting that there were insurmountable issues to con-tend with, but this team of diverse Navajos was very collaborative. They sharedtheir interpretations as readily as they took turns reciting the blessing beforeour noon meals together. The key was the commitment everyone felt towardaccomplishing the task, as well as the fraternity of being together to do worth-while and needed work.As a model for conducting other projects of this type, I would recommendthat sufficient funding be sought to reasonably accomplish such a project. Inall, there were areas where additional funding would have allowed us the free-dom to extend work sessions, to give people more time to complete their workbefore such sessions, to offer more training, to put more equipment into theschools so that the students would have the benefit of experiencing the use oftechnology as they worked on this project, and to provide follow-up in theclassrooms for the project.In all, this project holds great potential for 1) contributing to Los Alamos'and Argonne's ability to encourage Native Americans to consider careers inscience through the use of the Science Explorers program; 2) providing re-sources to the Navajo Nation for the development of their science programsthrough the effective utilization of their native language skills, and 3) investingin product development that ultimately may generate resources and programsustainability for the Laboratories as well as the Navajo schools. Above all,despite the lack of resources, we found many ways to embellish the work tomake it more meaningful so that it can provide a richer experience for students. 4150 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesIncorporating Technologyinto a Hawaiian Language CurriculumMakalapua Ka `awa and Emily Hawkins This paper describes Hawaiian language courses developed atthe University of Hawai'i at Manoa that incorporate computer tech-nology in the teaching of Hawaiian language. The history of public education in Hawaii extends back to the time of theHawaiian monarchy. Public education at that time was conducted and adminis-tered in Hawaiian to a populace that had one of the highest levels of fluency inits native language. In 1896, however, the use of Hawaiian as a language of theclassroom was banned by law. What followed was the near extinction of thelanguage until 1978 when a constitutional amendment and related legislationestablished both English and Hawaiian as official languages of the State ofHawaii. Until 1986 when the restriction against Hawaiian as an instructionallanguage in public schools was removed by the legislature, it could only betaught as a \"foreign language\" and thus the strides made in learning it werelimited. In 1990 Congress passed the Native American Languages Act in rec-ognition that language is \"critical to the survival of cultural and political integ-rity of any people.\" These two moves have been instrumental in the reestab-lishment of Hawaiian as a language that has a greater chance of surviving thethreat that global English holds over all native languages.The `Aha Punana Leo started preschools in 1984 and the Hawaiian Lan-guage Immersion Program (HLIP) was established in 1987 for the purpose ofrevitalizing the Hawaiian speaking community and providing an opportunityfor Hawaiians to receive an education in their native language. Each year it hascontinued on to the next grade level with the Board of Education in 1992 giv-ing consent to continuing the HLIP through twelfth grade. Its effect on thecommunity and other Hawaiian language programs is remarkable. Communi-ties throughout the State continue to call for the opening of new immersionsites by the Department of Education. Enrollment in public school Hawaiianlanguage immersion programs has grown from 40 students in two schools in1987 to 1,208 students in eleven schools in 1996, along with 174 students ineight Hawaiian language preschools. More than 3,500 students are in non-im-mersion Hawaiian language programs in grades K-12 and more than 3,000 incommunity college and university programs. Enrollment in Hawaiian languageclasses on the nine campuses of the University of Hawai `i system has jumpedfrom 800 in 1985 to more than 2,000 in 1997. Both of the baccalaureate degreegranting sites at Hilo and Manoa have been unable to keep up with the demandfor classes and services. Hawaiian as a second language programs in both Ha- 151E Teaching Indigenous Languageswaiian public and private high schools have shown this same growth with over2,500 students now taking Hawaiian classes.Hawaiian is now frequently heard in gatherings of the Hawaiian commu-nity: at birthday parties, concerts, and sporting events to name a few places. Itis becoming possible to write checks in Hawaiian, buy goods in a large store,and order food at a restaurant with a Hawaiian speaking person. Revitalizationis evident to observers both within and outside the Hawaiian community.The role of the University of HawaiiThe University of Hawai `i is committed to extending Hawaiian languageeducation, especially the full development of Hawaiian immersion in the edu-cational system. The Hawaii Department of Education expects the Universityto be the primary agency to guide and assist all educational programs. In thateffort the University trains the teachers, conducts evaluations of the programs,prepares materials in various subjects and numerous reading textbooks, con-ducts classes for inservice teachers, and coordinates many activities with theschools. We are also providing language training to many students who willnever become teachers but will become parents, friends, and relatives to chil-dren who can now grow up speaking Hawaiian. Our commitments to teachingHawaiian include:provide pre-service and inservice trainingdevelop curriculumtrain curriculum language policy issuesdevelop proficiency guidelines and measuressupply a continuing source of Hawaiian speakersprovide venues for use of the languageTechnology is simply one of the tools with which we involve students andcommunity members in learning and using Hawaiian in their daily lives. It isalso a link with the culture that surrounds most of us today and which is soattractive to the younger generations. What we are presenting in this paper isthe utilization of technology that has been developed or implemented at theUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa. Technology has the potential to:document and promote culture and native speechhelp to revitalize languagepromote the status of the language as a viable medium of communica-tionexpand and strengthen Hawaiian language communities by creating anaudience and purpose for writing in Hawaiianmake Hawaiian language resources available beyond educational insti-tutions It;152 Teaching Indigenous Languagesexpedite production and distribution of relevant, quality Hawaiian lan-guage materials and resourcesprovide opportunities to create multimedia projectsexcite learners to become motivated, engaged in the learning processand producers in the target language. Aspects of multi-modal capabilityinclude integrated text, sound, and graphics which are suitable for arange of learner typesincrease student-student communication and collaborationenhance and expand instructional strategiesbuild upon/enhance existing and effective pedagogypromote literacy skillspromote computer literacy. Computers add to the study of Hawaiian,and computer skills that are learned transfer to other courses and as-pects of students' lives. In order to maximize computer literacy, a hands-on training component is built into the curriculum.Brief description of software/technologiesThe Hawaii Interactive Television System (HITS) provides four channelsof video and audio communication among the major Hawaiian islands for dis-tance learning. In addition electronic-mail is being used for communication.The Daedalus Integrated Writing Environment (DIWE 1.3) software promotesinteractive written discourse in a student centered learning environment, in-cluding \"real-time\" group/class discussion, and WRITE/RESPOND/INVENTstand-alone software encourages the writing process, with invent, prewrite, com-pose, and revise prompts. Activities are communicative in nature and stressfluency, rather than \"correct\" use of patterns. Students also use Adobe Pagemill(2.0) authoring software program for the World Wide Web, which easily buildsand previews texts, images, sounds, tables, animation, and links.Hawaiian 201/202Haw 201/202 is a writing intensive intermediate level course in Hawaiianoffered at the University of Hawaii at Manoa with regular once-a-week com-puter lab sessions. Technology-mediated activities in the course include:a. e-mail (Eudora): Class lists are formed with weekly communicationamong class members is required, ongoing collaboration on exploringcultural and contemporary issues and ongoing practice of analula (newgrammatical patterns) is desirable.b. Daedalus: weekly computer lab sessions to \"discuss\" topics and issuesof interest. The first few weeks activities are designed to get acquainted,therefore discussions focus on asking and responding to questions aboutfamily, interests, favorite places, food, music, pastimes, songs/musicalgroups, travel, movies, and so forth. Current and controversial topicsand issues include sovereignty, raising university tuition, racism (on cam-pus and in Hawaitourism, use of Hawaii Creole English (pidgin) in 153I S Teaching Indigenous Languagesschools and in community, gun control, water and land usage/rights, elec-tions, comparison of classes, campuses, college experiences, Hawaiianlanguage education, gambling, and so forth. During the entire class pe-riod, students are encouraged to write as much as possible, to ask (espe-cially to clarify ideas) and respond to questions, and to include as manyclassmates as possible in discussions. Smaller conferences are possiblefor more in-depth discussion.Sample assignments in Haw 201/202include:Describe your favorite place as colorfully as possible without tellingits name and exact location. Respond to your classmates questionsand inquire about their places.As the newly elected mayor of Honolulu, what are three major changesthat you'll immediately make? Respond to your classmates ideas andbe sure to defend your own proposals.Should a new four year university be built in West 0`ahu? Defendyour position and attempt to persuade those who have a different po-sition.c. Semester projects: Students research a Hawaiian topic of interest with aminimum of three drafts, including a detailed outline, bibliography, andthree to four typed pages of text with graphics. Using Pagemill, studentsdesign projects to be posted on the WWW. Oral presentations shareprojects with the class, where feedback is expected and revisions maytake place prior to final grading. Haw 201students' comments (12/96)include \"We 're learning to communicate in our own language and wehave to do it well. It's not a matter of just slapping some text on thepage\" and \"Hawaiian communication has always focused on beauty...Theweb allows for a spirituality, a beauty, to be conveyed as part of themessageit's not just naked ugly text.\"Hawaiian 301/302, 397, and 470Hawaiian301/302(HITS) is an advanced level Hawaiian language coursefor three credits that meets once a week for three hours.

Supported by aline item in the California State University budget, the Center's primary mission is to channel theresources of Humboldt State University to the diverse communities of Northern California, particu-larly the Native American Communities. The Center has been instrumental in increasing interest inIndian culture, history and language, especially as they relate to elementary and secondary educa-tion. In addition, the Center has assisted the development of several local non-profit agencies bycontributing small subsidies, providing in-kind support services and preparing funding proposals.For 20 years, the Center's major project has been the American Indian Language and Litera-ture Program, which coordinates the work of linguists, curriculum specialists, teachers, students andcommunity members in an effort to document and reinforce traditional Indian cultures of the area.The program provides linguistic documentation, curriculum development, teacher supervision andother technical support (including linguistic documentation and archiving) services required to pre-serve the languages of Northern California tribes. It presently sponsors classes in the Hupa, Yurok,To Iowa and Karuk languages at various sites in Humboldt, Del Norte and Siskiyou Counties.As part of the campus community, the Center for Indian Community Development workswith professors in the Ethnic Studies, Anthropology and Native American Studies departments indevelopment and implementation of the Center's American Indian Language and Literature Pro-gram. This joint effort has significantly enhanced linguistic documentation, archiving and curricu-lum development activities.The production of lessons, dictionaries, word-lists, collections of stories, cassette tapes,videos, and other materials useful to the language education is an important function of the Lan-guage Program. Several projects have been undertaken over the years; a series of lessons in Hupahave been developed around cassette tapes and will be suitable for high school and adult classes.Similar materials will be produced for ICarulc, Yurok as courses on these languages are introduced.Practical dictionaries have been created for Karuk, Hupa, and Totowa. \"Pocketbooks\"have been created for Karuk, Hupa and To Iowa-Collection of new information on Northwest California Indian Languages is also a highpriority of the Language Program. These languages are rapidly losing fluent traditional speakers,and unless data is collected now it will be impossible to prepare fully accurate and comprehensiveteaching materials. Furthermore, future efforts in language recovery as well as the general humanis-tic study of traditional Northwest California culture will need to rely on documentation gathered inthis generation. Obtaining accurate and extensive data on an Indian language requires a number ofhighly specialized skills, primarily those of linguists and lexicographers. CICD plans to contract theservices of trained professionals in these fields, both to gather and process materials directly andmore importantlyto train assistants from the Indian community to supplement and continue thework.In addition to meeting needs for cultural and educational programs, the Center is increas-ingly involved in business, economic, environmental, and social development activities. To developgreater participation in the free enterprise system, and consequently, we have identifies three world;to acquire the capital needed to start, buy out, expand, or \" save\" business through purchases oftangible business assets (land, buildings, equipment, inventory, etc.) and the provision of essentialworking capital; and to identify market opportunities and procure sales contacts that will ensuresuccessful participation and long-term survival in the free enterprise system.Ideally, assistance is provided to Indian tribes and community based organizations, both ofwhich represent constituent communities, if the business employs members of tribes or other Indiangroups; the business generates income to a tribe or other Indian group; or the business generatesbusiness for / purchases goods or services from other Indian-owned business. The Center for IndianCommunity Development is here to support the needs of Tribal Development, and continues to growwith their constituent communities. 159173BEST COPY AVAILABLE Teaching Indigenous Languages IT REALLY WORKS! NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL COMMUNICATION PROFICIENCY I,EA1P0004.0It Really Works!Native American CulturalComnnmication Proficiencyand A Hupa StoryBY Mt IMINIENTT Language can make people do things. Have you ever noticed how a warning, \"Don't do that,\" will typi-cally produce a response, \"Why not?\" in the one who was warned, perhaps prompting them to go ahead and tryexactly what they were told not to do?If so, you have witnessed the power of language. Language is communication. Someone saying, \"Don'tdo that,\" can produce the intended response or move someone to another action. In both cases, there is a relation-ship between language and action. I. First Principle: Native American Students Learn by Doing Native American Cultural Communication Proficiency involves communication and action. It is built onthe principle that students have to get out and do things. Students learn language through experience, throughexpressing feelings and ideas. They learn if what they say has consequences and what the consequences are,when they are actually communicating. They act out their words, they use actions to reinforce their words, andthey communicate with body language. This emphasis on doing is at the heart of the Total Physical Responsemethod, developed by James Asher for second languages.The Hupa Language Program also combines techniques from various other methods, such as Total Physi-cal Response. It also takes from Cooperative Learning, its emphasis on learning within peer groups.To practice this method, a group of students can get together and put on a scene from a traditional Hupastory. I will demonstrate:In this story, Xa:xowilwaff , a mother tells her young daughter, \"Don't dig the Indian potatoes when twoof the stalks grow together.\"Haya:I mine:jixomil And then, after a She 'Don't do it!' \"The girl proceeds to dig up a baby, who follows her back to the house, and for years after, and who has thename of Xa:xowilwa:tf', He-Was-Dug-Up.\" 1111.11.1\"..././411Y1111.1141Y11.1116.441.111141141111411/14114.111.11111171111111IPPIPIP11PVTIMMIPIPPIPIV111111,111rWrIPPIP\"111411W41 1.74160 Teaching Indigenous Languages 2IT REALLY WORKS! NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL COMMUNICATION PROFICIENCY When a group of students gets together, learns lines, and puts on a puppet play, they begin with key linesfrom the first scene, as in the above example, and they proceed from there. As they shape the scenes and practicetheir dialogue, they are cooperating with each other and learning by doing. Moreover, they succeed or fail as agroup, so that the outcomes effect everyone on the team, not just one person. II.Second Principle: Native American Students Learn in WaysCompatible with Their Culture The second principle, is that learning inside the classroom be compatible with what the students experiencein their communities. The puppet play Xa: xowilwa:tr is derived from a traditional Hupa story. Although pup-petry is a modem adaptation of the story, the story is an ancient Hupa practice. Since the Hupa people developedtheir language, storytelling has been the traditional way of passing knowledge, i.e., language and culture, toyounger generations.Students learn the story, and they learn some Hupa words. Learning Hupa words is necessary so that theycan tell part of the story in the Hupa language. Depending upon their level of proficiency, they learn character'snames in Hupa, expressions in Hupa, or sequences of dialogue in Hupa.Using a Native American languageis a big step for Cooperative Learninggroups. They work together to produce aplay, helping each other accomplish a groupgoal, and learning in the process of doingthe project.Cooperative learning, teamwork inaction, is compatible with patterns of Na-tive American (and other) children's playin their out-of-school environments, andwhen moved into the classroom, can in-crease achievement.Research on NativeAmerican children has shown that peer teamlearning can increase test scores on readingcomprehension. III. Third Principle: Native American Students Learn in Stages That students are at different levels of proficiency leads into the principle that students need to be intro-duced to lessons in stages. This idea has been developed in a method called, Communication-Based Instruction.In learning increasingly more difficult material, through this method, students advance step-by-step from onelevel to another. Students may begin with listening before they actually produce language themselves.A student moves step by step through a process, gradually taking on a greater role in responding. A seriesof lessons typically begin with a teacher presenting something that requires a yes or no response. A series will endwith the student producing words, phrases, and longer units of language themselves. 161(BEST COPY AVAILABLE Teaching Indigenous Languages IT REALLY WORKS! NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL COMMUNICATION PROFICIENCY 3 In sum, Cultural Communication Profiency draws on three different methods: Total Physical Response,Cooperative Learning, and Communication-Based Instruction. An integrative approach such as this has beenurged in a recent national conference on indigenous languages and is at the heart of research and cirriculumdeveloped at the Center for Indian Comunity Development. Philosophy Creating a relationship between language and experience reflects John Dewey's educational philosophy,and the idea that language is communication. language develops under conditions of living, generally those ofresistance and conflict. The relationship between language and experience can be played out in the classroom ina variety of ways, with students observing, thinking, and then getting what they need, using language. Lessonsare task-centered, with achievement being individual or based upon group rewards.Experience, as defined in the classroom, can refer to:1) the teacher's experience how the lesson is shaped to express the objectives the teacher wants to ac-complish2) the student's experiencehow achievement can be expressed through elicited responses and self-ex-pression3) the tribe's experiencehow language relates to the values of the tribal community whose language isbeing passed onWe aim for Cultural Communication Proficiency, and as we practice, we increase our skills. Lessons onthe story of Xa:xowilwa:tr (He Was Dug Up), the story of Cha'alrl Milk'idildin (Frog's Love Medicine) Hayde Me'ist, Native Language Bingo, and other lessonshave been developed, tried out, revised, and are currently being used. Native Language instruction for Califor-nia and other Native American tribes are developed through a model whereby lessons are developed in oneNative American language, and then adapted to others.

Understandinga Northern California Story111bhabilwilldlYbulblIbmigillillY11.141.11411.11 At the Center for Indian Community Development, we have implemented a cultural communication profi-ciency language that utilizes ethnographic research.This type of research seeks a cultural context. Introducing acontext increases the meaning of words and phrases in the Hupa language so that students can comunicate mes-sages. Communicating messages builds confidence. Self-confidence is an important goal of a methodology thatfocuses on communication because students are more likely to attempt to use language if they believe they have theability. This applies to all modes of language-learning, to speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Lessons that WorkSelf-confidence is related to the way that students are asked to learn new language. In a a book, Methodsthat Work,Jon Oiler has stressed two areas of importance in teaching language to Native American students, theuse of stories and activities.' With puppet plays, traditional stories can be turned into a group activity. Not only dolessons require students to take action, they can work together cooperatively. This encourages an environmentwhere all can learn: Cooperative learning aims to reestablish the valuesof cooperation... an accepting, cooperative atmo-sphere, free of cross-comparisons. In cooperative learning,all can succeed because each has something unique to con-tribute to the enterprise... Cooperative learning implies fullparticipation of both teacher and student and the interactionof student and student., Woo Offer. Method, th. Work: Ideas f Lisracy and lartpace Teutcrs Languages 2IT REALLY WORKS! NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL COMMUNICATION PROFICIENCY Cultural Communication for Native American Students Cooperative learning has been found to be more successful with Native American children than lecture-based approaches because their learning styles have been found to favor teamwork, and student-controlled coop-erative projects over an environment where individuals compete for the attention of the teacher? These methodsare successful for the reason that they adapt classroom modes of instruction to modes of communication thatprevail in Native American communities' Developing Language Proficiency that Prepares Students for Standarized Testing Finally, puppet plays of traditional stories introduce a literature-based curriculum. There is reason tointroduce literature into the curriculum, as there is recent research that students who are taught with a literature-based approach perform better on reading comprehension tests .5 The rationale is that since literature is composedof longer units of discourse than words, and represents various levels of organization, reading stories require a greater attention to the material, resulting in better performance when comprehension is being tested. Applications at Grade Levels This lesson has a variety of applications at various grade levels, aiming to build language skills, communi-cation skills, and increase self-confidence. In the earliest years, students get practice in pm-reading skills, such asdeveloping attention span. Storytelling with puppets allows for practice with hand-eye coordination, as studentsmanipulate the puppets themselves. As students progress through the grades, what is expected becomes morecomplex. In Kindergarten through grade 2, they may be able to learn the names of characters, and some of theactions. At this age, when they retell the story, they are likely to fill in with actions from their own experiencewhen they can't remember the plot. In grade 3 through grade 5, however, they have the language skills to retell thetraditional story. By junior high school, students can be introduced to storyteller's strategies to understand howstories communicate meaning. High school students can compare stories and discover how language communi-cates culture.This lesson is an example of the cultural communication proficiency method. The lesson uses the nativelanguages and stories that have been collected from elders. It incorporates linguistic documentation and archivingactivities within a teachable form so that tribal communities can have a lesson ready to use.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL COMMUNICATION PROFICIENCY 3 Cultural BackgroundHupa is spoken on the Hoopa Indian Reservation. Hupa is anAthabaskan language of Northwestern California. The Hupa language isclosely allied with Chilula and Whit kut, and to a lesser extent with otherCalifornia Athabaskan languages. The Hupa shared a lifestyle of fam-ily-centered subsistence utilizing the natural resources of their envi-ronment, and world-renewal ceremonial dances.The Hoopa Indian Reservation spans approximately 144square miles in northeast Humboldt County along the Trinity River. San Francisco lies 300 miles southwest,Eureka, 64 miles west. The boundaries of the reservation were established by Executive order on June 23,1876,pursuant to the Congressional Act of April 3,1864. Nature in this area offers acorn, salmon, and deer for food, avariety of plants for medicinal purposes, houses made of cedar planks, ceremonial regalia of hides, feathers, seeds,and shells, and basketry.The Hupa historically lived along the shores of the Trinity River.The reservation, which covers about half of their traditional territory, con-tains several ancient village sites, three reconstructed sites. The ancientvillage sites are where ceremonial dances are held. The villages were thecenter of a culture that included literature, art, and music.Takimilding, the village at the \"center of the world\" for the Hupa, isthe location of the Jump Dance, held every two years in late summer. Thisdance coincides with the White Deerskin Dance, also a world renewal dance.Takimilding, on the downriver side of the valley, and Me'dilding on the upriverside were the two most prominant villages. Brush dances are still held at both sites.Xa'xowilwa:t1' is a story from Diyshta:ng'a:ding, now a reconstructed Hupa village, located at the upper-most point on the Trinity River as it enters the Hoopa Valley. The storyteller from Diyshta:ng'a:ding who told thisstory said that his mother's family had told it as long the Hupa lived there. Cultural Context The cultural context is the traditional story of the Hupa, that includes characters from an earlier epoch inpre-history. These characters are the k'ixinay, spirits who inhabited the world before human beings. Althoughk'ixinay possess superhuman qualities, in many ways, their lives reflected a Hupa lifestyle.Hupa stories combine the ordinary with the extra-ordinary. The story of Xa:xowilwa:tl' features domesticlife in a family that consists of a grandmother, mother, and a son born from an Indian potato. Nurtured by hisgrandmother, Xa:xowilwa:tl' grows unusually fast, and learns to hunt. He follows his mother when she goes topick acorns. At the acorn grove he meets two young women. When he goes to their home, their father directs himto shoot a condor covered with dentalia, catch salmon-covered with dentalia, and to play a stick game wherethunder, moon, panther, and other players are competing. After winning at these events, he marries the two youngwomen. They are the morning and the evening star, and all three are here today, having been transformed fromk'ixinay to their present state. 110711\"10^411WWPrIPIPP\"11111111111,11\"7110\".1111\"WImIlIPPIPPIP11\",111 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 177 Teaching Indigenous Languages 0Ti' REALLY WORKS!

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL COMMUNICATION PROFICIENCY 15 (2) Teacher brings the groups together for a discussion of similarities and differences between the twostories. For example, both include the episode where there are two girls in an acorn grove, but the twoepisodes are handled differently. In Xa:xowilwa:tl' the two girls can't look at him because he is sobright. In Wana'tchuraiyuwek, his uncle Linnet precedes him to the acorn grove, and describes hisgood looks to the two girls. In the first example, the storyteller is making a metaphor in his descriptionthat connects Xa:xowilwa:tr with the sun and looks ahead to the Creation Motifeme at the end of thestory; in the second, he is describing one character through the behavior of another, and Linnet'sdescription of his nephew is also a reflection on his own reticence to become involved with the twogirls himself.(3) Teacher discusses the concepts of the characterization of He-Was-Dug-Up, and of the metaphors withthe students:In Xa:xowilwair , the description of him is metaphorical, he is being described like the sun. In addi-tion, his name is a metaphor: He-Was-Dug-Up is a metaphorical description of a birth. Also, in theHupa language, it is common for names to be descriptive: the names of chracters describe actions thatare The teacher discusses how the incidents in the acorn grove in the two story are different, and how thesedifferences reflect differences between storytellers, and to the extent that these storytellers reflect theirtribes, the differences in tribal cultures. Wana'tchuraiyuwek shows more restraint, Xa:xowilwa:trmore visual imagery.(5) The teacher discusses how this practice of naming shows how meaning is communicated in Hupaculture. She presents this as an example of cultural, or communal meaning, and asks them to thinkabout names in American culture, and the different ways that they communicate something aboutAmerican culture.(6) Students have the opportunity to discuss their own cultures as reflected in their home backgrounds.Teacher asks if any languages other than English are spoken in the home, and if so, how that changesthe communication in the home. Students can talk about subjects discussed in the other language, andnot in English, such as wanting to go and visit, or things that happened in this country long ago whenthe people lived there. Students can compare these stories with the traditional Native American story,for cultural differences and similarities.

While the New Zealand Government is currently spending mil-lions of dollars to teach the Maori language in preschool languagenests, Maori total immersion primary schools, and elsewhere, its lan-guage policies are not likely to succeed because it has failed to pro-moted Maori among Maori and non- Maori to the extent that the lan-guage has a sufficiently good image. The results of a market researchstudy and the promotion of the 1995 Maori Language Year indicatethat the passive tolerance of the Maori language by New Zealandersin contemporary New Zealand society will allow a more active andexplicit promotion of the Maori language. Maori today account for about 13% of the population in New Zealand. TheMaori language has been a minority language for over 130 years. Prior to WorldWar II the Maori language was the first language of Maori who largely lived inrural areas. After 1945 large scale urban migration occurred that led to a break-down in the transmitting of Maori from one generation to another. Maori chil-dren began to be raised as monolingual speakers of English (Chrisp, 1997, p.101). This is very significant because at this time about 60% of the Maori popu-lation was under the age of 20. In a linguistic survey completed in the 1970s, itwas clear that less than 20% of Maori could speak the Maori language. Despiteintensive Maori language revitalization efforts in the 1970s and 1980s, includ-ing the kohanga reo or preschool language nests and language radio stations,the latest Maori Language Commission survey conducted in 1995 shows thatthe number of fluent adult Maori speakers appears to have decreased consider-ably to about 10,000. Social changes in New Zealand's history, reflected inurbanization, television, industrialization, and intercultural marriages have all 220206o Teaching Indigenous Languagescontributed to the Maori language not being spoken in homes (Waitangi Tribu-nal Report, 1986, p. 16). The low social status of the language in the eyes of itsspeakers (Crowley, 1984) and the general New Zealand community has alsobeen a factor. In the 1990s Maori still remains an endangered language. Argu-ably, successful Maori language revitalization will depend, at least in part, onthe attitudes and commitment of Maori speakers as a whole to maintaining andrevitalizing the language in the home, in the neighborhood, in the community,and beyond. There is a real need to market the language to lift its social statusand to encourage a higher level of commitment from the largely elderly groupof native speakers and younger second language learners as well as the generalpopulation (Nicholson & Garland, 1991, p. 395).Marketing paradigmCooper (1985) outlines how language can be viewed as aproduct and com-bined with the appropriate promotion to the correct target audience along withappropriate distribution and price (costs in personal energy, potential ridiculefrom family and friends, and so forth). Language can be planned in a marketingframework to enhance its status. Like any product or service, its enhancementcan be planned and the first step in marketing a language, in this case the Maorilanguage, is the so-called situation analysis. Stated more simply, a situationanalysis is a review of the current status and circumstances for a product orservice. For the Maori language this will involve answering questions such ashow many New Zealanders speak the language fluently, how many understandit, who are these people, where do they live, where, when, and with whom dothey use the Maori language, and so forth. But equally important is to ascertainNew Zealanders' attitudes to the Maori language and its usage, for only whenthe magnitude of public support or public opposition to the advancement of theMaori language is known can the Maori Language Commission and other Maorilanguage planning agencies, including tribal agencies, correctly formulate theirmarketing strategies for revitalizing the language. \"Like all marketers, languageplanners must recognize, identify, or design products which the potential con-sumer will find attractive\" (Cooper, 1989, p. 73). Given the situation analysisof Maori language to date, there does not appear as yet to be Maori languageproducts that Maori are finding sufficiently attractive to buy that will changethe language's endangered status.Grin (1990) believes that the first goal of language policy should be toimprove considerably the image of a minority language:the minority language needs to have a sufficiently good image. Anylanguage policy that provides money, but avoids sincere commitmentto boosting the image of the language, is therefore likely to fail. Thereseems to be no way around this: for a minority language to survive, itsimage must be positive. (Grin, 1990, p. 71) 207?:2 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesIt can be argued that while the New Zealand Government is currently spendingmillions of dollars on kohanga reo, preschool language nests, kura kaupapaMaori total immersion primary schools, as well as other initiatives, its lan-guage policies are not likely to succeed because it has not promoted Maoriamong Maori and non-Maori to the extent that the language has a sufficientlygood image.The Welsh Language Board has recognized the importance of good publicrelations and effective marketing, namely, \"marrying the Board's strategy withthe wishes and activities of most of the Welsh populace\" (Welsh LanguageBoard, 1989, p. 2). A marketing program is seen as an indispensable part of anystrategy for the future of the Welsh language. It is also an indispensable part ofany strategy for the Maori language.Market research studyThis section draws heavily on an article written by the author and RonGarland entitled \"New Zealanders' Attitudes to the Revitalization of the MaoriLanguage\" (Nicholson & Garland, 1991). In 1990 a nationwide mail survey of225 New Zealand adults' opinions was held about the Maori language's role incontemporary society and the extent to which New Zealanders will committhemselves to fostering the language. Two specific research objectives were asfollows:to ascertain the extent to which Maori is spoken and understood byNew Zealand adults and thereby confirm or question previous esti-mates of competency in the Maori language.to gain insights into New Zealanders' attitudes to the current plightof the Maori language, its place in today's world and the level ofpersonal commitment of New Zealanders to the Maori language.(Nicholson & Garland, 1991, p. 397)The data collection procedure used for this research was a nationwide mailsurvey of a representative sample of New Zealanders aged 18 years and overrandomly selected from the electoral rolls. The survey instrument was a ques-tionnaire using closed questions, that is, it did not seek respondents' reasonsfor their stated answer. The response rate was 59%. The sex distribution was53% male and 47% female while the age distribution was 18-34 years, 27%;35-49 years, 34%; 50 years and over, 39%. Maori respondents represented 14%of the sample, non- Maori (mostly European) 86%; regional distribution wasAuckland (the largest city, 820,000 population), 22%; the remainder of the up-per North island, 22%; lower North Island, 22%; South Island, 34%.As expected, most respondents claimed little or no understanding of theMaori language. However, 3% of the sample listed themselves as fluent in Maori,which if correct and extrapolated to the New Zealand adult population yieldsapproximately 73,000 fluent speakers. This extrapolated figure is highly likelyto be greatly inflated because it is suspected that a higher proportion of Maori 2 2 2208 Teaching Indigenous Languagesspeakers than non-Maori speakers would have completed and returned the ques-tionnaire and it is possible that the self definition of fluency in Maori couldhave been overrated by some claimants. From the survey it is clear that theinitial revitalization of the Maori language lies with the Maori community; allthe fluent speakers of Maori were Maori and 88% of these fluent speakers wereaged 50 years or older.Table 1: The place of the Maori language in New Zealand today Does Maori languagehave df = 2, r = 0.18 Two thirds of the sample agreed that the Maori language has a place in con-temporary New Zealand society as demonstrated in Table 1. It is interesting tonote the clear trend of inverse relationship between age and support for thelanguage. Two thirds of the respondents acknowledged that the language has aplace in contemporary society and there is considerably more support for thisposition among younger New Zealanders. If the young adults of today continueto embrace this attitude of support into their old age then the outlook for theMaori language becomes more optimistic. No significant differences were notedfor the other variables of ethnic background, region, and sex.Of course, it is one thing to support an idea or situation but another toactually do something about it. Willingness to make a personal commitment toensure the survival of the Maori language saw nearly one third of the samplereply in the affirmative as shown in Table 2. Taken at face value, this resultwould equate to 782,000 New Zealand adults having at least some commit-ment to maintaining the Maori language. If we take the pessimistic view of allnon-respondents being negative towards Maori language revitalization, thisequates to 440,000 New Zealand adults (out of a possible 2,444,000) having atleast some commitment to ensuring the future of the Maori language.Table 2: Willingness to make a personal effort for Maori languagesurvival Willing > 0.30 2. c2= 137.73, df = 1, r = 0.00 BEST COPYAVA1LABLF2092 3 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesAs expected, Maori respondents showed a more positive attitude to theirlanguage's revitalization with 84% stating that they would be willing to make apersonal effort in this regard. This percentage equates to 180,000 Maori adults(At the 1986 Census, 405,000 people listed themselves as of Maori origin ordescent; 216,000 of these people were aged 18+ years). Age and gender ap-peared to have little bearing on personal commitment to the Maori language.However, the questionnaire did not specify what sort of personal effort wouldbe required, but given the usual biases attached to surveying in general andmail surveys in particular, it would be wise for policymakers to accept a lowerlevel of national commitment to revitalizing the Maori language than statedhere.Maori Language YearThe Maori Language Commission was established by the New ZealandGovernment in 1987. Promoting Maori as a living language is one of its majortasks. While the Commission initially undertook a number of promotional ac-tivities, sustained marketing of the language had been difficult owing to finan-cial constraints. The notion of a theme year came into being as a result of thesefinancial or budgetary constraints and also to assist an increase in status as wellas levels of knowledge and use of the Maori language (Chrisp, 1997, p. 101).The Commission focused on three main goals for Maori Language Year. 1.to encourage Maori people to learn and use the Maori language invarious daily activities2.to celebrate the place of the Maori language in New Zealand his-tory and modern society3.to generate and/or harness, and actively employ, goodwill towardsthe Maori language within the wider New Zealand population.It was acknowledged at the beginning that any results in terms of these goalsmay not be immediately evident but hopefully would emerge in the future.Maori Language Year was seen as a catalyst.It was, and still is, very difficult to judge the success or failure of the firstgoal, namely, whether more Maori are using more Maori language in variousdaily activities. One of the problems is that there was no baseline data about theamount and volume of Maori language used immediately prior to 1995 (Chrisp,1997, p. 104). It can, however, be agreed that Maori Language Year did creategreater opportunities for using Maori. A considerable number of Maori semi-nars or schools of learning were held by Maori family and tribal groups. Usefuldiscussions on intergenerational language transmission took place at these gath-erings, and special Maori Language Year events and activities provided oppor-tunities for using Maori language.The second goal focused on celebrating the place of the Maori language inNew Zealand history and modern society. A wide range of celebrations oc-curred. However, while celebrations and a positive environment for language 210224 Teaching Indigenous Languagesrevitalization are important, what is vital is that more Maori choose to speakMaori in their homes, neighborhoods, schools, and other domains.The third goal was generating and harnessing as well as actively employ-ing goodwill towards the Maori language within the wider New Zealand popu-lation. The Commission sought to establish relationships in the commercialand political worlds as well as with Government agencies and the media. Com-mercial sponsorship meant that the amount of money to support Maori lan-guage activities and events was greatly increased. Commercial organizationsbegan to see the benefits of targeting the Maori market using the Maori lan-guage. Senior politicians of all the political parties, including the Prime Minis-ter, discussed the Maori language and its contribution to New Zealand society.Some Government agencies actively supported the promotion. Again, all thesedevelopments, including greater media coverage, assisted the creation of a morepositive linguistic environment. Fishman (1991, p. 245), however, has describedsuch efforts as \"atmosphere effects\" in that they do little to focus on the majorissue of intergenerational language transmission. One of the challenges of thefuture, however, is to maintain and extend the goodwill created during the MaoriLanguage Year (Chrisp, 1997, p. 105). In the medium to long term it is stillpossible that the level of goodwill among the wider population can translateinto important political and financial support.ConclusionFrom the results of the market research study and the Maori LanguageYear promotion, it appears that the passive tolerance of New Zealanders to thepresence of the Maori language in contemporary New Zealand society willallow active and explicit promotion. While Maori Language Year in 1995 wascelebrated by a large number of New Zealanders, sustained longer term mar-keting of the language needs to be aimed at the Maori community. Fishmancomments that it is crucial for language revitalization that priorities are identi-fied in order \"to focus the meager resources that are available in as judicious away as possible\" (Fishman, 1990, p. 18). Given the importance of the languagebeing passed on in the home, neighborhood, and community, marketingintergenerational transmission could be an early priority. Older native speakersand younger language learners, including parents who send their children topreschool language nests and total immersion primary schools, could be en-couraged to transmit the Maori language. Younger people could be encouragedto become more committed to learning it so that the number of fluent speakersis lifted quickly. It can be argued that Maori language radio and television sta-tions could play an important role in marketing the language among Maorifamilies. Introducing a marketing perspective to the active promotion of theMaori language would attempt to take advantage of existing Maori supportfirst.Another possible early priority is to market intensively on a national scale\"the hoped-for benefits\" (Fishman, 1990, p. 18) of Maori language revitaliza-tion. Such a program could attempt to convince Maori and non-Maori that New 21122,6 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesZealand's most positive future will depend on successful revitalization of thelanguage. Boosting its image is also important (Grin, 1990), particularly if theinvestment already made by policymakers is to result in the 'hoped for ben-efits.' Undoubtedly, higher social status for the Maori language together witheffective language support programs could act as powerful incentives for trans-mitting the language from one generation to another as well as encouragingyoung people to use it (Muhlhausler, 1987).While the Maori Language Commission is well placed to assist with thedevelopment of national Maori language marketing strategies, tribal councilsand tribal language commissions will need to plan strategically the marketingof the Maori language at local or regional levels. Raising the image of the lan-guage will be important if those dollars already expended by the governmentand tribal bodies towards language revitalization are to be cost effective.The United States invented the mass-consumer. culture. Some of the topU.S. brand names are recognized worldwide: Coca-Cola, Kodak, McDonalds,or IBM. In marketing Maori language intergenerational transmission, or thehoped-for benefits, it will be necessary that any advertising or promotionalmaterial is liked by Maori and non-Maori. It must appeal to the Maori or non-Maori heart or emotions. The deft use of humor is a powerfully effective meansof marketing (Garnsey, 1997). In the cultural marketplace what we could endup selling is hope: hope that an endangered cultural treasure will be saved, thatan endangered language can be revitalized, and that Maori and non-Maori candwell peacefully together in New Zealandaffirming and valuing one another'slanguages and cultures.Kia ora ano tatou katoa.Greetings to us all.

Peterson This paper discusses the realities of radio in indigenous languagemaintenance with a case study of KTNN, a Navajo language station.The relationship between audience, language, and programming isanalyzed, and more effective uses of radio are suggested. Joshua Fishman (1991) and other scholars have noted the influence of themass media as a factor in language choice in the contemporary world. In Na-tive American communities, English-language videos, television, and popularmusic have replaced storytelling and other traditional medium, contributing tolanguage shift among many Native American youth. However, the last 20 yearshas also brought a growing number of indigenous-language media in the UnitedStates and Canada, especially radio. This paper discusses the realities of radio'srole in language maintenance using a case study of KTNN, the largest indig-enous-language commercial signal in the world, and suggests ways in whichradio can be utilized more effectively in Navajo-language maintenance.Allan Bell asserts that \"broadcast media play a multiple roleactive aswell as passivein language standardization...broadcast media reflect the lan-guage evaluations of the society at large\" (1983, p. 29). Standardization is afactor in language maintenance, yet Navajo has no accepted standard. How-ever, Navajo-language broadcasters and their audience are actively creating astandard through daily programs and subsequent spirited feedback. Bell con-tinues to say that \"broadcast speech is the most public of languages. Its hearersare the largest simultaneous audience of the spoken language\" (1983, p. 37).When discussing language maintenance, however, it is important to note whothe actual and intended audience is. My data indicate that Navajo announcersoften tailor their language to an older, monolingual audience and for variousreasons, younger Navajos do not actively seek out Navajo-language broadcasts.As the lack of younger listeners will impact the future of the language, therelationship between audience, language, and programming is analyzed below.Broadcasting in the Navajo language has been around for quite some time,although prior to 1972 it was limited to small program blocks on border-townstations (Keith, 1995, p. 9). In 1972, the first native-owned, native-languagestation in the country, KTDB, went on the air in Navajo from Pine Hill, NewMexico, to serve the Ramah Navajo Reservation. The current Navajo-languagemediascape includes several Navajo-language radio stations, both public andprivate, as well as regular programming on local Christian radio. Navajo tele-vision station NNTV 5 produces around 4-5 hours of Navajo-language pro-gramming per week, ranging from current events to live broadcasts of the Na- 214 Teaching Indigenous Languagesvajo Nation Tribal Council sessions. While an important aspect of Navajo lan-guage broadcasting, NNTV 5 was received by only 4,300 cable subscribers in1996, only a small fraction of an estimated population of 180,000. It was notuntil the establishment of KTNN Radio in 1986 that Navajo-language program-ming reached the entire Navajo Nation and speakers of all variations of Na-vajo.KTNN AM 660It has been observed that indigenous people around the world establishtheir own media \"to preserve and restore an indigenous language, to improvethe self-image of the minority, and to change the negative impressions of theminority that are held by members of the majority culture\" (Browne, 1996, p.59). In the Navajo case, communication in the native language among a widely-dispersed population was a major factor in the Nation applying for and receiv-ing a broadcast license. KTNN's mission statement emphasizes these points:\"This will be the first station that will be owned by, and for the benefit of, theNavajo Nation. The programming will emphasize the Navajo culture and life-style on the reservation and will in large part be broadcast in the Navajo lan-guage\" (Fisher, et al., 1981).KTNN's 50,000 watt clear signal allows it to broadcast well beyond Na-vajo Nation borders, especially at night, reaching cities as far away as Phoenixand Albuquerque. KTNN's broadcast range and position as \"The Voice of theNavajo Nation\" (owned by the Nation) gives KTNN what Pierre Bourdieu (1991)has termed the \"symbolic\" power to affect linguistic change, as well as theunenviable position of being held to a high language standard, even where nosuch \"standard\" exists. In terms of language maintenance, KTNN is the single-most important broadcaster of the Navajo language.Audience and programmingAlthough KTNN has the potential to reach most Navajo speakers, that doesnot mean that they all tune in. In the context of language maintenance, it isimportant to have a wide and diverse audience; however, the audience is deter-mined in part by programming, i.e. the need or desire to listen to Navajo-lan-guage programs. KTNN's position as a commercial station, however, requiresthat programming be funded through advertising revenue. This means that whatis best for the language or language maintenance is not always considered, asadvertisers cater to those they perceive as holding the purse stringsin thiscase parents and grandparents.KTNN has a Country & Western music format \"which fits the life-styleout here on the Reservation\" (K.C.); it also plays traditional and contemporaryNative American music in regular rotation. Although KTNN is a for-profit com-mercial radio station, it is bound to serve the needs of the Navajo people withbilingual broadcasts of news, livestock reports, the President's report, and pub-lic service announcements (PSAs) for ceremonies, Chapter meetings, and com-munity events. The music is geared for the 21-60 age group, and the Navajo Teaching Indigenous Languagesnews and livestock reports are of interest mainly to older Navajos. The PSAsattract a wide range of listeners, and \"when kids want to find out if school isclosed, they'll listen\" (K.C.). KTNN's C&W format, however, does not thetastes of many younger Navajos, and they associate KTNN with \"Johns\" (aderogatory term for Navajos, especially older Navajos, who are perceived to beneither traditional nor assimilated, live in the \"sticks,\" and speak English witha pronounced accent, i.e., \"backwoods\" B.K.). Therefore, many youth do notwillingly tune in to KTNN's Navajo broadcasts, \"but if they're stuck at homeor in the truck with grandma or their parents, then they have to listen\" (K.C.).Some programs, such as sports broadcasts, which may seem youth-orientedactually are not:Broadcasting play by play came about when a lot of our elderswere...calling us at KTNN and saying, \"Hey, why don't you guys doit in Navajo? There's a lot of us who are back at home that would liketo know how our grandkids are doing at basketball tournaments.\" Sowhen we're talking we talk about the directions in a game, the 3 pointline...we educate our elders about the game. (R.B.)Sports play-by-play broadcasts are, however, one way in that KTNN's pro-gramming finds new uses for the Navajo language. At the same time, Navajonews broadcasts and feature stories keep the language relevant in the contem-porary world. There is also programming designed for the youth, featuring \"ur-ban\" and dance music. These shows, however, are broadcast in English.Contributing to the lack of a wide youth audience during Navajo broad-casts is the fact that many younger listeners may not understand the more \"tra-ditional\" Navajo used by some of KTNN's announcers, many of whom cater toan older, monolingual population: \"In my mind there are elderly people listen-ing to KTNN, a lot of people who don't speak English listening to KTNN, sotherefore they are primary in my mind when I translate from English into Na-vajo\" (M.G.). They talk of listeners \"in the remote areas,\" the hogan level,\"or \"out on the Rez.\" Therefore, announcers try to speak accordingly. However,as announcer M.G., who is in his 40s, put it: \"To continuously talk Navajo at alevel where the elders are able to understand is sometimes difficult, and with-out using the slang...that's hard.\"LanguageFormer program director T.Y. put it best when he said that \"one of thebiggest issues now facing KTNN is trying to define the type of Navajo thatshould be spoken.\" Changes in the Navajo language as a result of broadcasting,such as the constant use of English terms, can have wide-reaching implicationsin language maintenance. Furthermore, announcers must alter their speech fordifferent audiences, whether using more slang or more \"traditional\" terms. Thesefactors result in a spirited dialogue between broadcasters and audience on\"proper\" on-air language. However, even when \"proper\" language is used, prob- 21640 Teaching Indigenous Languageslems still arise: \"I find that no matter how descriptive you are in a story, there isalways somebody who does not quite understand what you just said. They havetheir own interpretations\" (J. B.).The data indicate that KTNN's unique position as a commercial radio sta-tion broadcasting in an indigenous language requires subtle changes in the waythe Navajo language is used on the air. This type of Navajo has been describedby my consultants as \"Broadcast Navajo\": \"Yeah, Broadcast Navajo is differ-ent. Broadcast Navajo is a way of speaking Navajo at a level where it's briefand to the point, because of the Navajo language being so difficult\" (T.Y.).Another consultant told me that \"when you use the 'formal' Navajo with thebig vocabulary, it takes about twice as long to say something than with the`newer' Navajo. We call that 'Broadcast Navajo' for our purposes here, be-cause we have to shorten everything up\" (K.C.). Navajo is a very descriptivelanguage and is not easily adjusted to fit the time constraints of 30 secondcommercials and other unique requirements of entertainment radio, especiallysince most of KTNN's Navajo-language programming is interpreted directlyfrom written English copy. \"To find DJs to speak this type of Navajo on theradio is difficult\" (T.Y.).Many of the DJs at KTNN find it necessary to codeswitch (use Englishterms) even where there is a \"traditional\" Navajo term available. For example,when faced with making a 30-second commercial, it is quicker for an announcerto say \"Window Rock\" than Tseghahoodzcini; furthermore, it is possible thatneither the announcer nor some members of the audience will know the Navajoname for Window Rock or other locations. Codeswitching among KTNN DJsis especially apparent with numbers, place names, addresses, and consumergoods, resulting in a great number of listener complaints. Broadcast Navajo isfurther characterized by speaking quickly using fillers such as efyci and ticid66and incorrect, direct translations from English.Scholars have noted that \"the public is ultrasensitive about broadcastlanguage...accusations that certain broadcasters speak incorrectly are a famil-iar listener response, usually accompanied by praise for other broadcasters whoare held up as models of good speech\" (Bell, 1983, p. 38). This appears to holdtrue for the Navajo case as well. Listener complaints about Broadcast Navajofar outnumber any other listener response, and they can be passionate: \"Why isthis morning guy still on the air? He can't even speak his own language!\" (1994Letter). \"We've been criticized for slaughtering the language.... our purpose isobviously to keep the language alive, but how are we keeping it alive is a ques-tion, because of the grammar usage and the lack of knowledge of all the words\"(K.C.). Many of these complaints are owing to factors mentioned above, in-cluding Navajo and English fluency, domain knowledge, and so forth. How-ever, for Navajowhere there is no official standardmany complaints aresimply caused by regional differences in the language:What else have we gotten complaints about.... the way we mispro-nounce words. There's different dialects across the Reservation, and 217231 Teaching Indigenous Languagessome of our announcers are from the western region and some arefrom the eastern region, and the same word can be pronounced twodifferent ways. And somebody inevitably will have a complaint thatwe didn't put the right inflection on it or it has a different meaningfrom one region to the next. (K.C.)Newscaster J.B. gave me the following examples:Todilchxdshi is one example. When I talk about 'pop,' I saytoclikhxdshi, which means 'the water that bubbles.' But in Gallup area,I notice that they say tolikant, 'the sweet water, the tasty water.' That'show they say it. And we say dam6o ydzid for Saturday ['little Sun-day'], and some people say yiskk damoo, which means 'tomorrow isSunday.' We just have different translations all the way across. One ofour DJs, when he says land, he says heya. I say keya. But he meanskEyah. But to me, that's the way he talks, that's his language.From a language maintenance standpoint, many of the complaints men-tioned above are legitimate. For example, continued use of English for placenames, numbers, and consumer goods will likely aid in the demise of theirNavajo equivalents. However, issues relating to regional dialects are more con-tentious and may or may not be solved with a Broadcast Navajo standard.Language standardsThe way in which KTNN's DJs adapt the Navajo language to a radio for-mat is largely individual choice, based in part on language ability in both En-glish and Navajo, domain knowledge, and their level of experience with radiobroadcasting. This, of course, leads to a wide variation in broadcast language.KTNN staff and management discuss the language issue at almost every meet-ing and have mentioned standardization, but,it's hard for us to standardize the Navajo language in a manual that weall take a look at. We've talked about that, and we've talked with Na-vajo Community College and Rough Rock Demonstration School onhelping us come closer to the meanings, but we haven't really beenable to formalize anything yet, because it takes time and money to dothat. (K.C.)Without an official standard to follow, other methods to determine \"cor-rect\" or accepted language use must be found by Navajo-language broadcast-ers. Browne (1996) notes that when language questions arise, indigenous broad-caster seek help from official outlets such as language commissions, individualexperts, or requests to the audience for help. Newscaster J.B. and longtimeannouncer S.R. were constantly cited as being the Navajo-language experts atKTNN (even though they spoke different regional dialects). J.B. said she has2 o 2 218 Teaching Indigenous Languagesconsulted elders or respected Council delegates herself for language advice.However, being \"traditional\" or an elder does not make one the best languageconsultant: Sportscaster R.B. told me that she could not rely on her grandpar-ents for proper terminology and description for basketball play-by-plays \"be-cause they don't really know the sport of basketball. But the younger genera-tion, they do.\"Audience members offer suggestions on language use; one consultant notedthat \"if they hear you say something wrong, they'll come up and tell you, 'Don'tyou think it would be easier to describe it like this?'\" (R.B.). J.B. gave me thisexample of audience oversight:Well, there was one time I lost the word for 'uncle,' and I was talkingabout this person in a story whose uncle had some kind of dealIforget what the subject matter wasbut I was at a loss for the worduncle. This was a boy to an uncle. And so I was trying to figure outwhat was the word, what was the proper language when I was readingit, and I kind of... bik'is is what I said, which is a brother. And so thenthe person called me and left a message on the phone and said theright language was bidc17.This dialogue between announcers and audienceand between the broadcast-ers themselvesis a sign that language is vital and alive: \"People listen.That [audience feedback] tells me they are listening and it is a serious matter\"(J.B.). The recursive relationship between audience, broadcasters, language,and programming is also creating a standard for Broadcast Navajo. Whether ornot a standard is needed may never be answered, but Navajo speakers obvi-ously are passionate about \"correct\" language use and expect their broadcast-ers to uphold those ideals. When asked who is the final authority on correct on-air language use, however, one announcer replied: \"My God. I guess whoever'stalking, which would be us...I guess\" (R.B.).Programming for the futureIn order to address KTNN's responsibility towards the Navajo languageand to foster a younger audience, regular language instruction programmingcould be developed. This programming should be planned in conjunction withNavajo language instructors in schools and universities and partially utilizeKTNN's existing sports and entertainment broadcasts as a vehicle of instruc-tion (i.e., develop pamphlets with basketball and football terminology in Na-vajo so students can follow play-by-play). Furthermore, entertainment and musicprogramming in the Navajo language geared towards youth could be imple-mented. Younger Navajo speakers should be the announcers and should be al-lowed to speak their own version of Navajo (with slang).There is probably no perfect way to appease all of KTNN's listeners. None-theless, KTNN's announcers are held to a higher standard of the Navajo lan-guage, and KTNN has a responsibility towards the language. Therefore, sev- 219233 Teaching Indigenous Languageseral actions could be taken: 1) Standardize frequently-encountered terminol-ogy in news and entertainment, agreed upon by speakers from all parts of theNavajo Nation, 2) Require announcers to improve language skills in both Na-vajo and English when needed as a condition for continued employment, 3)Log specific, legitimate listener complaints about Broadcast Navajo and utilizethem in future language planning and standardization, and 4) Secure grant moneyfor this on the basis of maintaining a Native language in the modern world.ConclusionIn today's world, commercial radio is a necessary and viable communica-tion outlet for the Navajo language. Commercial radio helps keep the Navajolanguage alive in many domains with news, sports, and public service broad-casting. It also provides positive exposure for the Navajo people and all NativeAmericans. However, commercial radio affects the way Navajo is spoken onthe air by DJs and announcers, creating peculiar type of Navajo defined \"Broadcast Navajo.\" KTNN helps perpetuate the Navajo \"simplyby keeping it out there on the air\" (K.C.). However, it is also changing thelanguage. Whether these language changes are being adopted by KTNN's au-dience would require a much deeper study. If one of KTNN's main goals is thepreservation and perpetuation of the Navajo language, then two issues need tobe addressed. First, it should be determined if a standard needs to be created forthe use of the Navajo language in the electronic media; and second, a way mustbe found to attract the younger generation of Navajos to Navajo-language broad-casts.

Albuquerque, NM: University Teaching Wordpath Society (IWS) is a nonprofit educationalcorporation formed to promote the teaching, status, awareness, anduse of Oklahoma Indian languages. The Society produces Wordpath, aweekly 30 minute public access television show about Oklahoma In-dian languages and the people who are teaching and preserving them.There are cable television companies all across the United States thatoffer some form of public access. The Federal Communications Com-mission requires cable companies to make their facilities and airwavesavailable to the public in exchange for having a monopoly on the cablein their local area. This public access may involve the right to airprograms on a certain channel during certain hours; it may also in-volve the right to use studio facilities to produce programs. This ac-cess is offered for a low fee or no fee. This paper describes IWS use ofpublic access television to promote Oklahoma's indigenous languages. In Norman, Oklahoma, the local cable company, Multimedia Cablevision,supports an active program that truly serves the community and is completelyfree. The program is called Wordpath, and it is a part of the Community Pro-ducers Workshop. Any Norman resident aged 18 or over can join the Workshopby taking a free training class at the studio which lasts a few hours and gives anoverview of the facilities and the Workshop. At the end of the class, partici-pants get a \"Community Producer\" (CP) card that entitles them to serve on thecrews of existing community programs and use the studio's facilities to pro-duce a new program of their own under the supervision of studio staff. Furthertraining and certification are available from studio staff in electronic field pro-duction (remote shoots) and editing.Community Producers can use a professional television studio equippedwith sound and lighting systems, graphics computers, an audio board, a videoswitching board, and a digital video effects machine, as well as dubbing andediting bays. Once certified, CPs may check out equipment to shoot programsat remote sites; this includes a high quality Hi-8 camera, microphones, andlighting equipment. The resulting programs air on the local cable channel only,which reaches 20,000 households in the Norman area. Shows may also be dis-tributed for nonprofit purposes (some are broadcast in other areas in their pub-lic access programs). No production for commercial purposes is allowed.I joined the Community Producers Workshop in 1995 with no video expe-rience whatever, and began serving on the crew of some of the existing showsto develop my skills. I began as a cameraperson and went on to do floor manag- ko A., -V222 Teaching Indigenous Languagesing, audio, computer graphics, and directing. When I felt ready, I began to pro-duce Wordpath.Goals of the Wordpath showWe have produced 32 shows so far (see Appendix A), and recently re-ceived funding from the Oklahoma Foundation for the Humanities and the En-dangered Language Fund to produce another 17 (see Appendix B). The goalsof the program are:to raise the consciousness and appreciation of the general public forIndian languagesto share information by announcing classes, conferences, and grantsand by demonstrating methodologies and technologiesto create language materials for classrooms and archivesto honor language preservationistsincluding teachers and studentsEventually, we hope to tape about 75 programs, including at least one for eachof the 27 Oklahoma Indian languages still spoken or being revived. Our Okla-homa Foundation for the Humanities grant will allow us to copy programs andplace them in four libraries around the state of Oklahoma, so that people out-side Norman or without cable will be able to see them.The structure of the Wordpath showWe shoot in the studio on Thursday evenings (except when taping a showat a remote location). Our shows then air the following week. I have taped aone minute introduction over which we roll the show title and opening creditsand a one minute \"outro\" over which we roll closing credits (personnel, copy-right information, and so forth). A typical studio show is essentially an inter-view between one or more guests and me. We may begin with a few announce-ments, and then I introduce the guests. I always ask them how one greets some-one in their language. Then they tell about their personal background and whytheir language is so important to them. If they are involved in classes, I givethem an opportunity to give dates and times. Often guests will tell a story orsing a song in their language (these segments can be used in classes later).Sometimes we tape a program on location, such as at a university, public school,or community language class or in a guest's home or other location of theirchoice. In these cases, I edit the tape myself and usually add a brief introduc-tion shot in the studio. The guests receive a copy of the completed show. Peri-odically I do a solo show on a linguistic topic, such as the structure of a particu-lar language or the commonalties of languages, such as borrowing, languagefamilies, teaching methods, and so forth.Our crew consists of other CPs who have taken the introductory class atthe studio and have an interest in the show. I have made a special effort torecruit Native Americans, especially targeting Oklahoma Indian tribes. I useannouncements and fliers to Indian language classes at the University of Okla- 22323\" Teaching Indigenous Languageshoma, Indian art galleries, and newspaper publicity in the hope that some ofthese recruits will go on to produce programs in their own communities. Rightnow our crew is about 60% Oklahoma Indian and includes both novices andexperts in video production.In the future, we will experiment with some more innovative formats. OurEndangered Language Fund grant is to develop two mini-dramas in Indian lan-guages. We plan to have native speakers of Oklahoma Indian languages plan,write, and act minidramas that will fit into our 1/2 hour slot. One will be inCreek and one in Choctaw. We will include a subtitled version in the Wordpathbroadcast and make both the subtitled and unsubtitled versions available to theparticipants' tribes and to public libraries in their areas. We hope this will in-spire more Oklahomans to make language tapes entirely in their tribal languages,both for the entertainment of fluent speakers and for use in language classes.Why do this?We feel good about the response to the Wordpath programs so far. Basedon comments from the public, I believe that people in Norman are becomingmore aware and appreciative of Indian languages. The show has also been verysatisfying and educational for me; I have met a lot of people from all over thestate who are involved in Indian language work. They peeked in on classes inIndian languages and gained a deeper understanding of the connections be-tween language and culture. The guests have enjoyed being on the show andhaving the tape afterwards to share with family, friends, and students. Some ofthe stories we have recorded during Wordpath shows have been used to en-hance language classes. I think the television experience has helped to build theself-confidence of some of the newer teachers. Students have felt good whenthey saw themselves on the program, and their family and friends have beenproud of them. Our crew has benefited by receiving free technical training andby the contacts they have made with each other and with the guests. At leastone crew member has gone on to use her skills producing a cultural program inher own community. Teachers have enjoyed seeing their colleagues' shows,and getting ideas they may use in their own classrooms. And, we have all had alot of fun with the productions, so everyone has benefited.I urge all of you to look into the possibilities of doing language video tapesin your own communities. If you live in a small rural community without acable company, see if there is someone in your tribe who is working or study-ing in an urban area that has a public access cable program. It is a good, inex-pensive way to produce teaching materials, honor fluent speakers and teachers,and make the public aware of the importance and the beauty of Indian lan-guages.

Today the Echota are 22,000 strong with a TribalCouncil that administers tribal lands, supports a dance team, pub-lishes a newsletter, and supervises an excellent Indian Education pro-gram. Among the objectives of the tribe's ongoing program of culturalpreservation and renewal is a desire to reacquire the Cherokee lan-guage. The tribe, joined in an effort with Auburn University, seeks toestablish a database on tribal language resources and attitudes. Theultimate goal of Echota leaders is to offer instruction in the Cherokeelanguage through the Alabama public school system. To design a lan-guage program to meet the desires and needs of the Echota commu-nity a survey was designed to gather information on Native Americanlanguage knowledge, language attitudes, and potential language use.This baseline survey forms part of the initial stage of the Echota Chero-kee language project. As such, it will lay the ground work for the lan-guage revitalization efforts to follow. After the survey has been com-pleted, the project leaders will have a reliable measure of Cherokeelanguage use among tribal members and an estimate of the extent ofsupport that the project will receive. Members of the Echota Cherokee tribe trace their ancestry through theChickamagua Cherokee, who seceded from the Cherokee Nation in 1777 overland cession issues. Older chiefs in favor of peace signed a treaty ceding a vasttract of Cherokee land to the state of South Carolina. Younger \"rebellious\"chiefs favored resistance to white encroachment. Refugees from South Caro-lina and dissidents led by these young chiefs established a settlement atChickamagua Creek, in Southeastern Tennessee. By the year 1817 the U.S.Government recognized these Chickamagua as a separate Cherokee commu-nity.Twelve years later tribal activities were driven underground by legislationenacted by the state of Alabama. This legislation outlawed Native Americangovernment, voided all contracts made with native Americans canceling alldebts owed them, and made it illegal for Native Americans to testify in courtagainst white people. Even though the U.S. Supreme Court ruled some of theselaws unconstitutional, President Andrew Jackson refused to enforce the ruling,effectively sealing the fate of the Cherokee people. In 1838, after exhaustiveefforts to change the removal treaty of New Echota, forced removal began andthe bulk of the Cherokee Nation embarked upon the infamous Trail of Tears. 228242 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThe U.S. Government took the position that all Cherokee were removed toOklahoma, however reservees, that is individual members of the ChickamaguaCherokee tribe who had been guaranteed land allotments under previous trea-ties, retained their properties. Many of these reservees were able to providerefuge for other Cherokees who had escaped removal. These ChickamaguaCherokee continued to be listed on tribal rolls; however, the severe social andeconomic costs of publicly acknowledging Native American identity compelledmany to conceal their heritage. There is evidence that a sizable number of Chero-kee remained in Alabama. The Hester Roll of 1884 documents only 17 Chero-kee living in Alabama, and the 1910 U.S. Census listed only nine, yet a court ofclaims application in that same year documents a population of hundreds ofCherokee living in Alabama.Today there are approximately 22,000 descendants of these Chickamaguaand of the Cherokee refugees to whom they gave sanctuary living throughoutthe state. In 1980, these descendants reorganized under the name Echota Chero-kee. The word Echota was chosen because it represents a Cherokee place ofsanctuary and renewal. The Davis-Strong act of 1984 designated the Echota asa state recognized tribe. The tribal council administers tribal lands, supports theEchota dance team, and publishes a tribal newsletter. The tribe also supervisesthe Lawrence County Title IV Indian Education Program, which has receivednational recognition by governmental review boards as an Exemplary Program.Among the many objectives of the tribe's ongoing program of cultural pres-ervation and renewal is a desire to reacquire the Cherokee language. The tribe,joined in an effort with Auburn University, seeks to establish a database ontribal language resources and attitudes. The ultimate goal is to provide a knowl-edge base for Cherokee Revival in Alabama.In order to design a maximally effective language program, the linguisticattitudes, needs, and desires of the Echota community must be identified. Dr.Robin Sabino, linguist at Auburn University associated with the Echota project,contacted me about designing a baseline survey that will meet these severalneeds for Alabama's largest Indian tribe. With the help of Dr. Sabino, colleaguesin the sociology department, and members of the Echota tribe, I constructed athree page questionnaire to gather information on Cherokee language knowl-edge, Echota language attitudes, and potential Cherokee language use in Ala-bama. The survey has recently been mailed with the monthly tribal newsletterto the six Indian education programs for distribution to students' families. Par-ticipation is voluntary, although encouraged by the tribal council. Echota Language SurveyThis paper discusses the survey design and the implications of the datagathered by the pretest for the future of the Echota language project. As Crawford(1996) so aptly pointed out, if language shift reflects a change in societal andcultural values, then efforts to reverse language shifts must also consider these 229243 Teaching Indigenous Languagessame values. Thus, from a broader perspective, it is important to inquire intothe change in values that have placed the Echota upon the path to linguistic andcultural renewal. In this sense, the Echota survey (see Appendix) and the datagathered as a result of the survey will contribute to the overall body of informa-tion on assessment of linguistic attitudes.Most Echota do not speak Cherokee, but each tribal member's input isimportant in order to design a program to best meet the needs of the entire tribe.In addition, some in the tribe have special language knowledge. For example,some members have living memory of the Cherokee language being spoken intheir homes.Purposes, goals, and rationale of the surveyBecause we expect that the survey will identify individuals whose knowl-edge will be especially valuable to the tribe's effort, there is a space on eachsurvey for tribal affiliation and role number. This will provide a way for theTribal Council to contact these persons and request a follow up interview viatelephone or in person. However, filling out the questionnaire does not obligateanyone to an interview. Anonymity will be preserved because I have not re-quested access to tribal roles. Because of the excellent working relationshipbetween the University and the tribe, the tribe has agreed to make initial con-tact with those individuals who might provide useful follow up information.Thus, from my perspective, the questionnaires are anonymous.The primary purpose of this survey is to assess the current knowledge andopinions of the Echota Cherokee of Alabama about their ancestral language,and to investigate the current status of the Cherokee language in terms of itsuse among the Echota. It is also important to determine the attitudes of tribalmembers toward the Cherokee language itself and its symbolic connotation fortheir own cultural identity.The survey questionsIn this section I discuss survey design, explaining the rationale behind someof the less obvious items. The surveys have only recently been distributed, andthe bulk of the questionnaires have not yet been returned, thus I am limited tousing the findings of the pretest as an illustration.The questionnaire was pretested by 21 individuals chosen by the clan chiefsand approved by the tribal council, thus the pretest sample population was bothsmall and self selecting. The ages of the respondents to the pretest range from15 to 69, 62% of which are male. Only four of the six clans participated in thepretest with a large proportion (42%) of the participants coming from one par-ticular clan. Echota clans are based on regional rather than the traditional, matri-lineal kinship affiliations, so the pretest results may prove more representativeof one particular region of Alabama than of the entire Echota tribe, which isdistributed throughout the state.Because of the small size of the sample and the fact that no random sam-pling method was used, it cannot be assumed that the results of the pretest will244230 Teaching Indigenous Languagesreflect the result of the larger survey. Nevertheless the pretest has yielded inter-esting results. Four of the respondents reported childhood memory of a familymember speaking Cherokee. This was unexpected due to the early accultura-tion of the Cherokee, the degree of intermarriage with whites, and the long timespan within which those who remained in Alabama were compelled to denytheir heritage. Interestingly, all of the Cherokee speakers named among familymembers were female, opening up the possibility of investigating Dorian's(1981) Grandmother principal. This information also raises the possibility offurther exploring the role of gender in language death.Another item explores experience with the Cherokee language outside thefamily. Fifty-two percent of the respondents said that they have been acquaintedwith someone other than a relative who spoke Cherokee. Three of the respon-dents knew someone who learned the Cherokee language in Alabama fromanother speaker of Cherokee. This suggests, that the Cherokee language sur-vived at least into the present century in Alabama.None of the respondents themselves currently speak the Cherokee language,but all expressed a desire to acquire it. None of the respondents reported everhaving attended a Cherokee language class in the past; however, 48% said thatthey have studied the Cherokee language on their own, which indicates a levelof personal motivation to reacquire their aboriginal language.In the event that no native Alabama speakers of Cherokee are identified,the Echota will have to choose between learning the North Carolina (EasternBand) or the Oklahoma dialect of Cherokee. Of those surveyed in the pretest,52% said that they would prefer to learn the Eastern band dialect. The othersdid not state a preference. No one stated a preference for the Oklahoma dialect,which would be the cheapest and easiest route because there are instructionalmaterials already available in that dialect.Different individuals have different ideas of what constitutes language abil-ity. To provide a more descriptive measure of language ability, I included asection that asked the respondents to rank their ability to understand, speak,read, and write the Cherokee language. I used a semantic differential scale fromone to seven (1 representing fluency and 7 representing no ability). No oneranked themselves above four in any of the categories. All reported no writingability. However, 19% of the respondents reported some ability to understand,24% reported the ability to speak a minimal amount of Cherokee themselves,and 10% reported the ability to read a minimal amount of the written Cherokeelanguage. Although the self-reported amount of language ability is modest amongthese respondents, it is more than anyone expected at the outset of the project.Furthermore, this knowledge provides a base to build upon and suggests thatthese respondents may have a realistic idea of the effort that language reacqui-sition will involve.In order to understand the hierarchy of motivations that encouraged theEchota to initiate and participate in language revitalization and to get an idea ofwhat the tribe hopes to achieve with its revitalization efforts, I included a sec-tion that asked the respondents to rank the top five reasons why they want to 23124i Teaching Indigenous Languageslearn the Cherokee language. The respondents ranked having Cherokee ances-tors and keeping Cherokee tradition alive most frequently as their primary in-centive.I used a Likert type ordinal scale of relative intensity for 13 questions as anindicator of language attitude. All of the respondents agree or strongly agreethat the Cherokee language is worth learning and that the tribe should workhard to save it, in spite of the fact that 57% felt that Cherokee is a difficultlanguage to learn. I believe these responses show a realistic view of the taskahead, with a conviction that the end result is worth the effort. Perhaps this isbecause 95% reported the opinion that knowledge of the Cherokee language isimportant to their identity as Echota Cherokee.Of those surveyed, 95% felt that it is important that their children learnabout their Cherokee heritage. While 86% felt that all Cherokee people, bothchildren and adults, should be able to read books and publications written inCherokee, and 76% felt that there is important information about the Cherokeeculture written in the Cherokee language. No one surveyed in the pretest feltthat preservation efforts are a waste of time and only one respondent feels thatthe preservation of the Cherokee language is unrealistic. Only one respondentfelt that the Cherokee language is of no value in the modern world, though 24%felt that preserving Cherokee is looking backward instead of forward.In order to avoid omitting important attitudinal information or motivationsspecific to the Echota tribe, I included an open ended question near the end ofthe survey, asking what advantages someone who can speak the Cherokee lan-guage might have. One respondent answered that learning Cherokee wouldgive her a sense of self worth and accomplishment, in addition to imparting theability \"to communicate with the older ones who are still here with knowl-edge.\" Another said that it would give him the ability to preserve his own cul-ture in his own language This particular statement brings up David Wolf's pointabout the loss of words for describing a part of a culture. Be it words referringto an aspect material culture or cultural practice, no genuine equivalent is avail-able in the replacing language. Thus there is difficulty discussing that particu-lar cultural item, making overall cultural revival that much more difficult.One clan leader felt that the clan meetings should be conducted in the Chero-kee language, while another man expressed the desire to preserve the traditionsas they were passed down by the elders. Perhaps the most personal responsewas a desire to \"pray to the creator and long past ancestor spirits.\" Along thesame lines, several respondents expressed that learning the Cherokee languagewould make them feel more connected to the past and their heritage. Anotherrespondent felt that the ability to speak the Cherokee language will make peoplerecognize him as a Cherokee. Similarly, a third respondent said that it wouldgive her \"credibility\" as a Cherokee. These last two responses may tap intomotivations more unique to the Echota. Many Echota do not look like stereo-typical Indians, owing to a largely mixed blood membership and a high degreeof acculturation. These Echota may desire a badge of identity as Native Ameri-cans. Language serves as an excellent badge of cultural identity. 232246 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesIn addition to being physically nondistinctive, the Echota are a largely ur-ban population that is physically spread out across the state. Many have ac-quired access to main stream education and jobs. The Echota are a people whowere successful enough at blending in to remain behind in their homeland whenother Native Americans were harassed into leaving or forcefully removed. To-day their descendants want to reverse some of the cultural cost of that success.ConclusionThe results of the pretest indicate that the survey instrument:1. adequately measures the status of Cherokee language use amongtribal members,2. assesses the linguistic attitudinal climate, and3. estimates the extent of support and participation that the proposedproject will receive. In doing so, it lays the ground work for theEchota Cherokee language revitalization efforts to follow.In addition, the pretest indicated that there is some degree of Cherokee lan-guage knowledge present within the Echota population. Perhaps there is enoughknowledge to serve as a foundation to build upon for those individuals whopossess that knowledge, or even to tap as an educational resource for thosewith no knowledge.Finally the attitudes expressed in the pretest of this survey signify that theEchota envision both social and personal rewards with the reacquisition of theCherokee language. These positive language attitudes coupled with the enthu-siasm, dedication, and willingness to work for cultural revitalization exhibitedby the entire Echota tribe in past efforts anticipates an optimistic future for theEchota Cherokee Language reacquisition project.

Zip code252238 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesAn Initial Exploration of the Navajo Nation'sLanguage and Culture InitiativeAnn Batchelder and Sherry Markel This paper describes the results of a survey of attitudes about theimplementation of the Navajo Tribe's mandate to teach Navajo lan-guage and culture in all schools in the Navajo Nation. The surveyindicated there was widespread support for teaching Navajo languageand culture in schools and that they should be infused throughout thecurriculum. Though many concerns were voiced, respondents werevery consistent in stating that religious and ceremonial instructionwere best left to be taught outside the school. Curriculum in elementary and secondary schools has traditionally beenthe means through which school districts help student develop the knowledge,skills, and responsibilities that are necessary for becoming contributing mem-bers of communities and societies (Armento, 1986). Historian K. TsianinaLomawaima asks the question, \"Can we expect Indian children to 'succeed' inschool as long as Indian history, cultures, and people are systematically ex-cluded from, marginalized within, or brutalized by curricular content? (1995,p. 341). The Navajo tribe answered that question in 1984 when they mandatedthe addition of instruction in Navajo language and culture to the existing cur-riculum in elementary and secondary schools on the Navajo Reservation.There has long been a concern that Navajo children are losing contact withtraditional Navajo culture, beliefs, and language. Crawford (1996) points outthat in the mid-1970's ninety-five percent of all children entering bilingual edu-cation programs in Rough Rock and Rock Point schools were fluent Navajospeakers. Currently, statistics at those schools show that only about half thestudents are Navajo speakers.Public Law 101-477, the Native American Languages Act, made it clearthat \"traditional languages of Native Americans are an integral part of theircultures and identities\" and form the basis for cultural transmission and sur-vival. The law goes on to say that there \"is convincing evidence that studentachievement and performance, community and school pride, and educationalopportunity is [sic] clearly and directly tied to respect for, and support of, thefirst language of the child or student.\" The 1991 Final Report of the U.S. Sec-retary of Education's Indian Nations At-Risk Task Force also acknowledgedthat language is essential for cultural survival, and adds that a critical goal forthe education of Native American students is to develop \"civic, social, creative,and critical thinking skills necessary for ethical, moral, and responsible citizen-ship\" (INARTF, Goal 5). 239 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesAs part of a larger study that will examine the changes in elementary andsecondary school curriculum under the Navajo Tribe's Language and CultureMandate, a preliminary survey involving members of the Navajo Nation inboth New Mexico and Arizona was conducted. The survey asked respondentsto reflect on the nature and depth of language and cultural studies that shouldbe a part of school curriculum. The survey focused on several key aspects oflanguage and culture instruction in schools:What components of language and culture should be taught in schools?At what grade levels?What is the best way to teach language and/or culture to students? Whoshould carry out instruction?How should existing curriculum be redesigned/added to for students toreceive the best instruction in Navajo language and culture?What levels of language proficiency should be expected of students?The responses to these questions are critical in understanding how the NavajoNation, and individual communities within it, will approach the addition oftheir language and culture to school curriculum. As Burnaby (1996) notes, thesupport of the community is necessary for programs to be successful. Curricu-lum development, revision, and adoption are never simple processes. Becausethe future of the Navajo Nation and its citizens is tied up in the implementationof this new mandate, the process becomes even more sensitive.Description of the studyA ten question survey (see Appendix) was mailed with a cover letter invit-ing participation in the survey to twenty elementary and secondary schoolsacross the Navajo Nation. In addition, twenty-one attendees of the Navajo StudiesConference in Albuquerque participated in the survey. A sheet attached to eachsurvey asked participants to give some demographic information about them-selves. Information gathered through these demographic sheets indicated thatthe 37 survey respondents represented a. broad geographical sample that in-cluded community members and teachers ranging in age from fourteen to oversixty-five, with the largest percentage of respondents in the range of twenty-five to forty-five years of age. Communities represented included Aztec,Beclabito, Rough Rock, Tohatchee, Ft. Defiance, Steamboat, Kayenta, ChurchRock, Oak Springs, Nakaibeto, Crystal, Farmington, and Albuquerque.Of the ten questions on the survey, five were open ended, requiring therespondent to identify and write about issues of concern. The other five ques-tions were limited choice options with directions to circle the responses thatthey deemed appropriate. Participant were asked about: 1) How should lan-guage and culture instruction be integrated into the existing curriculum; 2) Howoften should language and culture be taught; 3) Who should be responsible forinstruction; 4) What level of language competence was desired; 5) What as-pects of culture should or should not be taught in schools; 6) Where should254240 Teaching Indigenous Languagessupport for programs come from; 7) What should the goals of language andculture instruction be; and 8) What concerns about language and culture in-struction should be voiced?Survey resultsAs Burnaby (1996), Paulston (1986), and others (Assembly of first Na-tions, 1990; Leap, 1981) suggest, when language and culture are in the processof shifting, people tend to take passionate stances about their beliefs, and polar-ized views on beliefs and practices are voiced. The administration of this sur-vey, especially at the Navajo Studies Conference in Albuquerque, support thesenotions. Participants at the Conference took the initiative to discuss their viewsas they were filling out the survey. Many people waited patiently for a handmicrophone to be passed to them so that they could relate personal experiencesor concerns about the place of Navajo language and culture instruction in schools.The following five samples of unsolicited comments taken from participants atthat conference seem to highlight the range of emotions and concerns receivedthrough both the conference attendees and those participants that mailed intheir responses:The parents don't want a bilingual program. They don't want teachers toteach Navajo to their children. They don't really listen to me. The Chapterleaders and the tribal leaders should explain to parents and they'll listen tothem. I know that students will comprehend more things with two lan-guages, but I can't get parents to listen to me.Navajo Elementary TeacherYou want to teach the children to speak Navajo at school? I was takenaway from my parents by the sheriff when I was five years old. They camein a car and took me away. My father said I had to go with them. They putme in a boarding school, and I was not allowed to speak Navajo. If we did,we were punished. It was hard for me, it was so hard. We girls, we wouldwhisper in the dormitory, and if they caught us speaking Navajo, they wouldwash our mouths out with soap. I did not teach my sons Navajo. I did notwant them to go through that. It was awful. English is the language to getahead. I taught them English. Now, my oldest is trying to learn Navajo,and it is very hard for him. You got to teach the parents now. They're theones that are going to have to learn so they can teach their children. Youare going to have adult education, not just children in the schools.Navajo Community MemberThank you for doing this. This is very important. I have taught at bothWindow Rock and Ganado. At Window Rock many of my students spokeand understood Navajo. But I think that this is because they were all there.They lived there. No busses. At Ganado it was the other way around. Ev-erybody was bussed. They were all on the road. They didn't get Navajo all 241 Teaching Indigenous Languagesthe time and most of them don't understand it well. Everybody spoke Na-vajo until the Head Start came in. After that, about five years after that,that's when Navajo began to disappear.Navajo Community Member and TeacherI've been a missionary for thirty-five years in the Checkerboard area. Noone spoke English when I first got there. Now it is very typical for some-one to ask a question in Navajo and have the answer come back in English.It makes me sick to my stomach that the language is going. Somebody hasto stop this!MissionaryI am Hispanic, and I didn't learn Spanish until college. Do you knowhow hard that was to learn Spanish in college? This ends up being reteach-ing, and it takes much longer....I urge you to teach your children Navajo inthe home and in the school. You will lose it if you don't. I teach preschool,and there are only five Navajo monolingual students in my class. There areanother four or five children who may be bilingual; they respond to myquestions in both Navajo and English. The rest of the students don't under-stand any Navajo at all. Are we just lazy? English is the language of suc-cess according to parents. We must teach teachers to speak in Navajo dur-ing the school day.Reservation Pre-School TeacherAs the comments above illustrate, and the results of the survey back up, partici-pants in this study did not always agree on the place of Navajo language andculture instruction in elementary and secondary schools.Respondents were given choices as to who should teach Navajo languageand culture were provided as seen Figure 1 below. They indicated that \"Na-vajo\" was the best choice and the next highest choice was \"tribal elder.\" Sepa-rating out the surveys completed in Albuquerque from those sent in from schooldistricts showed some interesting differences in preference. Mailed responsesindicated that it was important that a community member be responsible forinstruction, though that person did not necessarily have to be an elder. TheAlbuquerque surveys included higher numbers of responses indicating a class-room teacher, regardless of background, should be the person responsible forinstruction in Navajo language and culture.As can be seen in Figure 2, every content area listed on the survey hadvotes for placement of Navajo language and cultural studies. However, lan-guage arts and social studies were the two most highly selected areas of studyfor curriculum expansion. Science and physical education received the leastresponses, while thirteen percent of respondents felt that Navajo language andculture studies should be infused in every class taught in schools. Sixty-twopercent of the respondents felt that regardless of where Navajo language andculture were included in the curriculum, daily instruction was necessary. `fir;242 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesFigure 1: Who should teach bucitierqu Community language and culture instruction MusicArt 11%12% P.E.9%Science10%EveryClass13%LangArts18% Math12%Stud15%Soc. Respondents were almost equally divided among the three levels of Na-vajo language competence desired in students. Twenty-four percent desired thebasics (an introduction to basic vocabulary), 32% competency (the ability tocarry on conversations in Navajo), and 44% fluency (the ability to use Navajofor all communication processes). It is striking that sixty-seven percent of therespondents felt that students should be competent or fluent in Navajo. Again,there were differences in the mailed and conference responses. Mailed responseshad much more support for basic and competent levels of fluency, while con-BEST COPY AVALI,- 243257 Teaching Indigenous Languagesference members were more likely to choose the competent or fluent catego-ries.Overwhelmingly, participants expressed a desire for parental/clan involve-ment with instruction, followed by community member involvement as can beseen in Figure 3 below. Several respondents urged that parents should be taughtNavajo language and culture so that they could support and teach their childrenwithin the family. Participants who spoke out at the Albuquerque conferencemade claims that through the efforts of boarding schools to teach English-only,a generation of language and culture had already been lost. This generationincludes both parents and grandparents of today's students, and these peoplecould benefit from instruction as much as the children.Figure 3: Who should be involved in Navajo language and culture instruc-tion and conclusionsThough many concerns were voiced, respondents were very consistent inagreement that some components of Navajo culture did not belong in schools.Religious and ceremonial instruction were mentioned time after time as areasthat were best left to those outside the school to teach. Another concern men-tioned several times was who would decide the credentials of those chosen tobe instructors in language and culture. Would it mean that all teachers had to becertified in their language skills and cultural knowledge or could just anyonevolunteer to be an instructor?25 g244 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThe results presented here are some preliminary findings from a surveycirculated across the Navajo Nation. Communities are continuing to send inresponses. What is very clear from the data that has been gathered so far is thatmembers of the Navajo Nation are very concerned with the education of theirchildren, though the means and goals for instruction of Navajo language andculture are not consistently shared across all communities. How the mandateimpacts each community and the entire Navajo Nation is not yet clear, but if thevoices we heard through the participants in this study are any indication, sup-port for teaching Navajo language is widespread.

Stiles This paper compares Cree, Hualapai, Maori, and Hawaiian in-digenous language programs and describes common components andproblems of implementation. Characteristics shared by the four prograins are discussed in regard to their implications for other languagegroups interested in implementing their own programs. The authorconcludes that successful programs need to link language and cul-ture, need written teaching materials, and need community supportand parental involvement and that successful programs can fight gangactivity, alcohol and drug abuse, and a high dropout rates in indig-enous communities. This paper examines four indigenous language programs to compare com-mon components, problems, and outcomes. The programs are Cree Way in Que-bec, Hualapai in Arizona, Te Kohanga Reo in New Zealand, and Punana Leo inHawai 1. The programs were chosen based on four criteria. First, the indig-enous language can be categorized as in Stage 6 using Fishman's (1991) gradedintergenerational disruption scale for threatened languages or in Stage 3 usingSchmidt's (1990) scale the language is no longer transmitted to the youngergeneration (in the home or in the community). Only some older people stillspeak the native tongue as their primary language, and everyday communica-tion uses a replacement language (English in these four communities). Therange of speech styles is limited and semi-speakers exist in the middle genera-tions. A semi-speaker is an individual who understands but does not speak thelanguage in its standard form (Schmidt, 1990). According to Dixon,Languages at [Schmidt's] Stage 3 are well on their way towards beingreplaced by English. But this process may be halted or at least sloweddown if the right sort of programs are introduced. These are languagesfor which there is some chance of survival although not, in most cases,a very high chance. (1989, p. 31)Second, the programs have common components: curriculum development,community support, parent involvement, and government support. The pro-grams also have common histories as they all began as tribal movements inreaction to the lack of tribal language use by school children. Third, the pro-grams exist in different countries where governmental influence and supportcould be considered for comparison. The two United States tribal groups,Hualapai and Hawaiian, have historical differences and Hawaiian Natives areconsidered a separate ethnic group from American Indians. Fourth, the pro- 248 Teaching Indigenous Languagesgrams have been held up to the bilingual professional community as modelprograms for endangered indigenous languages.The Cree Way projectThe Cree tribe in Quebec inhabits several village communities, some ofwhich have maintained their language and others have not. The Cree ofWaskaganish live along the eastern shore of James Bay, seven hundred milesnorth of Quebec, one of eight villages along James Bay. The community, in1993, had a population of 1,400, 485 of whom were school age children. Tradi-tionally, the Cree were hunters and gatherers, successfully adapting to the se-vere environment. Natural surroundings have deteriorated with the influx ofhuman population and the James Bay hydroelectric dams. Mandatory federalpublic school attendance came to Waskaganish in the early 1960's.In 1973, The Cree Way Project' was created by John Murdoch, a principal,in reaction to the inappropriateness of Canadian developed curriculum for theCree children. The purpose of the project was to \"bridge the seemingly un-bridgeable gulf between two alien nations: the native peoplesnomadic hunt-ers and the European Canadiansonce agricultural, now post-industrial citydwellers\" (Feurer, 1990, p. 7). The goals of the project were to use Cree lan-guage in the schools to validate Cree culture and create a Cree tribal identity, tomake reading and writing more important within their previously oral culture,to create a curriculum reflecting Cree culture and the Cree conceptual frame-work, and to implement that curriculum in the public schools.A Cree syllabic had been developed over a hundred years ago, however in1973 neither Cree language materials for education purposes existed nor didthe Cree population read or write in Cree. A resource language instructor beganteaching the Cree syllabics in half hour programs each day in each classroom,and a team of Waskaganish Cree tribal members began developing curriculummaterials and resources, such as handicrafts, for classroom use. The presentprogram employs three staff people for cultural and language development.Seven other communities at James Bay have also implemented the programand use the over 500 textbooks in Cree that have been developed in local work-shops.In 1988, a Cree immersion program at a preschool level was instituted inreaction to code-switching or \"sloppy\" Cree being used by teen language learn-ers. Traditionalist tribal members viewed these habits as a loss of linguisticcompetence. The purpose of the immersion program was to prevent languageloss and promote proficiency before public school exposure. In 1989, the im-mersion program extended to kindergarten. In 1993, grade one was added andanother grade level was added each year up to grade four. In grade four, half thesubjects will be taught in Cree and half in either French or English. Beginning'The information on the Cree of Waskaganish was obtained from two articlesby the same researcher, Hanny Feurer, written in 1990 and 1993. Referenceswithin the text are found in both articles unless specifically noted. 2492o; Teaching Indigenous Languagesin the fifth grade, the French or English curriculum is followed with Cree cul-ture enrichment in regular doses, including reading and writing Cree syllabics.This program continues through high school.Because of the encroachments of technology, trapping, and hunting are nolonger the sole livelihood of the Cree at Waskaganish. Cultural experiencesimportant to the transmission of tradition are fulfilled in two unique programssupported by the school boards. Four or five times a year, the students go tobush camp funded by the Cree Trapper Association. At camp, tribal resourcepeople teach traditional skills in trapping, beading, snowshoe construction, cook-ing, and fur tanning. Students write in Cree about the camp in their journals.Also, summer vacation has been shortened to allow one week in the fall andthree weeks in the spring for hunting and ceremonial programs. Students canuse these times to accompany elders and family on hunts or to ceremonies.Support for the Cree Way Project originates at a higher government levelthan the local school board. Public education in Canada is under provincialgovernance; however, Indian education is designated under federal rule. Fundsand control is delegated back to the provinces under the Ministry of IndianAffairs. In 1970, Quebec recognized the right of native peoples to have theirnative languages taught in public schools. A unique 1975 agreement by JamesBay and Northern Quebec puts authority for schools directly in tribal hands.Each community has a locally elected school board that governs language policy,curriculum, and textbook approval. The board employs a staff and is self-ad-ministrating (Feurer, 1994).Academic support also exists at the university level. In 1973 at the start ofthe program, Cree teacher certification was impossible. The University of Que-bec began a certification program for language teachers in James Bay commu-nities. Presently, McGill University continues these programs. Consequently,an ever increasing number of native speakers are certified as teachers. Fiftypercent of the teaching staff at Waskaganish are native Cree.Staff development offered in regular workshops are sponsored by the localschool boards. Teachers work cooperatively to develop culturally relevant cur-riculum and train themselves to teach in the Cree Way. Local resource centerssupport the curriculum with locally developed reference materials, crafts, andartifacts.The current status of this program demonstrates its continued viability inthe Cree communities. The high school dropout rate has been reduced, althoughspecific percentages were not reported by researchers as the high school popu-lation must leave the reservation to attend provincial schools. Higher educationgraduates return to the community at the rate of 99 percent to contribute theirskills to a growing bilingual community. Testing of immersion program par-ticipants that will graduate from the elementary program in 1997 is necessaryto quantify results. Teachers report active participation of students in the Creelanguage and increased proficiency in two languages. Parents are enrolling inCree syllabics courses, motivated by their children's language acquisition. Stu-dents in junior high and high school are now opting for formal instruction in 2 IS 4250 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesFrench (70 percent) to develop a third language useful in government employ-ment in Quebec (Feurer, 1993).The Peach Springs Hualapai programThe Hualapai (People of the Tall Pines) Reservation is located in high desertcanyon country along the rim of the Grand Canyon. In 1994, the Hualapai popu-lation was 1,700, \"nearly half of whom are under the age of 16\" (Watahomigie& McCarty, 1994, p. 26). Traditionally, the Hualapai were gatherers and sub-sistence farmers. The people lived in small bands or extended families with aheadman as leader. A reservation was established in 1883. A community politi-cal organization with a tribal council has developed from reservation constraintson the band headman tradition. The reservation school system provides educa-tion, Head Start through eighth grade to an average of 220 students (Watahomigie& McCarty, 1994).In 1976, 45 percent of the school age students spoke English as their domi-nant language (Zepeda & Hill, 1991). Since that time, the development of fed-erally subsidized HUD housing has weakened traditional family cultural trans-mission by separating the extended families into individual households. Tele-vision and media availability has further eroded the use of the language. In1982, 92 percent of the students came from homes where Hualapai was spoken,but the children spoke English at home and at school (Watahomigie &Yamamoto, 1992).In 1975, the Hualapai bilingual program was developed to offer languagemaintenance to a rapidly eroding language. No writing system existed for theoral Hualapai language and the first several years of the program were devotedto curriculum and materials development in written Hualapai. In three years, aparallel Hualapai curriculum had been completed and in five years a fully inte-grated bilingual program, using the new concurrent approach, had been imple-mented. The new concurrent approach as described by the program director,Lucille Watahomigie, is a \"balanced use of Hualapai and English, so that con-cepts and lexicon are formed and reinforced in both languages\" (Watahomigieet al., 1994, p. 36). In 1981, the school board adopted the Hualapai Bilingual/Bicultural Education Program (HBBEP) as the official district curriculum(Watahomigie & Yamamoto, 1992).Despite the success in development of the bilingual program, the commu-nity continued to show English gaining in use and more children came to schoolwith English as their primary language. The program reassessed its goals andreaffirmed the resolve to develop true bilingualism for the community. A newcommitment to incorporating heritage and culture and to the community in-volvement produced a \"revaluing\" of education to children and adults(Watahomigie & McCarty, 1994, p. 40). To fight fire with fire, the programturned to technology, computers, and video to capture the attention of childrenin the native language. A good deal of the language arts curriculum was put oncomputers. A state of the art video studio/television station is used by students 251 Teaching Indigenous Languagesto script and produce documentaries in Hualapai as resource materials for schooland community-wide use (Zepeda & Hill 1991).Community support is essential to this program. In the beginning, commu-nity support was nonexistent. Elders objected to Hualapai being written down.Even Hualapai language aides considered the language incapable of abstractideas required for content embedded subjects. Parents considered English thelanguage of the school. Parents, products of all-English schooling themselves,thought that combining English and Hualapai in the school would only confusethe children and make the dropout rate worse. Staff support and campaigningfor the bilingual program won over the community. Now the preponderance ofstaff are Hualapai and the community has participated in the development ofresources and in school activities. Seventy-five percent of the parents partici-pate in school events and classroom volunteering (Watahomigie & Yamamoto,1987).Staff development is of primary importance to the program. The staff meetstwice a week for language study. Frequent in-service training and summer in-stitute attendance at the American Indian Language Development Institute(AILDI) enables the staff to create materials and reevaluate curriculum compo-nents. AILDI was developed by the founder of the Hualapai program, LucilleWatahomigie, as a training ground for community language speakers to be-come research linguists in their own language. Courses in curriculum develop-ment originally through Northern Arizona University insured competent tribalinstructors to assist in the classroom while they earned certification as teachers.Nonnative staff attendance at summer linguistic institutes further prepared themto use the native language in the classroom (Watahomigie & Yamamoto, 1987).Governmental support has also been of primary importance to the pro-gram. Such support from the state has been assured because of the remote loca-tion of the reservation school system. There is no alternative but to have theschool on the reservation. The presence of two certified teachers, also tribalmembers, promoted the right atmosphere to create the bilingual program, andthe school principal position has been held by Hualapais. Both of the previ-ously mentioned teachers have served on the Council (one as Tribal Chair-man), which facilitated a close working relationship between entities. At thecommunity level, a parent advisory committee, established in 1975 at the verybeginning of the program, meets regularly to suggest policy and to participatein staff development training sessions.The current status of the Hualapai bilingual/bicultural program suggeststhat growth and success will continue. The tribal preschool and Head Start pro-gram, staffed mostly by Hualapai speakers, prepares their students for the bi-lingual classrooms of the primary grades. Although not described as an immer-sion program, the greatest extent of immersion in Hualapai is here at first schoolcontact. Reinforcement of English is plentiful outside the classroom.Then, too, the spotlight on the program from linguistic professionals hasbrought in many federal dollars to support the program. The program director,however, has used the abundance of funding to lay a permanent foundation of 252266' Teaching Indigenous Languagestrained community resource people so that as federal support recedes, the pro-gram will not suffer. Any research done by professionals about the programmust produce usable curricula and resources which are left with the program(Watahomigie & McCarty, 1994).Te Kohanga ReoThe Maori people of New Zealand comprise 15 percent of the New Zealandpopulation of approximately one half million people. At first contact with Eu-ropeans, 75 percent of the native population died of disease. The history of theMaori reads like the history of the Native American tribes; land taken withouttreaties, slaughter, and subhuman treatment (Holmes, 1992). The Maori have acommon language regardless of where in New Zealand they reside. The tribestrace their ancestry to Polynesian migrants about 800 AD or earlier and fol-lowed by other waves of migration, the last major influx at about 1300 AD.Tribes based on family ancestry were further divided into subgroups that livedin villages. They hunted, gathered, and practiced subsistence agriculture. Thepublic meeting house was the center of village life.In the early 1960's, a Play Centre preschool movement encouraged Maorimothers to use English with their children. This practice, in conjunction withthe greater presence of television in Maori homes, helped to accelerate Maorilanguage loss. By 1980, four Maori model bilingual programs, based in pri-mary schools as a kind of \"headstart program\", had been developed. But thesewere local in impact and not suitable for widespread use because instead ofattracting disadvantaged children, the opposite occurred. Middle class parentsbecame keen to send their youngsters there. In 1981, the Department of MaoriAffairs brought together Maori leaders who conceptualized a grassroots orwhanau movement designed to revitalize the dying Maori language in languagenests (Spolsky, 1990). In the nests, children from birth to eight years of agewould be exposed to the Maori language in a homelike atmosphere. Part of thisearly childhood education system would be called the te kohanga reo, a pre-school where Maori children would be immersed in the native language. At thispoint, the cultural knowledge development across the curriculum did not exist,just the spoken language (Holmes, 1992). By 1991, 700 kohanga had been es-tablished and 10,000 children had been enrolled in them. However, only elevenprimary bilingual school programs (kura kaupapa) existed into which to funnelall those children (Holmes, 1991). As of 1994, twenty-nine kura kaupapa Maorischools had been established or approved for start up (Maori Initiatives, 1997).It has been the goal of the program to reintroduce and revitalize the Maorilanguage, to reattach the language to the people at the community level. The tekohanga reo would facilitate the children's entry into school by establishingpractical and social skills and Maori pride (Cazden, Snow, & Heise-Paigorkia,1990).About half the te kohanga reo are located on Maori land in tribal buildings.The other half are operating in government school buildings, community facili-ties or homes. The preschools enroll ten to seventy students. Ten percent of the 2532E Teaching Indigenous Languagesadults, teachers, and aides are paid. The majority of workers are volunteer par-ents and elders. Only fluent speakers and cultural models can be teachers oraides and are, therefore, the older generation. Conflicts have arisen betweennonspeaking parents and the staff on cultural issues. Community leaders arealso concerned that the most adults in the kohanga are female and very fewmale role models are available to the children (Cazden et al., 1990).Government involvement from the beginning of the te kohanga movementhas been nominally supportive. It was a government initiative through the De-partment of Maori Affairs that established the Te Kohanga Reo (TKR) in 1982.A charitable trust was created to facilitate a partnership between the MaoriPeople and the government. The movement receives support also from the De-partment of Labor for whanau (community helpers or volunteers) training. In1989, a reorganized Department of Maori Affairs became the Ministry of MaoriAffairs with authority to make policy for the tribal programs. The new Ministrydelegated control to the tribal entities. In 1990, funding for all early childhoodeducation programs was equalized and based on the number of children en-rolled in each session (Cazden et al., 1990).The nominal governmental support has been overshadowed by the actualpractice in schools where graduates of the te kohanga reo must continue theireducation. In 1986, claims were brought before the Department of Justice tri-bunals in an effort to bring more equality for Maori children in public schools.These tribunals raved about the success of the TKR but then admitted the fail-ure of the government to maintain the language and culture as promised in theTreaty of Waitangi. Schools are monocultural with much power residing in theprincipal who may choose correspondence study as the alternative to bilingualclassrooms. Tribunal records consulted on the Internet expose the practices inschools to be very detrimental to Maori students. The Education Department isaware of the inequalities and desires to remedy the situation but seems power-less to do so in a reasonable time frame (Waitangi Tribunal, 1997). Even thereports of the tribunals in 1986 did not prompt action; it was not until 1989 thatMaori began to be used as the language of instruction in public schools, aftermuch active pressure by parents (Spolsky, 1990).The community and staff support of the program are the main reason thecurrent status of the TKR programs is positive and growing. The kohanga de-pend on considerable volunteer power, with the benefit of cultural certificationof the kaiakos (teachers and aides), coupled with formal approved training nowin place and involving 600 trainees. TKR's located on tribal lands exist withdonations from the community and parents who can ill afford the expense(Cazden et al., 1990). The cultural and language enrichment is so very impor-tant to the people that the State Services Commission has assessed the programas a remarkable success story (Maori Initiatives, 1997). Initially without out-side support, it now has increased support from public and private sectors. To-day te kohanga reo is government funded like other preschool services. How-ever, donations are still required. The program has found great admiration in dLi254 Teaching Indigenous Languagesother countries and at least one program has tried to replicate it, the Punana Leoin Hawai `i.Punana LeoThe Hawaiian people, like the Maori, are Polynesian migrating to Hawaiiabout 400 AD, followed by a second migration in the ninth or tenth centuryAD. Settlers in villages were governed by a hereditary monarchy. With thesettlement of Europeans and American missionaries, traders, and businessmencame diseases that decimated the native population. The monarchical systemwas overthrown and replaced by a U. S. Territorial Government, and eventu-ally by U.S. statehood. Literacy in Hawaiian was the work of the nineteenthcentury Protestant missionaries. They developed a writing system in order totranslate the Bible and hymn books into Hawaiian because literacy was re-quired by Protestants for church membership. The monarchy began an effortfor adult literacy education and by 1830 half of the population could read andwrite Hawaiian. After 1830, schools were taught in Hawaiian; most membersof the royal family were multilingual (Slaughter, 1994).By the early 1990's however, only 4.5 percent of the native Hawaiianswere native speakers, most over 50 years of age. Very few children spoke thelanguage or would have the opportunity to learn it. Hawaiian medium publicschools had been out of operation for 90 years. One island of the Hawaiianchain, Niihau, could still claim Hawaiian as the language of the community,and a few preschools housed in private homes used Hawaiian exclusively(Kamana & Wilson, 1995). The founders visited the Maori preschools in NewZealand (Aotearoa) and in 1985 started two preschools in the larger cities atHilo and Honolulu. In 1987, the parents of the first graduates of Punana Leopetitioned the state to set up two immersion kindergartens for their children.The state began an immersion K-1 program in two elementary schools(Kame' eleihiwa, 1992).The goals of the Punana Leo were to promote Hawaiian as a living lan-guage and to create an educational program that produces bilingual, biliteratechildren. In compliance with those goals, the immersion into the language isvery complete. Children have ten hour days, and on the school grounds onlyHawaiian is spoken. Visitors use interpreters even if English is understood(Zepeda & Hill, 1991). Parental involvement in the program is essential to re-inforce the use of the language at home. Language classes must be attendedweekly by all parents. Classes start for one hour and increase in length to twoand three hours as proficiency improves (Kamana & Wilson, 1996). Other pa-rental duties to the school include paying tuition based on income, which since1989, has been subsidized by the U.S. Department of Education. Ninety-fivepercent of the families receive tuition assistance. Eight hours per month of in-kind service to the school is also required, and parents make up the governanceboard of the school (Rawlins, 1994).Obviously, governmental support has helped to promote the immersionpreschools. A well established State Department of Education immersion pro- 255 Teaching Indigenous Languagesgram, Papahana Kaiapuni Hawai `i, now extends statewide through grade twelvebecause of the example of the effectiveness of Punana Leo. Although federalfunding, especially for Punana Leo, is unstable, the rest of the school systemnow supports immersion programs. The Kamehameha Schools, large well en-dowed private schools, have also taken a hard look at Punana Leo immersionconcepts and provided sporadic support in the form of instructional materialsand professional development (Paleka & Hammond, 1992).In 1996 nine Punana Leo sites served 175 children (Kamana & Wilson,1996). Long term follow up for research data will continue on 866 previousgraduates (Rawlins, 1994). In such a relatively new program, a lack of trained,fluent teachers and top quality resources and curriculum materials have beenstumbling blocks (Kame'eleihiwa, 1992).ComparisonThe four programs described above are open to many comparisons. Allfour have common program components, common problems affecting imple-mentation and growth, and common outcomes. A review of these areas willassist the formulation of conclusions. Each has an integral partnership of lan-guage and culture. Teaching a language in a sterile environment outside thecompanion culture dooms the language to only academic application. Each ofthese programs has developed curriculum that combines indigenous languageand cultural instruction. Language is learned as a by product, almost, of thecultural heritage. Using literacy to further validate the use of the language ineveryday life has transformed these formerly oral languages into languagesthat can be used for academic instruction in schools. Each program became aplace where the children can get away from English and immerse themselves intheir tribal language, and each program has paid careful attention to incorpo-rate student literature creation in cultural contexts to link language, culture,reading, and writing.The need for written teaching materials is a common problem for theseprograms. Textbook companies do not make, as a rule, textbooks for a fewthousand children in an obscure language. This means that the programs haveto develop their own materials, which takes years of dedicated work. First, asin the Hualapai program, much of the first five years was spent in negotiatinghow to write the language (Watahomigie & Yamamoto, 1987). Second, time isrequired to teach the new writing system to local community members. TheCree spent more than five years training a staff of speakers to write Cree mate-rials so that texts could be developed (Feurer, 1993). Printing costs for materi-als can also be prohibitive to a program, particularly in light of fluctuatingfunding. Without these materials, a program's emphasis on the language asviable for academic use can be lost.Another common component is that of community support and involve-ment. The literature on each of these programs reiterated several times hownecessary the support of tribal members was to program success. The culturalconnection cannot be made to the language without those who know the cul- 256r.4 G Teaching Indigenous Languagesture best. Usually this is the elders, still fluent, still \"inextricably associated,intimately tied\" to the culture (Fishman, 1987, p. 12). This connection is im-portant to the students also, as evidenced in the high percentage of Cree schoolchildren (80%) who choose to take the special vacations with elders and theirfamilies (Feurer, 1990).Community is also important to insure the transmission of societal founda-tions to future generations. Stephen Harris (1994) speaks about domains ofculture, the Western domain and the Native (aboriginal) domain, \"Hopefullystudents will see themselves as aboriginal people with bicultural skillshav-ing a strengthening and primary Aboriginal identity, but competent and confi-dent in two social worlds\" (Harris 1994, p. 143-144). This community involve-ment requires local control of the school system. All four of these programswere made possible by measures of local control and that control made pos-sible unusual formations of curriculum.But the close community ties have often presented difficulties in initiatingindigenous language programs. All of the communities in these four programsexperienced community objections to a program that taught the native tongueso seriously. Elders objected to the writing of the language (Cree and Hualapai);elders and parents feared teaching the children a language other than Englishbecause of past oppression for use of their native language (all programs); par-ents as non-speakers doubted the ability of their children to achieve fluency;and teachers were convinced the languages were unsuitable for academic en-deavors.Parental involvement is another common component of all four programs.The most important element for these programs is the support of the parents inthe home. The language learned at school must be reinforced at home in orderfor true bilingualism to occur in indigenous languages. \"Everyday use of lan-guage in a wide range of contexts provides language with its life blood througha self-generating processthe more people hear and use the language, the morefluent and confident in language use they become\" (Schmidt, 1990, p. 56).Everyday use can not occur in a vacuum and parental involvement in theseprograms has extended to language classes, in-service training, classroom par-ticipation, development of resources, and certification as teachers. These fourprograms have attained their measure of success because parents have not givenup on the dream. Parents, who were once against a program, have even gonebefore Congress to testify on behalf of the program they believe to be integralto the educational success of their children (Rawlins, 1994). In other nations,parents have lobbied their governments to give support to the programs. InNew Zealand, Maori parents have presented a claim against the Department ofEducation to redress the governments lack of support (Waitangi Tribunal, 1997).Some common problems to these programs have already been discussedas they affected the common components. Other common problems exist withinthese programs, including teacher availability, teacher training, and funding.Sources on all four of these programs mentioned the problem of finding fluentspeakers of the language with any training to be teachers. In all the programs, 2572 7 Teaching Indigenous Languagescompliance with government standards for teacher training has been a majorstumbling block to success.2 It is not a problem easily addressed because certi-fication cannot occur overnight or even over several years. The Hualapai, forexample, after nineteen years have certified five teachers (Watahomigie &McCarty, 1994). Even if the training problem is supported by colleges and uni-versities, as with the Cree, Hualapai, and Hawaiian programs, time is not on theside of the trainees. Programs must recruit staff from outside the community,and a high turnover rate hinders the programs. In all the communities, a major-ity of fluent speakers are elderly, not capable of taking on the rigors of teachingor the rigors of certification coursework. The Hualapai are the least affected bythis problem as half of the parental age group still have fluency (Watahomigieet al., 1994).Problems with funding are mentioned to be of major importance in all butthe Hualapai Program. Lucille Watahomigie has worked tirelessly with the pro-fessional linguistic community to generate federal funding as a demonstrationproject. She has stated in her more recent articles (Watahomigie et al., 1992,1994) that she does not expect that trend to last and has sought to plan againstit. The other programs listed unstable funding as a major detriment to theirsuccess. Help from the government is verbal but not budgetary. The Cree, withsome local funding control, have found it less of a problem as years go by. Isthis any different from the funding for education in any language? But authori-ties have not been convinced of the seriousness of the problem of languageloss. Even though evidence has been given for years of the academic success ofchildren given a bilingual/bicultural education, the funding is still not providedto those most in need.As a final point of comparison, discussion on common outcomes in theseprograms should take place. It can be said that because these four programshave remained in existence, they have made a difference in the communitiesthey serve. A definite \"revaluing of education at all levels\" has occurred in eachcommunity (Watahomigie, 1995, p. 192). More children are succeeding furtherwithin the educational system as a result of their exposure to bilingual/bicul-tural education. One hundred percent of the eighth grade graduates at HualapaiPeach Springs School, graduate from high school (Watahomigie, 1995). TheCree have noticed a significant drop in their dropout rate (Feurer, 1993). On thegovernmental level, the Hawaiian Board of Education has developed immer-sion program in the K-12 against the advice of the Department of Education(Kame' eleikiwa, 1992). The New Zealand Department of Education is seekingto support the Te Kohanga Reo movement by developing bilingual schoolswithin the public school system (Maori Initiatives, 1997).The benefit of these programs within the community extends also to thepride developed and identity regained by the children who attend. Loss of lan-2The Hawaiian legislature has shown willingness to assist the Hawaiian lan-guage immersion programs with the problem of teacher certification by ex-empting staff members from certification who teach solely in Hawaiian. 258(s, Teaching Indigenous Languagesguage carries with it a loss of culture and a loss of identity. Children enrolled inthese programs have a much greater sense of who they are and have regained atleast a sense of heritage. Loss of identity for teenagers can lead to gang activity,alcohol and drug abuse, and a high dropout rate.The revitalization or rejuvenation of an endangered language is anothersignificant outcome for the community. It is much too soon to tell if the lan-guages will make a complete recovery, but these programs have \"helped toupgrade the level of proficiency in the native language\" (Feurer, 1993). Theimportance of the Hawaiian language in Hawaiian schools has been validatedby the academic success of the Punana Leo students. New Zealand educatorshave witnessed five year old Te Kohanga Reo students exceeding the profi-ciency of Fifth Form (about fifteen-year-old) students in state oral exams(Waitangi Tribunals, 1997). The Hualapai have adapted the Hualapai Oral Lan-guage Test and Language Assessment Scales (LAS) tests to assess languageacquisition and have recorded improvements in skills in Hualapai. They havealso noticed improvements in the students' test scores on the English languageCalifornia Test of Basic Skills (CTBS).ConclusionsThe positive outcomes from these programs cannot be denied. Can it thenbe assumed that all these programs have been effective and are models forother indigenous language programs worldwide? It has been shown that eachof these programs have goals to promote biliteracy and bilingualism. Each hasdone just that. The Cree Way Project has the most clearly delineated goals, butthe other programs examined here have set in motion a system that can keeptheir languages alive. The fact that several research articles on each programare available and more research is underway encourages thoughts that theseprograms are a success and will continue to succeed. Planners have taken theirprojects very seriously, undergirding their development with research on theoryon second language acquisition, bilingual, and immersion education. Articlesare often filled with references to Cummins, Vygotsky, Lambert, and Fishman.Very importantly, when compared to indigenous language programs thatare not grounded on bicultural/bilingual goals and acquisition theory, a greatcontrast is seen. For example, a program in Nebraska that attempted to pre-serve the Omaha language within the public schools was reported on byCatherine Rudin in 1989. The program had problems caused by no materials,no fluent teachers, and culturally inappropriate translated stories. Rudin con-cluded that none of the children enrolled in the program (which began in 1970)have the ability to carry on a conversation in Omaha. She writes, \"The programhas had a positive impact on the level of Omaha proficiency of the young people:some is better than none\" (Rudin, 1989, p. 6). This program is older than any ofthese outlined but has met with little success in comparison. The Omaha pro-gram met similar problems as the other programs and was recognized by theU.S. Department of Education in 1988. Wherein lies the difference? 259273 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesIn all the programs so far discussed, planning with the community andproblem solving with community support has developed strong adaptable com-ponents. The Omaha program spoke of pleased parents and elders because chil-dren were more aware of their culture and language, but also mentioned a lackof community support in linguistic training and active resource development(Rudin, 1989). These grounding elements painstakingly developed by the fourprograms described herein are the key to prolonged success. These elementsare also the reason that replication of the programs has been and will be pos-sible. The Te Kohanga Reo program was replicated in the Punana Leo in Hawai `i.The Hualapai project has been helping other bilingual/bicultural programs getunderway, for example the Oklahoma Kickapoo Program (Watahomigie et al.,1987). The Cree Project of Waskaganish has been replicated by other JamesBay communities and in Cree communities elsewhere in Quebec. In each case,the community teamwork and groundwork over several years had made it suc-cessful when compared with other attempts.What conclusions can be drawn from the study of these four programs inregard to bilingual/bicultural education? Indigenous language groups cannotuse programs imposed from the outside culture. Home and community are tootightly interwoven into the mechanisms of language education to be influencedby sources outside the culture. Culture cannot be separated from language. There-fore, the indigenous people must take the challenge themselves to meet theirneeds, while the majority society can help provide consistent funding, researchfoundations, linguistic expertise, and pedagogical (teacher) training.Each of these four programs has recognized the importance of beginningat an early age with children. Each program begins exposure in preschool andfirst language support until at least the fifth grade. In the Maori program, lossof language skills was seen in those students without continued support in pri-mary school immersion. Harris (1994) discusses the domain theory in relationto separating the two languages: there is a need to \"create curricular space forless powerful language and culture which is in danger of being colonized by adominant, pervasive, and invasive culture.\" The culture and the language carveout a territory and \"within this territory the first culturefar from remainingstaticexpands, innovates, evolves, and reenacts the old, the inherited, thesource of roots, claims, and identity\" (Harris, 1994, p. 151-152). Indigenousprograms have carved out their territory and have established a wealth of goodresearch data on the pluses of bilingual education. They have done much toprove the theories the majority education system tosses around for argument.The majority society cannot successfully impose programs on the indigenousculture, but successful components from indigenous programs could be trans-ferred to the majority system for use in bilingual/bicultural education of otherminority groups and for the development of dual language programs to teach-ing minority languages to majority group members as minority group studentslearn the national language of their country. 260 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesReferencesAlberta Department of Education Cree Language and Culture Program Stud-ies.

Indigenous LanguagesLanguage of Critical Link BetweenEconomic Change and Language ShiftScott Palmeri During the Twentieth Century there has been a widespread pat-tern of language shift among the indigenous communities of the Unitedstates and Canada. This uniformity is surprising in light of the diver-sity of languages, geography, degree of physical isolation, history, andattitudes about language. I argue that there has been a widespreadchange in the language of work and that this quite possibly is a com-mon cause of much of the language shift. This language-of-work hy-pothesis is summarized as a causal chain leading from a shift in thestructure of work to a shift in language of the home. Communities inwhich parents train their children for life in a vernacular languagedominated work force are less likely to experience language shift inthe home. Most, if not all, of the remaining indigenous languages of the United Statesand Canada are considered to be endangered (see, for example, Krauss, 1996;Harmon, 1995a, 1995b). It is surprising that the same thing should be happen-ing to so many groups at the same time when we consider that the languagesthemselves are so different from each other, the attitudes about language reten-tion are different, the attitudes about the surrounding society are different, thegeography and degree of physical isolation are so different, and the historiesare so different. Why, with such diversity, are these languages in such a similarprecarious situation? Why is this happening so rapidly at this particular point inhistory? Finding an answer to these questions is important for the speakers ofthe remaining indigenous languages on this continent and in other parts of theworld, and it is important for anyone involved in education or language-relatedwork in these communities. 1An earlier edition of this paper was published as \"The Language of Work andthe Decline of North American Languages\" (Palmer, 1996). By now these ideashave been reviewed by many, whose advice and critique have resulted incontinouous overhaul of my ideas. Whatever the eventual disposition of thishypothesis, I have found the vigorous dialogue encouraging, and I have learneda lot. I am particularly indebted to Lynanne Palmer, Jaap Feenstra, Paul Lewis,and Nancy Dorian who gave insightful, detailed, and useful critique of theseideas. I doubt that I have accounted for all that they brought up, but the efforthas certainly resulted in improvement. 26327_7'. Teaching Indigenous LanguagesAlternative hypotheses on why languages are decliningThere are several possible hypotheses for explaining the decline of NorthAmerican indigenous languages in this century. First, their decline could becaused by primarily internal factors. According to this hypothesis, virtually allNorth American indigenous language groups held views and acted in ways thatbrought about the demise of their languages. But it is hard to understand whysuch a variety of different societies, with such a variety of ways of looking atthings, should all have views of language that caused them to abandon theirlanguages in this century. There seems to be a language loss pattern that is notexplained by group values about language and probably runs contrary to keyvalues in most groups. In particular I am thinking of the strong desire to protectand preserve the native language that is common among tribes in the South-west of the United States.Second, language loss could be caused primarily by external factors put-ting pressure on all of these different communities, but in such different waysthat there is no overall pattern to this pressure. Many different factors do seemto have a role in language shift. At two symposia in 1995, a variety of factorswere linked to language shift.1 While repressive language policies correlatedwith language shift, so did benevolent language policies. Similarly, the lack ofliteracy in the minority language is one of the factors that can hasten languageshift. But, it was mused, literacy in the minority language can correlate withlanguage shift as well. Even Vatican II was cited as having a role in one group.Yes, there are many relevant processes going on, but it is difficult to imaginethat the massive sweep of language shift in North America has resulted onlyfrom a random collection of external factors, without pattern.A third possibility is that there is a single external factor or pattern that hassparked at least a good portion of the language shift going on in North Americain this century. The problem is knowing what this external factor or patternmight be. For the most part, external factors, such as government or educa-tional programs, official repression or encouragement, and so forth have onlyan indirect impact on language maintenance. Ultimately, language maintenanceor loss is a function of the decisions and behavior of the speakers of the lan-guage themselves. This is captured most clearly and simply by Joshua Fishman's(1991) term intergenerational transfer. If each generation passes on the lan-guage to the next, the language lives. If it does not, the language dies. This is afamily matter. At heart it is about what language parents use when speaking totheir children.This paper explores the possibility that for North America, there is a gen-eral external pattern of events that is setting the stage for language shift. Spe-cifically, this paper proposes that a different kind of social change, a change inwork structure, has been catalytic to a change with regard to language withoutI Stabilizing Indigenous Languages Symposium, May 4-6, 1995, Flagstaff, AZ(see Cantoni, 1996) and Symposium on Language Loss and Public Policy, June30-July 2, 1995, University of New Mexico. 264 Teaching Indigenous Languageslanguage ever being a central focus. The change in work structure in NorthAmerica in this century is well known, and the pattern of language shift on thiscontinent is well documented among immigrant languages as well as amongindigenous languages. What has not yet been explored is the logical linkagebetween these two trends.I propose that the widespread pattern of language shift among indigenouscommunities in North America has its roots in a change in the language of workfor these communities. The change in the language of work has been the resultof key developments in the economic structure of the dominant society, changesin how indigenous community members relate to that structure, and ultimatelychanges in the ways in which the community organizes work.This change in the structure of work has a direct bearing on the lives andthoughts of the parents of young children. Their goal is to prepare their chil-dren for life. As it becomes increasingly necessary for community members towork at jobs that require the use of English, this results in revised perceptionson the part of parents regarding what training their children need in order tosurvive. So they talk to them in the national language instead of the indigenouslanguage, and the children grow up as first-language speakers of English.The rest of this paper develops the \"language-of-work hypothesis\" andexplores the relationship of this hypothesis to other factors influencing lan-guage maintenance and shift and to other language maintenance and shift theo-ries and case studies. It concludes with a discussion of potential problems andapplications and some thoughts on testing and developing the theory further.The language-of-work hypothesisBriefly stated, the hypothesis is: In a minority language community, if thenational or regional language is used as the language of work for virtually allthe \"jobs\"1 of the community that language will, within a few generations,replace the minority language as language of the home as well. There are sev-eral ways in which the term \"language of work\" can be used. As used in thistheory, language of work refers primarily to the language used to converse withwork colleagues and supervisors. A different language may be used for writingor dealing with customers.The language-of-work hypothesis links the economic history of the U.S.and Canada in this century with the language shift epidemic on this continentduring the same time frame by looking at one factor critical to both develop-ments. The logic for this is expressed primarily in what I describe as a causalchain of events. The setting for this chain of events is a particular change in theeconomic structure of the U.S. and Canada in the Twentieth Century.During the Twentieth Century, the U.S. and Canada have experienced asweeping change with regard to how work is organized. This is a change thesenations have in common with many others. Peter Drucker (1974, pp. 3-4) notes:II am including here both employment and othe means of providing a living,such as subsistence farming or hunting and trapping. 2652 7a: Teaching Indigenous LanguagesEvery major social task, whether economic performance or healthcare, education or the protection of the environment, the pursuit ofnew knowledge or defense, is today being entrusted to big organiza-tions, designed for perpetuity and managed by their own manage-ments ...Only seventy-five years ago such a society would have beeninconceivable. In the society of 1900 the family still served in everysingle country as the agent of, and organ for, most social tasks. Insti-tutions were few and small....society was diffused in countless mol-ecules: small workshops, small schools, the individual professionalwhether doctor or lawyerpracticing by himself, the farmer, thecraftsman, the neighborhood retail store, and so on ...The citizen of today in every developed country is typically anemployee. He works for one of the institutions. He looks to them forhis livelihood. He looks to them for his opportunities. He looks tothem for access to status and function in society, as well as for per-sonal fulfillment and achievement.The structuring of work largely through institutions has implications for thelanguage of the workplace. An institution, whether government, business, edu-cational, or other, tends toward use of a common language. Further, there isautomatically a built-in pressure toward increased dependence on written lan-guage. This may imply that a higher level of competence in general is neededin the language of the workplace. Meanwhile, the shift from small family-basedwork units to institutions implies changes in social network for the workers.This probably weakens the minority language's \"resistance\" to language shift(see below). This change in the dominant society is the backdrop for significantchanges in Native American communities on this continent.There is a series of steps leading from a shift in the structure of work, to ashift in the language of work, to a shift in the language of the home. At no pointin this causal chain is it assumed that community members wish to see theirlanguage die out. The entire process is motivated by concerns other than lan-guage.The first step involved indigenous language groups in North America mov-ing gradually from kinship-based economies to involvement in the surroundingwage-based economic system. Traditionally these language communities havehad kinship-based economic systems that allowed community members to usethe indigenous language in the workplace.'1In trying to understand the change in economic systems experienced by Na-tive American communities, I found Eric R. Wolf's 1982 book Europe and thePeople Without History to be helpful. Wolf is an anthropologist writing abouteconomic history. He contrasts the capitalist economic system with kinship-based and tributary-based (feudal) economic systems and examines all of this inthe light of earlier economic developments (mostly from about 1,000 AD on). 266'Th.rycd Teaching Indigenous LanguagesDuring the last half of this century, owing to a variety of factors, signifi-cant portions of the population of many indigenous communities have becomeparticipants in the wage-based economy of the surrounding society. In this re-gard, Christine Sims (1995) has pointed out the significance of participation inthe armed forces during World War II, as well as a post World War II federalrelocation program in which Native Americans moved from reservations tourban areas for years at a time.In some cases the surrounding society has moved in closer and more pri-vate sector jobs have become available. Various government and other pro-grams such as education, social services, and construction have provided em-ployment as well. Meanwhile, opportunities for supplying needs through tradi-tional work have often decreased or changed, increasing the need for employ-ment in the wage-based economy.The second step occurs when a significant portion of community membersneed to use a language other than their mother tongue in their place of work.Whether the work is related to health, education, construction, administration,or industry, most employment has generally required the use of English (orFrench in Quebec). This is in marked contrast to the traditional work environ-ment.The third step is a change in views in regard to what language skills chil-dren are likely to need in order to prepare for the future. As more and moreNative Americans have participated in the national economy, the language re-quired in the workplace has become, in some sense, the language of survivalfor their communities. By language of survival I mean the language people seeas essential for the meeting of basic needs. The definition of basic needs may,and probably will, change over time. Community members may find that theyhave an expanded list of needs and that traditional economic activity cannotadequately meet them. At the same time, other kinds of jobs may be more ac-cessible, while the actual opportunities for earning a living through traditionalmeans may be shrinking.Since parents are concerned with preparing their children for future life,the language they encourage children to learn will be influenced by their per-ceptions of what language skills are required to meet life's basic needs. Thiswas illustrated in a conversation with a bilingual mother who worked very hardto give her daughter good skills in English and who sees proficiency and lit-eracy in English as central to her daughter's future. Similarly, a colleague wroteme, \"Different Gwich' in men from time to time have told me that they arespeaking English to their kids, so that the kids won't have a hard time on theirjobs like they [the fathers] did, because they boss' orders[in English]\" (Richard Mueller, personal communication).The fourth step is that in this environment some parents make the nationallanguage the language of their children. This eventually puts pressure on therest of the community, and English increasingly becomes the common meansof communication. In a snowball effect, the indigenous language is used less,with the result that younger speakers have fewer opportunities for continued 267 Teaching Indigenous Languageslanguage learning and so may plateau out without having learned some of themore advanced features typically acquired in late childhood. This is in additionto the fact that participation in school automatically limits their time with adultspeakers at this period of their lives.Meanwhile, the indigenous language has often been esteemed as the lan-guage of heritage, even while being replaced by the national language. English,as the language of survival, may be used simply because it is needed for func-tioning in the workplace to earn a living. It is often valued because of what itaccomplishes, not for what it represents. The language of heritage (indigenouslanguage), in contrast, has often been held in high regard for what it is and forwhat it represents. Use, not high regard, is what perpetuates a language, so alanguage of heritage may decline even while being held in high regard.The fifth and final step is the arrival of a generation of children who arepredominantly first-language speakers of the national language. Language shifthas become obvious, but the process began well before this point. This is thepoint at which a community typically realizes it has a problem with languageshift.Key characteristics of the language-of-work hypothesisFirst, the language-of-work hypothesis describes a multigenerational phe-nomenon. Language of work patterns in one generation impact community lan-guage use two or three generations later, which is consistent with the workdone analyzing language loss among American immigrants (Veltman, 1983).Second, the language-of-work hypothesis describes a phenomenon operat-ing at the level of community-wide language use. It is a theory of communitylanguage loss. It is not about what happens to all parents but to a critical num-ber of parents, laying a foundation for a change in the group use of language infuture generations in that community. The language-of-work hypothesis pre-dicts that some will respond by making the work language the first language oftheir children and that a few such parents in one generation are sufficient to setin motion a process that eventually makes indigenous language learning verydifficult in the community a couple of generations later.Third, the language of work is not the only cause of language shift. Twoexamples illustrate that language shift can occur without being preceded by achange in the language of work. In a very intriguing paper on Gaulish, BrigitteL. M. Bauer (1995) discusses the situation that led to the loss of that language.While there is probably a lot we cannot know about something that happenedso long ago, it is reasonable to guess language of work could have been anissue for the leaders who needed to use Latin to fit in with the Roman adminis-tration, but probably not for the Gaulish speaking population at large. Simi-larly, in a small Athapaskan village, language shift seems to be preceding achange in the language of work (Jaap Feenstra, personal communication).Fourth, the language-of-work hypothesis predicts that prestige and collec-tive self esteem, or lack thereof, are not key factors for language maintenanceor shift. Language pride on the part of the speakers is commendable and cer-2268 Teaching Indigenous Languagestainly an asset for any language. But an adequate theory regarding languagemaintenance and shift in the U.S. and Canada in this century needs to take intoaccount the array of positive and negative language attitudes that accompany aremarkably uniform pattern of steady language decline. Meanwhile this, or asimilar theory, may be valuable tools for any who are strongly motivated tobuild a safer environment for their language. That for me is a strong motivationfor working on such theories in the first place.Fifth, the language-of-work hypothesis may apply equally to groups thatplace a low value on material things and to those who aggressively seek toacquire a higher standard of living. Language of work is operative not based onparents' attraction to material goods but on their desire to prepare their childrenfor life. Severe need may intensify the impact of language of work, but the rootmotivation is in the love of parents for their children, not a desire to accumu-late.Sixth, language shift, in this view, is not something that is the topic ofdecision but the unintended consequence of decisions about some of life's highestduties and obligations.The language-of-work hypothesis may at first glance seem to be painting apicture of people being caught up in processes over which they have no con-trol. Instead, it is suggesting that there will be a certain amount of predictabilityin the way people make decisions in similar environments. However, the sub-ject and timing of our choices are sometimes quite removed from the subjectand timing of the consequences of those choices. People are indeed thinkingand making decisions based on deeply felt values that are directed at preparingtheir children for life. Some of those decisions wind up having language shiftimplications, but they were not primarily language choices.That something so valuable as language can be lost without even being infocus is evidence of just how important children are to their parents. I wasfascinated by the story of our guide on a tour in Israel. She spoke flawlessEnglish, reflecting the fact that she grew up in South Africa and was educatedin England. Her parents had originally come from Lithuania and spoke Englishas a second language, while her son grew up in Israel speaking Hebrew. Shenoted that her parents are proud of her English, and her son is embarrassed tohave her speak her accented Hebrew in front of his friends. Obviously eachgeneration in this family was giving high priority to training the next genera-tion for the world in which they could expect to live. All three generations werethus launched in life from different linguistic platforms.Other accelerators and retardants of language shiftThe language-of-work hypothesis identifies one factor common in NorthAmerica that has a logical link to the thinking of parents and may be expectedto spark language shift. But the language of work is not the only factor in-volved. Many factors impact language vitality. Some factors speed up the pro-cess of language shift. Accelerators tend to relate to the linkage between the 269 Teaching Indigenous Languageslocal community and the surrounding society. Accelerators include anythingthatincreases access to the surrounding society,increases the attractiveness of participating in that society's eco-nomic system, orweakens the indigenous language-learning environment of childrenand young adults.Examples of accelerators of language shift include improved communica-tion and transportation, which have the effect of increasing the relative proxim-ity of the minority community to the surrounding culture. Radio and televisionare part of the benefits acquired through the dominant economic system. Theyincrease the attraction of participating in the dominant economic system andprovide increased exposure to the dominant language. With the advent of ruralTV reception (especially with video and satellite dish technology), increas-ingly now this exposure to language includes the women, children, and elderlywho are at home. This also has the potential of interfering with children's lan-guage learning.Elaborated local educational and governmental administrative structurescan also accelerate language shift by creating more jobs requiring English inthe community. In some communities, the educational and governmental posi-tions may be a major source of employment. All of these may require the use ofthe national language in the workplace. National-language education also tendsto disrupt children's indigenous-language acquisition. Each generation has itslanguage-learning opportunities severely reduced at the point when childrenenter the educational system. Indigenous-language features typically acquiredin late childhood and young adulthood may be lost or modified.1 Effectively,the language tends to become splintered into generationally differentiated dia-lects, and thus becomes less able to serve as a community-wide vehicle forcommunication. Local education in English can have this effect to some de-gree. Boarding schools are considerably more damaging since students are notaround adult speech in their mother tongue for months at a time. Often literacyand education function as stepping stones to employment using English.Government policies can also accelerate language shift. English-only poli-cies at boarding schools seem to have had mixed results. Some people haveresponded by valuing their language more highly and passing it on more delib-erately. I recall a conversation with person who told me about having been This was the subject of several papers at the Symposium on Language Lossand Public Policy, including The attrition of Inuttut as a first language by IreneMazurkewich, Where have all the verbs gone? Attrition in the Ll verbal systemby Dorit Kaufman, and Differential effects of L2 on by Ludmila Dutkova.284270 Teaching Indigenous Languagesdisciplined for using a Native American language in a boarding school and yetwho is raising children in that language. At the 1995 Symposium on StabilizingIndigenous Languages we heard the opposite logic also, that having been sub-jected to such pain, some parents want to protect their children from that expe-rience. They have thus not passed the language on to their children. This makesme think that perhaps in a community that is retaining the language, languagerepression may give added rationale to language maintenance, while in a com-munity that is well underway in language shift, language repression may giveadded rationale for the shift. It could be expected that those government poli-cies that impact the economic integration of a minority community have moresignificant implications for language shift than do policies that either encour-age or discourage use of the indigenous language.Significant numbers of marriages between speakers and non-speakers canalso hasten language shift.' Whereas in previous eras such newcomers and theirchildren would learn the local language, once a community is oriented towardemployment using a different language there is no longer much point to learn-ing the indigenous language.Language etiquette about speaking in front of non-speakers can also con-tribute to language shift. When there are non-speakers around, speakers in somecultures may feel uncomfortable using their language, or feel it is impolite.This is a minor problem at first, but becomes increasingly problematic as fewerand fewer people in the community speak the indigenous language. RichardMueller noted two different conversations in which Gwich'in men illustratedthe importance of not using the language when somebody present could notunderstand. One of them \"determined never to speak his language around peoplewho didn't understand it\" (personal communication).Intolerance or other negative attitudes on the part of a dominant societytoward minority languages is another factor. Nancy Dorian (1994, p. 119) notes,\"Discussions of the history of assimilation of immigrant groups in the U.S.often overlook the watershed effect of World War I in ethnic language mainte-nance. After the outbreak of that war public attitudes toward German becamesuddenly and strongly hostile.\" This was in contrast to a previously very favor-able environment. The change impacted other languages as well.Some of the accelerators of language shift, given enough time, may besufficient to cause language shift without a shift in economic systems. It isprobable, in fact, that in some North American communities a gradual lan-guage shift process was already underway when the economic system shifted,introducing a change in the language of work and the accelerated languageshift which that brings.Other factors retard language shift. Retardants tend to be values, struc-tures, and practices in the community's culture and life that resist changes from1Marshall and Jean Holdstock view this as being a very imporant factor forlanguage shift among the Beaver of British Columbia (personal communica-tion). 271riby li CJ Teaching Indigenous Languages the outside or strengthen the indigenous language learning opportunities ofchildren and young adults. If a structure maintains or creates an environment inwhich the indigenous language remains the language of work, then languageshift could perhaps be effectively blocked. Apart from this it may only be sloweddown.Examples of language shift retardants include religious use of a language.'This factor has been observed with regard to Pennsylvania Dutch among theAmish, where language vitality is high.2 It is also an important factor, for ex-ample, among Pueblo groups in the U.S. Southwest.Sheer population size can be a retardant, though it is no guarantee of safety.Participants at the 1995 Symposium on Stabilizing Indigenous Languages wereconcerned that even the Navajo language, despite a very large community ofspeakers, is undergoing rapid language shift.3 Joseph Grimes (1995) notes thatcritical size regarding language endangerment seems to be different in differentparts of the world.Linguistic similarity can also contribute to language maintenance. Wherethe dominant language and minority language are sufficiently similar, bilin-gualism may be more easily maintained than where they are radically different.This has been noted as a factor in the maintenance of Frisian in The Nether-lands (Jaap Feenstra, personal communication).The continued viability of a traditional means of earning a living can be animportant retardant. I wonder if Native American communities with relativelystrong language vitality might not be gaining a substantial portion of their in-come through work that can be done using the local language. One immigrantlanguage situation, Franconian German in Michigan, remained strong from themid 1800's until the late 1950's, probably as a direct result of being a relativelyisolated community with an economy revolving around individual family farms(Born, 1992).The Amish and Hutterites have gone further and have chosen to limit theparticipation of community members in the major language job market, forreligious reasons. Among the Hutterites this non-participation in the English-lEdwards (1985,p. 93), in a discussion of the role of economics in languageshift, notes \"There are cases in which the application of simple cost-benefitanalysis does not explain language shift or retention. One of these relates togroups in which language is indissolubly tied to a central pillar of life reli-gion being the obvious example.\"zHank Hershberger, personal communication. He felt this was a very impor-tant factor in language vitality.3This is also the view of things reflected in Crawford (1992, p. 245), \"In 1970,it was hard to find a member of the Navajo Nation unable to speak Navajo;twenty years later it is not unusual for children to grow up speaking only En-glish, even in isolated communities.\" 272 Teaching Indigenous Languagesspeaking job market is very complete. Among the Amish there are a few whonow need to work outside the group, owing to a shortage of farms. IA multigenerational schedule of language shiftThe language-of-work hypothesis deals with the roots of the epidemic oflanguage shift in North America. The question arises, \"What sort of scheduledoes all of this follow?\" For immigrants to the U.S., language shift seems tohave been following a three generation pattern, which has more recently beenreduced to two generations.For an indigenous community the timing may be different, even assumingthat language of work has a similar role in each. For immigrants, language shiftoccurs for a family or set of families who have moved. In the case of indig-enous languages, the shift occurs for an entire community that has not movedbut whose environment has changed. The timing itself may be difficult to stateprecisely. In general, I would guess the scenario might play out in this way:First generation1.Changes in the economic system of a community, and specificallychanges in the language of work, signal the beginning of the shift, butthere are no alarming linguistic changes at that point.2Following this, it is likely that only \"early adopters\" will begin to steertheir children toward the dominant language, resulting in a few casesof somebody either growing up without learning the indigenous lan-guage, or preferring the dominant society's language.Intermediate generation(s)3.At some point, newcomers to the community (spouses in mixed mar-riages primarily) no longer routine learn the indigenous language.4.When a substantial proportion of the community follows the lead ofthe early adopters, the first hints of the end of intergenerational trans-fer show up.5.Meanwhile, some families continue on strongly valuing and using theindigenous language, although schooling in the national language re-duces the language learning potential for even these children.Last generation of community language use6.At some point, the use of the indigenous language for much of com-munity life becomes impractical, and opportunities for language ac-quisition diminish even more as a result. I Hank Hershberger, personal communication. Neither group is experienc-ing language loss, though Hank sees the language retention situation asbeing stronger for the Hutterites 2732 Teaching Indigenous Languages 7.At about this time, both the community and outsiders can tell that thelanguage is in danger of being lost.8.Changes appear to be happening rapidly, and perhaps unexpectedly.For any group that is experiencing in some measure a loss of intergenerationaltransfer, the community is probably well beyond the point at which the firstchanges in the language of the workplace occurred. By then, other factors maybe more prominent as they obviously speed up or slow down the process that isalready under way.Some related theories and examplesStephen Schooling (1990), building on the work of Leslie Milroy (1988)and using a survey of language maintenance in New Caledonia, presents a goodargument for the usefulness of social network theory for predicting languagemaintenance or shift. In social network analysis, language is treated as a toolfor network maintenance. Describe the network and you have learned some-thing about language use, and thus gained hints about language vitality andfuture use. This does in fact seem to fit the way most people use language. Inthe case of New Caledonian languages, Schooling first discovered by detailedsurvey that the indigenous languages were very much alive and well, and thendemonstrated how the same result would have been predicted (with less effort)using social network analysis. The social network analysis actually gives a bet-ter picture of how the language is doing today, which way it is going, and whereit is likely to end up.Applying all this to language of work, I note that occupation (whetherwage employment or other means of making a living) is a network \"cluster\"that requires perhaps 50% of an adult worker's waking hours. It is the mainenvironment in which time will be spent with other adults. Meanwhile, in thekind of economic system we have, work in the wage-based economy is more orless obligatory for at least one parent, and often for both parents in each family.So, where English is the language of work, both the social (relating to fellowworkers) and economic pressure is there to help prepare children to relate inEnglish. While I did not encounter an emphasis on language of work in eitherMilroy's or Schooling's work, I noted that when Milroy came up with fivepoints for describing a person's social network, three of the five criteria had todo with fellow workers.Perhaps the most significant link between network theory and the language-of-work hypothesis is the observation that the change in this century to work ininstitutions automatically increases the chances that the average worker willwork with people who are different from his or her neighbors and relatives. Insocial network terms this creates a sparse and uniplex network, which is theopposite of the dense and multiplex network that Schooling demonstrates to bea stable environment for language maintenance.Taking a different tack, Roland Walker (1993) looks at Abraham Maslow's(1970) \"hierarchy of need\" as a good predictor of language maintenance or2E3274BEST COPYAVAILABLE Teaching Indigenous Languagesloss. \"From his study of healthy human beings, Maslow identified five catego-ries of basic needs that motivate human behavior: 1) physiological needs, 2)safety, 3) belongingness, 4) esteem, and 5) self-actualization\" (Walker, 1993,p. 80). In Maslow's theory, safety needs are not as powerful as physiologicalneeds, and so on. Applying this to language use, Walker notes: \"The value ofapplying Maslow's Hierarchy to questions of language choice is in its potentialto take us beyond external social circumstances to probe the circumstances ofthe heartthe motivations and felt needs of communities undergoing LS [Lan-guage Shift]. Understanding how language is used to meet basic needs helps toexplain why communities respond differently to the same external socialforcesspecifically, why one group undergoes LS and another does not\" (1993,p. 86).In North America since many indigenous communities have largely losttheir land base or no longer find traditional means of support practical or ad-equate, participation in the wage-based economy has become very importantfor meeting needs up and down the hierarchy. In this context, work-relatedissues become a strong source of motivationand this includes the languageskills needed for the specific work environment.Numerous case studies and other articles illustrate the significance of thelanguage of work for language maintenance and shift. In a fascinating articleabout St. Barthelemy island (West Indies), Julianne Maher (1996) tracks thehistory of language development on the 15-square-mile island over a period ofseveral hundred years. The residents of the island, which was settled by theFrench in the 17th century, by now make up \"four distinct communities that donot share each other's speech codes; such linguistic fragmentation in a smallisolated population is unusual\" (1996, p. 374). The author shows that one endof the island was inhabited largely by fishermen whose dense and multiplexnetwork of work relationships resulted in language stability (they spoke a dia-lect of French). Another part of the island at one time consisted of plantations,resulting in a different type of work environment and therefore different net-work constraints, in which a creole quite naturally became the dominant lan-guage. The port town population meanwhile spoke English, the language oftrade for the region. A fourth section spoke a different French-based language.The languages continued strong until recently, when the economic situation forthe entire island shifted as a result of the arrival of new residents and a shift toa tourism economy. Now all four languages are under pressure, mostly fromstandard French. Maher concludes that all of these language developments werelinked historically to the type of social network, and that this was stronglylinked to the specific type of local economydifferent in various parts of theisland. She reconstructs the economic history of the island, showing how all ofthis may have developed.The controversial 1977 language legislation of Quebec: Bill 101, the Char-ter of the French Language also provides insights. Language of work was afocus in this legislation. According to Miller (1984), 275 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesThe key targets of the Charter of the French Language were, first,to make French the language of work at the operational level; second,to spur the use of French as a language of business between corporatebodies in Quebec; and third, to ensure that individual customers areserved in the language of their choice.Except in high technology industries with North American orworldwide sales, the implementation of means to achieve these tar-gets has modified substantially the linguistic requirements into theQuebec market. (p. 128)The results of these language maintenance efforts in Quebec stand in stark con-trast to the prevailing pattern of steady language decline elsewhere in NorthAmerica.It could be that language of work is also a significant factor in languageretention or loss for the Sarni of Scandinavia. A number of papers (e.g., Collis,1990) show a difference in the language vitality of those on the coast workingin the wage-based economy using the national language and those inland whocontinue to herd reindeer. Other studies seem to point to the significance oflanguage of work as well. Susan Gal (1978) documents the desire of youngHungarian women in Austria to be part of the worker class and the wage-basedeconomy (which requires use of German) rather than to remain peasants work-ing on family farms, which allows continued work use of Hungarian.Addressing some potential difficulties and limitationsThe language-of-work hypothesis focuses on why people acquire Englishbut does not explain why they would drop their own languages. That is, it leavesunexplored the possibility that people may, in fact, want to pursue bilingual-ism. But I think that a pattern in which most parents relate to their childrenprimarily in a language different from their own leaves the indigenous lan-guage vulnerable. The language of work displaces something vital to the sur-vival of that language, and so is probably sufficient to predict language loss.If insiders, primarily parents, teach the inside language, and outsiders teachthe outside language, then stable bilingualism would seem to be an option.Both languages have an anchor; both are important to the next generation. Butwhat would hold it in balance, if instead, parents feel they need to relate to theirchildren in the outside language? Joshua Fishman notes, \"Vernaculars are ac-quired in infancy, in the family, which means in intimacy. They are handed onthat way, in intimacy and in infancy\" (1996, p. 192). If there is truly to be stablebilingualism, then the indigenous language needs that kind of continuing foun-dation. Clifton Pye (1992, p. 80), writing about Chilcotin of British Columbia,observes, \"The competition from English is so severe that a child has to receiveonly Chilcotin from his/her parents in order to learn it.\"Hypotheses, such as language-of-work, are not easy to confirm or disprove.There is a virtual fruit salad of factors involved in language shift. Many thingsare happening at once so it is difficult to clearly identify the specific role of one 276F=0 Teaching Indigenous Languagesfactor or another. Further, this hypothesis does not claim to apply to every indi-vidual, nor does it necessarily apply over only one or two generations. Rather,it describes a situation that nearly always ignites, in a handful of parents, acourse of action that leads, through accommodation and other clustering phe-nomena, to irreversible language shift for an entire community a few genera-tions later. I think of the linkage between the language of work and languageshift as being perhaps analogous to the linkage between air conditioners andhair spray on the one hand and the depletion of the ozone layer on the otherhand. That linkage between chlorofluorocarbons and ozone, once suggested,was not quickly confirmed.Post-shift language maintenance should be differentIf a language is well documented before or during the process of languageshift and is diligently passed on to younger speakers as a second language, thelanguage can live on even after there are no more first-language speakers of thelanguage. But maintenance of the indigenous language as a second language isnot the same as maintaining the language with first-language speakers. Differ-ent constraints apply. At this point, maintaining the language has become some-thing with its own focus, rather than a tool for survival.In this scenario, each generation continues to make the dominant languagethe first language of their children, who then participate fully in the dominanteconomic system. Simultaneously they pass on to some or all community mem-bers knowledge of the traditional language as a second language. This wasdone with Hebrew for centuries in many communities around the world. A reli-gious system emphasizing written Hebrew was essential to this process. Therecame, then, a time when it was possible to revive community use of the lan-guage as the main vehicle of communication. Today, Hebrew is the language ofwork and life in Israel. It remains to be seen if any Native American Languagescan be maintained with only second-language speakers.'Possible applications of the language-of-work hypothesisFirst, the language-of-work hypothesis may help in the search for solu-tions to language shift in North America. If the change that is happening oper-ates as this theory presents it, can any minority language group in North Americaavoid language shift? It would appear that in general, only the largest languagegroups, and even then probably only those with considerable resources, will beable to maintain the indigenous language as the language of work and simulta-neously provide a range of job opportunities to their speech community. Thislines up with what is being said generally about language endangerment andgroup size (see for example Krauss, 1996; Harmon 1995a, 1995b; Grimes, 1995).I have no idea what the minimum requirements are for this but observe that, forlA related question is, \"If a language is not written, can it still be successfullymaintained as a second language?\" 2772 9 1 Teaching Indigenous Languagesexample, Israel has accomplished this with regard to Hebrew and Quebec isworking hard to maintain that level of support for French.For a smaller group the challenge is immense. What can be done to createor maintain a core of structures that encourage the indigenous language as thelanguage of work and still provide the means to live at an acceptable standardof living through the purchasing of outside goods and services? Of course asmall community can close the door entirely. By limiting itself to the econom-ics of its traditional history, or some other self-contained system, a communitycan maintain a tight ship with regard to the language of work. But this impliesa very cohesive society with tight social control that defines the economic ho-rizons of community members. That social limitation would seem to be a veryhigh price to pay for language vitality, and it must be maintained within thelaws of Western democracies that stress individual freedom.But, as with chlorofluorocarbons and ozone, could it be that there are lessdrastic measures that would work? We still have air conditioners and spraycans. But we put different things in them now. Similarly, could it be that wemay eventually understand enough about language shift that communities canboth give a good standard of living and career opportunities to their childrenand yet still maintain their languages? That is, could it be that minority groupscould learn to preserve their languages in an environment automatically dan-gerous to those languages? I think that may be possible (see Appendix).Perhaps a group can effectively address the issue with a combination ofsolutions. For one thing, there could be an effort to raise parents' consciousnessof the issues and encourage a commitment to language maintenance alongsidetheir commitment to their children's preparation for work life.1 Nancy Dorian(1995) discusses the importance of sharing knowledge about just how languagemaintenance and shift work with those who need that information most. Sec-ondly, communities could seek to offer at least some minority-language jobopportunities. In considering new economic development projects for example,a community could deliberately examine the language of work impact of pro-spective economic ventures, perhaps inviting only local economic developmentthat can be structured as promoting work use of the minority language. AlanSproull (1996, p. 94), for example, explores the possibility of \"minority lan-guage use in the process of regional economic development.\" Sproull arguesthis would actually benefit the nation's economy, not just the region.Both Amish and Hutterite communities have some types of enterprisesthat retain the local language as the language of work and yet bring in revenueneeded to buy outside goods and services. These communities may serve asmodels to Native American communities interested in accomplishing the samething.'Similarly, the therapy for stuttering includes raising the awareness in the speakerof what he or she is doing. Language phenomena are so close to us that some-times it requires extra effort just to become aware of them. Awareness is, infact, a large part of the battle. 2782\"`' Teaching Indigenous LanguagesSecond, the language-of-work hypothesis may help us understand why lan-guage shift is or is not happening in some other parts of the world. If this hy-pothesis is correct, this kind of language shift epidemic can be expected tooccur in other regions where indigenous language groups experience similarchanges in economic structure and therefore the language of work. The worldis moving away from kinship-based economies, and it can be expected that theeconomic pressure toward language shift is being felt in more and more places.It is likely, though, that since economic changes are happening at different ratesand in different ways in different places, changes in language of work require-ments, and therefore, pressure on language vitality, would be different.Perhaps we could learn to read the economic and demographic data on aregion or a country in such a way as to get clues about where to expect lan-guage shift to be an issue. This, in turn, may help give advance warning togroups likely to be facing language shift, while they still have time to do some-thing about it. Joshua Fishman (1996) stresses the importance of acting early.SummaryI have argued that in the U.S. and Canada there has been a widespreadchange in the economic structure of indigenous language communities duringthe last half of the Twentieth Century and that this has involved a change in thelanguage of work for a significant portion of the community. In that parents areconcerned with preparing their children for life, a change in expectation aboutthe language of work has resulted in a change in what language parents usewith their children. At first only a few parents may respond this way, but thechange builds momentum in combination with other language shift factors.Meanwhile, the change continues to be reinforced through the continued domi-nance of the national language in the workplace. In contrast, communities inwhich parents train their children for life in a minority-language-dominatedwork environment are less likely to experience this shift in the language of thehome.The hypothesis needs to be tested. If it is true, then we should not be ableto find evidence of a minority language holding stable as a first language with-out evidence of language shift in an environment in which the minority lan-guage has not been used as the language of work among its population for sometime (at least 3 or 4 generations). The lack of such a counter-example wouldnot, of course, prove the theory, but finding one would certainly prompt eitherthe scrapping or revision of the theory. If the main hypothesis stands up, then anumber of additional areas need to be filled in. Among them:Define the matter of timing between economic shift (and in par-ticular changes in the language of work) and the steps in languageshift.Study how different employment patterns play out in relationshipto language shift. For example, one pattern is to enter a career andwork in it for years at a time; another is to go out of the community 2792 S S. Teaching Indigenous Languagesa few months at a time to work; another is to work one job for afew years, wait out a year or two while other extended family mem-bers work, then do another job for a few years, and so on. It may bethat different employment patterns have different levels of impacton language shift.Determine what happens when a community can offer a signifi-cant number of jobs that are based on employment using the indig-enous language. Does this result in language maintenance? Do allthe jobs have to be in the indigenous language for there to be lan-guage stability?

A group already working on language maintenance in other ways may beable to reinforce those efforts by addressing language of work issues as well.I would suggest using five questions that test a work environment forspeakers of a minority language:1. Does the worker rely on the cash economy for most food and othernecessities?2. Does the worker work for wages in an environment controlled bysomebody else?3. Is the work done in an environment with other workers who do notspeak this indigenous language?4. Is a different language the most frequently used language for con-versations with other workers, supervisors, and subordinates?5. Does the work require either commuting or living outside of theindigenous language community?Using the five questions above, it is possible to predict the following typesof work environments (see figure 1):Type A: Strongly supportive of minority language social network mainte-nanceQuestions 2-5 are answered NOThe Worker is free to establish his or her own work environment, andis under no pressure to use a different language in a work environ-ment.Type B: Supportive of minority language social network maintenance-Questions 4 and 5 are answered NOThe Worker is frequently able to use his or her own language to con-verse with fellow workers in the work environment.Type C: Erodes minority language social network maintenance -Questions1- 4 (and possibly 5) are answered YESThe Worker rarely uses his or her own language in the workplace toconverse with fellow workers.Language of work can be used as a leading indicator for language mainte-nance or loss. Quite frequently people do not realize their community is going 22)284 Teaching Indigenous Languagesthrough a process of language shift until the process is nearing the end. Anyreliable leading indicator of language maintenance or shift would be of help.A community with a good percentage of workers working in environ-ment type A is currently not likely to suffer pressure on the minoritylanguage from the work environment.A community in which nearly all workers are working in environmenttype C is likely to experience pressure on the minority language fromthe work environment.Language of work can also be used as a means of evaluating prospectivecommunity economic development proposals. Some approaches to economicdevelopment may hasten language shift even as they bring better jobs and higherincome. But it probably does not have to be that way. Ideally a communityshould be able to find adequate employment, and do so in such a way as to notput pressure on their language.From a language maintenance point of view, an economic developmentproposal that would result in Type A and B work environments wouldbe more desirable than a proposal that would result in a Type C workenvironment.Some kinds of work are easily adaptable to a Type A or B work environ-ment. Others are not.If a community wishes to develop the majority of jobs as Type A or Bwork environments, it will probably require serious development of thelanguage, and perhaps of workers' literacy skills in the indigenous lan-guage. All the needed work terms, and perhaps work-related readingand writing tasks, should be possible using the indigenous language.The kernel thought in all of this is that working languages live. Languageof work is something that can be studies and planned, as a tool for languagemaintenance. 2852SJ Teaching Indigenous LanguagesAppendix BTypes Language of Work Environments The worker ...Relies onWorks A.Local work environments which STRONGLY SUPPORT minority languagesocial network maintenance (work environment controlled by individual worker):Type A-1 bidimuelcontrol of La ci WorkSubsistence agriculture, fishing, etc. NONONONONO Type A-2Individual omtrol dig of WorkSmall cash farmer. fisherman, trapper, etc.YESNONONONOType B.Local work environments which SUPPORT minority language socialnetwork maintenance (minority lan ua e established as language of work).TypeB-1 Lg of work sat by Mow speakerEmployee of local monolingual business,or farm using minority languageas language of workYESYESNONONO Type B-2 Lb ba worb yet by wow vasbam YESEmployee of locally owned multi-lingualinstitution controlled by spoken of theminority Lgo, with minority Lg anlanguage of workYESYESNONO Type B-3Lg or work eat by Mow speakersYESEmployee of non-locally owned multi-lingual institution controlled locally byspeakers of the minority LG. with minorityLO as language of workYESYESNONO Type C.Local and non-local Work environments which ERODE minority languagecial network maintenance (a different tan cage established as Ian ua e of work):Type C-1Different Lg of work tot bycommunity members.

St. Clair The concept of cultural awareness is discussed within the contextof the recent commercial changes in America. Three cultural changeshave taken place since the turn of the century: the construction of theconsumer culture, the urbanization of America, and the marketing ofAmerica. Those who are not aware of these shifts risk the chance ofbecoming engulfed in them. For them the doors between their cultureand the business cultures of America remain invisible and subject toentrapment. Hence, one can be protected from cultural loss by beingaware of these surrounding host cultures. Many presenters at this conference have voiced concern about the forcesthat are causing their indigenous languages to disappear. It is my intent to ad-dress those very concerns. I want to discuss the structure of modern Americanculture. In our own lifetimes, there have been three major shifts in Americanculture. Around the turn of the century, American culture represented the superrich. It was a culture of the few, by the few, and for the few. This culture changedvery rapidly into a \"consumer culture\" during the second decade of this cen-tury. By the end of the Second World War, it was an integral part of ModernAmerica. The second major shift in American culture came about at the end ofthe War when General Motors put pressure on the American government tobuild more highways in order to sell cars. This phase is called the \"urbanizationof America\" because people moved out of the inner city and into the suburbs.This situation was ideal as it meant that they had to drive to work every day.Modern American Culture is now located in Suburbia. The final shift in Ameri-can culture is currently taking place. It is spearheaded by Business Schools inthis country that are training their students in the science of marketing. This\"marketing of America\" constitutes the current phase of American culture be-cause business schools are actively recruiting students from other countries inorder to train them in the marketing of the business of culture (Ishii & St. Clair,1996).You are probably wondering why I am addressing the structure of ModernAmerican Culture when this is a conference on stabilizing indigenous languages.There are several reasons for this focus. The first has to do with the fact thatmany crucial changes have taken place in American culture and they have beendone quietly and effectively. These changes provide us with a model of rapidcultural change that can be used by us to save our indigenous languages. Thesecond reason for discussing Modern American Culture is that it provides uswith an instrument for cultural analysis. We can understand our own culture bycomparing it and contrasting it with another. If the culture of opposition is not 287301 Teaching Indigenous Languagesclearly defined in our minds, it will absorb us. We need to know when we areleaving our home culture in order to enter into another way of life. We need toknow when we are leaving that host culture we return to our indigenous way oflife.There is an invisible door separating cultures. We need to sense that silentpassage from one culture to another. We need to know that the door betweenthese cultures are not closed. By understanding the structure of Modern Ameri-can Culture, we can more readily reenter our home cultures. This is my reasonfor discussing the global social forces behind Modern American Culture.The creation of the consumer cultureIn 1915 something happened in America to change it forever. A small groupof corporate executives met to discuss a crisis in their own business world. Itappears that their factories had overproduced. Their warehouses were full ofunsold products. The very rich were no longer buying their products. They hada crisis in overproduction. These business men approached the Ford Founda-tion for help. After a series of \"brain storming\" sessions, the sociology depart-ment of the Ford Foundation came up with a brilliant idea. They argued that theworkday should be drastically reduced from 60 hours to 48 and that workersshould be given larger salaries (Ewen, 1977). Now why would these businessmen be so generous? Why would they cut their own profits and share theirwealth with the working class? It appears that these men did have ulterior mo-tives. They created shopping centers (emporia) where their own products weresold. By having more money and more time to shop, the factory worker wasable to purchase the very items that they produced at work. Advertisers werebrought in to ensure that workers would be enticed by these luxury items(Sennett, 1978).We should recall that over 11 million immigrants entered the United Statesaround the turn of the century and these people resisted the new trends inAmerica. To counter this resistance, the advertisers purchased and controlled70% of all foreign newspapers in order to have direct access to these immi-grants in their own native languages. When they noted how these Europeanimmigrants resisted changes that were good for business, they directed theiradvertising campaigns against them. One of these had to do with the fact thatelders were respected by these immigrant families and the older men in thefamily were given first choice whenever a job became available. The advertis-ers began a \"young is beautiful\" campaign. They found the older workers to beinefficient and sought younger workers in their factories (Ewen, 1988). An-other campaign by advertisers came in the form of an attack on the extendedfamily. They felt that such group living patterns counteracted the narcissisticdesires of the individual. They advocated nuclear families, smaller groups ofindividuals who were distanced from controlling forces of the older ways andtraditions of their immigrant parents. Finally, these advertisers noticed that theseimmigrants liked to repair old clothes and fix broken objects rather than pur-chase new items (Ewen & Ewen, 1982). They considered this to be \"un-Ameri-3 r r'o288 Teaching Indigenous Languagescan.\" To undo these habits, advertisers drew up another campaign in whichthey argued for \"America as a throw away culture.\" Within a generation afterthis campaign was created, America had actually become a \"throw away cul-ture.\"The urbanization of AmericaBy the end of the Second World War, the consumer culture was a reality. Itonly took two generations to accomplish this feat. Since this exercise was highlysuccessful, business men set about in creating another cultural shift favorableto commerce. This time the influence came from General Motors. This corpo-rate giant wanted to sell more cars. They convinced Congress to build morehighways and to sabotage passenger rail travel. During the Second World War,America had only two \"military highways.\" One was Route 66 which traversedAmerica from Coast to Coast and the other was the Alaskan Highway. Con-gress gladly initiated the building of superhighways across America. This countryis now covered by ribbons of cement. Another way to increase car sales camewith the creation of Urban America. People moved away from the cities andinto the outskirts of the city. This change had nothing to do with overcrowding.It was a commercial movement (Jones, 1981). Every facet of the business worldbenefited from the urbanization of America. More new homes were sold, andthese subdivisions needed two or more cars, new furniture, new appliances,and other commodities that one identifies with suburbia. Remember what wesaid about overcrowding. It was not a problem during the beginning of theSuburban Movement. To ensure that overcrowding would be a problem andthat people would be enticed to move into the suburbs, an advertising cam-paign was created to encourage higher birth rates. The Baby Boomer Genera-tion lasted from 1946 to 1964. More children were born at that time than anyother in American history. The peak year was 1957 when 3.9 million babieswere born. The urbanization of America was good for business.The marketing of AmericaJust as the Baby Boom Generation was coming to a close, business mencame up with another idea that was continue their traditions of wealth and domi-nance. This time, the idea was to sell American products overseas. The mana-gerial elite from foreign countries were encouraged to study in the United Statesand become enculturated. Upon their return, they would provide a special com-mercial link with their native lands. Business students were of special interestto this movement because they would learn the art of marketing in America andexport it to their own countries. This \"marketing of America\" means that thebusiness culture is no longer limited to the United States. It is currently chang-ing the way people feel, think, and live around the globe (Harris, 1980). Thismarketing of America has been so successful that it has created a new interna-tional culture of business with seven variants (Hampden-Turner & Trompenaars,1992). 289 3 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesCrossing between disparate culturesWe have all had the experience of entering other cultures. When we leaveour own culture, we leave through an \"invisible door\" that separates our culturefrom others. Most people are unaware of the fact that they are entering anotherculture. They know that they feel uncomfortable and different, but they do notknow why. For those of us who study culture as our livelihood, we are usuallywell aware of the process of entering these other behavior domains of the hostculture. We know that when we first enter into another culture we stand in thisopen doorway with our legs straddling both cultures. We are well aware that wehave to act differently and speak a different language. We know that we have toeat different kinds of food and listen to different kinds of music. We even haveto dress differently. But something magical happens once we truly enter theother culture. We forget that we are of another culture. We begin to dream inthis other language, and we may even think differently. We may even forgetthat we look different and be shocked by our own images in the mirror.When it is time to leave our host culture, we reverse our process of culturalreentry. We straddle the invisible doorway between cultures once again andconsciously comment on the differences that separate our culture from theirs.After a few days, we return to our home cultures. Some have referred to thesechanges as \"cultural shock\" and \"reentry shock.\" I think that these terms onlymake sense if one is not aware of the invisible door that separates his culturalworld from those of others. I have made these journeys between cultures manytimes, and I do not consider them to be \"shocking.\" What is important aboutthis discussion of the invisible doors between cultures is our ability to be cul-turally aware. This ability is very important because it enables us to return toour home cultures without suffering cultural loss.How to prevent cultural lossIf you are being influenced by another culture, you need to protect yourselffrom being absorbed by it. You do this by being aware of how your culturediffers from the other culture. If you know that Modern American Culture isbased on the commercial forces of consumerism, urbanization, and marketing,then you can readily separate your value system from it. Why is this important?It is important because when we do not know how our culture differs fromanother, we can be readily absorbed by that outer culture.There are some people who have undergone severe cultural loss. They arechanged by the social and cultural forces around them and remain unaware ofthese changes in their lives. What is perhaps the most frightening experiencefor those of us who are trying to retain indigenous cultures are those individu-als who deliberately leave our home cultures to enter into another cultural worldforever. This individual decision can become rather alarming when large groupsof people leave the old way of life for another. This situation is alarming be-cause we are at a lost about why they left and why they do not want to everreturn. 290 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesConclusionThe more we know about the cultural forces around us, the more we areable to protect our culture from being overtaken by the mores of another. Manypeople assume that this is an \"either/or\" decision. It is not. We can leave ourhome cultures and return to them. We need not close the \"invisible doors\" thatseparate our culture from others. My discussion on three cultural shifts in Mod-ern American Culture highlights the social forces that impinge on our lives (St.Clair, 1997). If we are unaware of these forces, the \"invisible door\" may closeforever behind us. If we are aware of them, however, we can always return toour home cultures. ReferencesEwen, Stuart. (1977).

Issues explored in-clude the complications that conflicting goals and agendas bring tothe development of community control, the recruiting of human re-sources and motivating community action, and the small size of cru-cial communities and language groups overall and in specific con-texts. We need to develop the right strategies for different size lan-guage communities, and we need to pay attention to the amount andvariety of language use actually going on in communities. Local pri-orities must be respected; local leadership must be fostered; the forcesthat create negativity must be met with healing; and recent accom-plishments must be appreciated. Before coming to the Fourth Annual Stabilizing Indigenous LanguagesSymposium, I reviewed the work of the previous symposia on stabilizing in-digenous languages (Cantoni, 1996). What a wonderful opportunity it is to read,all in one book, about such a broad range of issues relating to indigenous lan-guages! Work on these matters has been terribly scattered and divided by greatdistances, national boundaries, and other barriers. Therefore, it is very satisfy-ing to see the results of the meeting of so many committed mindsoverviews,documentation of successes, priorities, frankness, and dedication. It is an honorto take part in this groundbreaking work.What I have to say is a rather intuitive and loosely connected explorationof several observations that I have made over a number of years concerningindigenous language activities in Canada. It draws and reflects on the work ofthese symposia, other sources, and my own experience to highlight certain fac-ets of the complex dynamic of indigenous language use. The clearest thingabout indigenous languages in North America is that they are all in danger ofbeing lost, some sooner than later. If they are to be preserved and stabilized, weneed some strategies for deciding on the most important things to do. I am notpresenting a plan here, but I am raising some issues that might be used to makeone. The main theme concerns the idea of the need for a critical mass of peopleand their activities in order for a social movement to take place. This theme isrelated here to the priority placed on local control of social institutions and therole of individuals in social movements. Other themes of leadership and nega-tivity are woven in as well. 292 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesCommunity controlMany influential social scientists, including my colleagues David Corson(e.g., 1990), Stacy Churchill (1986), and James Cummins (e.g., 1988), empha-size the need for linguistic and cultural minority communities to control insti-tutions that affect their lives if there is to be significant and sustainable im-provement in their circumstances in the midst of the power of the majoritypopulation. I want to consider some aspects of this kind of control in practice.Let me begin by saying that I am thoroughly committed to the principle ofcommunity control and cannot imagine any meaningful progress towards thestabilization of indigenous languages without this principle being addressedmore than any other. However, as Dr. Fishman has said about generalizationsabout language in society on various occasions, it is a little more complicatedthan that. In other words and for example, what kinds of control are the mostimportant and under what conditions? Are there circumstances where it is prac-tical and even useful for control to be shared? Should control over everythingbe approached at once, or should some areas be dealt with first? And so on.The crucial question is what control is and how much of what kind ofcontrol makes a difference, especially to indigenous language maintenance.Unfortunately, the collection of relevant information in Canada about what kindsof control indigenous peoples now have and how it has worked to make changesis complicated by the facts, among others, that there are many different institu-tions and jurisdictions involved and that we do not really know what the rightquestions are to ask. Serious, detailed discussions of what indigenous controlin Canada means and how well it is progressing have been undertaken (e.g.,MacPherson, 1991), and it appears that the picture is not very satisfactory. Letus look at a few aspects of control.In Canada, indigenous peoples have, for many years, been firm in theirinsistence that they get institutional control. They started with the matter ofcontrol over schooling. Perhaps the most influential document by Canadianindigenous people, Indian Control of Indian Education, was written in 1972 bythe National Indian Brotherhood in response to a federal government proposalthat the Indian Act be abolished and that indigenous peoples be treated like allother citizens. The National Indian Brotherhood stated that the federal govern-ment must retain its existing funding obligations for services, particularly edu-cation, to indigenous peoples but that control over those services be given tothose affected by the services, in this case the parents of indigenous schoolchil-dren. An important point in this statement was that the goals of education wereto be both the reinforcement and enhancement of indigenous children's iden-tity as indigenous people and the learning of skills to make a good living in thewider society. With this double objective, which is still strongly upheld in in-digenous communities in Canada in the 1990s, indigenous education is obligedto draw on both the mainstream and indigenous traditions.A somewhat different example relates to complex negotiations betweenthe Canadian federal government and the Yukon Territory concerning the ap-plication of the federal Official Languages Act (which makes English and French 2933 e7. Teaching Indigenous Languagesthe official languages of Canada) and the role of the Yukon indigenous lan-guages. It was decided that the indigenous languages would not be made offi-cial languages, but that they would receive comparable financial support. Therationale for this decision was that community self-determination of languagepolicies and initiatives was a more effective priority than the kinds of actionsthat territory-wide official language status would likely produce (Cottingham& Tousignant, 1991, as quoted in Fettes, in press). In other words, the treatmentof the indigenous languages would not be at all constrained by mainstreammodels of how an official language ought to be. Therefore, in this case, theissues relate directly to the indigenous tradition only.In the two examples I just gave of indigenous control over schools in Canadaand control over indigenous language development in general in the YukonTerritory, there is a difference in the extent to which mainstream ideas andadministration are involved. In the school case, parents want to meet main-stream objectives as well as indigenous ones. This means that community con-trol must include not only doing what the community wants but also doingwhat mainstream authorities expect. No doubt there are decisions taken everyday where teachers, parents, and administrators have to choose between vari-ous traditionally-oriented or mainstream-oriented possibilities. Schooling is notthe only community institution where these kinds of decisions and compro-mises have to be made. Health care, social work, law enforcement, and manyother institutions are often in the same situation. In very few cases can peoplejust decide to do things, such as indigenous language maintenance in the Yukon,without having to take into account mainstream models. The point I want tomake here is that community/indigenous control over mainstream types of in-stitutions in the community is not a simple matter of handing over control tolocal people to make the decisions that non-indigenous people used to make.Over and over, choices have to be made in order to change institutions frommainstream ones to truly indigenous ones.I was at a meeting once where indigenous people had come in from manycommunities to discuss indigenous language development. We brainstormed awide range of ideas of things that might be done in schools, at communityevents, in the store, out on the land, and in many other ways. After we had madea good list of possibilities, I found it frustrating that the conversation immedi-ately turned to which of these things could and could not be done because ofthe constraints of the different kinds of funding available. In my view, main-stream structures that provided the funding were taking control over the deci-sions we were trying to make. No one was talking about finding alternativesources of funding, lobbying to have funding rules altered, or figuring out whichthings could be done with community resources and little extra cost. I havedescribed this event as an example, to my mind, of the many ways in which it isdifficult to get real control over situations and institutions even if local peopleare in charge of them.Even in situations such as indigenous language maintenance and develop-ment in the Yukon, which is not modeled on mainstream ways of doing things, 294-S:s4.14 Teaching Indigenous Languagesthere are important issues to deal with. In being given control, local peoplehave to take control. But, how do we get people involved and committed to act?Can we convince people in the community that indigenous languages are highenough priority for them to change the ways they do things? How do we get theresources neededthe human resources of people's knowledge, skills, and timeand the practical resources of money and things? Actually using an indigenouslanguage does not cost money, but it often takes money and/or energy and timeto encourage people to use it. Once things are moving, how do we keep peopleinvolved and changing? In my experience, there is a great deal of talk abouthow important indigenous languages are. Non-indigenous people have beennotorious for making speeches and promises about such things and then notdoing anything about them. But indigenous people have not been perfect in thisrespect either. If indigenous people do not act, then who will? Indigenous con-trol has to do with getting both indigenous and non-indigenous people to act ontheir words rather than letting things slide along as usual because the usual wayis most often in the direction of the mainstream way.One more point I want to make here concerns indigenous control not justin communities where indigenous people are in the majority in their home com-munities, but where indigenous people live in places where they are in the (of-ten small) minority. In Canada, it seems that as much as half of the indigenouspopulation lives outside of traditional indigenous communities (StatisticsCanada, 1993). We need to think about indigenous control in all the kinds ofplaces where the indigenous population is. Also, it is only practical to thinkabout getting non-indigenous people to cooperate in achieving indigenous ob-jectives. Kirkness (1992) indicates that there are more indigenous programs inschools in which all or most of the children are indigenous and/or where theschools are administered by school boards and governments which are indig-enously controlled. However, she also gives examples of indigenously orientedprograms that are in schools run by regular school boards and governments andin schools where the indigenous children are in the minority. It is important thatwe keep in mind the potential of enlisting non-indigenous people and groups increating programs and activities that support indigenous interests. This strat-egy may not seem to be a good one in principle, or it may seem hopeless, but ifit is not followed up it seems likely that a very large portion of indigenouspeople will not be reached. Given the risk that many indigenous languages andcultures are at, all the indigenous people who do not live in indigenous commu-nities cannot be ignored.The factor of critical massCritical mass means having enough people or language or activity so thatthe things we want start to happen and keep happening. I suggest that size ofgroups of people should be given careful attention in our considerations ofwhere to put our energies in indigenous language support. Canada has aboutsixty indigenous languages (more or less, depending on how you count them),but only Cree, Ojibwa, and Inuktitut have more than 15,000 speakers. The other 2953 Teaching Indigenous Languageslanguages are mostly much smaller. We know that the smallest language groupshave been most vulnerable to extinction, and that only 35 per cent of indig-enous languages in Canada are in a strong position (Assembly of First Nations,1990). Indeed, the size of the group of speakers and the degree of endanger-ment are almost the same thing. So in this central way, size of the group is animportant factor when looking at where energies to support languages shouldbe placed. We could decide to put more effort into working with languages thathave the fewest speakers because they are the most at risk, or we could putmore support into languages with the most speakers because they have the bestprospects. But no one wants to make these decisions. I think that the morepractical decision is to provide the right kind of help to the right size of lan-guage. Those languages that have few speakers, many of whom are older people,need a different kind of treatment to those which have a lot of speakers, includ-ing children. We must be realistic that the kinds of activities which are veryeffective in some situations are not the best for every situation. Especially whenlanguages are really in danger, it is tempting to get on the bandwagon of everynew language program. But we must choose carefully those programs and ac-tivities that are the most realistic and put more energy into them.In addition to the size of the language group as a whole, it is useful to thinkabout the size of each individual community we want to work in. In my experi-ence, larger communities have a certain advantage over smaller communitiesin getting new and effective language support programs off the ground. Theysimply have more financial and human resources, more people and skills tochoose from, and more people to volunteer to help. If small communities havetaken over control of a lot of their institutions (schools, transportation, health,economic development, and so forth), their human resources may be stretchedto the limit with these responsibilities. They can only make changes in so manyof their activities at any one time. Also, they are likely to have pressures onthem that make things other than language higher priority. So again, a programthat works in a large community may not work out in the same way in a smallerone. On the other hand, small communities have certain advantages as well, sothat some kinds of programs and activities might work better there than in largecommunities. At any rate, the size of communities needs to be taken into ac-count in deciding on language promotion and support activities.One other aspect of size I can think of is the amount that the indigenouslanguage is used in any community or language group. In the Yukon Territory,the movement to develop, maintain, and preserve the indigenous languages hasrecognized the essential goal of creating a critical mass of real communicationin the indigenous languages as the momentum for substantial change (Gardner,1993, as quoted in Fettes, in press). In other words, there is probably an essen-tial amount of language use, and if that amount of use goes below a certainpoint, the language will decline rapidly no matter how many people there arewho know how to speak it. Because communication usually implies groups ofpeople, we would be looking at communities rather than individuals in order toassess this critical mass or amount of language. I do not think anyone knows 296 Teaching Indigenous Languageshow much communication in the language is enough to keep the language go-ing, but it makes sense that a language has to be used a certain amount or it willdie.In this vein, Mougeon and Beniak (1994) indicate the importance of a criticalmass of French speaking community institutions (social, cultural, and economic),or \"institutional completeness,\" in French speaking communities in Ontario tothe maintenance of the French language in an otherwise strongly English speak-ing province over long periods of time. In other words, people with Frenchbackgrounds need to be able to take part in a lot of things in French (such asschool, church, sports, radio, shopping, and so forth) before they take the Frenchlanguage seriously and use it regularly. Again, without defining what actualsize or proportion such a critical mass of language activity in community insti-tutions might be, the implication is that a community would have to support aconsiderable range of established institutions in the indigenous language tobenefit from this effect.Overall then, we need to take into consideration the size of the languagegroup, the size of the individual communities involved, the amount of commu-nication that goes on in the language, and the number of kinds of situations thatpeople can use the language in. If we are serious about working towards thestabilization of all the indigenous languages, we also have to combine the ques-tions of size with the questions of control. I have not thought through what allthe combinations might be or what they might mean. Besides, I think it is moreuseful to bring these ideas to issues in actual community situations than towork out all the theoretical possibilities here. However, below are some of thethoughts on my mind at the moment.Differing prioritiesWe must be prepared to accept the fact that some communities and lan-guage groups, especially the smallest ones, may decide that they have otherpriorities than indigenous language maintenance or revival. We must be realis-tic about the stress their human resources are under as they are handed not onlythe control of but also the responsibility for institutions (formal education, trans-portation, economic activities, and so forth) that were once imposed on themfrom the outside. The pressure to meet the mainstream requirements of thiswork may not leave room for a focus on indigenous languages. As Fishman(1996) and Gardner (1993) emphasize, a good strategy is to focus on less for-mal, more intimate community institutions such as home, family, and friend-ship groups first and let other institutions such as the school follow suit. Evensmall communities and small language groups have families and social activi-ties. Also, these aspects of life are in some ways more protected from main-stream control and interference. However, in such stressful times, it may beespecially difficult to find the human resources in a community or languagegroup of any size to take leadership in these areas. On the other hand, a com-munity could decide to use its control of institutions such as the school in sucha way as to change them to reflect strongly traditional linguistic and cultural 297311_ Teaching Indigenous Languagestraditions. The problem with this approach is that indigenous parents are widelyreported to want their children to be educated so that they can compete in thewider society. This might mitigate against any major changes in the organiza-tion of schooling and many other institutions. Hampton (1995) argues that theevolution towards true indigenous education goes through phases. Perhaps wemay be overly impatient for the results we want.LeadershipI want to change the focus at this point away from communities and lan-guage groups to individuals. The single most important factor I have seen in thedevelopment of successful indigenous language stabilization activities in Canadain the past thirty years has been the presence of leadership. Each exceptionalprogram or movement has been started by a community member who had avision of what could be done. This person was able not only to dream but alsoto inspire others to share in this dream. For a reason I do not understand, mostof these leaders have been women, but I do not think that this is a reason todiscourage men from working in the direction of indigenous language stabili-zation. I think of Roseanne Houle, Ida McLeod, Ida Wasacase, Verna Kirkness,Emma Jane Crate, Lena White, Mary Lou Fox, Greg Spence, Reg Henry, Dor-othy Lazore, Sr. Catherine Tekakwitha, Luci Salt, Annie Whiskeychan, MildredMil lea, Bernie Francis, Beatrice Watt, and many others.Local leadership in indigenous language development is important becauseit means that new ideas are coming from someone who understands the com-munity well and therefore knows many of the complicated factors that couldmake an idea succeed or fail. The leader knows about local human resourceswho is good at what and therefore who can contribute to new activities. Also,local leaders are very important in encouraging others to take part because leadersare role models. They show everyone that new things can be done, that it is notalways necessary to import skills from the outside. Finally, they are from thecommunity so they are likely to stay and see a project through to completion.Unfortunately, we cannot force good leadership to happen. The right per-son has to come forward at the right time. However, it is certainly possible toencourage leadership in ourselves and those around us. People who have tal-ents, especially young people, can be supported in using them. Opportunitiesfor training and experience of all sorts can be used. People who make contribu-tions should be rewarded and appreciated. New ideas can be tried out. Throughsuch means, talents, resources, and opportunities are not wasted, and new, valu-able things and activities are created, often at no cost.NegativityI suppose that the dark side of leadership is negativity in communities aboutwhat can be done and the sharing of talents and resources. In the book about theprevious symposia (Cantoni, 1996), I was impressed that people were preparedto come out and face the fact that negativity has played a problematic role inthe stabilizing of indigenous languages in North America. I have seen it at3 ,2298 Teaching Indigenous Languageswork myself, and I was sorry to see that it seems to be a factor in many othercommunities as well. I think, for example, of visiting a school in which anindigenous language is used extensively. At lunch one of the indigenous lan-guage teachers told me that she did not let any of the other teachers see theclassroom materials she had prepared over the years because she had put a lotof work into them and she did not want anyone taking advantage of all hereffort. In other situations, I have seen some parents make trouble over a newlanguage program or criticize everything the language teacher does. Most oftenI have heard people say that they would like to learn or improve their skills intheir indigenous language, but that they could not take the ridicule they gotwhen they tried to speak. This kind of attitude and behavior is a very powerfulforce in creating the risk of extinction of indigenous languages, and acting tostop it is essential to the work of stabilizing indigenous languages.I cannot believe that the people who do these negative things are all meanpeople. I have to think that they are acting out of some kind of pain or simplethoughtlessness. Some of the pain, we know all too well, has come out of theugly and racist things that non-indigenous people have done to indigenous peopleover the years in schools, on reservations, at work, in hospitals, and many otherplaces. However, there are other sources of pain as well that are tearing com-munities apart and keeping new, constructive, and useful things from happen-ing, including the support of the indigenous languages. In my view, efforts tostabilize indigenous languages must be linked to work on healing in communi-ties. It is through healing practices that we can uncover not only ways to soothethe pain and counteract negativity, but also ways to support, talent, skills, lead-ership, and wisdom that is so greatly needed for language, culture, and commu-nity survival and development.Final wordI appreciate greatly the opportunity to communicate my thoughts to thereaders of this book. It encouraged me to see that there are so many who havemade the trip to the Fourth Annual Stabilizing Indigenous Languages Sympo-sium in Flagstaff, Arizona, to learn and to share what they have learned. Lead-ership has clearly come forward in many communities in order to produce theideas and interests that were brought to Flagstaff. Now, I think, a new leader-ship is starting, one of people who can take the skills and knowledge they havedeveloped at home and share them with other communities and other languagegroups. This is a new stage, a broader, more hopeful stage. Although it may notseem that we have accomplished very much so far, we just need to look back afew years to see that a great deal has been done. Where once there was nothingbut the prospect of indigenous language loss, there are now programs, and teach-ers, and writing systems, and books, and radio programs, and young peoplelearning, and, most of all, the beginnings of a new respect for indigenous lan-guages. We are fortunate to have a place in this process. 299313 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesReferencesAssembly of First Nations. (1990). Towards linguistic justice for First Na-tions.

This paper develops a speaker-centered view of language as analternative to the monolithic, decontextualized abstractions favoredby modern linguistics. Successful language renewal requires the in-terweaving of critical literacy in the dominant language with localknowledge and living relationships expressed through the local lan-guage. The stabilization of indigenous languages forms part of abroader movement to reestablish societies on a human scale and inbalance with nature. For my doctoral dissertation in education, I have been developing a way ofthinking about language that can make sense both of my own experiences as anEsperanto speaker' and of my work with Canadian First Nations people oncommunity-based language strategies.2 In the context of the theme of the FourthAnnual Stabilizing Indigenous Languages Symposium \"sharing effective lan-guage renewal practices,\" this means asking about the meaning of the wordseffective, language, and renewal.The second of these terms is the most central and the most problematic.When we talk about language, we often fall back on the ways linguists havechosen to describe itin terms of discrete entities defined by standard gram-mars, standard dictionaries, standard phonologies, and the like. But that doesnot really capture what language is. The closer you look at people's linguistic'Esperanto is a century-old language designed and developed for use betweenpeople with different mother tongues, in a similar way to North American trad-ing languages (Chinook Jargon, Mobilian, and so forth). The best descriptionof its functioning is in French (Piron, 1994); see however Janton (1993) orRichardson (1988) for an introduction in English.21 have worked as a consultant on language and education issues to the Assem-bly of First Nations and other groups since 1992 (see e.g., Fettes, 1992 & 1997).During this work I encountered Joshua Fishman's ideas on \"reversing languageshift\": see Fishman (1991) and his two papers in the earlier Symposium publi-cation, Stabilizing Indigenous Languages (Fishman, 1996a, 1996b). The presentpaper develops an alternative theoretical model that, while in some ways criti-cal of Fishman, relies on many of his insights. 3013i5 Teaching Indigenous Languagesbehavior, the less \"standard\" it becomes. To take an example from my ownexperience, what looks like \"Dutch\" from the viewpoint of a non-speaker be-comes a constellation of stylistic norms for the learner of the \"standard,\" ashifting mosaic of regional and class-based varieties, which when observed intheir social context are a subtle ever-turning kaleidoscope of individual andgroup speech patterns of speakers going through their daily lives. There are nolinguistic techniques available, there is not even a vocabulary, to capture thefact that \"Dutch\" refers to all these things at onceto an entire ecological sys-tem of communicative strategies rooted in time and place, history, and the land.'What, then, are we trying to \"stabilize\" or \"renew\"? What does it mean tostabilize an ecosystem, which by its very nature is a dynamic, ever-changingset of interrelationships rather than a clearly identifiable \"thing\"? One influen-tial response is to make the ecosystem more \"thing-like\"more homogenousand predictable by establishing standards, printing dictionaries, and writing text-books and curricula. Teach people how to speak. Linguists tend to feel verycomfortable with this approach as it fits with all of their training.2 Yet I contendthat the modern notion of languages as homogenous, stable \"things\" that aretaught, learned, and useda concept deeply embedded in the grammar of West-ern languages and in linguistic theoryis fatal to the goal of revitalizing indig-enous languages.First, if languages constitute a class of things, then they resemble one an-other in essential respects. Given this premise, it is hard to escape the conclu-sion that one language must be as good as another for most purposes. Indeed,structuralist linguistics has elevated this avowedly empowering principle intosomething of a dogma. One even finds it embedded in the work of sociolinguistslike Joshua Fishman (1991), who in Reversing Language Shift refers to minor-ity and majority languages by the letters X and Y, as if they were as alike andinterchangeable as two symbols in an algebraic equation. I do not think thatFishman subscribes to this fallacy in a conscious and deliberate fashion, but itsinfluence has systematically infiltrated his work and that of many others. Farfrom being a help to advocates of language renewal, it undermines their causeby suggesting that languages are no more than tools to be picked up and put 'The most penetrating philosophical critique of standard linguistics has beendeveloped by Roy Harris and his co-workers (Harris, 1981; Davis & Taylor,1990). The links between language, land, and spirituality, that are so obviousand fundamental for many indigenous language activists, are only just becom-ing accessible to the Western tradition (Maffi, 1996).2See Miihlhailsler (1996) for a description of how objectifying ideologies haveinfluenced the linguistic description of the Pacific region and of their effects onlocal linguistic ecosystems. Thehistorical roots of this tradition are traced inIllich (1981). 302 Teaching Indigenous Languagesdown, or sets of clothes that one may or may not choose to wear, with no fur-ther social or environmental effects.'Secondly, from the idea that all languages are fundamentally alike, we arereadily led to believe that the same factors that entrench English (or other lan-guages of ruling) can be used to stabilize indigenous languages. Besides a mis-placed emphasis on writing, standardization, and teaching, this also tends tolink linguistic activism to various forms of nationalism and territorialismzero-sum ideologies that can awaken fiercely negative reactions on the part oflinguistic majorities and be hugely expensive to maintain in both human andeconomic terms. If we are serious about creating a world where thousands oflanguages can thrive, rather than just a few dozen or a few hundred, then othermodels must be found.2Thirdly, if every language is merely a local instance of a general phenom-enon, then any community's knowledge about its language appears insignifi-cant in comparison to the Western linguistic tradition. Linguists claim to havebeen studying the languages of the world for centuries and therefore to knowfar more about their workings and significance than any mere speaker. Thisperspective privileges modern linguistic techniques for abstracting languagefrom its social context, rather than techniques for re-embedding it. The particu-lar and concrete use of language in knowledge, culture, and interpersonal rela-tionships is largely ignored in favor of a focus on linguistic structure and \"lan-guage\" in general.Fourthly, if languages are seen as \"things\" separate from their speakers,then the latter cease to have a sense of ownership and control. Particularly fornon-fluent adult speakers, language renewal comes to seem an impossibly hugetask in which they have little if any role to play. Consequently linguistic re-sponsibility is entrusted to teachers, linguists, and various other people in insti-tutional roles, rather than being reaffirmed as a shared value of every memberof the community. Depending on the circumstances, such institutionalizationmay actually deepen and entrench people's alienation from their language.3I believe that we can meet the challenge of language renewal only by aban-doning the initial assumption. Forget about the monolithic, abstract entitiesthat modern science projects upon the linguistic world: a theory of languagerenewal must begin with the speakers, with people \"doing language\" together'For the modern \"enlightened\" view of all languages as equal and alike see forexample Newmeyer (1986). The logical conclusion that language loss does notreally matter very much is argued by Ladefoged (1992). A rebuttal is providedby Dorian (1993).2The most extensive work on fostering stable multilingualism has focused onlinguistic rights (Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson, 1994; Leger, 1995, 1996).For a profound indigenous perspective on language and government seeHenderson (1995).3This is especially true if the institutionalization is in schools that are alreadyviewed by indigenous people as alien (see for example Peshkin, 1997). 3033127 Teaching Indigenous Languagesin meaningful ways, and work out from there. This paper presents a prelimi-nary exploration of the terrain. I believe the results to be very compatible withwhat Elders and language activists say and do; in addition it demonstrates theinadequacy of one-track approach such as schooling and literacy alone. Mostimportantly, perhaps, this exploration helps us rebuild a vision of language inits full social context, as an instrument of love and oppression, rootedness andalienation, knowledge and lies.The two sides of languageOur \"speaker-centered\" perspective begins with the assertion that peopleand their actions are inseparable and that a true understanding of the latter mustinclude the actors' own description of their actions and motivations. This per-spective abandons the Cartesian notion of an invisible mind disconnected fromthe \"doing\" body in favor of \"the social mind\"the mind that exists throughconcrete physical and symbolic interaction with others. Such interaction, nowcommonly termed \"discourse,\" is given coherence through informal rules ofbehavior learned by trial and error. Discursive psychology, which seeks to rein-terpret our understanding of all human behavior along these lines, undercutsthe Cartesian idea that language is something separate from other areas of hu-man activity. Instead language is seen as an integral and central part of theways people interact with each other and their environment. IHowever, because language works through wordssymbolic goods thatresemble material goods in their stability and transportabilityit is operatedon by two very different kinds of discursive rules. Primary discursive rulesgovern the ways we negotiate meaning in face-to-face settings. When we adaptour speech to particular people, situations, and purposes, we are making use ofprimary discursive rules that are tightly integrated with all our non-verbal knowl-edge about the world of experience. This is how language is first acquired:mutual and constantly renegotiated references to things and events in our im-mediate environment (and in our behavior) give meaning to our earliest wordsand structure our most important early relationships. The dialogic and immedi-ate use of language in primary discourse becomes deeply embedded in ourcognitive functioning and underlies our capacity to use language for other goals.Being both dialogic and immediate, such \"vernacular\" or \"informal\" lan-guage has no need of standardization, and indeed resists it mightily. Its natureis to be mercurial, fluid, and ever-changing, according to the needs and creativeurges of its users. In contrast, secondary discourse aspires to authority and per-manencyto \"truth\" and \"knowledge\" of a lasting kind. Primary discourseenables us to tell stories about the world we know from experience. Its situated1That is, the mind of every individual is a kind of finely-tuned discursive pro-cessor, constantly working to ensure the stable and productive integration of aunique complex of discourses. On discursive psychology see Harre & Gillett(1994); on discourse and language see Gee (1991), as well as Bakhtin's (1981,1986) prescient work of forty to sixty years before. I!304 Teaching Indigenous Languages\"small stories\" make use of communicative strategies that are deeply rooted ineveryday life. But the words and word-use rules produced in this way are thenavailable to be strung together into more complex and abstract stories about theworld outside our experience, including past and future. This process startsearly. Even young children are busy assembling a conceptual model of the worldat the same time as they use language to negotiate their wants and needs withpeople around them. But it is the adult world that places greatest stress on sec-ondary discourse, with far-reaching consequences.'As Dorothy Smith (1990) has pointed out (extending an argument fromKarl Marx), the way in which concepts (words) are strung together in second-ary discourse need not bear any relationship to the things people actually doand know. This implies that language is a dangerous tool indeed, for secondarydiscourse has a clear effect on primary discourse. People may abandon or modifytheir rules of behavior to conform with those stories that appear most \"true\" orthose that they wish were true. But there is no guarantee that the results will bewhat they expect. They may have been seduced by \"ideology,\" in Marx's sense,rather than a valid picture of their material and discursive reality. Thus, cohe-sive and sustainable communities must achieve a dynamic balance betweenprimary and secondary discourses, one that allows language to continue to evolvethrough its use in informal situated negotiation of ways to live together, even asthis negotiation is influenced by ongoing attempts to integrate these complexpatterns of life into the relatively restricted conceptual systems that languagemakes available. 2Seen from this perspective, indigenous languages and the languages ofruling that threaten to engulf them no longer appear as similar as linguists wouldhave us believe. Indigenous languages are the product of hundreds or thou-sands of years of delicate, gradual accommodation between the primary andsecondary discursive systems of particular human communities, living in a sus-tainable relationship with particular places and ecosystems. It is no accidentthat indigenous languages vary so greatly within and among themselves. Thisis to be expected of any healthy linguistic system where primary discourse stillholds its own. By contrast, English and other standardized languages of rulingare the recent inventions of a cultural system drastically alienated from its en-'For two quite different but complementary descriptions of how secondary dis-course works, see Turner (1996) on how storytelling structures language andFeyerabend (1975) on storytelling as the universal form of knowledge produc-tion.2This view of language is a synthesis of many sources within and outside thereference list, with Smith (1990) providing a key insight. The primary/second-ary distinction was formulated by both Bakhtin and Gee along somewhat dif-ferent lines. Here, all language acts are viewed as drawing on both primary andsecondary discursive rules, although this paper also uses \"primary discourse\"and \"secondary discourse\" to refer loosely to language acts dominated by theformer or the latter.3o5 3 1 9 Teaching Indigenous Languagesvironment. What Ivan Illich (1981) refers to as \"taught mother tongue\" beganits relentless standardizing march across the Atlantic in 1492, a year that sawthe beginnings of the colonization of the Americas from without and the colo-nization of Europe from within.'Over time, as Illich has argued, \"standard language\" reduces the scope ofprimary discourse in a society to a minimum. Language ceases to be somethingthat can be negotiated and adapted to the needs of a specific place and situation.It becomes an objectified, authoritative \"thing\" whose supreme authorities arethe Book and the Expert. Words and concepts are expropriated from their socialcontext and anchored in disciplinary secondary discourses that claim a mo-nopoly over truth. The objectification of language parallels the objectificationof nature and of people themselves; indeed, it does not seem accidental that thephilosophical foundations of modernitythe Cartesian mind-body split, theBaconian ideal of abstract science, the Comenian notion of lifelong educationwere laid at the very time that standard language was beginning to replace thevernaculars among the educated classes of Western Europe.We can now reassess the third term in our declared goal of \"effective lan-guage renewal.\" The point is not to make indigenous languages resemble stan-dard ones (with the potential result, as Dick Littlebear suggested, that in an-other couple of generations we could be meeting to discuss the oppressive domi-nance of Cheyenne). Language renewal is about finding ways to restore thebalance between primary and secondary discourse, and with it the balance be-tween people and nature that indigenous communities had once perfected. Bythe same token, language renewal is not something that should concern indig-enous people alone, nor is it simply a matter of elementary justice. It is oneattempt among many to reestablish control over a runaway civilization (Sachs,1992, 1993).The triple braid of language renewalSo let us turn, at last, to the first word in our mission statement: what areeffective language renewal practices? A healthy language can be visualized as atightly woven braid of many primary and secondary discourses. In living andworking together (primary discourse), people refer to the stories they share as acommon source of knowledge, and in telling and retelling those stories (sec-ondary discourse), people draw on their years of shared experience, of doingthings together with and without language. Woven together, these two forms ofdiscourse enabled indigenous languages to evolve and made them of unrivaledvalue to their speakers.Today we are a long way from the hunter-gatherer condition of semi-iso-lated, self-sustaining family groups. Now every indigenous community whose'As Illich's essay makes clear, the decline of indigenous languages around theworld is simply a continuation of the process by which Standard English andother objectified languages of ruling have obliterated or weakened local ver-naculars in their countries of origin. 306 Teaching Indigenous Languageslanguage is under threat is exposed to a tangle of non-indigenous primary andsecondary discoursespractices and stories grounded simultaneously in an-cient discursive systems inherited from the European peoples and the socialsystems of modernity. In trying to remake the language braid, indigenous com-munities must refashion their own language to accommodate a changing wayof life and develop new stories to replace the objectifying and disempowering\"truths\" propagated in the invading language.We can think of this process as a \"triple braid\" of language renewal, onestill more complex and difficult to weave than the classic double braid. For itcan no longer involve the indigenous language alone. The secondary discoursesof English and any other language of ruling constitute a force for colonizing themind that must be directly resisted, not simply ignored. As long as the onlystories told in the invading language are ones of racism, alienation, exclusion,economics, individualism, and so on, they create a discursive space that leavesno room for more than one language, and it is the local language that will even-tually fall. Different stories need to be told in the invading language itself,which leave room for multiple identities and local forms of knowledge. Thispaper itself develops one such story. There are many others to be told. IThis perspective of the triple braid suggests that any community, no matterwhere its language is at, should work simultaneously on all three strands, asdescribed below. This may seem like too much to demand, and I do not claimthat it is easy. But to focus on just one or two strands is to neglect a key elementof language renewal; while to work on all three strands at once is to weavesomething that will last. Elements of this multidimensional approach can befound in Joshua Fishman's Reversing Language Shift (1991). However, I be-lieve that his stage-by-stage approach effectively obscures the complexities ofbelief and practice involved. Rather than assessing the linguistic health of acommunity on demographic grounds alone, as Fishman and many others pro-pose, we must focus on the health of each discursive strand and the ways inwhich they interweave.Strand one: Critical literacyThe first strand of language renewal does not depend on the indigenouslanguage itself at all. It is the task of confronting, marginalizing, and disman-tling the secondary discourses of alienation carried by the invading language.Critical illness, here, is the state of a community whose members see them-selves as powerless to change their lives; whose families are being destroyedby abuse; and whose leadership, whether in the fields of politics, health, educa-1The implicit claim is being made here that secondary discourses are the leversof language shift. Primary discourse in any language is always additive, pro-viding another module of situation-specific skills for the mind to use. For thisreason, primary discourse in the invading language is not a factor in languagerenewal work. Space precludes a fuller theoretical description of language shifthere; the topic will be further explored in my dissertation. 307321 Teaching Indigenous Languagestion, social welfare, or whatever, is locked into distant, impersonal structuresand meaning systems. And the healing process has to start by people comingtogether to share their pain, to name their oppressions, and to seek their ownsolutions. Linguistic oppression is only one of many forms of suffering, neithergreater nor lesser, but an integral part of an entire ecology of disempowerment.The principal means of identifying intrusive secondary discourses is to askpeople what they believe. It seems to me that many language activists under-stand this intuitively, for one of the most frequent topics in this Symposiumwas surveys of the attitudes that people hold towards their language. In onesuch study, an Apache, Bernadette Adley-SantaMaria, told us that some tribalmembers view the language as evil, as contrary to the teachings of the Bible.Such a discourse will doom a language in the long run, unless you can eithermarginalize it or replace it with a different, language-friendly one. In anothersession, Octaviana Trujillo told us that many Yaqui parents are still convincedthat learning the native language will prevent their children from learning goodEnglish. As long as that discourse is operatingand again, this is an objecti-fied, ideological discourse with deep roots in Western colonialismthen youare not going to be able to bring the language back, either in schools or outsidethem.So, the first strand of language renewal consists of identifying these dis-courses, demythologizing (de-objectifying) them, and replacing them with oth-ers. Enormous though the task is, there are two bright threads in this strand ofthe braid. One is that many of these alienating discourses are common to virtu-ally all oppressed peoples, so that there is enormous potential for sharing knowl-edge and strategies and developing common opposing discourses of empower-ment. The second is that such opposing discourses can draw selectively onconcepts that hold considerable power in the dominant society: concepts offreedom, of justice, of human rights, of anti-racism, of community, ofsustainability, and so on [Both of these threads are woven together in the workon language rights done by Skunabb-Kangas and Phillipson (1994) and Leger(1995; 1996)]. One very concrete recommendation I would make is that alllanguage activists look closely at the curriculum of their schools. What kind ofvision does it present of the world and of your people's place in it? If the visionis one of a homogenous society dominated by economics and technology, andyour people's place is peripheral or invisible then that vision must be changedbefore the language will have a chance.Educators will recognize this process as a variation on \"critical literacy,\"as pioneered by Paulo Freire and further developed by many people, indig-enous and non-indigenous, around the world. Critical literacy can be practicedin the school, but it can also be an important component of adult training projectsand various other kinds of grassroots social work. It teaches people how tofilter the discourses to which they are exposed, spot hidden forms of manipula-tion, and develop alternative accounts in which their own experience is central. 308 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesLanguage renewal desperately needs this work in order to succeed) But it alsorequires the introduction of a new element: the idea that indigenous languageshold the key to local authenticity. This brings us to the second strand.Strand two: Local knowledgesThe second strand to be rewoven is that of secondary discourse in the in-digenous language. It may seem paradoxical to work with secondary discourseeven when primary discourse (Strand Three) is extinct or critically ill, and in-deed Joshua Fishman has warned us in no uncertain terms about the dangers offocusing exclusively on what he terms (more narrowly) the institutional do-main. But this strand is essential to motivating and extending language use.Primary discourse by itself does not supply a sufficiently rich linguistic envi-ronment to keep its speakers happy; even young children are avid for stories,filled with questions, and thirsting to know what their elders know. In order forprimary discourse to thrive, the knowledge and the stories in the language mustagain become part of the community's common heritage. In critical cases thisprocess must begin with the smallest meaningful elements: words and names.It will already be clear that Strand Two can readily be interwoven withStrand One. For example, arguments for the importance of local, community-based knowledge can be linked to the reintroduction of specific indigenouswords for local realities, or the authority of non-indigenous sources can beundermined by \"translating\" their impersonal and monolithic discourses intomore human and concrete terms in the local language. Where and how theprocess starts, however, will be highly dependent on the cultural and socialpractices of the community. Religious or, more broadly, spiritual discoursesseem often to hold on to the language longest; they may also be where it canalso most readily be brought back. Names can provide another focus of resis-tance; even changing the name of the tribe or community may be a small steptowards language renewal. Traditional knowledge of family relationships, hunt-ing, fishing, agriculture, plants, and animals can still be powerful and relevantfor community members. In a further extension, formulaic expressions and cer-emonial texts can be deliberately reintroduced in appropriate settings, includ-ing everyday acts such as greetings, welcomes, introductions, and so forth.Eventually, however, any community committed to language renewal mustconfront the issue of discursive complexitythe problem of developing andtransmitting a web of stories attuned to local experience. Stability can neitherbe achieved by means of isolated words and formulas nor by reproducing ob-jectified discourses in the local language. In other words, translating textbooksunchanged from English to Inuktitut is inadequate for language renewal, and,I An accessible guide for language activists is also desperately needed. In itsabsence, the basic reference is Freire (1970). Shor (1992) gives an updatedtreatment for educators; Lankshear and McLaren (1993) provide an interestingcollection of theoretical perspectives; McLaughlin (1994) considers the impli-cations for American Indian education. 309323 Teaching Indigenous Languagesin the long run, it probably will ease the shift to English. The local language hasto be used to meet its speakers' need for concepts and stories that make sense ofthe world in their terms. So storytelling is crucial, in the broad sense used here.Traditional myths and historical accounts; stories about people's relationshipwith the land and with nature; contemporary tales of despair and hope, love anddeath; poetry, jokes, songs, poems, and so on. Every good story is another rea-son to cherish the language, another branch on the fire to keep it burning.Stories of this kind were once the prerogative of Elders and oral perform-ers. Today the traditional storytelling settings have been overwhelmed by theavalanche of invasive secondary discourses pouring in through books and maga-zines, radio and television, and compulsory state schooling. While critical lit-eracy can help stem this flood, it is equally necessary to develop new settingsfor storytelling, ones in which the invading language is at best on equal termsand preferably at a disadvantage. Wilderness camps, Internet chat groups,songwriting workshops, and multimedia works making use of indigenous artare some of the possibilities. Ofelia Zepeda's well-known work on developing0' odham poetry is another outstanding example (see for example Zepeda, 1996).Literacy and schooling have long preoccupied language activists, and sucha focus was much in evidence at this Symposium. It is an understandable one,given the role that texts and schools play in disseminating secondary discourses.But knowledge about language can all too easily become a surrogate for knowl-edge of language, and debates on orthography and literacy can hinder their useto communicate knowledge and ideascan in fact undermine ownership of thelanguage.' Indeed, evidence is accumulating that all forms of language acqui-sition involve mastering discourseboth primary and secondaryrather thanlearning words, grammar, and writing systems as independent categories. It istherefore not surprising that indigenous language activists report success withdiscourse-centered approaches, ranging from the Total Physical Response tech-niques espoused by Dick Littlebear (Model, 1996), through the classroom useof texts reported in a previous Symposium by Norbert Francis and RafaelAndrade (1996), to the Centro Editorial en Lenguas Indigenas in Oaxaca,Mexico, where fluent speakers develop a writing system over the course of afew weeks of composing extended texts in the language (Bernard, 1992).Nicholas Faraclas (1993), writing from Papua New Guinea, provides a par-ticularly convincing account of critical literacy and language stabilization work-ing together. The hundreds of indigenous languages scattered among the moun-tains and valleys of this rugged island are, of course, totally excluded from theofficial Western-style education system. Most have no more than a thousandI The two-edged nature of modern linguistic discourse is illustrated by a poemthat was read at the session on the American Indian Language DevelopmentInstitutes, in which participants expressed the idea that \"we are the enemies ofour language.\" In a speaker-centered approach to language renewal such athought would be impossible: one would speak of dispossession and the struggleto regain what was stolen.9 A310 Teaching Indigenous Languagesspeakers. Yet the movement that Faraclas documents has involved hundreds ofcommunities in developing and beginning to use their own writing systems,often in a matter of days or weeks. How is it done? First, communities controlthe entire process. Second, Strands One and Two are tightly interwoven: thecritical literacy process leads immediately into communities developing theirown stories about their world, in their own languagefirst in discussion andlater as texts. Third, the forms of the written language are taught in completeseparation from its use in storytelling, and often by different teachers. In oneclass, learners practice \"word attack\" skills, spelling, and so forth. In the other,they tell stories, which in the beginning can be recorded by the teacher or anadvanced learner and then can be read back and further developed by the class.The Papuan approach can work well for languages whose primary dis-course is still vital. Where it is not, Strand Three of the language braid must berewoven as well.Strand three: Living relationshipsThe third strand of language renewal is the one that Joshua Fishman (1991)made the focus of his book on reversing language shift, his \"Stage 6\": \"theinteraction of children and their parents or other affectionate socializers in natu-ral, daily, home-family-neighborhood-community life.\" While still the mostelusive and neglected element in language renewal and the most difficult thingto turn around in communities that have generally experienced very severetrauma, it can also be the most powerful. Recall Dick Littlebear's comment inhis post-banquet speech on \"rare and radical ideas\"that one brief conversa-tional exchange with a student made an entire term's teaching effort worth-while. \"I understood him, and he understood meit was perfect,\" he said. Thatis what primary discourse is about.Much of what Fishman writes about informal language can stand unchangedas a description of primary discourse. I believe, however, that he underesti-mates the ability of motivated adults to acquire and integrate a new languageinto their daily life and overestimates the determining effects of the home onchildren's language patterns. To be sure, home-based immersion in the lan-guage is a worthwhile goal, but it will not by itself lead to language renewal,nor does it exhaust the possibilities of primary discourse. Rather, any meaning-ful long-term relationship conducted in the language helps to establish anintergenerational network of relationships, which clearly at some stage shouldinvolve children but which may not reattain the stage of stable transmission asa first language for years, possibly even generations.Some methods of recreating primary discourse are well known. The Maorilanguage nests, kohanga reo, focus on the grandparent-infant relationship; theyhave inspired similar programs around the world. The Californian master-ap-prentice program involves establishing strong relationships between Elders andadult learners in the ancestral language. For fostering primary discourse be-tween adult peers, we can turn to the less well-known Maori movement, toaatarangi, which involves intensive training of adult speakers, both in immer- 31132 5 Teaching Indigenous Languagession camps and in urban settings, even on the workplace floor, by volunteerteachers. These programs, like any successful language renewal project, in-volve all three strands of the language braid; critical literacy and local knowl-edge are used to provide both the motivation for the recreation of primary dis-course and the substance of much of what is done in the language. If suchsupports are in place, much more can be done. For instance, I am not aware ofindigenous programs to foster parent-child bilingualism or language use amongteenagers, although both could clearly make an important contribution. IOne of the greatest pitfalls in primary discourse renewal, however, is itsinherent resistance to standardization. The reweaving of the language braidwill not produce the old language, as the Elders remember it and speak it. If itis successful, a new language will arise, one with deep roots in its traditionalheritage but equally reliant on the urge of its speakers to use the language foreveryday purposes and in everyday contexts far removed from the traditionalones. This can be disappointing, even disillusioning, for those who see the oldlanguage as something sacred, a rock of stability in a sea of confusion. But thedilemma cannot be escaped. A commitment to primary discourse requires awillingness to accept and foster change.2From the point of view of language renewal, use is far more important thanformunlike in traditional communities, where use could be taken for granted.This can mean developing a new secondary discourse about the language, inorder to make primary discourse accessible for as many people as possible.Dick Littlebear, again, hit the nail on the head in his post-banquet talk. Do notbe too critical of language learners, he said; don't be too puristic about gram-mar or pronunciation. That is something that can be very hard for fluent speak-ers to do, particularly if they are influenced by modern linguistics and its affin-ity for standard language. However, our stories about language renewal have toput discourse first. Get your learners to take ownership of the language, to useit for their own purposes, to start building relationships through it; then workon the details. 1Fishman (1991) is an excellent source of information and commentary on StrandThree programs. On language nests, see also Fleras (1987) and Smith (1992).Hinton (1994) describes the master-apprentice program along with many otherCalifornian language initiatives. For Te Aatarangi, mentioned in Fishman (1991),my main source is a personal encounter with Te Ripowai Higgins, a longtimelanguage activist who now lectures in Maori Studies at the University of Victoria,Wellington, New Zealand. Nicholson (1990) describes adult Maori languageretreats held at Maori culture centers.2lssues of this kind are very much in evidence in Israel, regarding the purity ofspoken Hebrew, and New Zealand, regarding Maori. Although poor teaching isoften blamed for these developments, I believe that they follow unavoidablyfrom the reintegration of the language in contemporary primary discourse. Man-agement of this transition is no easy task.-312 Teaching Indigenous LanguagesFurther implications of an ecological approachThe theory of linguistic ecology sketched here can shed light on manyother facets of language renewal. By way of illustration, let us take the threeissues raised by Barbara Burnaby (see Burnaby, this volume) in her plenaryaddress to the Symposium on Saturday morning. Drawing on many years ofworking with Canadian First Nations communities, Dr. Burnaby suggested thatsolutions to this trio of problems could be essential to developing sustainablestrategies for language maintenance.The first was the problem of local control and critical mass. Can the solu-tions that work for large language communities such as the Navajo also workfor small, isolated communities of a few hundred people? Is there some level ofinstitutional complexity that needs to be attained in order to keep a languageprogram vital and evolving? What does this mean for language renewal in smallcommunities?If primary discourse alone were enough, or if secondary discourse remainedunder the exclusive control of the community, critical mass would not be afactor. Historically, very small family groups were able to develop and main-tain distinct language varieties because their entire discursive world contrib-uted to the task. Every story, every communicative act reinforced the impor-tance and value of that variety. But today, indigenous languages have lost for-ever their monopoly on community discourse, and, as I have made clear, pri-mary discourse alone is not enough to keep the local language at the center oflocal meaning and communication systems. Storytellers and knowledge-mak-ers are needed for a language to survive. And this is why numbers are a realissue. The smaller the community, the greater the proportion of its people thatwill have to be involved in storytelling and knowledge-making. Yet the timeand skills available for this work are limited and always vulnerable to co-op-tion by the non-indigenous world.The most hopeful factor for small language communities is that secondarydiscourses travel. Perhaps indigenous storytellers can find ways to support eachother and enable smaller communities to profit from a much greater creativepool. Translation is still needed, but translation is faster than creation. I amthinking not only of writers of various kinds (novelists, poets, songwriters, andothers), but also of indigenous philosophers, teachers, scientists, and of courseElders, who combine all of those roles. Perhaps in this age of the Internet it willbe possible to develop rapid ways of exchanging stories between communitiesand sharing them on a wider scale than was ever possible before. The greatchallenge will be to ensure that this does not happen through the medium ofEnglish (or other languages of ruling) alone, but involves indigenous languagesfront and center.In her second point, Dr. Burnaby noted that most and perhaps all success-ful language programs hinge on strong, charismatic leaders, typically women.Why is this? Where do they come from? How do we foster them?If we think of the discursive world of a healthy, authentically self-govern-ing linguistic community as a triple braid, we can also think of each individual 3133 27- Teaching Indigenous Languagesin that community as weaving their own braids, each a microcosmic variant ofthe whole. We recognize as leaders those whose own discursive braids repre-sent a compelling model of authenticitya revelation for others of what theyand their community could become. I suspect that most leaders of this type arewomen, because primary discoursethe world of emotions, relationships, andthe flexible negotiation of meaninglies at the heart of language and authen-ticity, and women, whether for reasons biological or cultural or both, oftenpossess far greater skills than men for negotiating and cultivating this world.This hypothesis needs testing through ethnographic studies of such leaders;however, we can briefly explore its implications for language renewal.If women indeed tend to be better weavers of Strand Three, then perhapslanguage activists, in developing new settings for informal language use, shouldlook to the needs and aspirations of the women of their communities. Not onlydaycare centers, but parent and family support groups, women-only literacyand health groups, classes in traditional crafts, and career- and education-re-lated networks for women can provide nurturing settings for primary discourseto flourish. Language activists also need to identify family dysfunction as alinguistic problem as well as a social one. The looser the bonds of relationship,the more likely it is that community members will be swept off their feet by theflood of non-indigenous secondary discourse, leading eventually to the loss oflanguage. Conversely, the stronger are a community's ties of family and friend-ship, the more widespread will be the traits of strong leadership, reducing thepressure on isolated individuals and enabling the community to respond cre-ativelyand authenticallyto change.Dr. Burnaby's third problem, negativity, was exemplified by a dedicatedlanguage teacher who refused to share her materials with others. In similarvein, in papers to earlier Symposia, Joshua Fishman (1996b) spoke of a \"deathwish\" that can capture languages and their speakers; while Michael Krausswarned of \"denial\" as being \"the most important barrier that impedes the stabi-lization, revival, and maintenance of our languages\" (1996, p. 21). Are thesefears well-founded? What pathology triggers negativity, death wishes, and de-nial, and how can it be cured?Let us think again of how knowing subjects use language in discourse toorganize their experience of the world. The very phenomenon of a stable sub-jectivity is based on our ability to reconcile conflicting discourses, or avoidthem entirely. Yet speakers and teachers of endangered languages typicallystruggle with alienating secondary discourses in the invading language, dayafter day, in a primary discursive context that may be severely restricted. Onewonders when Dr. Burnaby's selfish language teacher last laughed in her lan-guage? What emotional hurdles must she overcome every time she sees thelanguage of the heart imprisoned in classroom and textbook? The solution shehas adopted is to let go of Strand Three altogetherthe most personal, painful,threatening strand. Leave the language in the books; become an Expert guard-ian of its secondary discourses. In the same way, in many communities, Eldersmay refuse to speak their language with younger people or berate them for 314 Teaching Indigenous Languagesusing it incorrectly; teachers may focus on rote learning; and fluent adults maypretend that they do not know the language. All of these decisions contribute tounraveling the language braid.If such flights are to be halted, ways must be found for even small numbersof speakers to enjoy using their language together. In Reversing Language Shift,Joshua Fishman writes that language festivals and language evenings are de-ceptive, because people enjoy them so much that they may forget that nothinghas changed. But something does change, if a language is no longer heard onlyat funeralsthe situation Rangi Nicholson so graphically described for Maoriat the Symposium. By themselves, festivals are not enough. Yet the triple braidtells us that one approach is never enough. Only when woven together can thestrands endure.In closing, I want to return to the title of this paper, which speaks of anecological approach to language renewal. In part, ecology is being used here asa metaphor for the way in which language is enmeshed in a discursive environ-ment of unimaginable complexity and for the dynamics involved in the playbetween primary and secondary discourses. How6fer, I believe it to be morethan a metaphor. Language evolved in human communities where personal expe-rience, social organization, and knowledge of the world were tightly interwo-ven. The spread of standard languages has advanced our (objectified) knowl-edge of the world immensely; but by the same token, it has also been inextrica-bly linked with the twin evils of social alienation and environmental destruc-tion. The link between language and wholeness, between language and the sa-cred, is felt in similar ways around the world; it can only be maintained bytelling and sharing stories rooted in time, place, and relationships. Turn lan-guage into an artifact, export it on a massive scale, and reified concepts andobjectified discourses will soon begin to cover up local meanings like asphalt.The language renewal movement thus forms part of a much broader move-ment towards reestablishing societies on a human scale and in balance withnature. Once again, many Elders and language activists know this (recallEvangeline Parsons Yazzie's tale of the deer mouse and the hantavirus in heropening address). \"Our language is in everything we do,\" I heard often at theSymposium. What this means is that the choice of the languages we speak isalso, inevitably, a choice about the kind of life we and our children will live andthe kind of world we will create. I hope that the theory introduced here willhelp us to choose wisely and to build well. ReferencesBakhtin, Mikhail. (1981/1935). Discourse in the novel. In M. of Texas.Bakhtin, Mikhail.
