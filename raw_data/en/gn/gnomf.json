Alto, MD Background: A survey was conducted of 26 physician offices and the County Health Department to determine the quality of vaccine storage. Methods: All refrigerators were examined for secure electrical supply, firmly shut door, storage of inappropriate items, and expired vaccines. A maximum-minimum thermometer was then placed in the middle of the storage area for 24 hours, and temperatures were recorded. Results: Of the 27 sites, only two had refrigerator temperatures in which both maximum and minimum temperatures fell within the acceptable range of 2\u00b0 to SoC. Sixty-three percent fell below minimum, 59 percent were above maximum, and 93 percent fell either below or above or both. Eight of the offices had a designated cold chain monitor, but there was no correlation with appropriate monitoring and storage of vaccines. Nine of the offices had permanent thermometers, but no correlation could be found between these sites and appropriate storage temperatures. Conclusions: A majority of vaccines in the community have been exposed to conditions that could reduce or destroy their potency. Physicians must educate their personnel in proper storage techniques of vaccines to ensure the potency of these vaccines. (J Am Board Fam Pract 1995; S:91-4.) During the last decade there has been an in\u00ad creased emphasis by health providers on improv\u00ad ing the delivery of vaccinations to infants, chil\u00ad dren, and teenagers. In the next decade, millions of dollars will be spent on increasing immuniza\u00ad tion coverage as the country moves toward the disease-prevention goals presented in Healthy People 2000.1 Some of this energy should be directed toward preserving the cold chain, as vac\u00ad cinations might not be effective if the process of their delivery and storage at clinics is compro\u00ad mised.2 Recent research from general practices in Great Britain and the national cold chain system in Hungary reveals multiple weak spots in the cold chain of vaccine storage, including limited awareness of codes, improper storage conditions, and storage of outdated vaccines.3-5 A concern has arisen that these weak links in the cold chain are present in the United States as well despite the recent heightened awareness of proper vac\u00ad cine storage.6,7 Are our immunization clinics and private physician's offices monitoring for breaks Submitted, revised, 18 October 1994.

Are monitors aware that freezing or heat can adversely affect a given vaccine? Vaccines have recommended storage tempera\u00ad ture guidelines, and failure to ensure an optimal temperature could expose them to a possible de\u00ad crease or loss of potency. Vaccine manufacturers will assist physicians in clinical decision making regarding the potency of vaccines stored under nonideal temperatures. In general, all vaccines, except oral polio and unreconstituted measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), cannot be frozen without damage. All vaccines except polio are sta\u00ad ble for several days at room temperature. 2 The specific freezing points of vaccines are not readily available. Manufacturers recommend against storage at less than 2\u00b0C and advise discard\u00ad ing any vaccine that was stored at less than DOC. Oral polio virus vaccine should be stored at less than DoC, but it may be thawed and refrozen sev\u00ad eral times under specific conditions. Physicians are urged to contact the manufacturers for more details. Current recommendations are that diph\u00ad theria, tetanus toxoid, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, vaccines be stored between 2\u00b0 and gOC.2 To ensure that this temperature is maintained, 1 person in the office should be a designated cold chain monitor and Vaccine Storage 91 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from properly educated concerning vaccine storage.8,9 This person should check and record daily maxi\u00ad mum and minimum storage temperatures, guard against inappropriate uses of the refrigerator, and monitor the expiration dates of vaccines. This study was undertaken to determine the quality of vaccine storage in family practice and pediatric offices and at the County Health De\u00ad partment in one community. The results provide a base line for future interventions to improve the cold chain. Methods A list of community physician offices was ob\u00ad tained from the telephone directory to include all primary care physicians in the Grand Valley of Colorado. A total of 2 8 offices were participat\u00ad ing in childhood immunization programs. A phy\u00ad sician at each office was contacted and a request was made to administer a questionnaire to the per\u00ad son in charge of the care of vaccines and to moni\u00ad tor the storage temperature of the vaccine refrig\u00ad erator for a 24-hour period. Of the 28 offices contacted, only one declined to participate. An investigator then scheduled a day to visit the office. The person who took care of vaccine stor\u00ad age (cold chain monitor, nurse, medical office as\u00ad sistant) was administered a brief verbal question\u00ad naire. Included were questions concerning possible designation of an office cold chain moni\u00ad tor, inventory techniques of incoming vaccines as well as vaccines on site, and what the office con\u00ad sidered to be an ideal storage temperature. The vaccine storage refrigerator and its contents were examined. A maximum-minimum thermometer probe was placed as close as possible to the center of the refrigerator and monitored until it read be\u00ad tween 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C. The probe remained for at least 24 hours after which the investigator returned to the office site and maximum and minimum tem\u00ad peratures were recorded. Two identical thermom\u00ad eters were used to facilitate data collection. They were checked for accuracy by calibration from -10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0C using a standard laboratory ther\u00ad mometer as reference. Accuracy was \u00b1 1\u00b0C. There was no known power outage during this study. Temperatures were recorded during weekdays so that the refrigerator was actively in use. Freezer temperature for storage of the oral polio virus vac\u00ad cine was not monitored. One office did not have a freezer; it also did not store oral polio virus. 92 JABFP March-April1995 Vo!' 8 No.2 Results Eight of 27 offices (30 percent) had a designated cold chain monitor. Nine of 27 offices (33 per\u00ad cent) had a refrigerator thermometer. Two ther\u00ad mometers were never read, six were read daily, and one was read weekly. Of the eight offices with a designated monitor, seven offices had a refrigera\u00ad tor thermometer, and temperatures were moni\u00ad tored on a daily or weekly basis. Respondents in 13 offices said that 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C is the ideal storage temperature for most childhood vaccines. Fourteen responded either incorrectly or did not know. All respondents knew that heat can harm vaccine potency; 5 answered \"false\" to the statement, \"Freezing can harm certain vac\u00ad cines.\" (\"True\" is the correct answer.) Twenty-six refrigerators contained items other than vaccines, including food in 11 and blood products in 6. Six refrigerators had automatic defrost fea\u00ad tures. The remainder were defrosted by office personnel every month to every 4 years. Two of\u00ad fices reported defrosting when the temperature became unstable, and both of these offices had re\u00ad frigerator temperatures that exceeded the accept\u00ad able range. Seventeen percent of the refrigerators had a permanent electrical hookup, ensuring against ac\u00ad cidental disconnection and compromise of the cold chain. All refrigerator doors were found to shut firmly; however, one door was ajar at the onset of the inspection. One person stated that the office had a written protocol should the refrigerator temperature ex\u00ad ceed the specified range. Although all of the moni\u00ad tors reported that they discarded vaccine vials not used within the manufacturer's recommended time, 10 offices had refrigerators that contained expired vaccines, including several vaccines that were more than 1 year out of date and in one in\u00ad stance more than 2 years out of date. Of the 27 sites, only two were found to have re\u00ad frigerator temperatures in which both maximum and minimum temperatures fell within the ac\u00ad ceptable range of 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (Figure 1). Neither of these offices had a cold chain monitor. Sixty-three percent of office refrigerators had temperatures that fell below the minimum, and 50 percent were higher than the maximum; 93 percent registered either above or below or both. Twenty-six percent fell below O\u00b0C, severely compromising the po- on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Discussion The results of this study show that vaccine stor\u00ad age in our community was inadequate, and cold chain monitors were not monitoring effectively. The primary care physicians and their staff in this community were in need of education in the pres\u00ad ervation of the cold chain of vaccines. By follow\u00ad ing some very general guidelines, vaccines could be subjected to less frequent or extreme tempera\u00ad ture variation. Table 1 is suitable for posting near the vaccine refrigerator. One person in each office should be assigned the duties of the cold chain monitor.7,s That per\u00ad son would learn requirements of vaccine storage and regularly inspect incoming and stored vac\u00ad cines for expiration dates. Each office should ob\u00ad tain two maximum-minimum thermometers for each vaccine refrigerator in the office: one for the freezer compartment and the other placed as closely as possible to the center of the refrigerated storage area. The cold chain monitor should ex-This study monitored vaccines only from the time of arrival at the physician's office to the time of administration to the patient. In our community vaccines are shipped without temperature indicators and could well have been damaged before reaching the physician's office.10,1l This important issue requires further study. Although the physician might have less direct control over what happens to vaccines before arrival at the office, there are numerous ways to monitor storage of vaccines on site to ensure that the extensive amount of time and money spent in promoting a healthy Table 1. Rules for Care of Vaccines. 1. Designate a cold chain monitor and an alternate person to assume responsibility when the monitor is away. 2. Place a maximum-minimum thermometer as close as possible to the center of refrigerator and freezer storage areas. 3. Check refrigerator and freezer temperatures daily and record them on a graph. The correct temperatures are 2-8\u00b0C in the refrigerator and <O\u00b0C in the freezer. 4. Keep the freezer free of excessive ice buildup. Check weekly. Store vaccines properly when defrosting freezer. S. Check all vaccines on arrival for evidence of heat damage or freezing. Ask the supplier to include a temperature indicator within the shipment packing. 6. Monitor vaccine expiration dates monthly. Expired or dam\u00ad aged vaccines should be discarded. 7. Do not use the refrigerator for storage of items other than vaccines and medications. 8. Provide the refrigerator with a permanent electrical hookup. 9. Close the refrigerator door promptly.

Downloaded from childhood through timely vaccination schedules is worthwhile and efficacious. Although this study was small, the results could apply to other loca\u00ad tions. A state or regional cold chain study would help to determine whether improper vaccine storage is a concern and whether children remain at risk for immunization-preventable diseases.
