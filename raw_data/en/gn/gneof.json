GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE 4 CFR Part 21 General Accounting Office-Bid Protest Regulations AGENCY: General Accounting Office. ACTION: Final rule. surmarARY: These rules reflect adoption of and amendments to the General Accounting Office's proposed rules published September 17,1984 (49 FR 36386), implementing section 3551-3556 of title 31, United States Code (as added by section 2741 of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369) and respond to comments submitted. They are designed to provide the framework for the consideration of bid protests by the General Accounting Office. EFFECTIVE DATe: January 15,1985. FOR FURTHEM111FORMATION CONTACT. John Brosnan, Senior Attorney, Accounting Office, by telephone (2021 275-5476. SUPPLEe, -ARY tF~On.'Tt: The General Accounting Office's proposed rules were the subject of 30 days public comment In light of the comments received several changes are made. The'Comments Twenty-three comments were received on the proposed rules. The following is a discussion of the principal issues raised in. the comments and the General Accounting Office's response thereto. Section 21.0(d) defined \"days\" in the regulations as working days of the federal government. One commenter suggested that GAO explain how days would be counted for the purpose of calculating the various time limits prescribed by the regulations. In response, \u00a7 21.0(d) has been revised toprovide the method by -hich such periods of time will be calculatcd. Also. GAO has revised \u00a7 21.0[d) to state that \u00a7 21.4, concernin withholdLng of contract award and suspcnsion of contract performance, is ezcludcd from the general rule that the term \"days, means government worling days, because \u00a7 21.4 repeats for informational purposes language from the Competition In Contracting Act of 1184, Pub. L. 93- 369 (Competition in Contract;ng Act). \u00a7 21.0(e) definition of \"adverse agency action\" be revised to include bid opening and receipt of proposals as examples of adverse agency action. The section has been so revised. Several commenters suggested that GAO clarify questions regarding the joint jurisdiction of the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals and GAO concerning protests of Brooks Act procurements for automated data processing equipment and services. Under section 3552 of the Competition In Contracting Act, a party who files a protest with the Board may not later file a protest with respect to that procurement with GAO. Section 21.1(a) contained similar language. In response to the comments, GAO has expanded the section 3:0. prohibition to cover all protests filed with respect to a particular procurement. Thus. to avoid an undesirable fragmentatl.n (f remedies, \u00a7 211(a) has bcen amnended to provide that after a particular procurement has been protested to t~e Board no protests by any rarty regarding that procuremcrnt rad be considered by GAO wrgh:. that ti l protest is before the Board. Several federal agencies bave suggested that \u00a7 21.1[c), dc::zrb-r the elements of a protest. be emended to require that protests include a citation of the specific statute or regulation the protester contends the agency violated. GAO recognizes that the Compe.tition In Contracting Act describes prests as concerning alleged violations of procurement statutes or rmglatiorc. A requirement that protesters cite the particular statute or repulation al!egd'dy violated seems unnecessary, hot-vcr, where a protester clearly deccribc3 the basis of protest, GAO would not want to dismiss a protest merely because a statute or regulation has not been cited. Many commenter requested chEmnges in the scheme contained In \u00a7\u00a7 21.1 and21.2 rcgard1in ofprotests and t6e 21.2(b)(1) stated that a prates!r ould nat be considered filed at GAO until itvas received in GAO's Procurement Lev. Control Group. That section also required that the protest includle evidence of service upon the contracting activity and contracting aaency. Sect!=i 21.2[b][21 provided that service could be accomplished.by delivering the protest in person or by sending the protest by certified, fkt-class or avernight mail. Section 21.4h)(3 required that the proleot contain a certificate of servisa. Also, other sections rontained corresponding requirements. Su.tzo_ 21.1(c), describing the content of a protest, required that a certificate of service be included in the protest. Section 1.3(c) required the czntracting agency to serve its report in t ze same manmeirtat protestz were to be 21.6,cl (nor; \u00a7 comments to be \".sored.\" Some commenters complained that the requirement in \u00a7 21.2(b)[-1 that protests be sp.cifically received in GAO's Procurement Law Control Group placed too great a risk of late filg on protesters and that the requirement in \u00a7 21.2[bl[2h)( for a certi-Ecate of sevice was unduly contractLna age complained prinmrfly that depo:;-zlNt a ccpy of the protest in thea mail did n3t inrz-a that the a;ency would it rzcnzo to thaz-e sn.;wtoz, GAO a L.- to-be dee=m--ed if reze : in GAO itz=F, rather in t Procuem ,nt Law Can -.d Grsup. ThEa service cn! certLfcat- o sarvz e requirements 212 b E3 have bean ellminated. .zz \u00a7 21.1(d) has been added -hic kpz!,dess that a copy of the protest m=st be received by the appropriate agency official or location wi!thin I day aftw the protczt is fled with GAO. Rather than the mere formal certificate of servf-c the protest must state that a copy has been or wil be provided promptly ta the agency. The burden Is en the prote-ter to get the copy of its protest to the agency wihin a day of fling at GAO. After GAO notifies the agency that a . protest has been filed, the contracting agency should inform GAO if it has not received the proteat document. The agency can facilitate timely receipt of a 49418 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations copy of the protest by providing in their solicitations notice designating where the protest copy should be furnished. Section 21.1(c](2) has also been amended to require that a copy of the protest along with the original be filed with GAO. The additional copy can be made available by GAO to contracting agencies in Washington, D.C. Finally, \u00a7 \u00a7 21.1(c), 21.3 (c) and (e), and 21.5(c) have been amended to conform to these revised requirements. Section 21.3(a) provided that GAO would notify the contracting agency within I day of the filing of a protest. Several commenters suggested revising the section to specify precisely how notification would be made. The section has been revised to state that GAO shall notify the contracting agency by telephone within I day of the filing of a protest, and shall promptly maila written confirmation of the notice. Telephone notice is the only practical way to comply with the Competition In Contracting Act's requirement that GAO notify the contracting agency within 1 day of the filing of a protest. Further, \u00a7 21.3(c), concerning the time for filing the agency report, has been revised to state specifically that the 25-day period for filing the report begins to run from the date of telephone notice. GAO received several comments on \u00a7 21.3(b), which provided that material submitted by a protester will not be withheld from the contracting agency or interested parties except as permitted or required by law or r6gulation. One commenter felt that the provision should specifically state the type of information that may be withheld'and the laws or regulations that might apply. Another commenter felt that anyone requesting information should be required to pay for it. After consideration of these comments, the GAO has decided to retain the language of the proposed provision. That language is identical to the language of the corresponding provision of our current procedures. 4 CFR 21.3(b) (1984]. The provision has proven to be clear and fair. GAO has eliminated \u00a7 21.5, which. stated the circumstances in which agencies must provide relevant protest- related documents to interested parties, and incorporated the substance of that provision into \u00a7 21.3(c). Sections 21.6 through 21.13 were renumbered accordingly. This provision gives protesters and other interested parties the right to receive copies of the agency report and relevant documents that would'not give the party a competitive advantage, and that the party is otherwise authorized by law or regulation to receive. If documents arewithheld the report must contain a list of withheld documents. Some commenters felt that \u00a7 21.3(c) required agencies to furnish copies of documents to a party that the party already had in its possession. The provision has been revised to require only copies of \"relevant documents,\"\"as appropriate.\" Two commenters expressed concern that in protests of overseas procurements agencies could not file reports within the 25-day reqmrement of \u00a7 21.3(c). Nevertheless GAO has decided not to revise \u00a7 21.3(d) regarding time extensions to automatically waive the 25-day period for overseas procurements. The 25-day period is mandated by the Competition In Contracting Act for all protests and extensions are to be granted on a case- by-case basis in exceptional circumstances. A few commenters felt that protests should not necessarily be dismissed for failure of the protesters to file comments, a request for an extension of time, or a request that the case be decided on the existing record as required by \u00a7 21.3(e). The GAO has decided not to amend this section. The requirement does not seem burdensome. A protester is required to indicate its continued interest m the protest so that the procurement-is not further disrupted and GAO resources are not wasted by the continuation of a protest in which the protester no longer is interested. A typographical error in \u00a7 21.3(f) has been corrected. The reference to \u00a7 21.2(d) has been changed, to the proper reference, \u00a7 21.2(c). Section 21.3(f)(2), concerning GAO review of Small Business Size Standards, has been revised to include specifically protests of standard industrial classifications among matters that the GAO will not review. Section 21.3(fj(3), which stated that the Small Business Administration (SBA) makes final dispositions of contracting officer determinations that a small business firm is not responsible, has been revised to make it clear that the SBA does not conclusively certify a lack of'responsibility. The section has also been revised to reflect the current language of GAO cases concerning the limited circumstances in which the GAO will review certificate of competency decisions. Two comments were received on \u00a7 21.3(f)(4), which stated that GAO 'would not review the decision to effect a set-aside under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act or the decision to award an 8(a) subcontract, absent a showing of possible fraud or bad faith or that regulations were violated. Onecommenter suggested that the term \"Set- Aside\" be eliminated from the title to avoid confusion with-the small business set-aside program under section 15 of the Small Business Act. That commenter also suggested that the language setting forth the exceptions under which the GAO would review section 8(a) actions be amended by changing the word\"regulations\" to \"Federal Acquisition Regulation.\" The commenter felt that the SBA should handle protests of violations of SBA regulations. The other commenter suggested revising the section to include set-asides under sections 9 and 15 of the Small Business Act-as set-asides not reviewable by GAO, due to the discretion granted by statute to SBA. The commenter also suggested eliminating violation of regulations as an exception permitting review by GAO. The section has been revised to eliminate the word \"Set-Aside\" from the title, and to state that the decision not to place, as well as to place, a procurement under the 8(a) program would not be reviewed by GAO absent the stated exceptions. Section 21.3(f)(5), concerning GAO review of affirmative determinations of responsibility, has been revised to state specifically that it refers to affirmative determinations of responsibility by the contracting officer to distinguish It from SBA certificate of competency actions, Section 21.$(f}(B), which provides that GAO will not review procurements by agencies other than federal agencies, has been revised to include nonappropriated fund activities as an example of an entity other than a federal agency. Section 21.3(f)(9), concerning nonappropriated.fund activities, has been dliminated as a separate section. As a result, \u00a7 21.3(f)(10) has been renumbered \u00a7 21.3(f)(9). Section 21.3(f)(10) has been added stating that GAO will not consider most subcontractor protests. The section also sets forththe circumstances in which GAO will review protests of subcontract awards. This section changes GAO's previous review standards of subcontracts set forth in Optimum Systems, Incorporated, 54 Comp. Gen. 767 (1975), 75-1 CPD 1 166, by eliminating review of subcontracts under any circumstances other than where they are \"by or for\" a federal agency. Other subcontractor protests are beyond the reach of the Competition In Contracting Act. Section 21.3(f)(11) has been revised to state more clearly the circumstances In which the GAO will dismiss a protest Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, Der n bor 20, 1934 / Rules and Regulations 4.419 involving a matter that is or has been the subject of litigation. Under \u00a7 21.4, some commenters questioned why the provisions of the Competition In Contracting Act relating to withholding of award and suspension of contract performance were included in the Bid Protetst Regulations. Several commenters felt the provisions were more appropriate for inclusion in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The provisions are contained in \u00a7 21.4 for the benefit of protesters so that they will not have to refer to multiple sets of regulations to ascertain the effect of a protest. The citation in \u00a7 21.4 (a) and (b) to the Competition In Contracting Act has been moved to the beginninv, of the sections to make this clear. GAO received a large number of comments on \u00a7 21.7, redesignated \u00a7 21.6; most of them concerned the statement in \u00a7 21.7(e) that the recovery of the costs of filing and pursuing a protest would be granted only ff it is not feasible to recommend.any other remedy. Some commenters argued that the granting of the costs of pursuing a protest should be further limited to instances in which the contracting agency's procurement actions and position taken in the protest are not reasonably justified. Conversely, other commenters argued that recovery of coss of pursuing a protest be routinely granted when a protest is sustained regardless of whether any other remedy is recommended. After careful consideration of these comments, GAO has decided to modify the provision. Section 21.6(e) has been revised to allow recovery of the costs of pursuing a sustained protest except where GAO recommends that the protested contract be awarded to the protester and the protester receives the award. Also, the section has been revised to include the standard, adopted from language in the Conference Report on the Competition In Contracting Act, that recovery of the costs of pursuing a protest and bid and proposal preparation will be available only where the contracting agency has unreasonably excluded the protester from the procurement. See Conference Report on the Competition In Contracting Act of 1984, H. Rep. No. 93- 861, at 1437 (June 23, 1984). One important purpose of the bid protest forum is to provide a procedure through which private parties may enforce the substantive provisions of the -Competition In Contracting Act. GAO believes that the amended regulation will help accomplish this aim without undue expense to the public treasury. Section 21.12(b), redesignated \u00a7 21;11(b), has been amended to make clear that sections 3553 (c) and (d) of theCompetition In Contract!: A-- rf 1224 relating to withholding of aw==l and suspension of contract pr.=- do not apply to nonstatutox- pzot2s^Z- Section 21.13(c), redesiga!sd \u00a7 21.12(c), response to a common!, tb aLo L-!e clear that the filing of a f:r reconsideration does nct inve t:-_2 Competiton In Contractin Act provisions for the withhotdhin cf a-.ard or the suspension of coni-act performance. Several commenters have asked that GAO formalize in the regulations its long-standing policy of prohiibi!g c.ox parte contacts regarding the morits of a protest between GAO and the part~es to a bid protest. GAO will continue to follow this policy and net discuzs the merits of a protest with any party except at a protest conference wilfi all paities invited (see \u00a7 21.5).

Extensions are to be considered exceptional and will be granted ,sparingly. (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when on its face a protest does not state a valid basis for protest or is untimely (unless the protest is to be considered pursuant to \u00a7 21.2(c)) or otherwise not for consideration by the General Accounting Office, it will summarily dismiss the protest without requiring the submission of an agency report. When the propriety of a dismissal becomes clear only after information is provided by the contracting agency or is otherwise obtained by the General Accounting Office, it will dismiss the protest at that time. If the General Accounting Office has dismissed the protest, it will notify the contracting agency that a report need not be submitted. Among the protests which may be dismissed without consideration of the merits are those concerning the following: (1) Contract Administration. The administration of an existing contract is within the discretion of the contracting agency. Disputes between a contractor and the agency are resolved pursuant to the disputes clause of the contract and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.41 U.S.C. 601-13. (2) Small Business Size Standards and Standard Inaustrial Classification. Challenges of established size standards or the size status of particular firms, and challenges of the selected standard industrial classification are for review solely by the Small Business Admimstration. 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(6); 13 CFR 121.3-6 (1984]. (3) Small Business Certificate of Competency Program. Any referral made to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act, or any issuance of a certificate of competency or refusal to issue a certificate under such section is not reviewed by the General Accounting Office absent a showing of possible fraud or bad faith on the part of government officials. (4) Procurements under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. Since contractsare let under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act to the Small Business Administration at the contracting, officer's discretion and on such terms as agreed upon by the procuring agency and the Small Business Administration, the decision to place or not to place a procurement under the 8(a) program and the award of an 8[a) subcontract are not subject to review absent a showing of possible fraud or bad faith on the part of government officials or that regulations may have been violated. 15 U.S.C. 637(a). (5) Affirmative Determination of Responsibility by the Contracting Officer. Because a determination that a bidder or offeror is capable of performing a contract is based in large measure or subjective judgments which generally are not readily susceptible of reasoned review, an affirmative determination of responsibility will not be reviewed, absent a showing that such determination was made fraudulently or in bad faith or that definitive responsibility criteria in the solicitation were not met. (6) Procurement Protested to the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals. Interested parties may protest a procurement or proposed procurement of automated data processing equipment and services to the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals. After a particular procurement or proposed procurement is protested to the Board, the procurement may not, while the protest is before the Board, be the subject of a protest to the General Accounting Office. An interested party who has filed a protest with the Board ,may not protest the same matter to the General Accounting Office. 40 U.S.C. 759(h), as amended by section 2713 of the Competition In Contractin' Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-3G9. (7) Protests not filed either in the General Accounting Office or the contracting agency within the time limits set forth in 5 21.2. (8) Procurements by Agencies Other Than Federal Agencies as Defined by Section 3 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1l49. 40 U.S.C. 472. Protests of procurements of proposed procurements by such agencies (e.g., U.S. Postal Service, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. nonappropriated fund activities) are beyond the General Accounting Office bid protest jurisdiction as established in section 2741 of the Competition In Contracting Act of 1914, Pub. L 9-369. (9) Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. Challenges of the legal status of a firm as a regular dealer or manufacturer within the meaning of the Walsh-HealeyAct is for determination solely by the procuring agency, the Small Business Administration (if a small business is involved) and the Secretary of Labor. 41 U.S.C. 35-45. (10) Subcontractor Protests. The General Accounting Office vll not consider subcontractor protests except where the subcontract is by or for the government. (11) Judicial Proceedings. The General Accounting Office will not consider protests where the matter involved is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction, unless the court requests a decision by the General Accounting Office. The General Accounting Office will not consider protests where the matter involved has been decided on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction. (g) A protest decision may not be delayed by the failure of a party to file a submission within the specified time limits. Consequently, the failure of any party or contracting agenty to comply with the prescribed time limits may result in resolution of the protest without consideration of the untimely submission. \u00a7 21.4 Wthho!dIng of award and suspcn.!on of contract performance. Sections 3553 (c) and (d) of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1934 Pub.

Bowshcr, Comptroller General of Grain Inopectlon Service 7 CFR Part 810 U.S. Standards for Triticale AGENCV: Federal Grain Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMArV: According to the requirements for periodic review of existing regulations, the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) has reviewed the U.S. Standards for Triticale. and isamending the triticale standards to: (1) Reduce the allowable limit for castor beans in the numerical grades; (2] delete smut as a factor which would render triticale Sample grade; and (3) make other miscellaneous nonsubstantive changes in language, format, and references. These changes are made to update the standards and conform the standards to other grain standards. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 1, 1926. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTAC. Lewis Lebaliken, Jr., Information Resources Management Branch, USDA. FGIS, Room 0557 South Building. 140 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, D.C. 20250; telephone (202) 382-1738. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12291 This final rule has been issued in conformance with Executive Order 12Z91 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1. This action has been classified as nonmajor because it does not meet the criteria for a major regulation as established in the Order. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification Dr. Kenneth A. Gilles, Administrator, FGIS. has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because those persons who apply the standards and most users of triticale inspection services do not meet the requirements for small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Further, the standards are applied equally to all entities by FGIS employees or licensed persons. Final Action The review of the standards included a determination of the continued need for the standards and the potential to clarify or simplify the language of the standards; a review of changes in mareting practices and functions affecting the standards; a review of changes in technolog-y and economic conditions in the area affected by the standards; and a determination of the potential to improve the standards and their application through the incorporation of grading factors or tests which better indicate quality attributes. The objective was to assure that the standards continue to serve the needs of the marhet to the greatest possible extent. A notice requesting public comment on the U.S. Standards for Triticale was published in the December 21 1933 Federal Register (48 FR 56393). Within 49424 Federal Register I Vol. 49, No. 246 I Thursday, December 20, 1984 I Rules and Regulations the 60-day comment period, 6 comments were received. All comments addressed 3 primary issues. 1. Should the allowable limits for castor beans in the numerical grades (7 CFR 810.656) be tightened from 2 to 1. for example, 2 seeds would render triticale U.S. Sample grade? Two commenters suggested that in tightening allowable limits for castor beans, FGIS should proceed further and allow no castor beans in triticale. One commenter misinterpreted the proposed change and objected to raising the limit from 0 to 1. Two castor beans are currently allowed in the numerical grades, and the proposal was to permit only one. Although the commenters expressed a desire to see the allowable limit further reduced, such a change is not necessary, based upon present testing information regarding the presence of castor beans in triticale. 2. Should the presence of an extreme amount of smut be deleted as a factor rendering triticale U.S. Sample grade (7 CFR 810.656)? Two commenters asked that FGIS retai current limits for smut, and advised-against looser limits. FGIS was not proposing to change the limits for \"Light smutty\" and \"Smutty\", but to delete the provision which renders ttiticale Sample grade when the quantity uf smut is so great that one or more of the grade requirements cannot be determined accurately. Due to seed treatment and other improvements, the \"Sample grade\" provision based upon smut has not been applied for several years. 3. Should the standards be eliminated or is there sufficient need to retain them? Four commenters stated that triticale standards must be retained to aid in their efforts to market the grain. Research results have been published on the nutritional aspects of triticale. While market development has been somewhat slow, these merchandisers of triticale advised that the standards are needed to continue development of the market. Two commenters suggested that test weight limits may need to be increased. When the standards for triticale were promulgated, it was understood that as more varieties were developed, and the production areas expanded, the need for adjustments in the grade-determining factors would be addressed. At this time, the number of new varieties and the expansion of acreage and production are not sufficient to evaluate a need for change in the test weight requirement, One commenter stated that there was no need to retain the triticale standards; however, the commenter concurred thatif'the standards were retained, changes should be made on the two issues of castor beans and smut A proposal to amend the standards for triticale was published in the July 31,. 1984 Federal Register (49 FR 30480). and a correction was issued subsequently (49 FR 31432] on August 7, 1984, to correct the close of the comment period and the format of the grade chart (\u00a7 810.658). No commentswere received in response to the proposal FGIS is ' publishing as a final rule the text of the proposed rule except for additional minor non-substantive format changes referenced below. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act, no standards established or amendments or revocations of standards under the Act are to becpme effective less than one calendar year after promulgation, unless in the judgment of the Administrator, the public health, interest, or safety require that they become effective sooner. To coincide with the beginning of the 1986 harvest, the amendments will become effective May 1.1986. A review of available information indicates that certain amendments to the standards would clarify and increase the effectiveness of the standards and effect uniformity with other standards, especially the wheat and rye standards. As a result of this review, FGIS is revising the U.S. Standards for Triticale as follows: 1. The allowable limit for castor beans in the numerical grades (7 CFR 810.656) will be reduced from 2 to 1, for example, 2 or more seeds will grade triticale U.S. Sample grade. Castor bean seeds are rarely fpund in any grgin. However, the large size of the seed and the toxicity of the ricin found within, make it prudent to permit the presence of only the minimum number of seeds in triticale, as is practicable. Accordingly, \u00a7 810.656 is amended to show that the limit for castor bean seeds in the numerical grades is reduced from 2 to 1, for example, when a 1,000 gram sample -contains 2 or more castor beans, the triticale will be graded \"U.S. Sample grade.\" 2. The presence of an extreme amount of smut is deleted as a factor rendering triticale U.S. Sample grade. Currently, when smut is evident in a sample, the special grades \"Light smutty\" and \"Smutty\" are applied (7 CFR 810.658 (d) and (e)). Also, when the sample contains a quantity of smut so great that one or more grade requirements cannot be determined accurately, a U.S. Sample grade designation is applied (7 CFR 810.656(b)). Inspection data show that triticale rarely, if at all, contains so much smut that grade requirementscannot be determined accurately. The special grades adequately inform the user of the condition of the triticale and make the requirement regarding extreme quantities of smut as U.S Sample grade unnecessary. Accordingly, \u00a7 810.050 is amended to show that the presence of an extreme amount of smut will not render the triticale U.S. Sample grade. 3. Revisions in wording are made to clarify and effect uniformity among standards, including reference to FGIS handbooks.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification Dr. Kenneth A. Gilles, Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because those persons who apply the standards and most users of flaxseed inspection services do not meet the requirements for small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.]. Further, the standards are applied equally to all entities by FGIS employees or licensed persons. Final Action This review of standards included a determination of the continued need for the standards and the potential to clarify or simplify the language of the standards; a review of changes in marketing practices and functions affecting the standards; a review of changes in technology and economic conditions in the area affected by the standards; and a determination of the potential to improve the standards and their application through incorporation of grading factors or tests which better indicate quality attributes. The objective was to assure that the standards continue to serve the needs of the market to the greatest possible extent. A notice requesting public comment on the U.S. Standards for Flaxseed was published in the December 29, 1983 Federal Register (48 FR 57304]. Within the 60-day comment period, one comment was received. The comment addressed two issues in the notice: 1. Should the format of the flaxseed standards (7 CFR 810.501 et seq.) be updated to conform to the current arrangement of the sections as appears in the wheat standards? 2. Should the moisture requirement for U.S. Sample grade flaxseed be deleted? The commenter agreed that the format of the flaxseed standards should be updated and that the moisture requirement for U.S. Sample grade flaxseed be deleted. A proposal to revise the standards for flaxseed was-published m the August 10, 1984 Federal Register [49 FR 32077). Within the 60-day comment period two comments were received. One commenter expressed support for the proposed changes. The other commenter opposed deleting the moisture requirement for U.S. Sample grade flaxseed since moisture is a critical factor relating to storage of flaxseed. Moisture content will continue to be shown on all official certificates which show an official grade determination.Further, desired moisture levels could be achieved through contracting. Since specifying a maximum moisture content is a common practice the grade limit generally does not serve a useful purpose. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the U.S. Grain Standards Act no standards established or amendments or revocations of standards under this Act are to become effective less than one calendar year after promulgation, unless in the judgment of the Administrator, the public health, interest, or safety require that they become effective sooner. To coincide with the beginning of the 1986 harvest, the amendments will become effective July 13,1986. A review of available information indicates that certain revisions m the standards would increase clarity and effectiveness of the standards and reflect current marketing practices. As a result of this review, the U.S. Standards for Flaxseed are revised as discussed below. 1. To enhance clarity and uniformity between standards, the U.S. Standards for Flaxseed are revised by dividing the standards into 3 parts, and into sections, similar to the present format in the U.S. Standards for Wheat. Specifically, in addition to the changes discussed below, an undesignated heading, Terms- Defined consists of a new \u00a7 810.501, Definition of flaxseed, and a new \u00a7 810.502, Definition of other terms. An undesignated heading, Principles Governing Application of Standards consists of a new \u00a7 810.503 Basis of determination, a new \u00a7 810.504, Temporary modifications in equipmentand procedures, and a new \u00a7 810.505, Percentages. An undesignated heading, Grades, Grade Requirements, and Grade Designations consists of a new \u00a7 810.506, Grades andgrade requirements for flaxseed and a new \u00a7 810.507, Grade designations. Incidental to this revision, the current \u00a7 810.501, Terms defined is eliminated as unnecessary. The current \u00a7 810.502, Flaxseed is clarified by rewording the -definition and is included in the new \u00a7 810.501, Definition of flaxseed. Included in a and thes sections are clarified by rewording the definitions as necessary. Also included in the new \u00a7 810.502, Definition of other terms, are the definitions for 2 new terms, Distinctly low quality and Other grains which are terms presently used in the flaxseed standards and, as such, should be defined. The definitions arethe same or similar to those used In other grain standards including wheat. The current \u00a7 810.507, Principles governing the application of standards is eliminated as unnecessary, The current \u00a7 810.508, Basis of determinations Is clarified by rewording the section and is included in the new \u00a7 810.503, Basis of determination which is divided into three subparagraphs, distinctly low quality, certain quality determinations, and all other determinations. This format appears in the wheat standards and the information which-appears in the section generally is contained In the FGIS Grain Inspection Handbook. The current \u00a7 810.509, Percentages is clarified by spelling out in greater detail the rounding procedures currently used for flaxseed. Accordingly, the revision specifies how a figure is rounded when followed by a figure greater, lesser, or equal to five. This revision makes the wording of the section the same or similar to that used in other grain standards, as appropriate. The pection is included in the new \u00a7 810.505, Percentages. The current \u00a7 810.512, Grades is eliminated as unnecessary. The current \u00a7 810.513, Grades andgrade requirements for Flaxseed is clarified by making format changes and is included in the new \u00a7 810.506, Grades andgrade requirements for Flaxseed The current \u00a7 Grade designatiovs is included in the new \u00a7 810.507, Grade designations. 2. FGIS has deleied the moisture requirement for U.S. Sample grade flaxseed which presently appears In \u00a7 810.513. Flaxseed which contains moisture in excess of 9.5 percent is currently graded U.S. Sample grade. Moisture content is a condition of the grain rather than a quality factor. Pursuant to current trade practices, discounts for moisture generally are assessed on the actual moisture content rather than numerical grade to account for weight loss and drying costs of the handler. High moisture grain is a normal condition during movement from harvest into market channels or storage. Moisture content by itself does not imply an intrinsic quality, but rather measures the amount of dry matter and water content of the grain. Moreover, moisture content can be specified through contracting which is a common practice, for example, with corn. Since specifying a maximum moisture content is a common practice, the grade limit generally does not serve a useful purpose. Also, the grain may be dried and graded accordingly. The moisture content will continue to be shown on all official certificates which show the49426 Federal Register / Vol. 49,No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations Federal Register / Vol. 49, No, 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations 49427 official grade determination as required under \u00a7 800.162(a)13) of.the regulations, Moisture content is not a grade- determining factor in the U.S. Standards for Wheat, Barley, Oats, Triticale, and Rye. A final rule to delete moisture content as a grade-determining factor in the U.S. Standards for Corn, Sorghum. and Soybeans as published in the September 12, 1984, Federal Register 149 FR 35743), with an effective date of September 9, 1985. Accordingly, this deletion adds consistency among the various grain standards. 3. The equipment and procedures referred to in the flaxseed standards are applicable to grain produced and harvested under normal environmental conditions. The revision provides that, when adverse growing or harvesting conditions make impractical the use of routine procedures, minor temporary modifications in the equipment or procedures may be required to obtain results expected -under normal conditions. Accordingly, a new \u00a7 810.504 on temporary modifications in equipment and procedures is added. Adjustments in interpretations (ie., identity, quality, and condition) shall not be made. This section is similar to sections which appear in other grain standards. 4. FGIS has included in the definition of U.S. Sample grade, the limits for stones, pieces of glass, crotalaria seeds, castor beans, particles of an unknown foreign substance(s) or a commonly recognized harmful or toxic substance(s), rodent pellets, bird droppings, and animal filth. The limits of 8 or more stones, 2 or more pieces of glass, 3 or more crotalaria seeds, 2 or more castor beans, 4 or more particles of an unknown foreign substance(s) or a commonly recognized harmful or toxic substance[s), and 10 or more pieces of rodent pellets, bird droppings, or other animal filth, have been followed in the inspection process for many years as they have appeared in the FGIS Grain Inspection Handbook and do not constitute new limits. The limits are added to the d,finition of U.S. Sample grade for Tclarity and to conform flaxseed to other grain standards Further, in addition to the changes proposed to \u00a7 810,513 ,as -discussed above, miscellaneous non-substantive format changes are made for clarity, to facilitate the use of the standards and to conform flaxseed standards to other grain standards. 5. Footnotes are updated to reference the Inspection and Equipment Hand books as appropriate and delete outdated references. 6. Allowable limits for croialaria seeds are included in the definition ofU.S. Sample grade for clarity and uniformity with other grain standards, This limit currently is included in \u00a7 810.901 which considers grain exceeding this limit as distinctly low quality. Section 810.901 still is applicable to soybeans but no longer applies to flaxseed. Similar revisions have been made to all the other grain standards with the intention of eventually deleting \u00a7 810.901 in its entirety. A final rule to delete corn from \u00a7 810.901 was published in the September 7, 1984, Federal Re~ister (49 FR 35339), with an effective date of September 9, 1985. Therefore, FGIS has amended \u00a7 810.901 since the provision is included in the U.S. Sample grade definition for flaxseed; and the section is not referenced in the flaxseed standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12291 This, final rule has been issued in conformance with Executive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1. This action has been classified as nonmajor because it does not meet the criteria for a major regulation established in the order. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification Dr. Kenneth A. Gilles, Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because those persons who apply the standards and most users of oats inspection services do not meet the requirements for small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Further, the standards are applied equally to all entities by FGIS employees or licensed persons. Final Action This review of the standards included a determination of the continued need for the standards and the potential to clarify or simplify the language of the standards; a review of changes in marketing practices and functions affecting the standards; a review of changes in technology and economic conditions in the area affected by the standards; and a determination of the potential to improve the standards and their application through the incorporation of grading factors or tests which better indicate quality attributes. The objective was to assure that the standards continue to serve the needs of the market to the greatest possible extent. A notice requesting public comment on the U.S. Standards for Oats was published in the December 29,1983 Federal Register (48 FR 57304]. Within the 60-day comment period, one comment was received. The commenterstated that the two issues discussed in the notice, which included the grading and certification of high-moisture oats and updating the U.S. Sample grade definition, should be incorporated into the standards. A proposal to revise the standards for oats was published in the August 8, 1904 Federal Register (49 FR 31697). The proposal included the following: 1. Delete the special grade -Tough\" and the U.S. Sample grade requirement for high-moisture oats. 2. Expand the U.S. Sample grade definiton to include specific limits for broken glass, castor beans, unlnovn foreign substances, cocklebur, and animal filth. 3. Make miscellaneous changes including definitions of several terms. reference to FGIS handbooks, and format changes to update and enhance the clarity and uniformity amon- grain standards. Within the 60-day comment period. 5 comments were received. Three commenters agreed that the changes should be made, a fourth expressed concern that the deletion of moisture from the oats standards ultimately would cause oats to deteriorate in storage. Such a change would not be a cause for deterioration for several reasons including the fact that moisture content would continue to be shown on official certificates which shows official grade determinations. Additional reasons as to why such a situation would not develop are referenced below in the discussion of the deletion of the special grade \"Tough\" and the U.S. Sample grade requirements for high moisture oats. The fifth commenter felt that the changes in the moisture factor were not warranted, but that if the changes were made, requested assurance that the revision would not become effective for one year after promulgation. As discussed below, the effective date is over one year after promulgation. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act, no standards established or amendments or revocations of standards under the Act are to become effective less than one calendar year after promulgation, unless in the judgment of the Administrator the public health, interest, or safety require that they become effective sooner. To coincide with the beginning of the 1935 harvest, the amendments will become effective April 14,1985, A review of available informationindicates that the changes would increase the clarity and effectiveness of the standards and reflect current marketing practices. As a result of this review, FGIS is revising the U.S. Standards for Oats as follows: 1. Delete the special grade -Tough\" and the U.S. Sample grade requirement for high-moisture oats. Currently, \"Tough\" is defined as \"oats which contain more than 14.0 percent but not more than 16.0 percent of moisture\" (7 CFR 810.258(i)) and is therefore characteristic of moisture content. Also, U.S. Sample grade includes oats which contain more than 16.0 percent of moisture (7 CFR 810.256]. Moisture content and the terminology \"TougN' is not descriptive of grain quality. Moisture content is a condition of the grain rather than a quality factor. Pursuant to current trade practices, discounts for moisture generally are assessed onthe actual moisture content rather than numerical grade to account for weight loss and drying costs of the handler. High moisture grain is a normal condition during movement from harvest into market channels or storage. Moisture content by itself does not imply an intrinsic quality, but rather measures the amount of dry matter and water content of the grain. Moreover, moisture content can be specified through contracting which is a common practice, for example, with corn. Since specifying a maximum moisture content is a common practice, the sample grade limit and special grade generally do not serve a useful purpose. Also, the grain may be dried and graded accordingly. The moisture content will continue to be shown on all official certificates w.hich show the official grade determination as required under \u00a7 890.162(a)(3) of the regulations. The special grade 'Tough\" has been deleted from other grain standards. Moisture content is not a grade-determining factor in the U.S. Standards for Wheat, Barley, Oats, Triticale, and Rye. A final rule to delete moisture content as a great determining factor in the U.S. Standards for Corn. Sorghum, and Soybeans was published in the September 12 1934 Federal Register (49 FR 35743), vith an effective date of September 9,1935. Accordingly, this revision would add consistency among the various grain standards. 2. Amend the U.S. Sample grade definition (7 CFR 810.256] to include limits for broken glass, castor beans,. aFederal Register / Vol. 49, 49430 Federal Register I Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations unknown foreign substances, cocklebur, and animal filth. The limits of 2 or more pieces of glass, 2 or more castor beans, 4 or more particles of an unknown foreign substancels) or a commonly recognized harmful or toxic substance(s), 8 or more cocklebur seeds, or 10 or more pieces of rodent pellets, bird droppings, or other animal filth have been followed in the inspection process for many years as they have appeared in the FGIS Grain Inspection Handbook and do not constitute a changelm inspection procedures. The limits are included to make the oats standards conform to the format of other grain standards. 3. Enhance the clarity and uniformity between standards by making other miscellaneous changes. The current \u00a7 810.252 (a) Distinctly low quality is clarified to show how stones and debris too large to enter the sampling device are applied. The current (f) Othergrains is expanded to include safflower. The current (j) Test weight per bushel is slightly modified for clarity and uniformity with other gram standards. Section 810.253 is modified by dividing the section into 2 parts, (a) and (b),.to clarify the basis of determination, and to conform the section to the term as used in other grain standards as appropriate. The information which appears is - generally contained in the FGIS Handbooks. Section 810.254 is amended to delete unnecessary reference to field offices, official agencies, and interested parties, so as to conform the language in this section to identical sections in other grain standards. A proposal was made to include in the oats standards a definition for a new term, \"damaged kernels\". This definition is similar to the definition of \"sound oats\". However, because the terminology \"'sound oats\" is more commonly used when referring to oats, FGIS has decided that adding a new term \"damaged kernels\" to the standards would be confusing and therefore has deleted the damaged kernels definition for this final rule. The current \u00a7 810.252 (b), (e), and 0), \u00a7 810.255 (second paragraph), \u00a7 810.258 (h) and (i), and applicable footnotes 2, 3, and \u00a7 810.257 footnote 4 are updated to reference the Grain Inspection Handbook and Equipment Handbook and to delete obsolete references. Also, miscellaneous non-substantive format changes are made in \u00a7 810.255 and \u00a7 810.256 for clarity and to facilitate the use of the standards, certain of the format changes to \u00a7 810.256 are in addition to those format changes that were proposed and are made to conform oats to other grain standards.

The extension of this authority to claims in the amount of $25,000 or less is considered appropriate and necessary for almore efficient administration of the agency's .orMoad as the former limitation of $2500 excluded the settlement of many tort claims at the regional level. The limit of $25,000 is consistent with 28 U.S.C. 2672, which authorizes the settlement of tort claims by the head of each Federal agency or his designee provided that settlements in excess of S25,000 shall be effected only with prior written approval of the Attorney General or his designee.

BILU1G CODE- 1505-01-M DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration Part 39 [Docket 84-NM-112-AD; AmdL 39-4968] Airworthiness Directive: Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendmrent adds a new airworthiness directive (AD) which requires modification of Boeing Model 747 series airplanes equipped with autoland autopilots which use certain Landing Rollout Control Units (LRCU). This action is necessary because loss of battery power to these LRCU's can produce hazardous pitch and roll maneuvers during final approach that may result in damage to or loss of the airplane. DATE: Effective January 2, 1985. Comments must be received by January 22, 1985. ADDRESSES: The applicable service information may be obtained from: Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124. This information may also be examined at the FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 9010 East Marginal Way South, Seattle, Washington.

Mailing address: Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As a result of ground testing, there have been reports that certain models of the autopilot Landing Rollout Control Units (LRCU) used i Boeing Model 747 series airplanes exhibit anomalous behavior as a result of loss of battery power. This loss of battery power inadvertently activates the built-in test circuitry, which is normally used during maintenance activities. Loss of battery power also causes the LRCU to command the airplane to simultaneously pitch and roll. Since there is only asingle autopilot battery circuit in the airplane, the power loss affects all autopilot/flight director channels, resulting in multi-channel/multi-axis commands. This phenomenon can only occur at relatively low altitudes after autopilot/flight director capture of the glideslope or localizer. If this failure should occur just prior to touchdown, the crew may not have enough time to overpower and recover the airplanes in order to land safely. The airplanes affected are those with LRCU's, Boeing part numbers 60100013- 757 and 60300013-759. The Boeing Company has prepared Alert Service Bulletin 747-22A2152, dated November 16, 1984, to correct this problem. Modification of the aircraft wiring in accordance with this service bulletin will prevent the hazardous pitch and roll maneuver during final approach, a situation which could result in damage to or loss of the aircraft. Since a situation exists which requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable, and good cause exists for making this amendment effective Itn less than 30 days. Although this action is in the form of a final rule, which involves an emergency and, thus, was not preceded by notice and public procedure, interested persons are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire regarding this AD within 20 days after its publication.

Mailing address: FAA, Northwest Mountain Region. 17900 Pacific Highway South. C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend Part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive which requires replacement of the RAT rotary actuator electric motor on Boeing 767 airplanes was published in the Federal Register on September 11. 1984 (49 FR 35640). This action is necessary to minimize the likelihood of the RAT not deploying when needed. The comment period for the NPRM, which ended October 23, 1984, afforded interested persons an opportunity to participate in the making of this omendment. Due consideration has been given to all comments received, One Industry group, representing operators of Boetig 767 airplanes, requested that the compliance period for replacing the motor be extended from 90 days to 140 days to allow sufficient time to cycle themotors through the vendor for modification Noting the turn-around time currently being quoted by the motor vendor and the availability of spares, an increase of the compliance period to 140 days is necessary. The FAA has determined that safety will not be adversely affected by this increased compliance time and has changed the rale accordingly. Another commenter noted a number of items in the NPRM that require clarification. The Summary section stated: \"During testing it was found that moisture could accumulate in the motor and freeze,\" The testing referred to was laboratory testing only, and no cases have been documented in which the RAT failed to deploy due to extend- motor icing. The NPRM stated that the RAT did'not deploy. In the test setup, the RAT was replaced by extend-motor output torque measuring equipment. This distinction is noted. The commenter also staied that in the event both engines fail, hydraulic power in addition to that available from the RAT would be available from windmilling engines driving the engine-driven hydraulic pumps; the ram air turbine was presented by the manufacturer as the primary source of hydraulic power for the flight controls in the event of loss of power on both engines. It is recognized that for much of the flight envelope, the engines will windmill with sufficient speed to provide adequate hydraulic power for the flight controls. During certification, this technique was not presented for approval and, therefore, was not demonstrated. In any case, the RAT provides dedicated hydraulic power even at speeds below which windmilling power would be available. The commenter also correctly noted that the drain holes required to be added by the proposal were to be added to the brake plate itself, and were not to modify the motor case drainage system. Approximately 51 U.S. airplanes will be affected by this AD. It is estimated that 5 manhours per airplane will be required by this AD and that the average labor cost is $40 per manhour. Based on these figures, the total cost to U.S. operators is estimated at $10,200. For these reasons, this rule is not considered to be a major rule under the criteria of Executive Order 12291. Few, if any, small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act will be affected, After a careful review of all available data, including the above comments, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the proposed rule with a change in the conpliance period as previously noted.14Federal Register / Vol. 49, 4943 Feder I Rgte Vo.4,N.26/husyDcebr2,18/Rusan Re Ion List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Aviation safety, Aircraft.

SUMMARY: This document revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD) applicable to Boeing Model 757-200 and 767-200 aircraft which requires periodic checks of the Fuel Quantity Indicating System (FQIS). This amendment requires replacement of the FQIS processor unit and terminates the repetitive checks. Failure of the FQIS may result in fuel exhaustion.

Mailing address: Federal Aviation Administration, Northwest Mountain Region, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C- 68966, Seattle, Washington 98168. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend Part 39 (14 CFR Part 39) of the Federal Aviation Regulations to revise Amendment 39-4696, AD 83- 15-05, was published in the Federal Register on June 29,1984 (49 FR 26747). The amendment-requires replacement of the FQIS processor and terminates the requirement for repetitive checks. Interested persons have been afforded the opportunity to participate in the making of the amendment. No objections were received. It is estimated that 114 U.S. registered airplanes will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately one manhour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor cost will be $40 per manhour. The replacement components will be provided without cost. Based on these figures; the total cost impact of this ADto the U.S. operators is estimated to be $4560. For these reasons, the rule is not consideredto be a major rule under the criteria of Executive Order 12291. Few, If any, small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act will be affected. After careful review of the available data, including all of the comments received, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.

This action was taken to enhance the safety of aircraft conducting IFR flight. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. One comment was received. The Alaska Airmen's Association concurredwith the proposal. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Section 71.181 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in Handbook 7400.6 dated January 3. 1984. The Rule This amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes the base of controlled airspace at 700 feet above the surface over the Port Heiden, AK, Airport within a generally circular area of approximately 800 square miles. While this airspace designation would exclude aircraft from conducting flight under visual flight rules (VFR) when the visibility is less than 3 miles, it would enhance the safety of aircraft conducting flight under IFR. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a \"major rule\" under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a \"significant rule\" under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On September 12, 1984. the FAA proposed to amend Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) to establish the base of controlled airspace at 700 feet above the surface in a rectangular area 37 statute miles by 15.5 statute miles aver the Mekoryuk, AK, Airport (49 FR 35786). While this airspace designation would exclude aircraft from conducting flight under visual flight rules (VFR) when the visibility is less than 3 miles, it would enhance the safety of aircraft conducting flight under IFR, Protection of IFR traffic is required for instrument approach, departure, missed approach, and holding procedures established for a new nondirectional beacon with distance measuring equipment (NDB/ DME) recently installed at Mekoryuk, AK. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA, One comment was received. ThatFederal Register / Vol. 49, 49436 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations comment was submitted by the Alaska Airmen's Association which concurred with the proposal. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Section 71.181 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in Handbook 7400. dated January 3, 1984. The Rule This amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes the base of controlled airspace at 700 feet above the surface in a rectangular area 37 statute miles by 15.5 statute miles over the Mekoryuk, AK, Airport. The rule is effected to enhance safety of operations in the area by insuring that when flight visibility is less than 3 miles aircraft operations would be conducted under IFR only. This action is brought about by the installation of omnidirectional radio beacon with distance measuring equipment at Mekoryuk, AK, along with the development of two public instrument approach procedures. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to leep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a \"major rule\" under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a \"significant rule\" under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal.

The Rule This amendment to Part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the boundaries of Prohibited Area P-40 at Thurmont, MD, by increasing the radius from I nautical mile to a radius of 3 nautical miles. The designated altitudes of surface to but not including 5,000 feet mean sea level remain unchanged. This amendment to the prohibited area is required in order to provide the necessary safeguards for the protection of the aeronautical activities associated with security at this facility and for the safety of persons and property on the ground. Since there is a security requirement for expeditious adoption of this amendment, good cause exists for making this regulation effecti.e at the earliest possible date and without prior public notice. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore-(1) is not a \"major rule\" under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a \"significant rule\" under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3)does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimalFor the same reason, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitles under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This amendment to Part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 97) prescribes new, amended, suspended, or revoked Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SLAP is contained in official FAA form- documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR Part 51, and \u00a7 97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms 8260-3, 8260-4 and 8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated above. The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication in the Federal Register expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SLAPs, but refer to their graphic depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form document is unnecessary. The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedureidentification and the amendment number. This amendment to Part 97 is effective on the date of publication and contains separate SLAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. Some SLAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center [FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which created the need for some SLAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided. Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these SLAPs, the TERPs criteria were applied to the conditions existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and pubic procedure before adopting these SIAPs is unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making.some SLAPs effective in less than 30 days.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In response to a petition, the CAB adopts a rule requiring advertising of charter flights, charter tours, or components of charter tours to state the entire price that a passenger must pay for the flight, tour, or tour component. DATES: Adopted: November 28, 1984. Effective March 19, 1985. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Craig Weller, Rules and Legislation Division, Office of the General Counsel, Civil Aeronautics Board, 1825 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20428; 202 673-5442. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In SPDR-90/PSDR-82, 48 FR 50900, November 4,1983, the Board proposed to prohibit the advertising of charter flights and package tours using air transportation that prominently displayed a base price, plus an additional \"add-on\" percentage, usually displayed much less prominently. The proposal would have required all advertising for flights or package tours which mentioned price to state the total price for all items included as one amount, although prices of optional features could be mentioned separately. The Board's proposal was m response to a petition filed by Mr. Donald Pevsner. Mr. Pevsner claimed that many charter tour operators were advertising package tours in various cities by prominently featuring an attractive price, togethei with a much less prominent statement that an additional percentage would be added for \"taxesand service.\" For example, an advertisement might-feature a price of $399 in large, eye-catching type, together with a small asterisk. In much smaller type elsewhere in the advertisement would be a notice that this price was\"plus 15% taxes and service.\" Mr, Pevsner charged that this practice deceived potential purchasers of package tours and made informed comparisons among tours impossible. After Mr. Pevsner filed his petition, the Board's enforcement staff conducted an investigation. It found that the use of percentage \"add-on\" advertising was, In fact, prevalent in some vacation markets. The enforcement staff then sent an industry letter to all tour operators and airlines, warning that the use of percentage especially if the \"add- on\" advertising could be an unfair and deceptive practice, percentage amounit did not truly represent the amount of taxes and service charges actually included. After sending this industry letter, the dnforcement staff continued its investigation and discovered that virtually no tour operator could justify the amount of percentage \"add-on\" being used unless a substantial portion was allocated to operator overhead or profit. The Board then decided to begin this rulemaking proceeding by proposing to require that advertising for all flights and tours using air transportation be required to state the price of the package in one single amount, Commenters expressing unqualified support were the American Society of Travel Agents, the City of New York Department of Consumer Affairs, Eastern Air Lines, the publisher of Economy Traveler Newsletter, and two individuals. Transamerica Airlines, Carefree Vacations, Samson Tours, Aer Lingus, and Trans World Airlines all supported the proposal, but suggested some modifications. Those opposed were the National Indirect Air Carrier Association, Trans National Tours, Travelers International Tour Operators, and the law firm of Covington and Burling. This proceeding is not the first time the Board has faced the issue of percentage \"add-on\" advertising. In PSDR-39, 39 FR 15309, April 29, 1974, the Board proposed adoption of a policy statement concerning the advertising of group inclusive tours (GIT). This policy would have regarded advertising of GIT's which did not state the price in one single amount to be an unfair and deceptive practice, essentially the same proposal being considered in this proceeding. The Board's concern grew from the practice of GIT operators to49433 Federal Register / Vol, 49,No. 246 /, Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations 49439 feature advertisements with one price prominently displayed, together with an additional percentage amount for \"taxes and service.\" The Board noted that the amount of \"add-onf' was often unrelated to the actual cost of taxes and service charges included in the package. Such advertising, the Board concluded, could mislead the public about the total cost of a GIT. Subsequently, in PS-62, 40 FR 4905, February 3, 1975, the Board finally concluded that regulation of GIT advertising was necessary to protect the public from misleading ads. However. in response to comments, the Board decided that GIT operators should have the flexibility to list separately the prices of the air fare and ground components of a tour. Therefore, the Board adopted a policy statement declaring that GIT advertisements which do not state the total tour price are unfair and deceptive, but explained that this policy would not prohibit the separate listing of prices for air fare and ground accommodations. This policy remains in effect. 14 CFR 399.84. After considering the comments filed in this proceeding, the Board has decided that, instead of the proposed requirement for prices to be stated as a single amount, the existing policy which applies to GIT's should be extended to all passenger air transportation. ' Advertisements for flights, tours, or for components of tours such as hotel packages, may use a total price for the flight or tour, or separate prices for each tour component, as long as each price- represents the total cost that must be paid by the passenger to the tour operator for the flight, tour, or component. This means, for example, that in an advertisement for a tour that mentions air and ground arrangements any price featured must cover both components, including any related taxes or service charges to be paid to the tour operator. On the other hand, an advertisement may mention only hotel accommodations and include only the price of that component. The provisions of the GIT rule should be familiar to most of the industry since they have been in effect for nearly 10 years. During this period, the Board is not aware that the rule has caused problems for GIT operators or for consumers. Because the new rules will be the same for all types of air transportation, there will be no discrimination between charter tours and scheduled service tours, as several commenters feared. In addition, this approach will allow operators the flexibility to state separately the prices of the components of package tours if they .vish, although itwill not be required. Both Aer Lingus and TWA argued that this flexibility was important for operators of scheduled service tours for two reasons. First, tour brochures must be printed and distributed far in advance of a tour marketing campaign. However. aii fares in some markets may often change because of competitive pressures. Pie- printed brochures containing such fares would thus become obsolete. In addition, some fares can be combined with more than one ground package to form several different tour packages. Listing of each possible resulting price would be cumbersome and potentially confusing. The Board considered these same arguments in PS-62 and decided that GIT advertisements should be able to state the price of air transportation and ground arrangements separately. No problems seem to have resulted and so this option should be available to operators using both scheduled service and charters. Transamerica Airlines, Carefree Vacations, and 'MlA argued that advertisements should be able to exclude taxes from the total price, or state them separately. The Board also considered this question in PS-62 with regard to GIT pricing, deciding that because taxes were an essential part of the cost of a tour they should be included in the total tour price. This decision still seems reasonable and taxes will not be excluded from the coverage of the rule. Trans National Tours stated that the Board should not prohibit the separate statement of prices for optional tour featuris. That was not the Board's intent. The final rule makes it clear any tour component, optional or required, may be separately priced as long as the price advertised is the total price for the advertised component. The National Indirect Air Carrier Association argued that the Board should not regulate in this area for a number of reasons. First, NIACA asserted that the proposed regulation would be an unconstitutional infringement on commercial speech which is not misleading. The Board does not agree. It decided almost 10 years ago that percentage \"add-on\" advertising for GIT's was misleading. It would be illogical to hold such advertising to be misleading to GIT customers, but not misleading to all other tour purchasers. Thus, the extension of the Board's GIT advertising policy to all forms of passenger air transportation is constitutionally permissibie. NIACA also asserted that the proposal would inhibit the dissemination of valuable informationabout the components of a tour. The Board cannot accept this argument for two reasons. First, the Board has already found \"add-on\" advertising to be deceptive, and it is hard to understand how valuable information is disseminated by such misleading means. Also, the Board's enforcement staff has determined that the amount of the percentage \"add-on\" used by almost all tour operators has no relationship to the actual cost of tour components. Because the information conveyed by \"add-of\" pricing is inaccurate, it would seem to have little, if any, value. NIACA states that the use of percentage \"add-on\" advertising, using an amount of 155, has become an industry standard, and that prohibition of this practice will result in higher charter costs by raising the base amount on which agent's commissions are determined. The investigation by the Board's staff, and comments in this proceeding, however, indicate that the use of \"add-onf' advertising is far from being standard in the industry. It appears to be a practice used by some operators in selected markets. There also seems to be no reason why the cost of tours should necessarily rise because of this action. Since the majority of tour operators do not use \"add-on\" advertising, the costs of most operators should remain unaffected. Those who are affected can always adjust the rate of commission paid to agents to comp.nsate for the inclusion of \"taxes and service\" in their base prices. NIACA also says that the proposed rule fails to state reasonable standards for compliance. The Board does not agree. The revised rule is not vague. In addition, a nearly identical policy has been in effect for GIT advertising for nearly 10 years without significant compliance problems. Thus, it should present no difficulties for operators selling other types of tours. NIACA states that advertising problems are best handled on a case-by-case basis, but the Board believes that such an approach would lead to just the sort of confusion NIACA fears. The standards in the final rule the Board is adopting are clear and should provide both guidance and flexibility for tour operators. NIACA asserts that the proposed relation will only be the beginning of advertising regulation by the Board as operators develop new advertising methods. NIACA submitted additional comments in this proceeding which purport to show a new advertising abuse by some scheduled carriers. These advertisements feature an inclusive price to be paid to the operator, plus a less prominent.......... --r IFederal Register / Vol. 49, 49440 Federal Register I Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations disclosure that additional amounts for \"taxes and service\" must be paid directly to the hotel. The Board does not believe that its action in prohibiting\"add-ons\" that must be paid to the tour operator will necessarily lead to other advertising abuses. In any case, fear of other, potential abuses should not persuade the Board to allow an actual abuse to continue. While the practice NIACA complains about is potentially troublesome, it is outside the scope of this proceeding. NIACA is free to file a petition for additional rulemaking, or a complaint of unfair or deceptive practices, if it chooses. The American Leadership Study Group (ALSG), which operates educational tours for students, said that it charges a $25 application fee for all prospective student passengers. This fee is applicable to more than one tour and is in addition to the price of any particular ALSG tour. ALSG does not think this fee should be included in the total tour price. The Board does not agree. This application fee apparently covers part of ALSG's administrative costs connected with the tours it sells. It clearly is a part of the cost of a tour for its customers. Thus it seems no different than other \"service charges\" which will have to be included in tour prices and it should not be treated differently. Effective Date The Board recognizes that the industry will need time to comply with the rule. Many.tour brochures and other promotional material must be prepared well in advance of a marketing campaign. Once these materials are distributed to various sales outlets, it is unreasonably costly to recall or modify them. Therefore, these rules will not become effective until 90 days after publication in the Federal Register. Any printed material that is actually distributed before that time need not comply with this rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Board certifies that none of these proposed changes will, if adopted, have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. As already discussed, the majority of tour operators do not use percentage \"add-on\" advertising. In addition, because all-tour operators will be covered, there should be no competitive impact on any one operator or group of operators.

SUPPLErMENTARY ItFORMATIOn: The Board's statements of general policy are in 14 CFR Part 399. Section 399.13 contain two of the many standard conditions which are attached to foreign air carrier permits authorizing foreign air transportation to and from the United States. In PSDR-80, 48 FR 35119. August 8,1983, the Board proposed elimination of that policy statement. The two conditions contained in the policy statement are that: (a] any permit is subject to agreements and treaties between the United States and the carrier's home country, and (b) the carrier must waive any claim of sovereign immunity in actions against it brought in U.S. courts. Since the adoption of this policy statement, these conditions have routinely been placed in all foreign air carrier permits. Therefore, the Board tentatively concluded that the policy statement was duplicative and unnecessary. No comments were received in response to PSDR-80, and the Board has decided that this policy statement should be eliminated. Copies of foreign air carrier permits, containing these conditions, are readily available to the public and to government officials. Applicants that want to learn of standard conditions on permits can easily obtain that information from the Board staff. Because there are many more standard conditions placed in permits than the two in the policy statement, the continued listing of only these two may actually lead to confusion. All standard conditions will continue to be placed in all foreign air carrier permits. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Board certifies that this action will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. The standard conditions will continue to be placed in all foreign air carrier permits; this action onlyremoves a duplicate statement of those conditions.

Washington, D.C. 20349. SUPPLErr.25NARY INFoRneAMTO.:The Commission is adopting rule 3s-5 [17 under that Act. Rule 3a-5 pravides an exemption from the definition of investment company for companies organized primarily to finance the business operations of thefr parents or companies their parents control. The rule also provides an e.emptlon from the defimition of \"investment securities\" of the Act [15 U.S.C. E83a-[a](3ll for securities of the finance subsidiary that are hald by its parent company or by a company which the parent controls. Backhgound A subsidiary of a non-invetmnt company which has been formed primarily to finance its parent's business operations comes within the de finition of investment company in section 3fa} of the Act [15 U.S.C. 69a-3(a)] I if the finance subsidiary invests in, reinvests in, owns, hold3 or trades in securities of its parent or its parent's other subsidiaries. In a typical financing. the finance subsidiary receives the sacurities as consideration for remitting to the parent or to the parent's other subsidiaries cash or cash equivalents which the finance subsidiary has raisad by issuing non-voting preferred stc k or debt securities or by other forms of borrowing. The parent or another subsidiary of the parent usually owns substantially all of the finance subsidiary's voting securities. Since the finance subsidiary's securities that are held by its parent or another subsidiary of its parent would be considered investment securities, the parent (or other subsidiary) would also be considered an invsatment company if the value of all investment secrities owned by it exceeds 40 percent of its total as:ats on an tra in.- in or (3j In or toaiA 49442 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 245 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations In 1908, the Commission adopted rule 6c-1 to exempt from all provisions of the Act U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. issuers organized primarily to finance the foreign business operations of their parents by issuing debt securities abroad. The rule was adopted in response to a January 1, 1968 Executive Order that placed mandatory restrictions on investment of U.S. capital abroad and was designed to ensure that the balance-of payments position of the United States would not be adversely affected.3 To that end, the rule made exemptive relief available only for so long as the securities of the finance subsidiary purchased by U.S. nationals or residents were subject to the Interest Equalization Tax or a comparable deterrent.4 When the Interest Equilization Tax expired in 1974 and a comparable deterrent was not adopted, rule 6c-1 required finance subsidiaries to obtain exemptive orders before issuing any securities (except to their parents or to other subsidiaries of their parents). The Commission had subsequently granted a number of orders exempting from all provisions of the Act the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign private issuers, as well as U.S. issuers, which have been formed primarily to finance the business operations of their parents and their parent's other subsidiaries in the United States, as well as abroad, by raising capital in U.S. as well as foreign securities markets. In order to provide for uniform exemptive treatment under the Act, the Commission requested public comment on a proposed revision of rule 6c-1.5 The proposal would define a finance subsidiary to be any corporation.(i) All of whose securities other than debt securities, non-voting preferred stock or director's qualifying shares are owned either by a foreign private issuer (in which case the finance subsidiary must be organized under the laws of the United States or a state) or by a U.S. issuer; and (ii) whose primary purpose is to finance the business operations of its parent company through borrowings or other sale of the finance subsidiary's securities. Under the proposed rule, the parent would be required to guarantee unconditionally payment of principal, dividends, premiums, liquidation Government securities, (B) securities issued by employees' securities companies, and [C) securities Issued by majority-owned subsidianes of the owner which are not investment companies.\" [Em phasts added.]5See Investment Company Act Release 5330 (dated March 25, 1908) [33 FR 5295]. 4 Id. 0 See Investment Company Act Release No. 12679 (September 22, 1982) [47 FR 425781.preference, and sinking fund obligations on the finance subsidiary's debt securities and non-voting preferred stock issued to or held by the public. The proposed rule provided that in the event of default, legal proceedings could be instituted directly against the parent to enforce the guarantee; any convertible or exchangeable securities of the finance subsidiary could be convertible or exchangeable only for securities of the parent company; and the finance subsidiary could not deal or trade in securities or hold securities other than securities resulting from its primary purpose. The proposed rule also provided that for purposes of the rule, securities of a finance subsidiary held by its parent or another subsidiary of its parent would not be considered investment securities.6 In response to the proposed rule revision, thirteen comment letters were received. In general, the commentators strongly supported the proposed revision, but requested certain substantive changes with respect to the nature of the parent, the finance subsidiary and the securities issued by the finance subsidiary. As discussed in more detail below, the Commission is adopting the revisions to rule 6c-1 (to be renumbered rule 3a-5) substantially as proposed but with some changes which reflect commentator suggestions and the Commission's reconsideration of certain issues. Discussion As stated in the proposing release, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to exempt a finance subsidiary from all provisions of the Act where neither its structure nor its mode of operation resembles that of an investment company. We have found this to be the case where the primary purpose of the subsidiary is to finance the business operations of its parent or other subsidiaries of its parent which are not investment compames. We have also found this to be the case where any purchaser of the finance subsidiary's debt instruments ultimately looks to the parent for repayment and not to the finance subsidiary.'The rule, therefore, describes a situation where the finance subsidiary is essentially a conduit for the parent to raise capital for its own business operations or for the business operations of its other subsidiaries. As explained in more detail below, to the extent that the commentators have suggested changes in the proposal that are consistent with the conduit theory and that would give a finance subsidiary 6d.the flexibility needed to raise capital, the proposal has been redrafted to reflect those commerits. Other comments have not been adopted. Technical word changes to clarify the rule's meaning also have been made, I. Nature of the Exemption The final rule is renumbered rule 3a-5 and provides an exemption from the definition of investment company found in section 3(a) of the Act I for a finance subsidiary that meets the conditions set forth in the rule. The revision of rule c- I that was proposed would have provided an exemption for finance subsidiaries from all provisions of the Act. The Commission is adopting the final rule under section 3(a) because it is under that section that a finance subsidiary meets the literal definition of investment company. Historically, with the exception of rule 6c-1, rules that have provided exemptive relief to companies that do not appear to be the type of entities that the Act was designed to regulate have been keyed to section 3(a), not section 6(c). II. Nature of the Parent A. How parent's non-investment company status Jmay be determined. The final rule provides an exemption from the definition of investment company for a finance subsidiary whose voting securities are virtually all owned by its parent or a company controlled by its parent if neither the parent nor the controlled company is considered an investment company section 3(a) or if the parent or the controlled company is excepted or exempted by order from the definition of investment company under section 3(b) 9 or by the rules or 7See supra exemptions for certain primafacie and transjent Investment companies, as well as rule 3a-3 that provides an exemption for certain subsidiaries of companies that are not Investment companies. 9Section 3(b)(1] (15 U.S.C. 80a-3tbl[1) excepts from the definition of investment company any issuer primarily engaged directly or through a wholly-owned subsidary or subsidiaries In a business or businesses other than that of Investing, reinvesting, owning. holding or trading In securities, Section 3[b)(2) [15 U.S.C. 80a-3(bJ(21 permits an issuer to apply to the Commission for an order finding that it is primarily engaged In a business or businesses other than that of Investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities either directly or through majority-owned subsidiaries or through controlled companies. Section 3(b](3) 115 U.S.C. 80a-3(b)(3)j excepts from the definition of investment company an issuer all the outstanding securities of which [other than short-term paper and directors' qualifying shares) are directly owned by a company excepted from that definition under sections 3(b)(1) or 3(b)(2).49442 Federal Register / Vol. 49,No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 240 / Thursday, DectnIber 20, 134 I Rures and Regulations 4943 regulations under section 3(a). As proposed, the exemption would have extended only to finance subsidiaries whose voting securities are owned by a parent or another subsidiary of the parent l0-if neither the parent nor the other subsidiary is considered an investment company under section 3(a) of the Act. Two commentators suggested extending the proposed exemption to finance subsidiaries of companies that are excepted from the definition of investment company by sections 3(b) or 3(c),\" by rules or regulations adopted thereunder or that are exempted from all provisions of the Act by exemptive order pursuant to section 6(C).12 The Commission intended to provide in the proposal that the parent be able to derive its non-investment company status from the rules or regulations under section 3(a) as well as from the section itself,3 and the proposal has been reworded to make that clear. The Commission also agrees that the parent should be able to derive its non- investment company status from section 3(b) because that section excepts or exempts upon application companies that are not primarily engaged, directly or indirectly, in investment company activities.14 However, a parent that is excepted from the definition of investment company under section 3(c) could be engaged or could intend to engage primarily in investment company activities. For example, an issuer is excepted under section 3(c)(1)-not because of the nature of its activities- but because its outstanding securities (other than short-term paper) are beneficially owned by not more than one hundred persons and it is not making and does not presently propose to make a public offering of its securities. While it may be appropriate to make exemptive relief available to the finance subsidiary of an issuer \"See discussion infra re change m the final rule to reqmre that where the finance subsidiary s voting securities are owned by another subsidiary of the parent, that subsidiary must be controlled by the parent \"Section 3[c) [15 U.S.C. &,a-3[c)] excepts specific classes of entities definition of investment company. '\"Section 6(c) 115 U.S.C. &9a--1c)] gives the Commission authority, by rules or regulations upon its own motion or by order upon application, to \"conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions. from anyprovsmons of [the Act] or of any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of [the Act].\" 13see supra note 8. \"See supra note section 3(c). the Commission believes that, at leat fur the time being, such em,,mpti.e relief should be granted only on a caSe-by- case basis so that it can hat e the opportunity to evaluate all of the relevant factors. Similarly the Commission is not convinced that because a parent, at some time in the past, has been granted exempfi% e relief from all provisions of the Art u ider section 61c), a financing subsId~ary later formed by the parent should al-o be automatically relieved from comnplying with the Act. Since the conditions under which such exemptive orders h-ve been granted under section 6(c) differ dramatically and involve my'Iad fact patterns, the question of whether an exempted issuer's finance sultjidiary should also be exempted should be decided only on the basi3 of an application. B. Description of eligibLe fr -,n parents. The final rule provides that a parent company or a compeny controlled by the parent company must be, in the case of foreign issucrs, a foreign private issuer. The rule defines, a foreign private issuer to mean any issuer which is incorporated or organizcd under the laws of a foreign country, but not a foreign government or a political subdivision of a foreign government. The proposed rule would haLe defined an eligible foreign parent simply as a foreign private issuer without dcfininj the term. In the proposing release, the Commission requested specific comment on whether eligible foreign pri% ate issuers should be limited to \"world class issuers\", le., those that meet the registrant requirements specified in form F-3 [17 CFR 239.ZC0].ia A majority of the commentator3 opposed limiting eligible foreign parlnts to world class issuers, arguing that it would be unfair for the rule to distinguish between foreign issueri and U.S. issuers where no apparent purpose under the Act would be sar ed, Those commentators observed that the credit and size of the parent is irrele% ant to the issue of whether the parent's finance subsidiary should be roulated under the Act. One commentator also as!ed that the exemption be made available to the finance subsidiaries of foreign governments and political subdivisions. In the event that the Comw mi s i n did not agree to include the finance futtsidiaries of foreign governments, that commentator suggested that the rule iS Form F-3 rcquirc-, tzfraU, T-,it t non.-converlible i% ntrrrt Urn0!o d Lt n' zs;hould at a minimum define the term foreign private issuer by reference to rule 3L-4(e) (17 CFR 240.3hb-4(cJJ under the Securities Exchange [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.] (\"Exchanga Act\"]. The final rule does not limit eligible foreign parents to world class issueS, because the Commission agrees that the size or cr2dit of the parent does not indica e whether the primary purpose of its finance subsidiary is to raisa cash for the parent or the parent's other subsidiaries. However, the final rule does limit eligible foreign issuers to private issuers because government issucrs are more likely to be insulated from liability. As suggested, however, the final vale dos3 explicitly deine foreign private issuer.'6 C. ihether finance subsidaies of multole parents should be exepted. The final rule defines an eligible parent company to include a partnership or joint venture as well as a corporation under certain conditions. The revied rule a3 proposed would not have extended e'.emptive relief to the finance subsidiaries of such multiple parents but invited specific comment on the issue. A majority of the commentators urged the Commission to permit the finance subsidiaries of multiple parents to rely on the final rule, arguing that as long as the finance subsidiary is formed primarily to finance the business operations of the multiple parents, the subsidiary can still be viewed as a conduit for its parents. The commentators noted that a finance subsidiary is frequently formed by multiple parents to finance a largescale project because single sponsors are unable to devote the necessary capital or credit to the project or are unable to use all of the net output of the protest. The final rule does extend exemptive relief to the finance subsidiaries of multiple parents, but only if the parents are joined formally as a partnership or joint venture and the partners or participants in the joint venture, as well as the partnership or joint venture itself, would not be considered investment companies under section 3(a) or would be excepted or exempted by order from the definition of investment company by section 3[b) or by the rules or regulations under section 3(a).

Nature of Subsidiary A. Whether exemptive relief should be extended to foreign subsidiaries of foreign private issuers.-The final rule makes exemptive relief available to fpreign finance subsidiaries of foreign private issuers although the proposed rule would have excluded such subsidiaries from the scope of the rule. Several commentators requested that this change be made, observing that certain foreign private issuers have 'considered raising capital in U.S. securities markets by organizing foreign, as well as U.S., finance subsidiaries. According to those commentators, although typically a foreign private issuer chooses to organize a finance subsidiary in the United States because of state legal investment law,8 there mdy be tax reasons for a foreign private issuer to organize the finance subsidiary in its own country instead of in the United States. The Commission has decided to extend exemptive relief to foreign subsidiaries of foreign private issuers in the final rule because as long as the other conditions of the rule are complied with, that subsidiary should be functioning primarily as a conduit for its parent and investors should view its debt as essentially the debt of its parent. B. The primary purpose test-I. The - extent to which other purposes should be permitted. The final rule retains the requirement contained in the proposed revision that a finance subsidiary may rely on the rule only if its primary purpose is to finance the business operations of its parent.19 Several of the commentators questioned the need for such a primary purpose test, arguing that subsidiaries that are used to finance the business operations of their parents are 1 See discussion mnfra re the Commssion's decision to retain an unconditional guarantee requirement in the final rule. \"See discussion in proposing release supra note 5, concerning state legal investment laws which limit the extent to which certain U.S. institutional investors can acquire the debt securities of foreign issuers. 19 See discussion mnfra re extension of the exemption to a subsidiary whose primary purpose is to finance the business operations of companies controlled by its parent.also often used to provide other services to the parent and its affiliates. The Commission has decided to retain the primary purpose test in the final - rule; to do otherwise would be inconsistent with the rule's underlying rationale. If a subsidiary were to be engaged primarily in non-financing activities, it could not be considered a conduit for the parent to raise capital. In addition, the Commission notes that the primary purpose test by no means prevents a finance subsidiary from engaging in non-financing activities so long as its primary purpose is to engage in financing activities. 2. Whether the subsidiary's primary purpose may be to finance the business, operations of the parent's other subsidiaries. The final rule provides that the primary purpose of a subsidiary may be to finance the business operations of companies controlled by the parent, as well as the business operations of the parent itself. This is in contrast to the proposal which required that the primary purpose of the subsidiary must be to finance the business operations solely of its parent. Several commentators questioned the primary purpose test as phrased in the proposed rule revision because the test was contradicted by a statement in the release which referred to subsidiaries exempted under the rule financing the operations of the parent \"or one of the parent's subsidiaries.\" Two commentators requested that, as is the case in existing rule 6c-1, the exemption extend to finance subsidiaries that loan cash or cash equivalents to compames in which the parent company owns at least a ten percent equity interest. One commentator observed that financing the operations of an affiliate of the parent is equivalent to financing the operations of the'parent since the capital raised goes to the corporate group and the investors are protected by the parent's guarantee. The Comnussion agrees that financing the business operations of a controlled company can be considered the equivalent of financing the business operations of the parent so long as the company controlled by the parent company is not considered an investment company and investors look to the parent company and not the controlled company for repayment of the finance subsidiary's debt. Under the final rule, the primary purpose test is limited, however, to companies in which the parent owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities.20 If the 2 In the case of a partnership or joint venture, the rule requires the parent company to have the power to exercise a controlling influence over theprimary purpose test permitted the finance subsidiary to finance the business operations of entities in which the parent's interest is less significant, the Commission does not believe that the finance subsidiary could be perceived as a conduit for the parent company. C. Whether the rule should address the amount of cash or cash equivalents which the finance subsidiary must remit to its parent or companies controlled by its parent and when that amount should be remitted. A new provision has been added to the final rule which conditions exemptive relief upon the finance subsidiary remitting at least 05% of any cash or cash equivalents which It raises to the parent company or a company controlled by the parent company as soon as practicable, but in no event later than six months after the subsidiary receives such cash or cash equivalents. The Commission believes that if the final rule does not expressly state how much of the money raised by the finance subsidiary must be remitted to its parent or a company controlled by its parent and how long that money may be held by the finance subsidiary, the finance subsidiary could function as a de facto investment company for an indefinite period. D. The extent to which the finance subsidiary should be permitted to invest in, reinvest in, own, hold or trade in securities other than the securities of its parent or a company controlled by its parent. The final rule also provides that the finance subsidiary may not invest In, reinvest in, own, hold or trade in securities other than Government securities, securities of its parent company or a company controlled by Its parent company (or in the case of a partnership or joint venture, securities of the partners or participants in the joint venture) and debt securities (including repurchase agreements) which would be exempted from the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.] by section 3(a)(3) of [15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(3)].2 This represents a significant rewording of the provision in the proposed rule which would have conditioned exemptive relief upon the finance subsidiary not dealing or trading in management or policies of the partnership or joint venture, See definition of control in section 2(a)(9) of the Act [15 U.S.C. Boa-2(a](9fl. \"1 Section 3(a)(3) provides an exemption for \"any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker's acceptance which arises out of a current transaction or the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for current transactions, and which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited-,...\" Federal Register I Vol. 49, No. 246 I Thursday, December 20, 1914 I Rules and Regulations 49445 securities or holding securities other than securities resulting from its primary purpose. Several commentators believed that the proposed revision was too restrictive and would inhibit responsible cash management. They observed that under the rule revision as proposed, a finance subsidiary would not be permitted to make temporary investments of idle cash before loaning that cash to its parent or companies controlled by its parent. The reworded provision in the final rule is intended to make clear that a finance subsidiary may temporarily own or hold, invest, reinvest or trade in, short-term money market investments. This should give the subsidiary the flexibility of offering its debt securities under-auspicious market conditions and managing the cash received from the offering until its parent or a company controlled by its parent is in a position to receive the offering proceeds. At the same time, as discussed above, such money market investments can only be temporary, because the finance subsidiary has no more than six months to remit 85% of any cash or cash equivalents which it raises to the parent company or companies the parent controls. One commentator was concerned that the rule revision as proposed could be interpreted to prohibit the transfer of equity stock or debt securities from a parent company's foreign operating subsidiaries to its finance subsidiary resulting in the loss of an income tax exemption for foreign investors on the interest income from bonds, notes or other interest-bearing obligations issued by the finance subsidiary. As reworded, the final rule makes clear that a finance subsidiary may own, hold, trade, invest, or reinvest in the securities of its parent company or a company controlled by its parent company. The securities of foreign operating subsidiaries are included to the extent that such subsidiaries meet the definition of a\"company controlled by the parent company.\" IV. Nature of the Securities of the Finance Subsidiary A. Whether the securities of the finance subsidiary should fe unconditionally guaranteed by the parent company. The final rule retains the -proposed rule's requirement that debt securities of the finance subsidiary issued to or held by the public must be unconditionally guaranteed by the parent company as to payment of principal, interest and premium, if any, and that non-voting preferred stock of the finance subsidiary issued to or heldby the public must be unconditionally guaranteed by the parent with respect to payment of dividends, liquidation preference in the event of liquidation and payments lo be made under a sinldng fund, if a sinking fund is to be provided.-- In response to the Commission's request for specific comment on the unconditional guarantee requirement, a few commentators advocated its elimination and several urged that the final rule provide for functional equivalents of a guarantee. Those commentators who favored elimination of the requirement stated that the requirement is unnecessary, given the rule's primary purpose test. Those commentators also believed that the level of credit support for a finance subsidiary's debt is essentially a business judgment. Several commentators stated that the Commission should accept alternatives to an unconditional guarantee, noting that these alternatives could still provide the investor with recourse to the parent company or to another credit- worthy entity. Among the alternatives cited were: (i) Income maintenance agreements by which the parent agrees with the subsidiary or with the holders of the subsidiary's securities to make sufficient contributions to the subsidiary's capital to service the subsidiary's debt; (ii) direct or indirect support of the subsidiary's debt securities by an irrevocable credit support agreement with a financial institution; or (iii) \"throughput and deficiency\" agreements by which the parent (usually a partnership or joint venture) undertakes to provide a joint business enterprise with a sufficient volume of business to service the subsidiary's debt ond to advance payments to the subsidiary to cover any deficiencies. After consideration of these alternatives, the Commission still believes that exemptive relief should be made available only where the parent unconditionally guarantees the finance subsidiary's debt and the holders of those debt instruments have direct recourse to the parent to enforce repayment. 2- As stated above, it The final rale centaunu a tczimzrnl .T--5 2 may bc c- hrdatcd m r,_Nt of payment to other df.bt of the par-ut c -.mpary. 23 As dczcribcd above, in thc cace of a parent company which is a rnc-sbip vcnturo, the joint venture to enforce rcpa \u00b0ncnt.appears appropriate to exempt a finance subsidiary from the definition of investment company only where the primary purpose of the subsidiary is to serve as a conduit for its parent and where the subsidiary's debt can be viewed essentially as the debt of its parent. Even if the primary purpose of the finance subsidiary is to finance the business operations of its parent and Lompanies which its parent controls, that does not necessarily mean that purchasers of the subsidiary's debt securities would look to the parent company for repayment. While some applications for exemptive relief invohing income maintenance, credit support and throughput and deficiency agreements have been granted, the Commission believes that the use of such agreements should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. B. Whether the finance subsidiary's Lonvertible or exchangeable securitias should be convertible or exchangeable only for securities of the parent company The final rule allows the finance subsidiary to issue securities which are convertible or exchangeable for othei debt securities or non-voting preferred stock that it may issue or for securities of its parent.25 Under the proposed rule, the securities could only be converted or exchanged for securities of the parent. Several commentators questioned the need for this provision. One commentator states that the rule should not restrict conversion or exchange privileges at all, even conversion or exchange privileges at all, even conversion or exchange for securities issued by an investment company. These commentators believed that at a minimum, the provision should not restrict conversion or exchange for other debt securities or non-voting preferred stock that the finance subsidiary may issue. The Commission believes that some restriction on convercion and exchange privileges is necessary for the debt of the finance subsidiary to be considered the equivalent of the debt of its parent. However, the final rule does permit conversion or exchange for other debt securities or non-voting preferred stool: of the subsidiary if those securities are backed by the parent's unconditional guarantee and give the security holder the right to proceed directly against the parent in the event of nonpayment. 25 Tae e C-e parent company is a p.-nszhp or ,ant ,.et ru pzovid23 that thie or vcnture as v=al as for ceeitie c: :d by the pareanLNo. 246 / Thursday, December 20, M9A / Rules and Regalations 49-145 Federal Register / Vol. 49, .49446 Federal Register / VoL 49, No. 246 1 Thursday. December 20, 1084 I Rules and Reguktlons Conclusion The Commission is adopting rule 3a-5 substantially as proposed to except the finance subsidiaries of U.S. and foreign private'issuers from the definition of investment company under certain conditions. The final rule differs from the proposal in the following respects: ji) The rule excepts the finance subsidiary from the definition of investment company under section 3(a) instead of exempting the subsidiary from all provisions of the Act under section 6(c); (iH) the rule permits a parent (or a company controlled by the parent) to derive its non-investment company status from section 3[b) and from the rules or regulations under section 3(a) as well as from section 3(a); (iii) the rule defines parent company to include a partnership or joint venture as well as a corporation as long as certain conditions are met; (iv) the rule extends exemptive relief to foreign as well as U.S. finance subsidiaries of foreign private issuers; (v) the rule extends exemptive relief where the primary purpose of the subsidiary is to finance the business operations ofcompanies controlled by the parent company as well as where the subsidiary's primary purpose is to finance the business operations of the parent and (vi) the rule permits the securities of the finance subsidiary to be convertible or exchangeable for other debt securities or non-voting preferred stock of the finance subsidiary as well as for securities of the parent company.

SUMMARY: Pursuant to the authority delegated by 18 CFR 357.307(1), the Director of the Office of Pipeline and Producer Regulation revises and publishes the maximum lawful prices prescribed under Title I of the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA) for the month of January 1985. Section 101(b)(6) of the NGPA requires that the Commission compute and publish the maximum lawful prices before the beginning of each month for which the figures apply. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1985. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kenneth A. Williams, Director, OPPR, (202) 357-8500.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 101(b)(6) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) requires that the Commission compute and make available maximum lawful prices and inflation adjustments prescribed in Title I ot the NGPA before the beginning of any month of which such figures apply. Pursuant to this requirement and \u00a7 375. 307(1) of the Commission's regulations, which delegates the publication of such prices and inflation adjustments to the Director of the Office of Pipeline and Producer Regulation, the maximum lawful prices are issued by the quarterly publication of price tables. When the maximum lawful prices were published on October 24, 1984, it was decided that January 1985 prices would not be issued until the Commission issued an order concerning deregulation and price changes to take effect on January 1, 1985. On November 16, 1984, the Commission issued Order No. 406 in Docket No. RM84-14-000 which, among other things, revised Table I of \u00a7 271.101(a) to provide for the inclusion of new maximum lawful prices under sections 103(b)(2) and 105(b)(3) of the NGPA. In order No. 406 the Commission also decided that the tight formation and production enhancement ceiling prices should be based on 200 percent of the \"old\" section 103 price (section 103(b)(1) of the NGPA).To implement the price changes of Order No. 406, the Director of OPPR is now issuing the maximum lawful prices for the month of January 1985 by publishing the tables for the applicable quarter (November and December 1984 and January 1985). Pricing tables are found in \u00a7 271.101(a) of the Commission's regulations. Table I of \u00a7 271.101(a) specifies the maximum lawful prices for gas subject to NGPA sections 102, 103(b)(1)(2), 105(b)(3), 106(b)(1)(B), 107(c)(5), 108 and 109. Table 1I of \u00a7 271.101(a) specifies the maximum lawful prices for sections 104 and 106(a) of the NGPA. Table III of \u00a7 271.102(c) contains the inflation adjustment factors. The maximum lawful prices and the inflation adjustment factors for the periods prior to August 1984 are found in the tables in \u00a7 \u00a7 271.101 and 271.102.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In a notice published in the Federal Register of October 1, 1982 (47 FR 43428), FDA announced that a petition IFAP 2B3645) had been filed by De Danske Sukkerfabfikker through its U.S. Representative, General Dairy Equipment Co. fnow Pasilac Inc.), 680 Taft SL NE., Minneapolis, MN 55413, proposing that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe -use of copolymer of m- phenylenediamine and benzene-1,3,5- tricarboxylic acid chloride as a component of an ultrafiltration membrane intended for use in food- processing applications. Also in a notice published in the Federal Register of August 19, 983 148 FR 37713), FDA announced that a petition (FAP 3B3739) had been filed by Paterson Candy International, Ltd., Laverstake Mill, Wbitchurch. Hampshire, England, proposing that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of 1,3,5- benzenetricarbonyl chloride polymer with 1,3-benzenediamine as the food- contact surface of a semipermeable membrane to be used in the concentration of liquid foods. The tvo notices refer to the same polymer described by a different nomenclature. Both petitions are for the use of this polymer as a reverse osmosis membrane. FDA has evaluated data in the petitions and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed food additive use is safe and that the regulations should be amended as set forth below. In accordance with \u00a7 17-lh) (21 CFR 171.1fh)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (address above) by appointment with the informatioi contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CM 171.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection.The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant Impact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not required.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The increasing availability of videotaped movies and taped sound recordings has created a demand among military personnel for facilities on DoD installations for the reproduction of these recordings for personal use. Although there is some uncertainty regarding the application of U.S.copyright laws to such activities, it is considered appropriate for general policy guidelines to be established. This rule sets out policies concerning the use of government equipment and facilities for the duplication of sound and video recordings for personal use. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 31, 1984. AODRESS: The General Counsel, Department of Defense, The Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20301-1600. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. David W. Ream, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Defense, (202- 695-3272). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This Directive was published in the Federal Register dated March 20,1984 [49 FR 10275 as a proposed rule]. Comments were received from individuals and organizations within the Department of Defense as well as from members of the public. After reviewing the-comments, the Department prepared a final rule incorporating many of the proposed' changes suggested by commenters. The comments and the Department's treatments of them are discussed below. Background Technological advances in the past few years in the transcription and broadcasting of entertainment media have had their effect in the Department of Defense (DoD). In particular, the increasing availability of videotaped movies and taped sound recordings has created a demand from military personnel for facilities on DoD installations for'the viewing of these products and for the reproduction of recordings for personal use. On numerous occasions during the past several years DoD officials have been contacted by representatives of persons who own copyrights in a variety of film, sound tape, phonograph record, and videotape products. They assert that DoD is promoting the misuse of their materials in violation of copyright laws. Their principal concerns fall into two areas: First, they claim that DoD fosters the illegal duplication of sound tapes and videotapes by making government equipment and other facilities available for this purpose. Second, they allege that the showing of videotaped movies, and the unlicensed playing of records or tapes in DoD Clubs, terminals, transient billets, andrecreational facilities, are violations as well. The proposed rule did not hddress\"official\" uses of copyeighted works. Although the Department respects privately held copyrights, the Government has a statutory right to use copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owners. Judicial and administrative remedies are available for alleged violations. The proposed rule was directed toward removing DoD support of the questionable personal use of copyrighted materials by individual officers, enlisted members, and employees of the Department. Analysis of General Comments The comments were divided approximately equally in representing two opposing views. On the one hand, a number of commenters suggested that this was not an appropriate area for Departmental controls and that the proposed rule was far too restrictive. On the other hand, persons supporting the interests of the copyright owners asserted that the proposal was superficial in its treatment of the problem and did not go far enough to eliminate the perceived wrongs. These viewpoints will be examined in more detail. The leading advocates for the first position were representatives of military personnel. They argued that the regulation did not take into account the rigors of military life, particularly In overseas areas. The proposed regulation, they stated, singled out military personnel for restrictions not binding on thei civilian, private sector, counterparts, and that these restrictions are unrelated to their military responsibilities. These advocates described the proposed rule as contributing to the \"erosion of the benefits\" to which military members are entitled. The drafters of the proposed rule wore fully aware of the conditions under which military personnel serve. It was recognized that entertainment facilities often are inadequate and that remedtal steps may need to be taken. Nevertheless, such shortcomings do not justify Governmental support of copyright violations or, in the view of some, the encouragement of piracy, As Federal Register ' Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 194 / Rules and Regulations 49451 an analogy, if more recreational plaSing fields are required at a military base they will not be seized from the owners of adjacent property but will be leased or purchased under authorized procedures. Similarly, the Department of Defense will not facilitate or condone the misappropriation of copyrighted materials but instead will acquire these materials through authorized methods. Spokespersons for copyright owners claimed that the proposed regulation fell short of the definitive guidance that is required, and that it does not fully implement the restrictions found in the copyright laws. It also omits major areas of potential abuse, such as the reception and retransmission of signals from satellites and the unauthorized copying of computer software. There are several reasons for the approach taken in the proposed directive. There is not unanimous agreement among copyright lawyers on the scope of the U.S. copyright law and the degree to which it is enforceable. While some of these issues may be clarified by the courts or by congressional action, it is necessary to develop a uniform general policy that will be applicable to DoD personnel world-wide and will be enforceable under regulatory authority, independent of remedies available to copyright owners under the copyright laws. The general policy will be supplemented by more detailed guidance by the Military Departments and other DoD Components. In addition, there is an urgent need to take tlus initial step and publish some minimal guidance. If the components fall short in their implementation, or if additional elaboration on a Department-wide basis is necessary, those steps will be taken later. The time required for judicial or legislative clarification, or even to coordinate a more detailed policy within DoD, could postpone indefinitely this first remedial step. Analysis of Specific Comments The proposed rule was titled. \"Copyrighted Sound and Video Recordings Used for Entertainment Purposes.\" Two commenters asked if it were intended to limit coverage to entertainment and exclude other potential misuse. Although past inquiries directed to the Department generally involved entertainment media, the philosophy behind the policy also applies to training, educational, and other activities. Accordingly, the title and the \"Purpose\" section of the final rule do not include the limiting phrase. \"Used for Entertainment Purposes.\" One commenter asked if there was a distinction between \"official\" and\"unofficial\" use of Gov.eminent facilities. This rule is intended to limit the use of Government equipment and facilities for the personal benefit of individuals, i.e., the \"unofficial\" uscs of resources. To clarify that point, a statement to this effect has been placed in the \"Applicability\" section of the final rule. explaining that it \"does not regulate the procurement or use of copyrighted works for authorizid official purposes.\" The policy statement in the proposed Directive aclmowledged Depart-rnt of Defense recognition of \"the rights of U.S. copyright owners\" and referred to intended guidelines \"for the use of U.S. copyrighted works.\" A commenter asked if protection afforded by this policy was intended to be limited to U.S. ovners and U.S. rights. Such was not the intention and the \"U.S.\" refercncr.s have been deleted. Several commenters complained that a \"loophole\" was built into the policy by the slatement that the rights of copyright owners would be recognized to the extent consistent with the Department's \"unique mission and worldwide commitments.\" Because flexibility in the application of the policy is required to accommodate unforeseen circumstances, this qualification is unchanged in the final rule. It may be necessary to change the guidelines to more rigid rules after there has been some experience with this initial rule. Another limitation in the policy is the statement that the Department will not condone, facilitate, or permit certain activities \"for private or personal use.\" One commenter objected on the basis that this phrase was surplus and that if the activity were improper it was of no consequence that the use was \"private or personal.' The challenged phrase has been retained to clarify the point that the purpose of the rule is to cover other than official DoD activities. Three commenters questioned the assertion that the policy \"does not necessarily represent DoD's interpretation of U.S. copyright laws.\" As noted earlier, the purpose of the Directive is to end certain undezirable practice, whether or not they may be enforced by judicial proceedin,. ThEre are wide differences in opinion regarding the application of the copyright law and to its enforceability against the Department, its co p nents, and individual members. The efforts of the Department to ra.gulate ccrtain activities should not be rcgardcd a- DoD's interpretation of the copyright law. If an enforcement action is initiated against the Department. approzs pte defenses will be utilized on tie Department's behalf by the DI.partmentof Justice, depending upon the facts of the case, notvithstanding the policips of this Directive. This provision of the final rule has been reworded to clarify its intended meaning. The proposed rule permitted the performance of copyrighted sound and video recordings without permission or license of the copyriht owner v~hen the performances are in \"bachelor officer or enlisted quarters or some other residential facility or a physical extension thereof, such as a dayroarn.\" It also specified that places of entertainment. \"such as a club, library or open mess, shall not be considered a physical extension of a residential facility for purposes of this Directive:- Several representatives of copyright ovners suggested that this underrvined the standard specified in the U.S. copyright law. To performn a work\"publicly,\" according to section 101 of title 17, United States Code, \"means to perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered * * Advocates of military members claimed that the copyright law definition could have no application in a military community and that clubs, libraries etc. should be considered the equivalent of personal residences. The final rule recognizes that there are substantial differences among the various DaD components. For emample, a DaD rule defining \"public\" for purposes of an Air Force laze may not be suitable for a Navy vc.-el. Accordingly, several broad parameters are established in the final rule but the development of implementing standards will be the responsibility of the Heads of the DoD Components. Finally, one individual suggested that the rule prohibit the possession or storage of pirated tapes on Government property. The enforcement of this suggestion could be impossible ithout excessive intrusion into the litas of individuals living and v orling on DaD installations. Other practical considerations, such as the difficulty of identifying pirated products and proving the wron-ful intent of the possassor caused this suggestion to be rejected.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:On April 24,1984 the Coast Guard published a final rule in the Federal Register (49 FR 17450) which completely reorganized 33 CFR Part 117 containing requirements relating to the use and operation of drawbridges across the navigable waters of the United States. The revision was designed to simplify the use of these regulations by grouping all of the general rules info a single subpart and by arranging the provisions pertaining to individual drawbridges alphabetically by state and waterway. Waterways running through or bordering more than one state are listed under both states. Lake Champlain is listed under both New York (J 117.797)and Vermont (\u00a7 117.993). The final rule published November 5, 1984 (49 FR 44207) only amended the Vermont listing.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Mr. Glenn Lukos at (213) 688-5606 or Mr. Ralph T. Eppard at (202] 272-0200. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The U.S. Navy has requested the Corps of Engineers establish a naval restricted area in the Pacific Ocean in Mid-San Diego Bay, California. On January 27,1934, the Corps published the proposed naval restricted area in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Section of the Federal Register with the comment period ending on March 12, 1984 (49 FR 3491- 3492]. The coordinates published in the proposed rule contained errors in Stations No. 7 and No. 8. A correction published in the Federal Register on February 21, 1984, (49 FR 6386) corrected only Station No. 7, thereby omitting the required correction to Station No. 8. Accordingly, the Corps republished the proposed rule (corrected) on April 12, 1984 and extended the comment period to expire on April 27,1984 (49 FR 14540- 14541). The Corps received an inquiry from Congressman Duncan Hunter on behalf of a constitutent and letters from 19 individuals, several of whom represented yacht clubs and home owner associations in the area. These letters expressed opposition to the establishment of the restricted area basically for one or the other of the following two reasons: 1. The restriction on boating/sailing through the area in the lee of the Naval Amphibious Base Several groups indicated they hold sailboat races and/ or regattas through the area. 2. Eliminatibn of the anchorage area adjacent to the Naval Amphibious Base at Glorietta Bay. All comments received were furnished the Commander, Naval Amphibious Base for consideration. The Navy states that it never intended to restrict such transit through the subject area and has agreed to a rewording of the rule to make this clear, (i.e., \"all vessels entering the restricted area shall proceed across the area by the most direct route and without unnecessary delay. For vessels under sail, necessary tacking shall constitute adirect route.\") Also, added to the rule is the statement, \"organized activities (such as sail races and regattas) within the restricted area will normally be allowed unless the Commanding Officer, Naval Amphibious Base determines such use would interfere with military operations in the area. Requests must be made to the Commanding Officer, Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, San Diego. California 92155 or by calling, telephone number (619) 522--4333 at least 10 days prior to the event.\" The Navy expresses great concern about having the anchorage area adjacent to the base at Glorietta Bay. The Navy points out that it actually owns all of the submerged land currently used by the anchorage and that the boats at this anchorage are trespassing. This been verified through charts available at the Port of San Diego. The individuals anchoring in this area currently do so under provisions in 33 CFR 110.210 (San Diego Harbor, California Anchorage Grounds). Unrestricted anchorage (currently permitted by 33 CFR 110.210) within the subject area is now prohibited under this rule. The naval facilities at the amphibious base include the fuel pier, a variety of classified special warfare vessels, classified underwater vessels, and classified training facilities. The Na.y indicates that they have had to increase security measures along this portion of their shore as a result of the anchorage. An additional Navy concern is the safety of these anchored vessels and liability should there be an accident involving the fuel pier or trainirn vessels. Having considered all comments received and relevant information available, the Department of the Army has determined that the establishment of the restricted area is warranted. Accordingly, the Department of the Army is establishing a naval restricted area under 33 CFR 207.611 as set forth below.

(SIP) to EPA in 1972, there have been numerous revisions to the plan. These revisions included changes to almost every regulation. The table which is being codified today at 40 CFR 52.1167 identifies those Massachusetts regulations which are part of the federally-approved SIP. The table alsoprovides the date on which EPA took final action to revise each regulation. Where only part of a regulation is federally approved, it is indicated in the comments section of the table. We are publishing this table in today's Federal Register, and making it part of the Code of Federal Regulations to assist the public in identifying those Massachusetts regulations or portions thereof, which are federally approved. We intend to revise this table each time we approve a revision to the Massachusetts SIP. The table published today has been developed primarily for informational purposes. It does not have any independent regulatory effect. The actual federally-approved Massachusetts SIP is incorporated by reference at 40 CFR 52.1120. To the extent that this table codified at 40 CFR 52.1167 conflicts with 40 UR 52.1120,40 CFR 52.1.120 governs. EPA is publishing this table without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective 60 days from the date of this Federal Register unless, within 30 days of its publication, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be v.ithdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will vithdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaldng by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The State of Maryland has submitted a Consent Order for the Westvaco Corporation Paper Mill located in Luke, Maryland. The Consent Order establishes a revised sulfur dioxide (SOt2 emissions limitation fur the mill. Although the revised SO2 emissions limitation is less stringent than the currently approved SIP limitation, the State has adequately demonstrated that ambient SO, air quality standards will still be met.,The State has also demonstrated that PSD increments in the four PSD areas where baseline has been triggered will not be violated. EPA is approving this Consent Order as a revision to the Maryland SIP, as the State submittal meets all of the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 51.

Frankford (3AM13) at the aforementioned EPA Region III address.) Phone: 215/597-1325. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 8, 1983, the State of Maryland submitted a Consent Order for the Westvaco Corporation Paper Mill located in Luke, Maryland, and requested that it be reviewed and processed as a revision to the Maryland State Implementation Plan (SIP). The State certified that a public hearing was held in Cumberland, Maryland on August 31, 1983; in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 51.4. This Consent Order, which was further revised by Maryland on January 26, 1984 and submitted to EPA on February 7, 1984, establishes a revised sulfur dioxide (SO.) emissions limitation for the Luke Mill. Under the terms of the Order, SO emissions from all fuel burning equipment may not exceed: (a) 66 tons per day as calculated from midnight to midnight. (b) For each three-hour period (calculated as block averages), a range of 9.4 tons at 50% buoyancy to 17.0 tonsbt 100% buoyancy, represented (ton/3 hours) Additional details concerning Maryland's submittal and EPA's preliminary review are described in the notice of proposed rulemaking on July 2, 1984, 49 FR 27177. One statement made in the notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the characterization of the SHORTZ model as an \"EPA-guideline model\" was incorrect. SHORTZ is not an EPA guideline model as such. Rather, SHORTZ was chosen by EPA to be used as the reference model. In situations where a refined guideline model is appropriate, such model is usually chosen as the reference model. However, for situations where no refined guideline model is appropriate, it is up to the agency to negotiate with the applicant the appropriate choice for a reference model. The type of demonstration required is described in the EPA guidance document \"Interim Procedures for Evaluating Air Quality Models.\" (August, 1981). EPA chose SHORTZ to be the reference model against which the nongudeltne model (LUMM), submitted by the State as its control strategy demonstration, would be compared. The SHORTZ model w* as chosen as the reference model in this case for the following reasons: (1) No refined guideline model exists which would be applicable for this case. (2) The mbdel was developed by H.E. Cramer Company for EPA Region III 49458 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations specifically for complex terrain situations. (3) The SHORTZ model has the capability of utilizing the sophisticated meteorological measurements that were taken. (4) The SHORTZ model has a long history as being the government's representative model in this case. Thus, EPA's incorrect characterization of the SHORTZ model in the notice of proposed rulemaking will not affect EPA's determination that the LUMM nonguideline model was judged to be the more accurate in predicting ambient SO2 concentrations. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking/Receipt of Public Comments On July 2, 1984, 49 FR 27177, EPA proposed approval of the revised SO2SIP limitation for the Westvaco Mill. EPA also requested comments as to whether a PSD increment consumption analysis need be addressed as part of the control strategy demonstration pertaining to this SO2 emissions increase. During the public comment period, which ended on August 1, 1984, EPA received comments from five interested parties. These comments raised a number of issues, including the applicability of the PSD increment consumption analysis with respect to this SIP revision. Concerning the PSD issues, three commenters argued that the PSD increment consumption analysis should not apply to this SIP revision. In this way, the commenters argue, the increased SO2 emissions would be included into the baseline concentration. These commenters have asserted that such a determination is justified, as this SIP revision is a continuation of the process, which has been ongoing since 1975, to establish a final SO2 emission limitation for the Westvaco Mill. The commenters pointed out that the June, 1978 regulations provided a\"grandfathering\" provision, which placed all emissions increases resulting from pending SIP revisions as of August 7, 1977 into the baseline concentration. One commenter submitted comments asserting that the SO2 emissions increase provided for in this SIP revision should not be included in the baseline concentration. The commenter cites 40 CFR 51.24(bl(13], which generally states that actual emissions increases and decreases at any stationary source occurring after the baseline date will affect the applicable PSD increments. EPA Response: Although the June 1978 PSD regulations allowed for the\"grandfathering\" of pending SIP revisions so that the increased emissions would be calculated into thebaseline concentrations, the revised PSD regulations published on August 7, 1980, 45 FR 52715, rescinded the \"grandfathering\" exemption. The relevant language states as follows: \"EPA believes this exemption from increment consumption analysis is no longer necessary. States and sources have been on notice since June 1978 that emissions increases at existing sources due to SIP relaxations must be evaluated for possible increment consumption. No state or source has been uncertain as to the applicable baseline date, or been placed in an inequitable position as to other states or sources. Therefore, today's regulations do not exempt from increment consumption analysis those SIP -relaxations not finally approved by EPA prior to the baseline date in the affected area.\" Therefore, EPA has determined that the revised SO2 emissions limitation cannot be considered to be part of the baseline. Thus, the increased SO2emissions from the Westvaco Mill do consume PSD increment. In addition to EPA's determination that this revised SO2 emissions limitation will consume PSD increment, the commenters have raised a number of other issues relating to how much and where increment will be consumed. One commenter suggested that the increment being consumed should be split evenly between Maryland and West Virginia (the two states whose PSD increment would be consumed). However, EPA has no policy which would allow consumption of the available increment to be split evenly by two States if the modeling analysis demonstrates otherwise. The same commenters also submitted comments stating that West Virginia, as the State where most of the PSD increment will be consumed, might be subject to a \"potentially severe\" economic impact in several West Virginia counties because of the level of' increment consumed. However, EPA has determined that the revised SO2 SIP limitation will not consume 100% of the increment in any affected PSD area. Additionally, it is nportant to realize that the short-term increment consumption caused by a new source entering the area would be added to the total predicted consumption by Westvaco, only in the event that the source was locating on a line in between the Class I area and Westvaco. That is, the total impact resulting from the interactions of the two sources would 1 almost certainly not be the addition of their separate worst case impacts. In all likelihood, the worst case impact from either one source or the other, whichever is larger, would represent thetotal short-term increment consumption. Therefore, the potential for economic growth will not be at this time entirely prevented by EPA's approval of the revised SO2 emissions limitation for the Westvaco Mill. Another related issue addressed by a commenter concerns the level of emissions used to determine the level of baseline concentration. EPA has determined the 24-hour baseline to be 5 tons per day (the emission limit of the Secretarial Order in force at the time). In EPA's and Maryland's engineering judgment, this baseline level was determined to be representative of actual emissions during the two years preceding the baseline triggering date, The annual baseline concentration was based on an S02 emission limit of 47.9 tons per day. The commenter suggests that the 49 tons per year limit approved by EPA on April 25,1980, 45 FR 27933, should be used to establish baseline, as EPA analysis had shoxn that NAAQS violations may occur if the emissions limit exceeded 49 tons per day. EPA responds in the following mannen (1) The modeling analysis submitted by Maryland supports the revised SOa limitation and indicates that no NAAQS violations are predicted to occur when the 66 ton/day limit is established. (2) According to current Agency policy, EPA defines baseline concentration as the ambient concentration levels at the time of the first permit applicati6n in an area subject to PSD requirements. Baseline concentration generally includes, inter alia, actual source emissions from existing sources, which are generally estimated from source records and any other information reflecting the actual source operations over the 2-year time period preceding the baseline date, (See, 45 FR 52714.) As previously stated EPA has determined, based on the Agency's and Maryland's engineering judgment, the 24-hour baseline to be 58 tons per day at the time of the first permit application. Another commenter suggested, assuming that PSD increment consumption takes place, that the increment consumption analysis performed by the State of Maryland was done on a conservative, worst case, basis, and that the increment consumption analysis should be recalculated on a \"more realistic\" basis. EPA responds to this comment as follows: The Agency attempts to make conservative predictions as a result of a very basic procedure found In EPA guidance which applies to all modeling No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations 49459 applicatiofis. When approaching a regulatory modeling problem, the first step is to perform a screening analysis. Such analysis is designed to be of a simple nature and conservative, in order to avoid having to perform very sophisticated and costly analysis when not warranted. However, if the results of a screening analysis indicates problems, then a more sophisticated (\"refined\") analysis can be performed for the purpose of accurately predicting ambient air impacts. EPA considers screening procedures to be essential for long range transport applications (which was the case in determining Westvaco's potential PSD impacts). The reason for this is two-fold: 1. There is no refined model approved for general use (i.e., a \"guideline model\") that applies to long range transport situations. 2. These sophisticated models that do exist for long range transport are enormously resource-intensive. Thus, EPA concluded that the conservative screening analysis performed to determine Westvaco's impact on increment consumption was appropriate. However, recognizing the fact that the amount of increment consumption predicted was ba.ed on a very conservative screening technique, a new source entering the area would be free to re-model the situation. All sources, including the source under consideration, should be modeled with as sophisticated an approach as would be needed to demonstrate that the Class increments would not be violated. The approach taken could be the same as was performed in the Westvaco case or one could use some other conservative screening technique but which is less conservative than the original screen (e.g., use of the same models but this time accounting for pollutant decay), or finally one could use a sophisticated long range transport model. Two commenters raised the isF ie that the proposed SO2 emissions linit constitutes a \"major modification\", and therefore should undergo a full PSD analysis. EPA has determined that the proposed emissions increase would not constitute a \"major modification\", as the August 7, 1980 regulations, 45 FR 52698, do not treat this type of chan'ge as a physical change or a change in the method of operation. According to the preamble of the August 7, 1980 regulation, a physical change or change in the method of operation shall not include \"a switch to.a fuel or raw material which the source was capable of accommodating before January 6, 1975, so long as the switch would require no change in any preconstruction permit conditionestablished after the date under the SIP\" (as was true in this case). EPA also received comments pertaining to this SIP revision which concerns issues other than PSD. One commenter suggested that there should be more of an evaluation of available low-sulfur fuel technology to determine if an SO2 emissions relaxation is necessary. Response: The Clean Air Act provides that States shall set emissions limitations which ensure attainment of the NAAQS and protection of all applicable PSD increment. The control strategy demonstration submitted by Maryland on behalf of Westvaco adequately supports the conclusion that the S02 emissions relaxation will not result in NAAQS violations. Since the revised SO2 emissions limitation is not considered a \"major modification\" and therefore not subject to a full PSD analysis, there is no best available control technology (BACT) requirement that the source must meet, As long as the State has adequately demonstrated that the revised SO2 emissions limit will not result in any violations of the SO NAAQS or any applicable PSD increment (as was done in this case), the State may request an SO2 emissions relaxation as a revision to its SIP. One commenter questioned whether the modeling which supports the Westvaco consent order assumed maximum allowable emissions and worst case meteorological conditions. The commenter also questioned whether certain property on which air quality monitors are located is currently owned by the company. EPA has determined that the property in question is presently owned by the company. EPA has also determined that the LUMM modeling did assume maximum allowable emissions and worst case meteorological conditions, and that the modeling adequately demonstrated that no ambient air violations of the SO2 standard are likely to occur under those conditions. Another commenter also submitted comments stating that the July 2, 1984 notice of proposed rulemaking did not adequately address the issue of the'potentially severe\" economic impact of this proposed SIP revision in portions of West Virginia such that a reader of this notice could determine that such an impact might exist. EPA responds that based on the above discussion, it is the Agency's opinion that the results of the increment consumption analysis performed does not pose a significant threat to the future growth or industry in West Virginia.Stack Height Determination As EPA explained in its notice of proposed rulemaking, Westvaco's emission limitations are affected by credit for the company's stack height Portions of EPA's stack height regulations were overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Sierra Club v. EPA, 719 F.2d 436 (1983). In response, EPA proposed revised stack height regulations on November 9, 1984. (49 FR 44878) The stack height credit used in establishing the Westvaco emission limits is consistent with this proposal. However, these emission limits will be reviewed for consistency after EPA's new stack height regulations are promulgated. EPA Actions In view of the above evaluation, as well as EPA's determination in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 49 FR 27177 (1984), that the modeling analysis submitted by Maryland is adequate to justify both protection of the SO2 NAAQS and protection of the applicable PSD increments, EPA approves Maryland's Consent Order for the Westvaco Corporation as a revision of the Maryland SIP. In conjunction with the Administrator's approval, this notice revises 40 CFR 52.1070 (Identification of Plan) of Subpart V (Maryland) to incorporate this Consent Order into the Maryland SIP. General Under Section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 19, 1985, This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see Section 307(b)(2)).

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This notice announces the Environmental Protection Agency approval of a revision to the New York State Implementation Plan concerning a\"special limitation\" (variance] issued by the State to the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO). The \"special limitation\" permits LILCO to continue using fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of 2.8 percent, by weight, for two' years in units 1, 2, and 3 of its Northport generating facility ahd m units 3 and 4 of its Port Jefferson generating facility. The sulfur content of the fuel oil permitted to be burned in these units during the third year of this variance will be reduced to 2.0 percent, by weight. The current fuel oil sulfur content regulatory limitation is 1.0 percent, by weight. The State's submittal, extending a current \"special limitation,\" allows the use of up to 2.8 percent sulfur content fuel oil during the period from September 25,1984 until September 24, 1986; and up to 2.0 perdent sulfur content fuel oil to be used from September 25,1986 until December 31, 1987.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William S. Baker, Chief, Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region II Office, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278, (212) 264-2517. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 21,1984, New York State submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a proposed revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning a \"special limitation\" issued by the State under the provisions of Part 225.2 of Title 6 of its Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations. This \"special limitation\" allows the continued use by Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) of fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of 2.8 percent, by weight, for two years, in units 1, 2, and 3 of the Northport generating station, and in units 3 and 4 of the Port Jefferson generating station. The maximum sulfur content of the fuel oil permitted to be burned in these units during the third year of this variance will be reduced to 2.0 percent, by weight. New York State regulations normally limit fuel oil sulfur content at these units to a maximum of 1.0 percent; however, under an EPA approved \"special limitation!' higher sulfur content fuel oil has been burned at these units since July 20,1976. The most recent \"special limitationY' issued by the State would allow the use of up to 2.8 percent sulfur content fuel oil from September 25,1984 until September 24, 1986 and up to 2.0 percent sulfur content fuel oil from September 25, 1986 until December 31, 1987. The last EPA approved \"special limitation\" expired on September 24, 1984. EPA reviewed the technical material submitted by New York State along with the proposed SIP revision request and concurred with the State's determination that no violation of national ambient air quality standards would occur at any location in any state. Also, since the emission levels associated with the burmng of 2.8 percent sulfur content fueloil were included in the \"baseline,\" as defined in EPA's Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulations, no increment would be consumed as a result of the continued use of 2.8 percent sulfur content fuel oil. Based upon this review and EPA's own analysis of the technical material submitted, EPA proposed to approve the New York SIP revision on August 22, 1984 (45 FR 33286). In that Federal Register notice of proposed rulemaking EPA advised the public that comments received on or before September 22, 1984 would be considered in the Administrator's final decision. No public comments were received. Good Engineering Practice Stack Hoight Discussion Portions of the stack height regulations promulgated on February 8, 1982 (47 FR 5864) have been overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Sierra Club v. EPA 719 F.2d 436 (1983) cert. denied, 52 U.S.L.W. 3929 (U.S. July 2, 1984). In response, EPA published proposed revised stack height regulations on November 9, 1984 (49 FR 44878). EPA has determined that the action taken today is consistent with the proposed revised stack height regulations, Four of the units affected by today's action, Northport Units I and 2 and Port Jefferson Units 3 and 4, were in operation prior to 1971 and are, therefore, exempt from the proposed revisions to the stack height regulations, The two stacks associated with Northport Units 3 and 4 were not completed prior to 1971. Therefore, a GEP formula stack height (2.5H) was used to calculate stack height for dispersion modeling purposes. Since the building height associated with these stacks is less than the width, the H+1.5L formula height is equivalent to the 2.5H formula. Although this determination of GEP stack height has been calculated in accordance with the proposed stack height regulations, this action will be re-evaluated for consistency with the final stack height regulations when promulgated. In the interest of expediting federal review, EPA proposed approval of this SIP revision before final submittal of the revision to EPA by New York. EPA refers to this procedure as \"parallel processing\". New York's final submittal revised the three year sulfur in fuel oil variance from allowing the use of up to 2.8 percent sulfur content fuel oil for three years to allowing its use only from September 25, 1984 to September 24, 1986 with 2.0 percent, by weight, fuel oil to be burned from September 25, 1980 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations 49461 until December 31, 1987. Since this revision is more restrictive than proposed, a revised notice of proposed rulemaking is not required. This action is being made immediately effective because it is a substantive rule which grants an exemption or relieves a restriction, it imposes no-hardship on any affected sources, and no purpose would be served by delaying its effective date. Under section 307(b](1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days of todap. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce it requirements. (See section 307(b](2)) The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This notice announces that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is revoking a rule promulgated by EPA as part of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Implementation Plan. The promulgated rule made it clear that certain specific actions taken by the Commonwealth's Environmental Quality Board (EQB) are to be submitted to EPA as implementation plan revisions. Today's action is being taken because EPA believes that it is not now practical to identify generic categories of EQB actions which should or should not require EPA approval as implementation plan revisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective on December 20, 1984. ADDRESSES: A copy of EPA's original action, EPAs proposal to revoke the rule, and comments received during EPA's public comment period are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On November 3,1930 (45 FR 72635) the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published its approval of a revision to the Commonw'ealth of Puerto Rico's Implementation Plan. The revision consisted, in part, of arecodification of the Commonwealth's \"Regulation for the Control of Atmospheric Pollution\" (the Regulation). Under certain provisions of the Regulation, the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (EQB] is authorized under various circumstances to take action to establish, alter or vary emission limitations or compliance dates set forth in the Regulation. In its November 3,19Z0 action, EPA promulgated a rule, 40 CFR 52.2732, which reiterated the Agency's general view that actions of a state which modify the provisions of an applicable implementation plan are required to be submitted to EPA by the state for approval as plan revisions. In its preamble to that action, EPA attempted to identify certain provisions of the Regulation granting EQB authority which, if exercised, would result in actions subject to the implementation plan revision process. Because of the lack of general criteria as to what constitutes implementation plan changes subject to EPA approval. and because the list of affected provisions of the Regulation did not purport to be exclusive. EPA received comments from EQB and others stating that its effort to restate a general policy and provide guidance had, instead. created additional confusion for EQB and for sources located within Puerto Rico. Therefore, upon reconsideration, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on February 18,1931 (48 FR 5139). proposing to revoke 40 CFR 52.2732. The reader is referred to the February 18,1981 notice for additional discussion of the reasons underlying today's action. In its February 18,1931 proposal. EPA advised the public that comments would be accepted as to whether the proposed revocation of 40 CFR 52.2732 should be approved or disapproved. During the comment period., which ended on April 20,1981, EPA received two comments which are discussed later in today's notice. Today's action finalizes the February 18.1981 proposal revoking 40 CFR 52.2732 and withdrawing the preamble listing of certain regulatory provisions which would be subject to this provision. This does not mean, however, that all actions taken by EQB under the Regulation are to be exempted from the implementation plan revision process. EPA remains responsible, under the Clean Air Act, for ensuring that the Puerto Rico Implementation Plan provides for the attainment and maintenance of national standards. EPA will continue to work with the EQB to help identify those particular EQB 49462 Federal Register I Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations actions which require EPA approval as implementation plan revisions. EPA is also willing to discuss with EQB and with individual sources, on a qase-by- case basis, the need for EPA approval of any particular action to be taken by EQB. Finally, EPA will make every effort to promptly review and act on all EQB actions submitted as implementation plan revisions. EPA's revocation of 40 CFR 52.2732 will not affeQt the approval status of the Puerto Rico Implementation Plan, nor will it alter the requirements regarding plan revisions set forth at 40 CFR 51.6 and 51.34. Discussion of Comments Received EPA received two comments, one from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board, the other submitted jointly by the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association PRMA) and Union Carbide Caribe, Inc. (UCCI). Although both comments supported EPA's proposed revocation of 40 CFR 52.2732 and withdrawal of the preamble listing of affected regulatory provisions, each did raise the following specific concerns. While EQB expressly agreed with EPA's proposed revocation and withdrawal, as set forth in the February 18, 1981 proposal, it did express its concern that the language of the notice is an expression of EPA's continuing intention to impose those standards set forth in ,0 CFR 52.2732 and in the November 3,1980 preamble on EQB's exercise of discretionary authority. It was EPA's sole intention in its 1980 rulemaking to restate its general policy regarding the necessity for a state to submit to EPA, as proposed revisions to its implementation plan, variances granted by that state. This 1980 restatement of policy did not represent a departure from previous policy. See CFR 51.34 and 51.6. Certainly, EPA did not intend this restatement of policy to create any additional uncertainty or confusion for EQB or the regulated community. EPA recognizes that there may be actions of limited duration where it is not practical for the action to be submitted as an implementation plan revision. Moreover, EPA does not intend to intervene in the affairs of the Commonwealth to any extent beyond that which is required under the CleanAir Act. And, as stated earlier, EPA is willing to work both with EQB and potentially affected sources to identify those particular EQB actions which should be submitted to EPA as implementation plan revisions. Similarly, those comments submitted jointly by PRMA and UCCI express their mutual concern that EPA's policy limitsEQB's ability to exercise its discretionary authority under its existing implementation plan. While EPA agrees that the Clean Air Act provides a state with maximum flexibility to carry out its implementation plan, EPA remains responsible under the statute for ensuring that a state plan provides for the attainment and maintenance of national air quality standards. To the extent that this statement, in conjunction with EPA's general statement of policy, as set forth earlier, creates confusion for the regulated community, EPA is willing to work with both EQB and the regulated community to discuss the application of this policy- to concrete factual situations. While the identification of an exhaustive list of all possible actions by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico under its Regulation which would or would not require an implementation plan revision might alleviate any confusion on the part of the EQB and the regulated community, EPA does not believe it is possible to develop such a list at this time. Under Executive Order 12291, today's action is not \"major\". It has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. Under section 307(b)(1] of the Clean Air Act, petitions fdr judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days of today. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

SUMMARY: This revises the Total Suspended Particulates (TSP) attainment status designations for a sub-city area of Waukesha, Wisconsin, from primary and secondary nonattainment to secondary nonattainment only, and for a sub- township area of Pacific Township, Wisconsin, from primary and secondary nonattainment to full attainment. These revisions are based on redesignation requests from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), dated January 4,1984, and March 14, 1983, respectively, and on supporting technical data submitted by the Department. Under the Clean Air Act, an attainment status designation can be changed if warranted by the available data. In today's action, USEPA is approving the redesignations as requested by the State of Wisconsin.

Colleen W. Comerford, (312) 886-6034. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Waukesha In the June 5, 1984, Federal Register (49 FR 23195), USEPA proposed to revise the attainment status designation of Waukesha from primary and secondary. nonattainment to secondary nonattainment for Total Suspended Particulates (TSP). This proposed revision was based on two factors: (1) A January 4, 1984, request from the WDNR to revise the Section 107 attainment status designation for Waukesha; and (2) a March 14, 1983, technical support document containing a summary of the most recent 8 consecutive quarters of TSP ambient air quality data, collected from six monitoring sites and one special purpose monitor located in Waukesha. Additional technical information was provided by the WDNR on September 13,1983. A detailed 'discussion of USEPA's proposed approval can be found in the June 5,1984 notice of proposed rulemaking (49 FR 23195). USEPA proposed to approve the WDNR's redesignation request because the ambient air monitoring data showed no violations of the primary TSP National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) from 1980 to 1983. (However, -violations of the secondary TSP NAAQS were recorded at four of the sites during 1980, and at two of the sites during 1981- 1983.) In addition, the WDNR supplied verification of the factors contributing to these reduced primary TSP emission levels. These factors included source shutdowns in the primary nonattainment area. Street paving in both nonattainment areas, and source compliance with the federally approved Part D SIPfor TSP (48 FR 9860; March 9, 1983). Pacific Township In the July 30, 1984, Federal Register (49 FR 30338), USEPA proposed to revise the attainment status designation of Pacific Township from primary and secondary nonattainment to full attainment for TSP. This proposed revision was based on twb factors: (1) A March 14,1983, request from the WDNR to revise the Section 107 attainment status designation for Pacific Township; and (2) a February, 1983, technical support document containing a summary of the most recent 8 consecutive quarters of TSP ambient air quality data. collected from two monitoring sites during 1980-1982. In addition, operating Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations 49465 permits for the two sources located within the nonattainment area were submitted as supplementary information on January 17, 1984. A detailed discussion of USEPA's proposed approval can be found in the July 30, -1984, notice of proposed rulemaking (49 FR 30338). USEPA proposed to approve the WDNR's redesignation request because the ambient air monitoring data showed io violations of the primary or secondary TSP NAAQS between 1980 and 1982. In addition, the improvement in ambient TSP levels can be attributed to control strategies that have been 'mplemented at the two industrial sources located within the ,onattainment area. The effectiveness of the implemented control measures has been verified by the 1980-1982 air quality data, which are representative of carrent air quality. Conclusion During the public comment period, no comments were submitted on either redesignation. Therefore, USEPA takes final action to eliminate the designation of primary nonattainment, to retain the designation of secondary nonattainment. and to reduce the size of he secondary nonattainment area for Waukesha, Wisconsin, for TSP as defined at 40 CFR 81.350. The boundaries of the remaining secondar nonattainment area are given below: North-Moreland Boulevard Last from Frame Park Drive to White Rock Avenue south on White Rock Avenue to Eales Avenue, east on Eales Avenue to Cleveian-r Avenue. East-Cleveland Avenue from Eales Avenue to Perkins Avenue. South-East Main Street from Whthe Rock Avenue to the Strand, north on the Strand to Perkins Avenue, east on Perkins Avenue from the Strand to Cleveland Avenue. West-White Rock Avenue from East Main Street to Frame Park Drive. Frame Park Drive om Perkins Avenue to Moreland Boulevard USEPA also takes final action to approve the redesignation of a sub- township portion of Pacific Township from primary and secondary nonattainment to full attainment for TSP. Consequently, all of Columbia County is now-designated attainment fo x TSP, as defined at 40 CFR 81.350. and a Part D TSP attainment plan is no longer required for this County. Therefore, USEPA lifts the industrial growthprohibition that was imposed on Columbia County, under Section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Clean Air Act, with this final approval of the Pacific Township redesignation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under Section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by (60 days from today).

Introduction and Background 1. The Commission has before it a number of petitions I seeking reconsideration or clarification of our Second Report and Order which authorized the use of random selection or lotteries to choose from among certaii competing applicants. Second Report and Order, Gen. Docket No. 81- 768, 93 FCC 2d 1983); Order Granting Stay of \u00a722.23(a), FCC 83-378, released August 9, 1983. 2. The Second Report was a broad- ranging document that for the first time in Commission history authorizei the use of random selection in lieu of comparative hearings to select initial licensees, Lottery rules were adopted for the low power television service 2 in the Mass Media Bureau; in private land mobile operational fixed microwave, aviation and maritime services in the Private Radio Bureau; and in public land mobile (except cellular radio) in the Common Carrier Bureau.3 3. A significant portion of the Second Report involved issues relating to the use of lotteries in the low power television service. Due to the lottery statute's requirement that preferences be given to applicants in any case where lotteries are used to allocate licenses in the mass media service, preferences were established for low power applicants as follows: (a) Applicants more than 50% controlled by minorities (a 2:1 preference); (b) Applicants whose owners control no other media of mass communcations (a 2:1 preference); and (c) Applicants whose owners control 1, 2 or 3 other media of mass communications (a 1.5:1 preference).- 4. In the Private Radio Services it was determined that lotteries will only be used m the sublect services where a determination has been made that it would be in the public interest. For example, in the private land mobile services, lotteries will be used among competing applicants only if there are no material differences in competing I See Appendix A for the list of petitioners. 2AII references to \"low power\" or \"LPrV\" include television translators, except when otherwise stated. 3In late 1983, the Commission proposed to use lottenes as a method of allocating cellular licenses in the markets below the top-30. Notice of Proposed Rule Making. CC Docket No. 83-1096, 48 FR 51493 (November 9,1983). \"I The issue of preferences for women applicants in the mass media services subject to a lottery is the subject of a separate, pending proceeding. Third Notice of Proposed Rule Making, Gen. Docket No. 81-768. 48 FR 49069 (Oct. 24, 1983).applicants' abilities to serve the public interest. 5. The Second Report established lottery procedures in the common carrier public mobile service (except cellular). The Rules promulgated by the Second Order permit lotteries to be used both for expansion of existing systems and for initiation of new systems, 6. The petitions for reconsideration of the Second Report raise a number of issues concerning the implementation and operation of the Commission's lottery licensing authority. In the mass media area, the minority preference Is questioned by some as being unconstitutional and by others as not being a \"significant\" preference. It Is asserted that the diversity preference Is unconstitutional and is not sensitive enough to distinguish between different types of media interests. One mass media petitioner seeks modification or waiver of the lottery rules in Instances where a financially troubled UHF television station seeks translator authorization to fill out its predicted coverage area. Existing low power licensees argue that existing LPTV stations that get \"bumped\" due to the start up of a full power station should not be required to compete in a lottery for a new frequency assignment, 7. In the private radio area, petitioners seek clarification of the cut-off and application procedures. In addition, petitioners argue that certain private radio services, e.g., maritime radio common carrier, public safety and special emergency, and radio location services, should not be subject to.a lottery. It is also argued that expansion channels for existing systems may be subject to competition from \"gamblers\" who are merely interested in a \"sporting opportunity\" to obtain license authority, Public safety petitioners object to language in the Second Report that indicates that lotteries may be used for making grants between competing public safety applicants, 8. Common carrier petitioners argue that lotteries should not be used In situations where land mobile licenses seek to expand existing systems, One petitioner seeks elimination of a Part 22 Rule which, it is argued, would make It difficult to amend applications. This latter concern was addressed by the Commission subsequent to the issuance of the Second Report. See Order Granting Stay, FCC 83-378, Released, August 9, 1983. 9. Finally, reconsideration is sought of the erratum that corrected a number of errors contained in the regulations accompanying the Second Report. See No, 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations 49467 Final Rule Correction, 48 FR 34039 (July 27, 1983], 10. These broad issues as well as ther more narrowly-focused issues raised by petitioners will be discussed in the context of their relevant service areas below. Where appropriate, this Order will also discuss minor rule changes that appear warranted based upon the pleadings before us and our own experience with the lottery rules. 11. Tie-Breaker Lotteries 11 In the Second Report we interpreted the lottery statute as conferring upon the Commission authority to conduct the use of ad hoc lotteries in tied cases. Second Report at 27185. Nevertheless, we declined to implement tie-breaker lotteries at that time because the matter was deemed to deserve further study. Id. 12. Upon further reflection of this interpretation during our overall review of this Docket, we have decided, sua sponte, to revisit this issue. It is now our view that the new lottery statute was not intended to apply to the deadlock or tie-breaker situation. This view is supported by the language used by Congress in both the initial and revised lottery statutes. Both statutes and their legislative histories are replete with references to the use of \"a system of random selection.\"4 (emphasis added). The term \"system\" denotes an \"orderly combination or arrangement, as of particulars, parts, or elements into a whole .. \"Black's Law Dictionary 1621 (4th ed. rev. 1968). Thus a random selection system is not being employed when a lottery is not contemplated at the outset of a proceeding and is used only as a last resort to resolve a deadlocked comparative proceeding, 13. In the Second Report, the systematic use of lotteries for ceritai specific services in the mass media, common carrier and private radio areas was implemented as a substitute for comparative hearings. This is in sharp contrast to the occasional ad hoc use of a lottery as an instrument of last resort to resolve a comparative hearing after there is a record finding that there are no material differences between the applicants. Indeed, if the new statute With regard to the 1982 revision, see 47 U.SC, 309(i)(1), (3)(A) and (4)(A) {1982}l subsection 309i), Pub. L. No. 97-35, contained three references to \"a system of random selection.\" 47 U.SC. 309()(1), (3)(A) and (4)(A). it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that each word within a statute should be given independent meaning and effect. Wilinson v. Leland, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.] 627, 662 t1829]: American Radio Relay League v. FCC. 617 F,2d 875, 879 (D.C Cir. (1980); 2A C. Sands, Sutheriand Statutory Construction, section 46.06 (rev. 3d ed. 1973).governed tie-breaker situations, it could create the anomalous result of according diversity or minority preferences in a lottery, even though the Commission after a full hearing applied such preferences in finding the rival applicants equally qualified. 14. Without apparent authority under the new legislation to conduct a lottery in a tie-break situation, the question is whether our general public interest authority supports such a result.5 Section 309 of the Act describes in general terms the procedures that the Commission should use for dispensing telecommunications licenses. A public interest, necessity and convenience finding is necessary before any license may be granted. 47 U.SoC. 309(a). And a \"full hearing\" is required in the case of contested applications. 47 U.S.C. 309(e). 15. The term \"full hearing\" has been traditionally held to require a comparison between competing mutually exclusive applicants. Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. FCC, 326 U.S. 327 (1945). The Commission's selection of applicants in a comparative proceeding must be a reasoned decision that, based upon relevant comparative criteria, selects the best applicant. Johnston Broadcasting Co. v. FCC 175 F.2d 351 (D.C. Cir. 1949). For the Commission to make a strained or arbitrary decision within the context of a comparative hearing, when it cannot make a rational distinction between the applicants, would be inconsistent with the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), which requires reasoned decision making and rationality as the hallmark of administrative law and procedure. 5 UoS.C. 706(2)(A). Due to the mathematical equality of opportunity inherent in a pure lottery, we view the use of lotteries as a fair and reasonable decisionmaking device if the applicants are in true equipoise on comparative factors. In this manner, the objectives of both the Communications Act and the Administrative Procedure Act can be harmonized because each applicant will have an equal chance of winning and no one will be harmed by an arbitrary choice on the merits. 16. It is our view that in a legitimate \"tie\" situation, use of a lottery would not contravene the section 309 requirements. In reaching this result, the Commission could conclude that on the The lottery legislation did not purport to preempt our residual authority to use a lottery pursuant to our public interest mandate. In addition, the Commission's inherent authority to use lotteries should not be considered undermined because it has \"long hesitated\" and eventually sought Congressional authority for the systematic use of lotteries. See United States v. Southwestern Cable Co, 392 U.S 157, 170-71 (1968).record evidence before it there were either no differences of decisional significance between the applicants, or the differences between the applicants weighed equally in each of their favor, In effect, such a situation would leave the Commission no choice but to conduct a lottery or other type of tie- breaker to avoid arbitrary or capricious action. See, e.g., MCI Cellular Telephone Company, FCC 84-61, Mimeo No, 34321, para. 57 [released March 6, 1984). 17. Finally, in our view, there are no legal or procedural grounds for delaying the use of a tie-breaker lottery in an appropriate proceeding. It is well established that an administrative agency can implement new policy either by administrative rule or in the context of ad hoc adjudication. SEC v. Chenery Corp. (\"Cheneryll'1, 332 U.S. 194 (1947), Applying a lottery at the end of a comparative hearing without prior notice would not be prejudicial because the applicants will have had ample opportunity to present all of their evidence and arguments to show that they were the best qualified applicant8 Although not required as a matter of law, the Commission may choose to follow prior practice and allow the parties to comment on the proposed use of a lottery or other alternative tie- breaker approaches. See, e.g., Alexander S. Klein, Jr., FCC 79-401 (released August 3, 1979). 18. In sum, we view the Commission's mandate to \"encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest\" as ample authority for the use of ad hoc lotteries. 47 U.S.C. 303(g}; National Brcadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 216 (1943). Additionally, the Commission is given wide latitude to \"conduct its As noted in MCI Cellular Telephone Company, sup 'a, we believe that it is appropriate for Administrative Law Judges to certify that the ultimate choice among applicants should be made randomly where two or more applicants are tied. However, we also believe that such a determination should be made only after completion of a full evidentiary hearing and preparation of an intial decision containing findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, on all the material issues of fact. law, or discretion presented on the record, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 557. In reaching the ultimate conclusions, we contemplate that an AL would provide a reasoned analysis supporting the determination that two or more of the applicants are tied and then certify the case as appropriate for utilization of a lottery. Any party objecting to this action would be free to file exceptions to the initial decision, as provided by \u00a7 \u00a7 1.276 and 1.277 of our Rules, directly with the Commission notwithstanding \u00a7\u00a7 0.361 and 0.365 of our Rules. If no exceptions are filed, a random selection would be promptly made by lottery without consideration in Mass Media Services cases of any preference accorded by \u00a7 1,122 of our Rules.Federal Register / Vol. 49, 49468 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations proceedings in such manner as will best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and to the ends of justice.\" 47 U.S.C. 154(j). We believe that the public interest could best be served by using lotteries to resolve tied cases and therefore speed new service to the public and save both the Commission's and the public's time and resources. III. Mass Media Services 19. Several petitioners seek reconsideration of the preference system that was adopted by the Second Report. SIN, Inc. and Affiliated Low Power Television Applicants (\"SIN\") \"urge the Commission to alter its lottery preference scheme to provide the'significant preference' to minority applicants which the revised statute\" requires. Petition at pp. 1-2. SIN argues that the 2:1 fixed relative minority preference adopted in the Second Report does not comport with the lottery statute I which requires a \"significant preference\" for minority controlled applicants. 47 U.S.C. 309(i)(3)(A). Furthermore, SIN asserts that the 2:1 lottery preference for minorities reduces the likelihood that minorities will prevail in a lottery selection as compared to a traditional comparative hearing. 20. SIN takes issue with the minumum forty per cent diversity preference for all eligible applicants in a given pool of competitors, as compared to the minority preference which is not subject to adjustment to a certain minimum or floor. It is argued that this diversity preference adjustment further dilutes the effect of the minority preference. We are urged by SIN to increase the minority preference from its current 2:1 level to some level that will provide a more meaningful preference. ,21. Neighorhood TV Company (\"Neighborhood\") claims that the minority preference is \"absolute\" and detrimental to other applicants who are ineligible for the minority preference. Petition at pp. 3, 12 and 13. Petitioner Neighborhood asserts that the lottery preference system is unconstitutional as it allegedly violates the equal protection aspect of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. It is argued that the minority preference is unsupported by findings of prior discrimination in the telecommunications field, that a minority preference will not necessarily increase the diversity of information and, in any event, the use of a minority preference in the lottery selection system is contrary to the public interest. 747 U.S.C. 309(i][3)(A).22. International Broadcasting Network (\"IBN\") questions the diversity preference given in mass media lotteries. IBN contends that the Commission's diversity preference fails to distinguish between different types of media ownership interests.8 IBN suggests that the Commission should exclude the first fifteen translator and low power TV stations from counting against an applicant when computing the diversity preference. Finally, IBN contends that the lottery statute is\"constitutionally infirm.\" Petition at p. 4. 23. Greater Williamette Vision, Ltd. (\"GWV\") urges the Commission to modify the lottery rules or exempt from the lottery selection process those new, financially troubled UHF-TV stations that need translator facilities to fill out their predicted contour coverage. GWV asserts that it needs translator service to fill-in its authorized-coverage area and that in applying for a translator it should be given a conclusive preference or at least it should not be disfavored in a lottery situation.9 24. Bahia Honda, Inc., Los Cerezos Television Company, Graciela Olivarez, Seven Hills Television Company, Spanish International Communications Corporation and Las Tres Campanas Television Company (\"Joint Petitioners\") seek reconsideration of the SecondReport on the ground that it would require an existing LPTV or translator licensee forced to change channels due to the initiation of full power television service to compete for a new channel in the lottery context. Under our existing Rules, a low power or translator licensee that changes channels to avoid interference from a full power television station would have to file a \"major change\" application. 47 CFR 73.3572[a)(1)(i). The low power rules treat a \"major change\" application as an initial application and thus subject to competing applications and the random selection process. Report and Order, BC Docket No. 78-253,47 FR 21468, 21487 (May 18, 1982); 47 CFR 74.732(d). Joint Petitioners state that the Second Order is ambiguous as to 8The lottery Rules provide a 2:1 relative diversity preference for those applicants with no other media interests. Applicants with 1. 2 or 3 other media interests receive a 1.5:1 relative diversity preference. IBN argues that our diversity preferences are insensitive to different types of media holdings. For example, it is pointed out that an applicant who is the licensee of a full power station would be accorded the same diversity preference as an applicant who is the licensee of a LP'V station. 9 Under our lottery rules, GWV. if it owns no other media interests, would be ineligible for the 1.5.1 diversity preference due to the geographical proximity of its existing and proposed stations. See SecondReport at 27191, 27192 and 27203.whether existing low power licensees who must change channel assignments to avoid interference to full power stations are subject to competing applications. In addition, Joint Petitioners request the Commission to give dispositive preferential treatment to displaced LPTV or translator licensees. 25. We are unpersuaded by the arguments advanced by IBN, Neighborhood and SIN that our lottery preference system needs to be modified or set aside as unconstitutional. We remain constant in our view that the lottery statute Is constitutional and affirm our previous conclusion: The program adopted herein does not share that attributes of the scheme rejected In Bakke, lnd comports with the teachings of Fullilove. The Conferees have, at 43-44 of the - Report found that past discrimination has resulted in severe underrepresentatlon of nnoritles in media ownership. They have therefore established a program in which race is one of two factors to be awarded fixed relative preferences .... [FJixed relative preference does not guarantee that minorities will receive double the number of licenses as would non.minority applicants. Further, the Conferees have Instructed that we report annually on the effect of the preference system and whether It is serving the purposes intended. Congress wlltbo able to further tailor the program based on that information, and may eliminate the preferences when appropriate. All of these factors lead to the conclusion that the preference system as adopted lasses constitutional muster. 48 FR 27182, 27190 (June 13, 1983) (footnotes omitted). 26. In response to IBN and others, we decline to modify the weight or operation of either the minority or diversity preferences. We believe that the preferences as adopted represent a reasonable exercise of the Commission's discretion to structure \"significant preferences\" for the promotion of minority and diversity interests. See 47 U.S.C. 309(i)(3)(A); Second Report at 27190-91. And, as the courts have observed, administrative agencies are granted reasonably wide discretion In carrying out their statutory duties, ied Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381 (1969); Federal Election Commission v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, 454 U.S. 27, 39 (1981). 27. With regard to SIN's complaint that the minimum forty per cent diversity preference unnecessarily dilutes the minority preferencewe note that minority applicants who own few or no other media of mass communications may also take advantage of the diversity preference. The minimum forty per cent diversity No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations 49469 preference was specified in the Conference Report and implemented in the Second Report. See Conference Report at 42 and 46 and Second Report at 27203. In essence, the minimum forty per cent diversity preference ensures that diversity qualified applicants as a group have at least a forty per cent chance of winning in relation to applicants who qualify for no preferences. As an additional matter, it should be noted that minority applicants are faring reasonably well in the low power television lotteries. To date, it appears that approximately 73% or 36 out of 49 of the lotteries in which minorities have participated have been tentatively \"won\" by minorities. 28. Neighborhood mischaracterizes the nature of the minority preference as\"absolute.\" The minority preference, as well as the diversity preference, was adopted by the Commission as a \"fixed relative preference.\" SecondReport at 27190-91. See also Conference Report at 42-44. The 2:1 fixed relative minority preference doubles the chances of a minority applicant in relation to non- preferred applicants. However, the actual probability based upon preference that is assigned to minority applicant varies from lottery to lottery depending upon the number of applicants and the presence or absence of applicants eligible for a diversity preference. See Conference Report at 42. 29. With regard to GWV's request that it be excused from competing in a lottery to obtain a translator license to fill out its predicted coverage area, we note that a recent Notice of Proposed Rule Making seeks comments on whether television translators should be processed in a manner different than low power television applications. Notice of Proposed Rule Making, IvlM Docket No. 83-1350, 49 FR 908, 911 (January 6,1984). Numerous comments addressing this issue have been filed in Docket No. 83-1350. Therefore, we will defer the issue until we resolve it in that rule making proceeding. In the interim, however, we believe that the public interest does not weigh in favor of holding up the mutual processing of low power and translator applications. If an applicant loses a lottery for a particular UHF frequency, there may be another available frequency for which authorization May be sought. 30. Although at this time our treatment of television licensees who seek to improve service In their authorized coverage area is different than our treatment of common carrier mobile service licensees (see paras. 44-46 infra), we believe that there are sound public interest reasons for requiringmutually exclusive translator and LPTI applicants to compete in the same lottery. First, UHF frequencies are generally fungible (and there may be several available) for LPTV and translator licensees, whereas due to technical factors, certain adjacent or compatible frequencies are required for efficient system expansion in the common carrier mobile service. See para. 44, infra. Secondly, due to the mobility of the receive locations in the common carrier mobile service3, potentially all customers are affected by a gap in the service coverage area; whereas in the broadcast service, where the nature of the service is not mobile, only the potential viewers in the shadowed area are affected. 31. Joint Petitioners seek reconsideration of the Second Order on the grounds that LPTV or translator licensees that are displaced due to the start up of a nearby full power station should not have to compete in a lottery for new channel assignments. It is argued that is is unfair for an existing licensee with an ongoing operation to be forced to compete in a lottery for a new authorization. It is asserted that displaced licensees should be entitled to some \"expectancy\" of receiving a new authorization. 32. Joint Petitioners' request for special dispensation will not be considered at this time, and we will not change our current processing procedures for pending LPTV and translator applications. Joint Petitioners' request directly conflicts with our present views on the fundamental concept of LPTV as a secondary service. Moreover, the outstanding rule maling proceeding referred to above proposes new procedures, including a \"window\" filing period in place of \"cut-oft' that, if adopted, should alleviate much of Joint Petitioners' concern. Consequently, prudence dictates that we not consider additional relief at this time. 33. Displaced LPTV and translator licensees are not left completely without a remedy. Displaced licensees are eligible for special temporary authority (\"STA\") on an available frequency as long as they have an application on file for that particular frequency. See, e.g., SecondReport at 27193; 47 U.S.C. 309(o). In this manner displaced licensees can continue operations, at least for an interim period. 34. Finally, in the mass media area, New Life Evangelistic Center, Inc. (\"New Life\") seeks reconsideration of an Erratum which corrected certain errors in the Second Report 48 FR 34039 (July 27, 1983). The crux of New Life's petition is that \"the Erratum deletes publicationin the Federal Register of cut-off in the broadcast cases ... :' Newv Life's petition is denied. When we published our lottery Rules in the Second Report we inadvertently copied obsolete mass media Rules that specified Federal Register publication of cut-off lists. Commission practice only requires public notice of such lists. Second Report and Order, Gen. Docket No. 79-137,46 FR 36830 (July 16,1931). Therefore, reconsideration of the ministerial act of republishing the correct Rules is denied. IV. Private Radio Services 35. Petitioners Mobile Marine Radio, Inc., Watervray Communications System. Inc. and Offshore Navigation. Inc. (\"three petitioners\"] raise several mutual concerns. The three petitioners, respectively, urge the Commission not to use lotteries in maritime MF and HF band common carrier service, inland waterway communications service and radiolocation service. We reject petitioners' requests on this issue and remain firm in our vier, that the public interest will best be served by using lotteries in these services to select initial licensees where there are no substantial material differences in the qualifications of the competing applicants. See Second Report at 27193. 36. The three petitioners also request reconsideration concerning \u00a7\u00a7 1.918( and 1.227(b)(4) of the Commission's Rules. With regard to \u00a7 1.918(b), the concern is that an applicant's right to amend its application to raise or address comparative issues might be cut-off by the operation of \u00a7 1.918(e) prior to the determination whether a lottery or comparative hearing vill be used to select an initial licensee. We did not mean to preclude the submission of supplemental information which might address issues of comparative significance. Although applicants do not have an unlimited right to amend their applications, they may supplement their applications with such information as is necessary to address relevant issues. 37. The three petitioners contend that \u00a7 1.227(b)(4), regarding consilidation of applications, should apply to both lotteries and comparative hearings. This concern is now moot. Section 1.227(b)(4) was modified by Commission Order, released July 24.1984 (FCC 84-323). to clarify, inter alia. our intention that Rule Section should apply to both lotteries and comparative hearings. 38. Offshore Navigation, Inc. pointed out in its petition that mutually exclusive applications are possible in Subpart F of Part 90, the RadiolocationFederal Register / Vol. 49, 49470 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations Service. Section 1.962 of our Rules authorizes petitions to deny in the Radiolocation Service. Nothing in the Second Report should be construed'to the contrary. Petitions to deny in the Radiolocation Service may be filed in accordance with the procedures established in the Second Report for Private Radio Services in which petitions to deny are authorized. However, we will not modify \u00a7 1.972(c), as requested byOffshore Navigation. Since the current language encompasses mutually exclusive applications in the Radiolocation Service, any additional clarifying language would be superfluous. 39. The Associated Public-Safety Communications Officers, Inc. and the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department (\"two petitioners\") raise mutual concerns. First, the two petitioners are concerned about the implication in the SecondReport that a lottery might be used to choose between competing public safety applicants. As stated in the Second Report, a lottery will not be used to choose between competing public safety and non-public safety applicants. For competing public safety applications, we will not use lottery procedures when it appears upon initial analysis that there are significant differences in the abilities of competing applicants to serve the public. However, when it appears upon initial analysis that there are no substantial and material differences in the merits of competing applications, we may select licensees by lottery. In this way, lotteries will be used only when comparative procedures would serve no useful purpose. In making this public interest determination whether public safety applications should be subject to a comparative hearing or lottery, we may consider such factors as overall public safety implications, geographic coverage area, population affected, operator experience and spectrum efficiency. Our reasons for using lotteries or comparative hearings will be specified in public documents m each individual case. If we use lotteries in such a case, we expect to expedite service to the public while ensuring that licensees always remain fully qualified. In any instance where we select licensees by lottery in these services, we will make the affirmative finding, referenced in the Conference Report, that the public interest will be significantly benefited. Conference Report at 37-38. 40. The two petitioners also seek reconsideration of the Second Report to exempt Public Safety and Special Emergency Radio Services eligibles fromany system of raridom selection. Petitioners argue that the use of lotteries to select licensees for such services would be inconsistent witii47 U.S.C. 332(a) and its legislative history. Recently amended section 332(a) instructs the Commission to consider the promotion of safety of life and property in the management of private land mobile spectrum. Similarly, the legislative history of section 332(a) states that the Commission should carefully consider and promote the needs of public safety agencies in managing the private land mobile spectrum. io 41. Petitioners request for reconsideration on this issue is denied. Our decision to use lotteries in these circumstances is well within our statutory authority.\" Both the recently amended land mobile provision (section 332(a)) and the lottery provision (section 309(i)) were included in the Communications Amendments Act of 1982. Thus, when drafting section 332(a), Congress was well aware of the lottery provision. 12 Indeed, the legislative history accompanying section 332(a) discourages the use of auctions for allocating land mobile spectrum, but expressly provides that \"this should not be construed to limit the ability of the Commission to use lottery procedures for purposes of granting private land mobile licenses.\" Conference Report ht 53. Accordingly, we find petitioner's statutory argument to be without merit, V. Common Carrier Services 42. Kadison, Pfae.zer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi (\"Kadison\") seeks reconsideration of the SecondReport and specifically elimination of new Rule \u00a7 22.23(a)(2) concerning amendment of applications rn the Common Carrier Mobile Service. On August 9,1983, we stayed this Rule change,13 in order Sess. 52- 53 (1982. \"As we have indicated, we will not use lotteries to sqlect among public safety and non-public safety/ applications, and we will not use lotteries to select among public safety applications when there are materal differences in the merits of the applications. We anticipate that the selective use of lotteries in these services will ensure that the Commission fulfills its Congressional mandate to consider the communications requirements of public safety entities in making spectrum assignments.\"2 Generally, when Congress enacts two statutory provisions in the same bill and on the same subject matter, it is assumed that Congress was aware of both provisions and an effort should be made to construe the two together and give effect to each. See, e.g.. ?A C. Sands. Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.02 (rev. 3d ed. 1973). \" Order Granting Stay, FCC 83-378, released August 9,1983.consider Kadison's arguments in the ongoing proceeding to revise Part 22, CC Docket No. 80-57. In our Report and Order in that Docket, we partially granted the relief requested. See Report and Order, FCC 83-476 at paras. 58-65, released December 19, 1983. 43. Telocator Network of America (\"Telocator\") and joint petitioners Kelly Communication and Omni ,Communications, Inc. (\"Kelly and Omni\") seek reconsideration of the lottery Rules with respect to radio common carriers licensed under Part 22 of the Rules, These petitioners argue that the Commission should not use lotteries across the board in the mobile services. Petitioners assert that carriers who seek to expand existing systems to relieve congestion should not be subject to random selection. It is argued that valid public interest reasons exist for such exemption. For example, existing carriers would be unable to rationally plan the improvement of existing systems; all frequencies potentially available for expansion are not fungible, some being more crucial to expansion of existing systems than others; and \"fortune-seekers\" may seek to acquire an expansion channel solely for the purpose of reselling it at an exorbitant price to an existing carrier who needs It for system improvement. 44. We are persuaded that the public interest would best be served by retaining the option to use comparative proceedings rather than lotteries In certain situations in the Public Land Mobile Service. The petitioners have set forth certain conditions under which, we believe, the use of some type of comparative hearings (not necessarily trial-type hearings before administrative law judges) may be warranted. When a carrier seeks to increase the capacity of an authorized system by the addition of channels, it will generally find it necessary to do so for both technical and edonomic reasons by the addition of channels in the same frequency band as those used on its existing system.14 Similarly, a carrier seeking to increase the geographic coverage of an authorized system by the addition of transmitter locations will need to apply for the same channels used on its existing system.

Accordingly, we will permit applicants for the expansion of authorized-systems to request that their mutually exclusive applications be designated for a comparative hearing instead of being placed in a lottery for selection.'5 After reviewing the pleadings (see Appendix B), the Commission will either issue a designation order or an order stating why the application will not be accorded a comparative hearing. 45. In order to ensure that applicants do not attempt to circumvent our lottery procedures, we shall adopt guidelines specifying those applications for which comparative procedures may be requested. First, the frequency must be in the same band (i.e., 35/43 MI-kz, 150 MHz, 450 MHz or 900 MHz) as the frequency for which the applicant is already licensed. Second, if the application involves geographical expansion, the proposed base station must be located within 40 miles of one of the applicant's existing base stations. This is consistent with \u00a7 22.525(b) of our Rules which defines when a paging application will be considered as - seeking an additional frequency for purposes of our one initial channel policy. The Rule is set forth in Appendix B. 46. Unlike the mass media discussion, supra at para. 30, we believe that existing mobile service licensees that seek to either add additional frequencies or expand their coverage area should have the option of either a lottery or comparative hearing. There is a fundamental difference between the mobile service and the LPTV/translator service. Translator and LPTV frequencies, to the extent they are available, are generally fungible. That is, one available UHF television frequency is gefierally as desirable as another. On the other hand, mobile service frequencies for existing licensees, as opposed to new entrants, are not always fungible; in order for licensees to -15 In permitting the use of a comparative hearing instead of a lottery in these circumstances, it is not our intention to establish an automatic presumption that an applicant seeking to expand an authorized system is to be preferred over a new applicant. Upon designation for hearing, all applicants will be given the opportunity to demonstrate that the public interest would be served by a grant of their applications.efficiently and economically expand frequencies or coverage area, certain adjacent or compatible frequencies must often be used. Thus. we believe it desirable for mobile service licensees seeking to expand their systems or coverage areas to have the option of demonstrating their specific frequency requirements and the unmet business needs of their customers in a comparative hearing. Accordingly, we believe that our different approaches to the sys~em coverage area issue in the mass media and common carrier services are well founded. VI. Conclusion 47.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The AID Acquistion Regulation (AIDAR) is being amended to correct an authority citation relating to extraordinary contractual relief, to allow more flexibility and discretion in setting contract payment due dates, and to correct an obsolete address. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 10, 1984. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: M/SER/CM/SD/POL, Mr. I.M. Kelly. AIDAR, in subpart 750.71, contains procedures for extraordinary contractual relief to protect foreign policy interests of the United States. AID was authorized to use these procedures by State Department Delegation No. 104, and this authority was cited in Subpart 750.71. State Department Delegation 104, has been superseded by Executive Order 12163 and International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA) Delegation of Authority No. 1; Subpart 750.71 is amended to reflect this. The AID contract clause concerning payment due dates was established in response to the Prompt Payment Act. The AID clause set payment due datesof 30 days after receipt of a proper invoice, or acceptance of property or services, whichever is later, for contracts paid from a paying office in the United States; and 45 days, same basis, for contracts paid from a paying office located overseas. As written, the clause allowed no discretion to the contracting officer or controller in establishing payment due dates, considering a contractor's usual practice, or any special requirements or a particular procurement. The clause has been modified to make it clear that payment due dates other than the 30/45 days now required may be authorized. This treatment is consistent with the Prompt Payment Act, OMB Circular A-: 125, and applicable Treasury and AID regulations concerning contractor payment. None of the changes being made by this AIDAR Notice will have any significant impact on AID contractors or the general public. Therefore, the changes are not considered \"significant\" under OFPP Policy Letter 83-2, or FAR 1.303(b) or 1.501, and public comments have not been solicited. This AIDAR Notice is not a \"major rule\" as defined in Executive Order 12291; therefore no regulatory impact anaylsis is required. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that AIDAR Notice 85--3 will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Federal Grain Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 8O U.S. Standards for Soybeans AGENCY: Federal Grain Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: According to the requirements for the periodic review of existing regulations, the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS has reviewed the U.S. Standards for Soybeans. Pursuant to this review, FGIS proposes to revise the soybean standards to: (1) Delete test weight per bushel as a grade- determining factor for soybeans; (2) revise the current classes of soybeans by deleting the classes of Green, Black, and Brown soybeans, and include these deleted classes in a new definition of Soybeans of other colors; (3) include limits in the Sample grade requirements for soybeans, and (4) make changes in language, format, and update the footnotes referenced in the standards. These changes are made to update and conform the standards to other grain standards. DATE: Comments must be submitted on or before February 19, 1985. ADDRESS: Comments must be submitted in writing to Lewis Lebakken, Jr., Information Resources Management Branch, USDA, FGIS, Room 0667 South Building, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, D.C. 20250, telephone (202) 382-1738. All comments received will be made available for public. inspection at the above address during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lewis Lebakken, Jr., address as above, telephone (202) 382-1738. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12291 This proposed rule has been issued in conformance with Executive Order12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1. This action has been classified as nonmajor because it does not meet the criteria for a major regulation established in the Order. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification Dr. Kenneth A. Gilles, Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because those persons who apply the standards and most users of soybean inspection services do not meet the requirements for small entities as defined in the'Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Further, the standards are applied equally to all entities by FGIS employees or licensed persons. Review of Standards The review of the standards included a determination of the continued need for the standards and the potential to clarify or simplify the language of the standards; a review of changes in marketing practices and functions affecting the standards; a review of changes in technology and economic conditions in the area affected by the standards; and a determination of the potential to improve the standards and their application through the incorporation of grading factors or tests which better indicate quality attributes. The objective is to assure that the standards continue to serve the needs of the market to the greatest possible extent. A notice requesting public comment on the U.S, Standards for Soybeans, Corn, and Mixed Grain was published in the May 8, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 30446). Views and comments were solicited to help in the study and evaluation of present grading practices and standards and in the development of any recommendations for change. Within the 60-day comment period, twenty-three comments were received on the soybean standards. Fifteen commenters stated summarily that the soybean standards do not need to be changed. Eight commenters favored inclusion of oil content in the soybean standards, and the majority of these commenters also favored inclusion of protein content. Other commenters addressed the removal of test weight and/or moisture as grade-determining factors and the limits for foreign material in the standards.To gather additional information, discussions were held with industr. representatives; including the American Soybean Associatibn (ASA). The ASA repressents a large number of soybean producers. At the annual meeting in August, 1984, the ASA recommended several changes to the soybean standards. These recommendations were: 1. Eliminate moisture content as a grade-determining factor, provided that moisture will always be shown on the inspection certificate. 2. Eliminate test weight as a grade- determining factor, but-make it optional upon request.3. Eliminate all classes of soybeans except Yellow and Mixed soybeans, and 4. Eliminate stinkbug damaged kernels from the factor \"damaged kernels total\", and show the percentage of stinkbug damaged kernels for informational purposes on inspection certificates. The deletion of moisture content as a grade-determining factor in corn, sorghum, and soybeans was proposed in the June 7,1984, Federal Register (49 FR 23651) to provide for consistency among the various grain standards and to recognize current trade practices. A final rule for this action was published in the Federal Register on September 12, 1984 (49 FR 35743). Effecitve September 9, 1985, moisture content will no longer be a grade-determining factor, but will continue to be shown on all soybean inspection certificates which show an official grade determination. As discussed below, FGIS concurs with the recommendations of the ASA to delete test weight per bushel as ' grade-determining factor in soybeans and to delete all classes of soybeans except for Yellow and Mixed soybeans. However, FGIS will study the recommendation to eliminate stinkbug damage from the factor \"damaged kernels total.\" FGIS' concerns with the recommendation are: 1. The added time and costs of inspection to show stinkbug damage results separately on all inspection certificates, and 2. The potential for confusion on the part of foreign buyers in contracting for specific limits for stinkbug damaged kernels and/or the impact upon foreign markets if there were no limits. As a number of initial commenters indicated in the request for public comment, oil and protein content are Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, Dccember 20, 1934 / Proposed Rules important factors for determining the quality and value of soybeans. a However, additional time is needed to refine methods of determinationbefore these factors can be made applicable to the official inspection procedures. If methodology is developed which will allow oil and protein to be determined accurately and rapidly, FGIS will consider proposing the inclusion of oil and protein into the soybean standards. \" Although a small number of commenters addressed the limits for foreign material in the soybean standards, these limits have not generally been a major point of concern. FGIS, therefore, has determined the limits to be adequate and they should not be revised at this time. A review of available information indicates that certain revisions in the standards wouldincrease clarity and effectiveness of the standards and reflect current marketing practices. As a result of this review, FGIS proposes the following changes in the U.S. Standards for Soybeans: 1. To enhance clarity and uniformity among standards, FGIS proposes to revise the U.S. Standards for Soybeans by dividing the standards into 4 parts, and into sections, similar to the present format in other U.S. grain standards. Specifically, in addition to the changes below, the undesignated heading, TERMS DEFINED would consist of a new \u00a7 810.601, Definition of soybeans, and a new \u00a7 810.602, Definition of other terms. An undesignated heading, PRINCIPLES GOVERNING APPLICATION OF STANDARDS would consist of an new \u00a7 810.603, Basis of determination, a new \u00a7 810.604, Temporary modifications in equipment and procedures, and a new \u00a7 810.605, Percentages. An undesignated heading, GRADES, GRADE REQUIREMENTS, AND GRADE DESIGNATIONS would consist of a new \u00a7 810.600, Grades and grade requirements for soybeans, and a new \u00a7 810.607, Grade designations. The undesignated heading, SPECIAL GRADES, SPECIAL GRADE REQUIREMENTS, AND SPECIAL GRADE DESIGNATIONS would consist of a new \u00a7 810.608. Specialgrades and special grade requirements, and \u00a7 810.809, Specialgrade designations. Incidental to this revision, the current \u00a7 810.601, Terms defined, would be removed as unnecessary, TERMS DEFINED would become an undesignated heading, and \u00a7 810.601 would be designated the new Definition of soybeans. The current \u00a7 810.602, Principles governing application of the standards, would be removed; PRINCIPLES GOVERNING APPLICATION OF STANDARDS wouldbecome an undesignated heading, and \u00a7 810.602 would be designated the new Definition of other terms. The current \u00a7 810.603, Grades, grade requirements, and grade designations, would be removed; GRADES, GRADE REQUIREMENTS, AND GRAD DESIGNATIONS would become an undesignated heading, and \u00a7 810.03 would be designated the new Basis of determination. The current \u00a7 810.601(a) Soybeans, would be redesignated as \u00a7 310.601, Definition of soybeans, and would include the scientific name for soybeans. The current \u00a7 810.601(b) Classes, \u00a7 810.601(c) Yellow soybeans, and \u00a7 810.601(g) be revised and redesignated as the new \u00a7 810.602(a). The current \u00a7 810.601 (d), (e), and (f) would be removed as classes and redesignated as \u00a7 810.u2[h). Soybeans of other colors, as discussed in 3 below. The current \u00a7 810.01(h) Grades is removed as unnecessary. The current \u00a7 810.e01(i), Bicolored soybeans, would be incorporated into the new \u00a7 810.602(h), Soybeans of other colors, and would include additional information incorporated from the current \u00a7 810.903. Section \u00a7 810.903 would, therefore, Damoged Kernels, () Heat-damaged kernels, (m) Foreign material, and Stones would be restated and redesignated as \u00a7 810.602 (i), (b), Ce, (d), and (j), respectively. The current \u00a7 810.602(c) Moisture, and (d) Test weight per bushel would be redesignated as (f) and (k), respectively. The current \u00a7810.601(o) 8/64 sieve, would be redesignated as \u00a78106020). Also included in the \u00a7810.602 Definition of other terms, would be definitions for two new terms, (c) Distinctly low quality and (g Purple mottled or stained, which are incorporated from the current \u00a7810.901 and \u00a7810.802 respectively. Sections \u00a7810.901 and 810.902 would therefore be removed. The new \u00a7810.603. Basis of determination, (previously \u00a7810.02(a)) would be clarified by rewording the section and dividing it into three subparagraphs, (a) Distinctly low quality, (b) Certain quality determinations, and Cc) All other determinations. This format appears in other grain standards and the information which will appear in the section is generally contained in the FGIS Grain Inspection Handbook. A new \u00a7810.604, Temporary modifications in equipment and procedures, is proposed. The equipment and procedures referenced in the soybean standards are applicable tograin produced under normal environmental conditions. FGIS propoces to provide that, when adverse growing or harvest conditions make impractical the use of routine procedures, minor temporary modifications in the equipment or procedures may be required to obtain results expected under normal conditions. Adjustment in interpretations (i.e., identity, quality, and condition) shall not be made. This section is similar to sections which appear in other grain 6tandards. The current \u00a7810.602(b). Percentages, would be clarified by spelling out in greater detail the rounding procedures currently used for soybeans. Accordingly, the proposed revision would specify how a figure would e rounded when followed by a figure greater, lesser, or equal to five. This revision would make the wording of the section the same or similar to that used n other grain standards, as appropriate. The section would be included in the new \u00a7810.605, Percentages. A new \u00a7810.605, Grades andgrade requirements for soybeans, (currently \u00a7310.603) is proposed. Changes would be made to clarify wording and to revise the format for the requirements for U.S. Sample grade. The format changes for the U.S. Sample grade requirement, are made to conform to other grain standards and to incorporate the current \u00a7810.901 into these requirements. Because of changes to other standards, \u00a7810.901 applies in effect only to soybeans, therefore \u00a7810.S01 would be removed. A new \u00a7 810.607, Grade designation, (currently an undesignated heading) is proposed. Changes would be made to clarify wording and to conform to other grain standards. The current \u00a7 810.603 (b) and (c) would be redesignated as \u00a7 810.607 (a) and (b), reapectively. An undesignated heading, currently contained in \u00a7 810.603(d) is revised to read: SPECIAL GRADES, SPECIAL GRADE REQUIREMENTS, AND SPECIAL GRADE DESIGNIATIONS. The heading would be followed by two new sections, \u00a7 810.603, Specialgrades aid special grade requirements, and \u00a7 810.609, dasignations. This information is currently contained in \u00a7 810.603 (d) (1 and 2). The new wording and format for this section of the soybean standards would add clarity and conforms with other grain standards. As indicated above, \u00a7 810.901, \u00a7 810.902, and \u00a7 810.903 in the current standards would be removed and incorporated into other sections.4 0 JU5 Federal Register / Vol. 49,, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Proposed Rules 2. FGIS proposes to delete test weight per bushel as a grade-determining factor in, the standards for soybeans. The value of test weight per bushel has been questioned by producers as a critical test for soybeans. Other factors such as moisture content and the percentage of foreign material (which would include soybeans and pieces of soybeans smaller than %4 inch in diameter) also serve as indicators of light testweight per bushel soybeans. Producers state that discounts may be appliedfor all three factors-low test weight per bushel, high moisture content, and high foreign material. As proposed, test weight per bushel would continue to be shown on inspection certificates as required by regulations under the U.S. Grain Standards Act (\u00a7 800.162(a)(2)J. A revised definition of test weightper bushel is included in the proposed standards which conforms to wording found in other gram standards. Currently, test weight per bushel is expressed in whole and half pounds with a fraction of a half pound, disregarded. Since test weight per bushel would no longer be a grade- determining factor, it is proposed that test weight per bushel be expressed to the nearest tenth of a pound. 3. FGIS proposes that the current classes of soybeans be revised. The current soybean standards define classes for Yellow, Green, Brown, Black, and Mixed soybeans. While it is known that some black or brown soybeans are produced for special purposes, any detailed information on the production of grean, brown, or black soybeans is not available because of the crop size. Further, these soybeans are rarely offereed for official inspection. With the proposed revisions in soybean classes, two classes are defined-Yellow and Mixed soybeans. Under the proposed revision, green, brown, or black soybeans, or a mixture thereof, when exceeding 10% of the sample, Would be classed as Mixed soybeans. A new definition for soybeans of other colors would be added to the standards with the proposed revision. Soybeans of other colors would include black, brown, green, and bicolored soybeans. The percentage of yellow. soybeans. and the percentage of soybeans of other colors would follow the class designation on the inspection certificate, e.g., LLS, No. 2 Mixed soybeans, Yellow soybeans 80%, Soybeans of other colors, 20%. 4. FGIS proposes, for uniformity, to' include in the definition of U.S. Sample grade: the limits for stones, pieces of glass, cratalaria seeds, castorbeans, particles of an unknwnmforeignsubstance(s), rodentpellets, bird droppings, and animal filth. The limits of 8.or more stones (which have an aggregate weight in excess of 0.2 percent of the sample weight), ?, or more pieces of glass, 3 or more crotalaria seeds, 2 or more castor beans, 4 or more particles of an unknown substance(s), or a commonly recognized harmful or toxic substance(s), and 10 or more pieces of rodent pellets, bird droppings, or other animal filth, have been followed in the inspection process for many years, are contained in the FGIS Grain Inspection Handbook, and do not-constitute new limits. The-limits should be included to make the soybean standards conform to the format of other grain standards. 5. Footnotes would be updated to delete reference to the Inspection and EquipmentHandbooks as appropriate. Footnote 2 would be revised and references to footnotes 3 and 4 would be changed to footnote 2. Footnotes 3 and4 would be deleted. Comments including data, views, and arguments are solicited from interested persons. Pursuant to Section 4(b) of the United States Grain Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 76(b)), upon request, such information may he orally presented in an informal manner. Also, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act, no standards or amendments or re.vocations of standards-under the Act are to become effective less than one calendar year after promulgation, unless in the judgment of the Administrator the public health, interest, or safety require that they become effective. sooner.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The proposed action would revise the Standard Requirements for the production of Tetanus Toxoid and, Tetanus Antitoxin by changing the criteria for a valid test. The. current Standards require that the controls must die with clinical signs of tetanus. The proposed revision would provide for- terminating the test by euthanasia when the animals are manifesting clinical signs from which recovery is highly, improbable.

Paperwork Reduction Act - This proposed rule contains no new or amended recordkeeping, reporting or application requirements or any type of informatiQn collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Executive Order 12291 This proposed action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in Secretary's Memorandum No. 1512-1 to implement Executive Order 12291 andihas.been.classified, as-a\"Nonmajor Rule.\" This proposed rule would not have a significant effect on the economy and would not result in a major increase in costs-or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local govenment agencies, or geographic regions; or-significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability. of the United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign- based enterprises, m domestic or export markets. In addition, this proposed rule is the result of a cyclical review of 9 CFR. 113.99 and 113.251. This review is required by Executive Order 12291. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Mr. Bert W. Hawkins, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, has determined that this action would not result in, am adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small. entities are defined as independently owned firms not dominant in the field otveterinary biologics manufacturing. Alternatives The alternatives considered are:1. Do not amend the current: regulations. This would continue the procedure in which test animals must linger until death for a valid test. 2. Amend the current regulations to allow for use of specific clinical signs as a criteria for a valid test. This not only conserves time but is also a more humane method of conducting required tests. This alternative is selected. Background The present Standard Requirements for Tetanus Toxoid and'Tetanus Antitoxin provide for each serial to be potency tested in guinea pigs, For a test to be valid, the control animals must die with clinical signs of tetanus described in the Standard Requirements, The' National Veterinary Services Laboratories has analyzed data acuinulated over a period of 3 years including results of 69 tests. These data were evaluated to determine If the tests could have been terminated when controls developed specific clinical signs of tetanus without altering the validity of the test system. The results showed that the final outcome would not have changed if judged by the criteria of these proposed revisions. Therefore, it is proposed to amend 9 CFR 113,99(c)(4) and 113,251(d)(6) to allow for terminating the tests by euthanasia after the development of specific definitive clinical signs. Other changes are proposed. to clarify and update the regulations. In 9 CFR 1.13.99(c), \"adult\" is deleted and a weight range is added. A correction Is made to reflect that \"each dilution of pooled serum\" is used. This is consistent with the requirements in 9 CFR 113.251 and accepted international standards for Tetanus Toxoid and Tetanus Antitoxin. In 9 CFR 113.251(d), the period of observation has been changed from \"approximately 95 hours\" to \"0 to 120 hours.\" In the last sentence of \u00a7 113.251(d)(4), \"expected unit value\" Is changed to \"labeled unit value, one dilution at 10 percent above and one dilution at 20 percent above.\" This change is consistent with \u00a7 113,251(a)(2) of this part. It assures an adequate number of units in all final containers of Tetanus Antitoxin throughout a dating period. This is the common practice used in the industry to establish dating at I year and 3 years, respectively. Other minor changes in wording have been made to clarify and update these Standards withoul.changing the meaning or intent of the regulations. List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 113 Animal biologics.49478 Federal Register / VoL 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1934 / Proposed Rules PART 113-STANDARD REQUIREMqENTS Section 113.99 paragraph (c) would be revised to read: \u00a7 113.99 Tetanus Toold. (c) Potency test. Bulk or final container samples of completed product from each serial shall be tested for potency. A group of at least 10 guinea pigs, consisting of an equal number of males and females weighing 500 grams \u00b110 percent shall each be injected subcutaneously with 0.4 of the dose recommended on the label for a horse. (1) Six weeks after injection all surviving guinea pigs shall be bled and equal portions of serum, but not less than 0.5 ml from each, shall be pooled. Serum from not less than eight animals shall be used. (2) The pooled serum shall contain at least 2.0 Antitoxin Units (A.U.) per nil as determined by titrating it in the manner prescribed for Tetanus Antitoxin in 9 CFR 113.251. A 1.10 and a 1:20 dilution of the serum shall be made. The dilutions shall be held at 20 to 25 =C for 30 minutes prior to combining with a test dose of Standard Toxin. The test dose of Standard Toxin shall be mixed in proper proportion with each dilution of pooled serum, incubated at 20 to 25 \u00b0C for I hour and injected subcutaneously into two guinea pigs weighing between 340 and 380 grams. (3) The test dose of the Standard Toxin shall be verified against 0.1 of a unit of Standard Antitoxin in two guinea pigs weighing 340 to 380 grams which serve as control animals. (4) Controls shall be observed until they are down and are unable to rise or stand under their own power. At this time they are euthanized and the time of death is recorded in hours. For a valid test the controls must reach this point with clinical signs of tetanus within 24 hours of each other and within an overall time of 60 to 120 hours. The clinical signs to be observed are increased muscle tonus, curvature of the spine, asymmetry of the body outline when the resting animal is viewed from above, generalized spastic paralysis, particularly of the extensor muscles, inability to rise from a smooth flat surface when the animal is placed on its side, or any combination of these signs. If the control guinea pigs do not respond in this manner, the test is invalid and shall be repeated. In a valid test, if the titer is at least 2.0 A.U. per ml, the serial is satisfactory. If the titer is at least 1.0,but less than 2.0 A.U. per ml, the retest provided for by paragraph (c)[5) of this section may be conducted. If the titer is less than 1.0 A.U. per ml, the serA is unsatisfactory and may not be rctcstcd. (5) Serials with titers of at least 1.0 A.U. per ml, but less than .0 A.U. per ml in the initial test may b- retested, but if the retest is not conducted the serial is unsatisfactory. The retest shall be conducted in the same manner as the initial test except that at least '0.0gnea pigs, consisting of an equal number of males and females weighing M, grams \u00b14.10 percent, shall be used as vaccinates and serum from not less than 18 animals shall be pooled for the toxin- antitoxin titration. In the retest, the pooled serum from vaccinated guinea pigs is diluted 1:25. If the retest titer is less than 2.5 A.U. per ml, the serial is unsatisfactory. Section 113.251, paragraph (d) would be revised to read: \u00a7 113.251 Tetanus Antitoxin. (d) Potency test Bulk or final container samples of completed product from each serial shall be assayed to calculate the units of Tetanus Antitodn in each final container. A comparative toxin-antitoxin neutralization test shall be conducted using a standard ant;toxin and a standard toxin. All dilutions shall be made in M/15 phosphate buffered (p-) 7.4 physiological saline with 0.2 percent gelatin. (1) One ml of the Standard Antitoxin shall be diluted before use so the final volume contains 0.1 unit per ml. The dilution shall be held at 20 to 25 \u00b0C for 30 minutes prior to combination vith a test dose of toxin. (2) The Standard To: .in test dose is that amount which wbcn mixed with 0.1 unit of Standard Antitoxin. incutated at 20 to 25 \u00b0C for 1 hour, and injected subcutaneously into a 340 to 309 gram guinea pig, results in death of that guinea pig within 60 to 120 hours with clinical signs of tetanus. The toxin shall be diluted so the test dose shall be in 2.0 ml. (3) A mixture of diluted Standard Toxin and diluted Standard Antitodn shall be made so that 0.1 unit of antitoxin in I ml is combined with a test dose of toxin. This Standard Toin- Antitoxin mixture shall be held at 20 to 25 ' C for I hour before injections of guinea pigs are made. (4) A sample from each serial of antitoxin shall be prepared as was the Standard Toxin-Antitoxin mixture,encept the amount of antitoxin shall be based on an estimation of the expected potency. The final titration shall include a test at the labeled unit value, one dilution at 10 percent above and one dilution at 20 percent above. (5) Normal guinea pigs weighing within a range of 340 to 393 garams shall be used. Przjnant gdin.a piga must not be used. (i) Each of the two guinea pigs (controls) shall be injected subcutaneously with a 3 ml dose of the Standard Toxin-Antitoxin mixture. Injections shall be made in the same order that to.In is added to the dilutions of antitoxins. These shall be obs-eved parallel r.ith the titration of one or moze unImovwn antitodns. (ii) Two guinea pigs shall be used as test animals for each of three dilutions of the unlmovn antitoxin. A 3.0 ml dose shall be injected subcutaneously into each animal. (6) Controls shall be observed until they are down and are unable to rise or stand under their ovn power. At this time they are euthanized and the time of death is recorded in hours. For a satisfactory test, the controls must reach this point with clinical signs of tetanus within 24 hours of each other and within an overall time of 60 to 120 hours. The clinical signs to be observed are increased muscle tonus, curvature of the spine, asymmetry of the bady outline when the resting animal is viewed from above, generalized spastic paralysis, particularly of the extensor mu.-les. inability to rise from a smooth surface when the animal is placed on its side, or any combination of these signs. If the control guinea pigs do not respond in this manier, the entire test shall be repeated. (7) Potency of a new antitoxin is determined by finding the mixture which will protect the test animal the same as the to:in-antitoxdn mi:ture. Test animals dying sooner than the controls indicate the unit value selected in that dilution was not present, whereas those living longer indicate a greater unit value.

ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This notice proposes a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would require modification of the slat position indicating system on certain'McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 and KC-10A airplanes. This action is prompted by reports of rejected takeoffs due to slat disagree indications during the takeoff roll. A study conducted b the manufacturer has revealed that the tolerances for the outboard slats which induce these disagree indications, are too narrow and are causing unnecessary rejected takeoffs at high speed. Widening the tolerances for the outboard slats will eliminate unnecessary rejected takeoffs without compromising safety. DATES: Comments must be received no later than February 11, 1985. ADDRESSES: The applicable service information may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, 3855 Lakewood Boulevard, Long Beach, California 90846, Attention: Director, Publications and Training, C1-750 (54- 60). This information also may be examined at the FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, 17900 Pacific Highway South, Seattle, Washington, or at 4344 Donald Douglas Drive, Long Beach, California. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Eugene F. Huettner, Aerospace Engineer, Systems & Equipment Branch, ANM-130L, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 4344 Donald Douglas Drive, Long Beach, California 90808; telephone (213) 548-2831. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:. Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications - should identify the regulatory docket number and be submitted in duplicate to the address specified under the caption \"AVAILABILITY OF NPRM.\" Allcommunications received on or before the closing date for comments specified above will be considered by the Administrator before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for-comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Availability of NPRM Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, Office of the Regional Counsel, Attention: Airworthiness Rules Docket No. 84-NM- 110-AD, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168. Discussion During the past several years, six operators have experienced seven instances of slat disagree indications due to slat mechinical movement occurring during the takeoff roll. These slat disagree indications resulted in rejected takeoffs, some at high speeds. A study conducted by the manufacturer has revealed that the disagree indications have been caused by the outboard slat surfaces experiencing aerodynamic loads during, takeoff which cause the outboard slats to extend slightly beyond the takeoff tolerance band of the slat indication system. These tolerances are too narrow and are causing unnecessary rejected takeoffs at .high speed. Modifying the targets and sensors of the outboard slats will widen the tolerance band, reduce slat disagree indications during takeoff, and eliminate unnecessary rejected takeoffs without compromising safety. The FAA has determined that incorporation of McDonnell Douglas Service Bulletin 27-195 is necessary to decrease the potential for slat disagree indications occurring during takeoff. These proposed modifications would provide more reliable operation of the slat indication system and reduce the potential for unnecesary rejected takeoffs at high speeds. Cost Estimate. It is estimated that 160 U.S. registered airplanes would be affected by this NPRM, that it would take approximately 12 manhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor costs would be $40 per manhour. The costs of modification parts areestimated to be $482 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators would be $153,920. For these reasons, the proposed rule is not considered to be a major rule under the criteria of Executive Order 12291. Few if any, small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act would be affected. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Aviation safety, Aircraft. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend \u00a7 39.13 of Part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) by adding the following new airworthiness directives: McDonnell Douglas: Applies to McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 and KC.-10A airplanes, certified in all categories which are listed in McDonnell Douglas Service Bulletin 27-195, NEW, dated Juno 25,1984. Compliance Is required by January 1, 1988, unless previously accomplished. To minimize the potential operational hazard associated with unnecessary rejected takeoffs caused by slat'disagree indications, resulting from too narrow tolerances, accomplish the following: A. Modify the targets and sensors of the outboard slats in accordance with McDonnell Doulgas DC-10 Service Bulletin 27-195, NEW, dated June 25,1984, or later revisions approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region. B. Alternate means of compliance which provide an equivalent level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region. C. Special flight permits may be Issued In accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21,199 to operate airplanes to a base in order to comply with the requirements of this AD.

The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to \u00a7 71.123 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) to alter the descriptions of several airways by deleting all alternate route designations, renumbering some airway segments and revoking airwaysegments that are not required. This action supports our agreement vith ICAO to eliminate all alternate route designations from the National Airspace System. Section 71.123 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in Handbook 74C0.6 dated January 3.1934. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally currenL It, therefore--l) is not a \"major rule\" under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a\"sigificant rule\" under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 20,1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: At the request of the South Carolina Department of Highways and Public Transportation, the Coast Guard is considering a change to the regulations governing the State Road 544 bridge of Socastee, mile 371. Horry County, South Carolina, by permitting the number of openings to be limited during certain periods. This proposal is being made because periods of peak vehicular traffic have increased. This action should accommodate the needs of vehicular traffic and still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation. DATE: Comments must be received on or before February 4, 1985. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Commander (oan), Seventh Coast Guard District, 51 SW., 1st Avenue, Miami, Florida 33130. The comments and other materials referenced in this notice will be available for inspection and copying at 51 SW., 1st Avenue, Room 816, Miami, Florida. Normal office hours are between 7:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, except holidays. Comments may also be hand-delivered to this address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Walt Paskowsky, Bridge Administration Specialist telephone (305) 350-4108. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Interested-persons are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written views, comments,data, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify the bridge, and give reasons for concurrence with or any recommended change in the proposal, Persons desiring acknowledgement that their comments have been received should enclose a stamped, self- addressed postcard or envelope. The Commander, Seventh Coast Guard District, will evaluate all communications received and determine a course of final action on this proposal. The proposed regulations may be changed in light of comments received. Drafting Information The drafters of this notice are Mr. Walt Paskowsky, Bridge Administration Specialist, Project Officer, and Lieutenant Commander Ken Gray, project attorney. Discussion of Proposed Regulations Vehicular traffic across the bridge during the summer months from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays, averaged 4156 vehicles in August 1980, as compared to an average of 5025 vehicles for the same period in August 1983, an increase of 35%. Vehicular traffic across the bridge during the winter months from 7 am. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, averaged 0232 vehicles in February 1980, as compared to an average of 8275 vehicles for the same period in November 1983, an increase of 33%. The major portion of the vehicular traffic crossing the bridge in the summer is recreationaly oriented, while the majority of the traffic crossing the bridge in the winter is commuter oriented. Marine traffic through the draw follows a different pattern with 55% of the bridge openings occuring during 4 months of the year in the spring and fall reflecting the seasonal migration of vessels to and from southern waters. Accordingly, regulations are being proposed for these months since this is the period when vessel movements have the greatest impact on vehicular traffic. Economic Assesment and Certification These proposed regulations are considered to be non-major under Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulation and nonsignificant under the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979). The economic impact of this proposal is expected to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. We conclude this because the proposal will exempt regulary scheduled cruise vessels andI I I49482 Federal Register I Vol. 49, No. 246 /-Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Proposed Rules tugs with tows. Since the economic ippact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges. Proposed Regulations In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard proposes to amend Part 117 of Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, by redesignating paragraphs (a) (b) and (c) of \u00a7 117.911 as paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), without change, and by adding a new \u00a7 117.911(a) to read as follows: PART 117-DRAWBRIDGE OPERATION REGULATIONS \u00a7 117.911 Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Little River to Savannah River. (a] The draw of the Socastee (SR-544) bridge across the AIWW, mile 371, at Socastee shall open on signal except from 1 April through 30 June and 1 October through 30 November from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal holidays, the draw need only be opened on the hour, 20 minutes after the hour, and 40 minutes after the hour if any vessels are waiting to pass. From 1 May through 30 June and I October through 31 October from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays, the draw need only be opened on the hour, 20 minutes after the hour and 40 minutes after the hour if any vessels are waiting to pass.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposal would amend the regulation implementing statutory provisions on the mailing of solicitationsin the guise of bills, invoices, or statements of account It would clarify an existing regulation by removinJ possible ambiguity. It would also foreclose a potentially deceptive technique used by some mailers to render less obvious a required warning regarding the true nature of their solicitations.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: George C. Davis, (202) 245-4385. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under 39 U.S.C. 3001(d) and implementing postal regulations, solicitations in the guise of bills, invoices, or statements of account are \"nonmailable\" unless certain warnings are printed on the face of the solicitation making it clear that the solicitations are merely offers and not bills that have to be paid. These regulations require warnings to be displayed in capital letters of a color prominently contrasting with the background against which they appear. These regulations also specify alternative locations for the warnings. The regulations regarding one alternative location require the varning to be centered diagonally across the face of the solicitation. Recent litigation involving this regulation sup,\"ested that the rule is ambiguous and that the mailer is free to print the warning horizontally on the center of the invoice. Also, some recent solicitations resembling invoices have surrounded the required warning with printed matter so similar in style and size of type to the warning as to \"camouflage\" the warning and render it less conspicuous to the consumer. Although we believe the current regulations form a basis for challenge of these practices under 39 U.S.C. 2001(d) and the false representation law (39 U.S.C. 3005), the adoption of a revised regulation is the most effective method of curtailing the proliferation of these practices. The proposed revisions would specify and illustrate diagrammatically the alternative diagonal placement of the warning and would specify that the required warning may not besurrounded by words or sy mbols which detract from its conspicuousness. In view of the considerations discussed above, the Postal Service invites comments on the following proposed revisions of the Domestic Mail Manual, incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations. See 39 CFR 111.1. List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 1 Postal Service.

Such a conference is iequired by Section 320 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to be held every three years. The purpose of the third conference is to provide a forum for public review and comment on proposed revisions to the Guideline on Air Quality Models. DATE: The Conference will be held on January 29, 30, and 31, 1985 (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday) from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on January 29 and 30; 9:00 am to Noon on January 31.

S. Touna, phone (919) 541-5681. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: To standardize air quality modeling practices within such programs as prevention of significant deterioration (PSD), Section 320 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 states that a conference on air quality modeling is to be held every three years to address appropriate air quality modeling necessary to carry out regulatory requirements. The first conference held in December 1977 addressed EPA's proposed modeling guideline and was devoted almost exclusively to PSD discussions. The result was the \"Guideline on Air Quality Models\" (EPA-450/2-78--027) which provides guidance on the selection and apjilication of air quality models. Such models are required for evaluating StateImplementation Plans, making new source reviews, assessing PSD proposals and otherwise estimating source receptor relationships. The second conference in August 19B1 was an open forum to address model accuracy and the incorporation of model uncertainty in regulatory decision-making. The third conference will again address EPA's- modeling guidance because substantial new knowledge concerning modeling analyses has been developed since the original guideline was issued. Revised guidance is needed to improve the basis for air quality impact assessments and to insure that the current state-of-the-art with respect to air quality models and data bases is represented. As a basis for revising the Guideline on Air Quality Models and for holding this conference, EPA has conducted in- house workshops which included Regional Office, research and headquarters staffs. Furthermore, EPA has entered into a cooperative agreement with the American Meteorological Society (AMS) to obtain input from the scientific community on resolving issues raised at previous public meetings and conferences. Also, a procedure for including new models in the guideline, as noticed rn the Federal Register, Vol. 45, No. 61 March 27,1980, was iiitiated and about 30 models have been received. Based onthe results of these activities, EPA is proposing revisions to the guideline and is soliciting comments through this conference. This conference is serving jointly as a public hearing on proposed amendments to EPA regulations which appear at 40 CFR 51.24 and 52.21. The amendments relate to using air quality models and substituting by reference the revisea guideline for the oiginal 1978 version. EPA has previpusly issued a notice (see 49 FR 48018-48021, December 7, 1984). on a Public hearing concerning these amendments. The conference will begin with an opening day summary on applicable CAA requirements and issues concerning consistency in modeling. Reports on the plans and accomplishments of EPA's cooperative agreement with the AMS and on other major EPA programs concerning model evaluation will be presented. Status reports on research programs of the electric Power Research Institute and of EPA will also be presented. On the afternoon of the first day, there will be briefings by EPA officials on the Agency's rsponse to previous public comments and on the proposed revised guideline. To conclude the day, representatives of the APCA Meteorology Committee will discusstechnical issues associated with air quality modeling. On the second day, the conference will begin with statements from the National Academy of Sciences, appropriate Federal agencies including the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Bureau of Standards and others. Statements by representatives of State and local air quality management agencies will follow. Following these presentations, the conference will be opened to statements and comments from the general public. EPA solicits advice and comment especially on the following items: (1) Specific changes to 40 CFR Parts 51 and 52; (2) the revised format of the modeling guideline; (3) recommendations concering models for ozone; (4) proposed changes to the preferred models; (5) how performance evaluations can be improved for models, particularly photochemical ozone models (i.e., EKMA for which adequate evalaution data bases are not available); (6) specific quantitative procedures for relating air quality standards and PSD increments to emission limitations through the use of mathematical models that include statistical techniques to deal with uncertainty; (7) the degree to which individual State or local regulatory agencies, within the context to Clean Air Act regulatory requirements, should be provided more (or less] authority to use air quality models which have not been reviewed and approved by EPA; and (8) If regulatory agencies are provided additional authority to use other air quality models, what degree of oversight or approval authority should be retained by EPA. In order to assist the Agency In preparing for the conference, persons planning to attend are asked to notify the Agency by mail or phone a0,tthe address or phone number given In the \"Further Information\" section above no later than ten (10) days prior to the meeting date, Such persons should identify the organization (if any) on whose behalf they are entering a statement and the date(s) of attendance. If a presentation is projected to be longer than 15 minutes, the presenter should also state why it needs to be longer. Persons failing to submit a written notice but desiring to speak at the conference should notify the presiding officer immediately before the meeting and will be scheduled on a time-available basis.

L 9D-448), 42 U.S.C. 4 11-4128. and 44 CFR 67.4 (a)). These base (1(0-year) flood elevations are the basis for the flood plain management measures that the community is required to either adopt or show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These modified elevations will also be used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings and their contents and for the second layer of insurance on existing buildings and their contents. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 USC 605(b), the Administrator, to whom authority has been delegated by the Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency, hereby certifies that the proposed flood elevation determinations, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A flood elevation determination under section 1363 forms the basis for new local ordinances, which, if adopted by a local community, will govern future construction within the floodplain area. The elevation determinations, however. impose no restriction unless and until the local community voluntarily adopts floodplain ordinances in accord with these elevations. Even if ordinances are adopted in compliance with Federal standards, the elevations prescribe how high to build in the floodplain and do not proscribe development. Thus, this action only forms the basis for future local actions. It imposes no newrequirement; of itself it has no economic impact. List of Subjects ! 44 CR Prt 67 Flood insurance, Flood plains.

These base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the flood plain management measures that the community is required to either adopt or show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).These modified elevations will also be used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings and their contents and for the second layer of insurance on existing buildings and their contents. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator, to whom authoritihas been delegated by the Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency, hereby certifies that the prol3bsed flood elevation determinations, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A flood elevation determination under section 1363 forms the basis for new local ordinances, which, if adopted by a local community, will govern future construction within the floodplain area. The elevation determinations, however, impose no restriction unless and until the local community voluntarily adopts floodplain ordinances m accord with these elevations. Even if ordinances are adopted in compliance with Federal standards, the elevations prescribe how high to build in the floodplain and do not proscribe development. Thus, this action only forms the basis for future 'local actions. It imposes no newrequirement; of itself it hs no economic impact. List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 67 Flood insurance, Flood plains.

The effects of alternative land use allocations for 17 roadless areas inventoried in the second Roadless Area Review and Evaluation (RARE II, FEIS, January 1979) weredisclosed in DEIS Appendix M. On August 24,1984, the EPA published a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register (Vol. 49. No. ICU, pg. 33722). A 90-day public review and comment period was closed on November 29, 1984. Although we believe the effect of the wilderness decision on the analyses disclosed in the DEIS is minor, a Supplement will be issued to document principal changes as a result of the wilderness decision. Additionally. *because the question of \"wilderness suitability\" (Planning question 7. pg. 1- 10, DEIS) is no longer within the scope of the analysis of the DEIS. those commenting on the DEIS may wish to change, revise, or refocus their comments. Changes to the DEIS, documented in the Supplement, resulting from not analyzing wilderness suitability will be reflected in the Forest plan and final EIS. For example, outputs and effects such as recreation and vilderness will change. Documentation of the roadless area reanalyses in the DEIS, including Appendix M, is no longer within the scope of the DEIS and will be removed from the frmal EIS. Additionally. alternative I and J, originally included to insure a full range of wilderness suitability alternatives, will be removed in the final ElS. To insure ample time to comment on these changes, we are providing an additional 90 day comment period. Please send your comments to the Forest Supervisor, 196;9 South Sheridan Ave.. Sheridan, Wyoming 82801. To be addressed in the final EIS. comments on the draft documents must be received by midnight March 28,1985. All comments received during the initial 90 day comment period which ended on November 26, 1034, will be addressed in the final EIS. Feel free. however, to change or revise your comments based on the Supplement or other information. We are also sponsoring two public advisory hearings to provide an opportunity for oral comment to the Forest Service concerning the proposed plan, DEIS and SupplemenL The first hearing will be held on January 23,1933 at the Elks Lodge No. 1431 located at 622 Greybull Avenue. Greybul. Wyoming. The second hearing will be on January 24,1985 in the convention center of theHoliday Inn Holidome. 1809 Sugarland. Sheridan. Wyoming.

After an introduction by the Forest Service, oral and/or written comments may be presented. A verbatim record of all oral comments will be kept which all become part of the comments on the Proposed Plan. DEIS and Supplement. To insure full participation by the public, some ground rules have been established for the conduct of the hearing; 1. Each speaker will be limited to 5 minutes for an oral presentation. This time may be adjusted at the hearing to insure that everyone has an opportunity to make a presentation. 2. Persons may pre-register to speak at the hearings by contacting the receptionist at the Forest Supervisor's Office by phone (307) 672-0751. in ,riting, or by a personal visit.

A revised Notice of Intent was published in the Federal Register on August 25, 1983. The August 1983 notice indicated that the analysis in the draft 'EIS would disclose the environmental consequences of wilderness and nonwilderness management for the areas of the Shoshone National Forest which were inventoried in the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation (USDA Forest Service, RARE II FEIS, January 1979). Subsequent to the August 1983 notice appearing in the Federal Register, Congress passed the Wyoming Wilderness Act. The President signed it into law (Pub. L. 98-550) on October 30, 1984. There is one new wilderness on the Shoshone National Forest (the Pope Agie). There are additions to the Fitzpatrick, Washakie, and Beartooth- Absaroka Wilderness, and one Wilderness Study Area (the High Lakes). The status of the Dunoir Special Management Unit was not changed and provisions of Pub. L. 92-476 will still apply. The Act states that the wilderness attributes of the Study Area be protected until the next round of Forest Planning. All other roadless areas on the Shoshone National Forest were released for nonwilderness uses. Therefore, the analysis described in the August f983 notice will not be performed as the re-evaluation of roadless areas is no longer within the scope of the EIS. Thd proposed Forest Plan and draft EIS will be released for public review and comment in Spring 1985.

Consideration of this motion to except Piher International Corp. is still continuing, and it has now applied for an extension of its authorization to mahe certain exports, asserting that failure to obtain the extension will entail serious economic hardship.

This category part covers TSUSA Nos. 383.1305,383.2507,383.5234, 383.5810,383.6310 and 383.7724. U.S. imports of this category part from Thailand were only 157 dozen in 1982 and 246 dozen in 1983. Imports of commercial quanties began m April 1984 when 1,095 dozen were entered. Imports for the April-June 1984 quarter from Thailand were 1,592 dozen and for the July-September quarter, 10,883 dozen. This was a quarter-to- quarter increase of 584 percent. The sudden and sharp increase of imports of Category 438 pt. from Thailand threatens to disrupt the U.S. market for women's, girls'. and infants' wool knit blouses. The U.S. market for Category 438pt- increased significantly in 1983 from the recession year of 1982. Imports, including those from Thailand. absorbed this increase and also took away part of the market supplied by our domestic maufacturers. The result was a decline in domestic production. January-September 1984 imports were in excess of total 1983 imports and were up 81 percent from the same period in 1983. This import growth will again exceed market growth and the domestic industry's share of the market will, decline in 1984.The U.S. industry is fragmcnted with msny relatively small firms which are threatened by an import rise in this category. Domestic production of Category 43Opt. declined by 20.5 percent in 1933 to 178.003 dozen from 224,00 dozen In 1S2. Imports, on the other hand. increased by 32.7 percent from 422,001) dozen to 50,00M dozen. The ratio of imports to domestic production climbed from 18.4 percent in 192 to 314.0 percent in 1933. It will be high-r in 1C-24 due to the further sharp ncrease in ltworts. December 17, 134.

Uruguay-Market Statement Category 434-Men's and Boy's Wool Coats, Excluding Suit-Type Coats November 1984. U.S. imports of Category 434 from Uruguay- amounted to 10,238 dozen during the year ending September 1984, nearly six and one- half times the quantity imported a year earlier. Imports for the first nine months of 1984 were 8,003 dozen compared with 1,576 dozen imported during the same period in 1983. Uruguay was the fourth largest supplier during the year ending September 1984, accounting for 10.6 percent of the total imports. These imports from Uruguay are disrupting the market for Category 434 and the sharp increases, if continued, threaten more serious disruption. U.S. production of Category 434 has trended downward for a number of years. Production in 1983 was 315,000 dozen the lowest level on record and down 13.7 percent from 1982. Imports also trended downward through 1981 but sharply increased during the 1982 and 1983 period and during the first nine months of 1984. Imports m 1983 were 60,000 dozen, up 71.4 percent from 1982 and 122.2 percent from 1981. Imports for the first nine months of 1984 were 76,000 dozen, 92.3 percent above the same period in 1983. The ratio of imports to domestic production Increased from 8.3 percent in 1981 to 19.1. percent in 1983. The 1984 ratio probably will be between 30 and 35 percent.

Plumb, Secretary. [FR Doc. 84-33181 Southern Union Gathering Co.; Petition for Declaratory Order December 14, 1984. Take notice that on September 21, 1984, Southern Union Gathering Company (Gathering Company), Post Office Box 26400, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87125, filed in Docket No. GP84- 55-000 a petition, pursuant to Rule 207, for a declaratory order clarifying the extent of Gathering Company's jurisdictional obligations, all as more fully set forth in the petition and the appendices thereto which are on file with the Commission. All interested members of the public are invited to inspect these documents. The petition states that Gathering Company was created in 1953 to gather natural gas in the San Juan Basin area of northwestern New Mexico in order tocontinue to supply, primarily, the markets of its affiliate, Gas Company of New Mexico (Gas Company), and, secondarily to sell what Gathering Company characterizes as \"excess volumes\" to interstate markets. Gathering Company further states that since that time it has met all requirements of Gas Company's Northwest New Mexico service territory as its primary market, and sold surplus supplies to El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso). Gathering Company states that these sales of surplus supplies to El Paso have been made pursuant to what it refers to as an\"excess gas sales contract\" (the Contract) and certificates of public convenience and necessity, in order to maintain ratable takes and avoid the incurrence of substantial penalty payments to producers for failure to take ratably. Gathering company maintains that the applications, certificates, and the Contract relating to the El Paso sale all recognize what Gathering Company characterizes as the limited nature of the underlying obligation to El Paso. Because of its view of the purpose and nature of the underlying authorizations, Gathering company believes that it can market surplus volumes not desired by El Paso through first sales to: (1) Gas Company, for resale to intrastate purchasers in New Mexico or to other interstate purchasers under Gas Company's Hinshaw certificate issued in Docket No. CP80-331-000; or (2) to any other interstate or intrastate purchasers (whether direct-sale or sale-for-resale customers), without having to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission or any abandonment authorization. Gathering Company is also seeIding a confirmation of its view as to the pricing implications vwhich vwould flow from a declaration' that only the volumes El Paso actually takes under the Contract are committed or dedicated by Gathering Company to interstate commerce. Gathering Company states that in order to assess adequately these pricing implications, it is necessary to analyze separately Gathering Company's sales to El Paso, to Gas Company, and to all others (the post- NGPA customers). As to the rate for Gathering Company's sales to El Paso under the Contract, Gathering Company states that the declaration requested wvill have no impact on the rate for Gathering Company's sales rate to El Paso. These sales are made at Gathering Company's system average cost of gas plus aCommission authorized gathering charge. The natural gas supplies at issue here are produced from wells in the San Juan Basin. that are connected to a natural gas gathering system owned and operated by Gathering Company. Gathering Company states that it is currently negotiating, with several prospective cutomers, who are interested in purchasing gas that is in excess of the requirements of Gas Company without the delays and uncertainty that are inherent in having, to obtain certificate or abandonment authorization from the Commission in order to sell gas. For all the reasons stated in the application, Gathering Company seeks a declaration that its certificates authorizing sales to El Paso do not require it to obtain certificate or abandonment authorization from the Commission in order to sell gas, which is excess to the requirements of Gas Company, in first sales to: (1) Gas Company. for resale to intrastate markets in New Mexico or to other purchasers under Gas Company's Hinshaw certificate; or (2) to any other intrastate or interstate purchasers. Gathering Company's contends that, under the Contract and the Commission's order vith respect to its sale to El Paso, as properly interpreted, no specific acreage or volumes were dedicated by Gathering Company, and that the only gas that ws dedicated to interestate commerce is that which is actually sold to El Paso as needed to maintain ratable takes. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this petition should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Commission, 825 North Capital Street. NE., Washington. D.C. 20426, in accordance vith the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (13 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before January 4.1935.

(Section 301(m)(1J(A)). B Both applicants have failed to demonstrate that the energy and environmental costs of'treatment would exceed the benefits by an unreasonable amount. (Section 301(m)(1J(B)). B Both applicants have established a program to monitor the impactof -their discharges. Since EPA proposes 'to deny the variances, we are not 'commenting on the sufficiency ofthe programs at this time. (Section 301(m)(1)(C)). * Both applicants have demonstrated that their respective proposed discharges will not result in 'any additional requirements on any other. point or non-point source. (Section 301(m)(1)(D)). * Neither -applicant plans to add new discharges or to increase existing discharges over the five-year permit period. (Section 301(m](1)(E)). -The 'hydrological andgeological characteristics of the receiving water are not sufficient to allow compliance with all the requirements of section 301(m). (Section 301(m)(1J(F)). * The applicants have established a program from researchand development in water pollution control technology and have made cleartheir intention to undertake a contractual obligation-to carry this program out upon issuance.ofa modified permit. Since EPA prqposes to deny the variances, we are not commenting on the sufficiency of the programs at this time. (Section 30,(m)(1{G)). * The applicants'have failed to demonstrate that the facts and circumstances present a unique situation which, if relief is granted, will not establish a precedent or the relaxation of the requirements of :this Act applicable to similarly situated discharges. (Section 301(m)(JllH)). & EPA has nqt made a determination on whether the granting of these variances would put the owner or operator of any similar'facility at a competitive disadvantage. ISection301(m)(1)(1)). e The effluent limitations proposed are not sufficient to implementall the applicable water quality standards. (Section2Ol0(m)(2)). * The proposed discharges do not impact anypublic water supplies. It appears, given limited ambient data and inconsistent sampling, that the proposed discharges do not interfere with the protection and propagationiof a balanced, indigenous population (BIP),of fish, shellfish, fauna, and wildlife. The discharges may, however,,discourage recreational activity on the water.(Section 301(n (2)). Detailed information on these findings is available in the Tentative Decision Documents. If EPA issues a final denial olthese variances, the State of California, a delegated NPDES state, will renew the NPDES discharge permits under which !the applicants are now operating. The new permits would have BPT/BCT effluent limitations. If EPA reverses its decision and issues a final approval of the variance, then EPA will issue the modified NPDES Permits with appropriate modified effluent limitations. Dated: December 14, 1984. Judith Docket No.79-187; FCC 84-567] AT&T Earnings-on Interstate and 21,1984. Released: December 11,1984. By4he Commission.1. This proceeding was initiated as a result of information that indicated that tariffs incorporating compensation to local exchange carriers, interexchange carriers, and AT&T, would result -in an earned rate of return for 1978'that would exceed the level authorized by the Commission.I At issue is whether the authorized rate of return for 1978 was exceeded, and if so, the remedial action that the Commission should lake. We conclude that the level of interstate revenues that was received by AT&T and the Bell System Companies thereinafter collectively referred to as \"AT&T\", unless the context indicates otherwise) during 1978 exceeded the authorized level by $101,000,000. We also establish a remedy by providing for reductions to prospective rates. In a forthcoming order, we -'will address the 1978 compensation that was received by non-AT&T/BOC carriers that was derived from inter:state tariffs that were filed by AT&T.2 I. Background 2. On January 19,1976, the Commission voted to prescribe 9,5 percent as the rate of return for AT&T's interstate and foreign services. The Commission also stated'that earnings equivalent to an additional 0.5-percent return on AT&T's interstate rate base woild be allowed as an incentive for increased productivity and efficiency. A written decision to this effect was released on'February 5, 1976,3 that stated that the Commission would \"not require any downward adjustment of AT&T's overall interstate rates provided its overall rate of return does not exceed 10 percent.\" AT&Tfiled tariff revisions on January 29,1976 that were represented as having been designed to produce the prescribed g.5 percent rate of return. The Commission suspended the xevised rAtes for one day -and subjected those rates to an accounting order. 3. With the increased rates in effect for only part of the year, AT&T reported an overall interstate rate of return of 'During 1978 AT&T iled monthly reports of interstate earnings that showed earnings ratios In excess of those that had been prescribed In Docket No.20376,57 FCC 2d 050 (1970].

AT&T's measurement of its earned rate of return increased to 9.59 percent. AT&T's Interstate Monthly Reports (\"IMR 1\"] for the first nine months of 1978 showed a cumulative annual rate of return of 10.42 percent. This prompted the Common Carrier Bureau to initiate an internal review of AT&T's earnings. On December 20,1978, the Acting Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau formally requested information from AT&T.4 In response to the Bureau Chief's letter, AT&T stated that its 1978 rate of return was 10.02 percent when calculated in accordance with the accounting changes concerning plant under construction that had been adopted in Phase H of Docket No. 19129.s It also stated that changes in economic conditions since the 1976 prescription justified an increased earnings levels 4. AT&T's MR 1 dated January 22, 1979 for calendar year 1978 showed a 10.22 percent rate of return on AT&T's interstate and foreign services.7The Acting Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau subsequently asked AT&T to explain the difference between the 10.02 percent figure cited in its letter of January 19,1979 and to 10.22 percent figure shown on the RMR 1 which was dated January 22 1979.8 AT&T stated that the 10.02 percent figure for 1978 had been calculated in accordance with accounting rules for interest during construction that actually were not scheduled to become effective until January 1,1979. AT&T further stated that it had used this measure of rate of return because it appeared to be a better 4Letter to William R. Stump, American Telephone and Telegraph Company. from the Acting Chief.

At the time of the Bureau Clhe's letter, AT&T had a petition before the Commission that subsequently was approved ata public meeting on December 2L 1978.

On September18, 1979, the Commission adopted a Notice of Inquiryin this proceeding to examine the policy and eamins3 measurement issues that had arisen from AT&T's 1978 interstate operations. We requested comments on five issues: (1) Is review of AT&T's earnings on a calendar year basis appropriate in determining whether AT&T has complied with a rate of return prescription? (2) If a calendar year assessment is not appropriate, what interval should be used? (3) Mhat is the correct measurement of AT&T's earned rate of return during 1978? (4) Has AT&T exceeded its prescribed rate of return, and if so, by what dollar amount? (5) What remedial action should the Commission take if AT&T's earned rate of return has exceeded the prescribed level?10 6. Comments in response to those issues were filed by AT&T, the United States Independent Telephone Association (USITA), the United States Office of Consumer Affairs (USOCA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group (Massachusetts PIRG). Joint Comments were filed by the National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, the Consumer Federation of America, the Missouri Public Interest Research Group, and the Califomia Department of Consumer Affairs, (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"NCCB\"}. AT&T opposed refundin, any revenues that resulted in earnings in excess of 10.0 percent. 7. AT&T argued, inter aela, that the Commission did not have autlorty to order refunds of 1978 revenues. AT&T also contended that if the Commic.lon had legal authority to order rcEundo, refunds were not warranted as a matter of discretion given AT&T's earnings history and then edsting conditions in the financial marlvlts. In addition, AT&T stated tfiat its 1978 rate of return for all interstate services was not the 10 .-2 percent shown for 1978 on the IR 1 but rather 10.09 percent becauze the IWR I reflected only the revenues, eypcnz:s, and investment that were associated with services provided at uniform Mietter to Clut, Common Ca nrlJrcau, fwm William R. Stump. any refund of AT&T's 1978 revenues, arguing that the Commission only has authority to prescribe actual rates, not a rate of return. In addition. USITA contended that the reasonableness of a given rate of return varies with changin, economic and financial conditions. .GSA supported refunding those revenues that caused AT&T's 1978 earnings to exceed a 10.0 percent rate of return. USOCA also supported refunds after having noted that the Commission's 1976 prescription Decision had placed AT&T on notice that 10.0 percent was the maximum allowable rate of return. Both GSA and USOCA argued that 10.22 percent was the correct figure for AT&T's 1978 earned rate of return. NCCB also supported refunds, but stated that the amount of the overage should be determined through evidentiary hearings. The Massachusetts PIRG fied a letter suggesting that AT&T's 1978 earnings in excess of 10.0 parcent be used to establish a consumer action group to monitor AT&T. 9. AT&T, GSA. USOCA, and NCCB filed reply comments. AT&T argued that GSA. USOCA. and NCCB had failed to discuss the central issue in the case, erroneously assuming that the 10.0 percent figure constituted a ceiling for AT&T's rate of return despite changing economic conditions. Responding to this contention. GSA. USOCA. and NCCB argued that a rate of return prescription remains binding until changed by the Commission after a full hearing.12 Vc.-cetl %-.a 5awI by AT&T hart3t te H ;efatu-al Gas COaI tO ae .11. at C .US 0CA al:s ,:!;:v t at tP ore f m ye o~reg We th UTA Ye U SiTA ct k 2 c : c a z hn:I re.cF rn a' of r c:=n cf a ca e -- cz hr. = on e b a are,: 4 t ct h ai fEA Y C bC.:u,2 it 13 0ly \" ai t eebr2.13 oie49503 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices II. Discussion A. Assessment of Measurements of A T&T's 1978 Interstate Rate of Return 10. Including its comments in this proceeding, AT&T has provided five earned rate of return figures for 1978. The Interstate Monthly Report No. 1 (\"IMR 1\"), that AT&T filed with this Commission as its statement of earnings on interstate and foreign operations, reported that AT&T's earned rate of return for the calendar year ending December 31, 1978, was 10.22 percent. On June 29, 1979, AT&T submitted a \"1978 Annual FDC Report\" that stated that AT&T's 1978 earned rate of return on its interstate and foreign services was 10.1 percent. On November 13, 1979, AT&T filed comments stating that the 10.1 percent was really 10.09 percent.' 3 The 10.02 percent measurement was supplied by AT&T on January 19, 1979, in a letter from Mr. William R. Stump to the then Acting Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau which Mr. Stump further clarified by a letter to the Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau dated May 3, 1979. 11. The five different figures that AT&T provided are based upon three 3ssentially -separate concepts. The IMR I stated that the earned rate of return was 10.22 percent. AT&T's 1978 FDC 7 Report, which was based upon data for he month of June 1978, stated that the ,arned rate of return was 10.09 percent :or 10.1 percent). AT&T also contended hat the preceding measurements should )e reduced by twenty basis points (0.20 ercent) to reflect the Commission's lecisions in Phase II of Docket No. L9129. We reject this later adjustment of wenty basis points for reasons that have been expressed in our decisions in other proceedings.14 corporate reporting requirements (including annual reports to shareholders) are based upon the fiscal year, with the consequence that the adoption of the fiscal year for assessments of AT&T's earned rate of return would assist investors, the public, and overnmental entities ih reviewing AT&T's (perating results on a consistent basis. Accordingly. ice AT&T's 1978 fiscal year was coincident with I le calendar year, we conclude that we will confine ( ur analysis to those issues that are raisedby (arnings that were achieved during AT&Ts fiscal ear ending December 31, 1978. is In the second footnote on page 43 of AT&T's (omments, AT&T stated: \"Itlhe 10.1 percent was a i )unding of a 10.09 percent, so that the excess is nly 9 basis points.\" 14 At this point it is sufficient to note that we I ave already ruled upon this matter. See lemorandum Opinion and Order In the Matter of 'he American Telephone and Telegraph Company Z FCC 2d 1 (1979), and the discussion contained in ppendix A, infra.12. We thus turn to the adjustments that were made to the 10.22 percent reported in the December, 1978, IMR 1 to arrive at the 10.09 percent that AT&T submitted in its \"1978 Annual FDC Report\" as its earned rate of return for 1978. By transmittal letter dated June 29, 1979, AT&T filed a \"1978 Annual FDC Report.\" That report, which relied upon data for the month of June, 1978, purported to show the rate of return that AT&T had earned during the 1978 calendar year on each of its interstate services. Volume 2 of that report developed a \"recast\" of the IMR 1 that revised AT&T's December, 1978, JMR 1 to show an earned rate of return of 10.09 percent on AT&T's interstate services. The \"recast\" contained interstate investment, expenses, and revenues that had purportedly not been included in the prior IMR I reports that AT&T had supplied to this Commission. Specifically, AT&T stated that the IMR 1 had not included investment, revenues, or expenses that were incident to the provision of interstate services at \"non- uniform rates.\"15 Several aspects of AT&T's approach require that we not accord to the \"1978 Annual FDC Report\" adjustments the same weight that we .attach to the figures that were contained in the December, 1978 IMR 1. For example, if \"recasting\" were required, actual data for the 1978 calendar year should have been employed for \"recasting\" rather than data that were selected for the month of June.16 Second, no data have been presented that credibly establish that June, 1978, is a month that accurately presents the investmen't and/or expenses that were associated with the provision of facilities to the OCCs.17 In this regard S5 In its \"1978 Annual FDC Report\". AT&T described \"services provided at non-uniform rates\" as being the use of its facilities pursuant to BSOC Tariffs Nos. 3 and 4, Western Union Contracts Nos. I and 2, and the use of its facilities by other common carriers. In its comments in this proceeding, AI'&T stated that the 10.22 percent measurement contained in the December, 1978, IMR I has \"[eixcluded, for example, * * revenues, expenses and investment associated with interstate facilities provided to other common carers, foreign exchange channels between contiguous exchtnges and less than fourteen miles in length, and link facilities for air-ground and coastal harbor service. and CATV channel service.\" (Emphasis added.) i8 Presumably data for each of the twelve months in 1978 were available to AT&T during the Spring of 1979. given the fact that AT&T's IMR 1 for the Month of December. 1978, states that it was issued on January 22,1979. 17 Additional issues arise with respect to the treatment of the adjustments that were made for facilities incident to the provision of services under BSOC Tariff Nos. 3 and 4 ands Western Union Contracts Nos. 1 and 2. The Western Union Contracts Nos. 1 and 2 terminated on September 30, 1978, which would suggest that adjustments would be necessary to reflect the fact that no furtherwe concur in USITA's assessment that the measurement of excess interstate revenues for the fiscal year of a carrier requires actual interstate investment, expenses, and revenues for the entire fiscal year. 13. More important, however, is the fact that this Commission has consistently relied upon the Interstate Monthly Report No. 1 in assessing AT&T's interstate earnings. AT&T has supplied the IMR 1 reports to this Commission for approximately twenty- eight years as its summary of Its interstate and foreign services operations. On July 25,1979, AT&T, in response to specific questions as to measurement of AT&T's earned rate of return on interstate services for the calendar year 1978, stated, AT&T reports monthly to the Commission the interstate rate of return consistent with the Commission's past decisions as to the appropriate elements of revenues, expenses, taxes and net investment to be used In the calculation of the rate of return, The report on which the interstate rate of return is shown is the Interstate Monthly Report No. 1. It]he rate of return of 10.22% shown on the December 1978 Interstate Monthly Report No, 1 is the rate of return for 1978 based on the Commission's directives appropriate to that year, including the December 21 [IDCJ decision mentioned above. (Letter from Mr. William Stump to the Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau, dated July 25,1979.) (Emphasis added.) 14. On September 27,1979, additional information was requested from Mr. Thomas Lawrence, a member of AT&T's FCC Financial and Accounting Matters Staff, as to the measurement of the revenues that AT&T had received during 1978 that were in excess of the 10.0 percent specified in our decision in Docket No. 20376. Specifically, Mr. Lawrence was asked to: [pIlease state: (1) What total revenues for 1978 would have been required to achieve an after tax raite of return of 10.00 percent and (Z) the income tax rates (federal, state, and, If applicable, municipal) which have been applied to any revenues which have resulted in earnings in excess of the 10.00% rate of return specified in Docket No. 20378. (Emphasis added,) In response thereto, Mr. Lawrence stated: Pursuant to your request, we have computed the revenues'that would have been required to achieve an after-tax rate of return of 10.0% for the year 1978. The data utilized In the attached analysis Indicates that the revenues required to achieve a 10.0% return would have been $101.0 million less than the activity under those contracts occurred during the months of October, November, and Deptaber, 1978,i9504495o4 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices revenues shown on the Interstate Monthly Report No. 1 for the year 1978 as issued by AT&T on January 22,1979. * * * (Letter from Mr. Thomas Lawrence, AT&T, dated October 26,1979) (emphasis added). 15. In its comments in this proceeding, AT&T has also stated that an earned rate of return measurement of 10.22 percent would result in $101.0 million of revenues in excess of 10 percent. 18 In light of the information that is before us, we conclude that AT&T's 1978 interstate and foreign services revenues exceeded the level that was authorized by $101,000,000.19 16. The $101 million in excess revenues that AT&T received ^ during 1978 are exclusive of interesL In prior refund cases, it has been our policy to award simple interest at the rate that has been computed by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. Although comments suggested that another interest rate be adopted, we see no compelling reason to depart from that well established practice here.21 It has also been the Commission's practice to compute interest from the date of the complaint.22 In this case, however, we have determined that the final date for the determination of AT&T's excess revenues is at the conclusion of AT&Ts fiscal year on December 31, 1978. Accordingly, interest shall be calculated from that date, rather than from the December 20,1978, date of the GSA letter. The Internal Revenue Service 8 AT&T Comments. pars. 64. 19In the case before us here, there is no issue of fact that requires a trial type evidentiary hearing. We have relied upon the IMR 1 that AT&T has supplied to this Commission. AT&T's alternative measurements of its earned rate of return during 197a [viz. 9.89 percent, 10.02 percent 10.09 percent. 10.1 percent) have been rejected on the basis of our earlier decisions with respect to IDC (9.69 percent. 10.02 percent), and our assessment of the \"1978 Annual FDC Report\" (10.09 percent, 10.1 percent). The resolution of these measurement issues depends either upon the meaning of our prior decisions (see Appendix A. infra). or upon the fact that we accord no weight to the measurement of AT&Ts rate of return that is contained in AT&T's 1978 Annual FDC Report. As AT&T noted in its Opposition to the NCCB petition. \"the pertinent data are already before the Commission in reports routinely filed as well as previous correspondence * * *\" AT&T Opposition at 3. n.* (filed August 2. 1979). 20AT&Ts reported gross revenues were based upon tariffs that included connecting and concurring carners that received revenues through the division of revenues and settlements processes. \"'The National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, the Consumer Federation of America and the Missouri Public Interest Research Group requested that interest be accrued at the prime rate. The USOCA supported that request. \" Teleprompter Inc. v. Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co. 79 FCC 2d 232, 238-39 (1980), recon. 85 FCC 2d 23 (1981): Georgia Power Co. v. Columbus Cablevision.

B. Restitution 17. The Notice of Inquiry requested comments on the action that this Commission should take when the earned rate of the return exceeds the rate that has been authorized. Information in response to that request suggests that the mechanism that entails the least administrative expense would require the imposition of a temporary discount upon interstate services for a period that is sufficient to reduce carrier revenues by the amount that is to be restored to interstate ratepayers. During the time that has elasped since comments were received in this proceeding, the Bell System Operating Companies have been divested from AT&T, the Division of Revenues process has terminated, access charges have been implemented, and earlier settlements procedures have been supplanted by the NECA administered distribution of access charges revenues under Part 69 of the Commission's rules.24 Whatever weight might properly be ascribed to the conclusion that, in a pre-divestiture environment, temporary discounts on services are less expensive and more efficiently administered than cash refunds has added weight in the post-divestiture environment. In structuring an appropriate remedy, this conclusion is particularly compelling in light of the joint nature of the interstate services that were provided by AT&T, the Bell System Operating Companies, and the independent telephone companies during 1978. During that period, local exchange and other connecting carriers that received revenues that flowed from the provisions of services pursuant to AT&Ts interstate and foreign services tariffs also shared in aggregate revenues that were excessive. Traditional concepts of equity would, therefore, require that those entities that received excess revenues proportionately share the burden of restoring those revenues 2447 CFR the subscribers from whom they were received.? 18. Effecting restitution has been further complicated by the fact that it is virtually impossible to achieve a \"direct targeting\" of the amounts that should be refunded to particular recipients. Since 1978, ratepayers have died, changed names, and changed addresses. Corporations and other entities having dejure status as ratepayers during 1978 have been dissolved, estates have been liquidated and distributed, conservators have been appointed, and trustees in barmptcy have become successors in interest to rights of bankrupt ratepayers in funds. Moreover, even if each element within the class of 1978 ratepayers were still in existence and identifiable at ascertainable addresses, it would still not be possible to allocate the amount of 1978's excess revenues, with accrued interest, that should be directly refunded to each of those ratepayers without additional proceedings that would be extensive and time consuming. Also, as we have heretofore observed, we cannot conclude, on the basis of AT&T's 1978 FDC study, that the proportions of the excess revenues that would be allocated to each tariffed service offering during 1978 would be correct.? 19. We have thus concluded that restitution can best be accomplished through a mechanism that will permit us to apply 1978's excess revenues, with accrued interest, to benefit subscribers utilizing the interstate and foreign telecommunications services of AT&T and its connecting and concurring carriers.- Accordingly, we direct AT&T rScoa 2 M- (o) o th Caun .m tiana Act czn~aro tha L Co mmban. rith sa fazt and \"any a-zah .=G; * * * that fa unfa I c r tz- aon 3b!a 2 h eeby d 2 71 =-d t o a coniaau. it fa nat inayp1op;ata to a 1;zv-t Ili cr c- t.i ve were rec_ ved duria3 197.

In this case, we could have ordered an immediate discount. However, we have recently Imposed revisionsto Interstate tariffs for switched services and have beenconducting an extended reveiw of the private line and special access service tariffs. Additional revisions to reflect changes in assets, expenses, and patterns of demand in exchange access'tariffs will be necessary periodically. Because the imposition of unnecessary administrative expense is undesirable, we have concluded that it will be more efficient to address the revenue requirement adjustments that we have required in the context of tariff revisions that will be -occuring during 1985. This decision is based upon the fact-that we have previously established an orderly procedure for the annual revision of exchange carrier customer line charges, that provdes for exchange carner filings that are to have ascheduled effective date of June31. See \u00a7 69.3 of the Commission'q Rules. Those revisions would opdlinarily require changes in AT&Ts interexchange tariffs, that would require an assessment of AT&T's supporting documentation. As a consequence, it would be adminstratively more efficient and less expensive to ensure that appropriate modifications have been made to interstate tariffs during the period that has been scheduled for 1hat process, rather than providing for an additional round of tariff modifications and review on top of those that have been required in the context of our most recent orders. We have also concluded that it is not feasible to disproportionately allocate 1978's excess revenues, with accrued interest, among categories of Interstate services on the basis of AT&T's 1978 FDC Report [see pare. 12, supra). At this point, we feel that the administrative, technical, and data complexities, that are associated with effecting restitution in a timely manner, require that weadopt the approach that is contained herein. 2The \"Plan of Reorganization\" that implements the \"Modification of Final Judgement\"'provides that contingent liabilities that relate to interstate rates be apportioned on the basis of \"relative investment devoted to Interstate services as of the effective date of divestiture (as calculated in-accordance with the FCC-prescribed Separations Manual in effect on the'date of divestiture), adjusted to reflect the assignments of assets under this Plan of Reorganization (CPE andlInterLATA assets to AT&Z and tntralATA assets to the \"Plan of and equitable division of.the xestitution obligations of the exchange and interexreange carriers. 20Interest on AT&T's pro rats share of the $101,00,000 shall be accrued from January 1, 1979, to the date-upon which AT&T files tariff revisions that reflect the reductions in revenue requirements that have been ordered herein.The aggregate reduction in'revenuerequirements is to be allocated amongihe estimatea revenue requirements for each service offering by a constant proportion (e.g. the revenue requirement of each service offering shall be reduced by a fraction that is equal to AT&T's total restitution obligation divided by AT&T's total 1985 Interstate revenue requirement).

LegalAuthority 20. After a full hearing on the record, the Administrative Law Judge entered an Order in Docket No. 20376 that provided that AT&T's interstate earnings were not to exceed 10.0 percent.30 After expressly affirming the decision of the AdmTnistrative Law Judge, the Commission stated that AT&T's earnings were \"not to exceed 10 percent\", si and further stated that it would \"not require any downward adjustment of AT&T's overall interstate rates provided its overall rate of return does not exceed 10 percent.\" 32 AT&T did not, however, seek during 1978 to modify the rate of return prescription that AT&T now contends had been vacated by rapidly changing economic circumstances. Nor did this Commission or any court modify, during 1978, the Docket No. 20376 prescription orders. After receiving evidence during 1980, we did prescribe an interim rate of return of 10.5 percent based upon the preliminary evidence that was then before us.33 At that time we took care to point out that the Commission's Docket No. 20376 prescription orders lad not lapsed, and that changes in AT&T's cost of capital could not \"'simply be determined by reference to changes in economiQ conditions without a hearing. Thus, we note that general fluctuations in the economy do not, as AT&T implies, weaken or invalidate an outstanding prescription such that a carrier may freely exceed it by filing increased rates.\" 34The proper procedure fof a carrier who contends that an outstanding order is improper is to petition the Commission to modify that order.\"s During 1978 AT&T did not 30AT&T Co.

Based in large measure upon information that was provided with respect to economic conditions during 1981, we subsequently concluded that AT&T's prescribed rate of return should be increased to 12.75 percent.ATE'T86 FCC 2d 221,251 (1981).5AT&T78 FCC 2d at 666 n.7 Although AT&T contends that economic conditions during 1978 were sufficienfly different to have vacated the 1976 prescription,we do mot perceive AT&T's factual predicate to have been well founded. Our assessment of economic and financial market conditions that are of public recordwivth respect to 197B, as well as AT&T's interstate earnings during 1978, reaffirms our conviction that AT&T's prescribed rate of return was within the correlative range of economic and financial market conditions that we considered-at the time of therate ofreturn prescription in early \u00a7 1.106, and 1:401 (1978).conform to the Commission's procedural rules by seeking an order that would have vacated the 1976\"prescription order. Accordingly, there is no statutory basis that would lead to the conclusion that the 1076 prescription was not In full force and effect during 1978.31 21. We next turfi to an argument that was raised by USITA. In discussing the Commission's authority under section 205(a), USITA stated \"[tihe FCC accepted the rates filed by AT&T in 1976. These rates became lawful rates, and AT&T could charge neither greater nor lesser rates. Yet this is precisely what the Commission would be doing in ordering refunds for 1978.\" 1 In essence, USITA appears to contend that the interstate tariffs under which AT&T was providing service during 1978 were \"lawful rates.\" In this regard, several observations are in order. First, the Commission had never made an affirmative finding that any of AT&T's tariffed charges during 1978 were \"just and reasonable\" within the meaning of the Communications Act. Second, tariffed charges of AT&T that were in effect during 1978 had been found by this Commission to be unlawful (see Appendix B, infra, and references cited therein]. The continuation of those services was permitted because the detrimental effects that would resulted from a disruption in the provision of those services outweighed the harm that would result from the continued provision of those services at rates that had not been adequately justified. We did not, however, intend that AT&T's charges would result in revenues that exceeded that limit that we prescribed in Docket No. 20376.35USITA's Commission orders continue in force until the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction issues a superseding order. 47 U.S.C. 408 (1078, 55SeeAT6 T. 78 FCC 2d at 665-70.31USITA Comments at 5-6.38A T&T, 57 FCC 2d 960, 973 (1970): A T&r 78 FCC 2d at 667. See alsoAppendix B, infra, and citations contained therein. The difficulties that the Commission was encountering with respect to AT&T's tariffs are described in Docket No. 18128, 01 FCC 2d 587 (1976), recon., 67 FCC (1978): Notice offnquwry n CC Docket No. ;V-245 (In the Matter of American Telephone & Telegraph Co, Manual and Procedures for Allocation of Costs), 73 FCC 2d 629 (1979); WATS, FCC 2d 610, 630-33 (1070). To the extent that services with associated charges that have been found to be unlawful have been provided through the use of plant that has been jointly used in the provision of other services at charges that have not been determined to be \"Just and reasonable\", we confront a situation that, In the absence of enforcement of the overall rate afreturn prescription, would potentially permit carriers to achieve unlimited rates of return unless this Commission were to terminate the provision of those services.I I I49506 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1914 / Notices contention that AT&T's interstate charges during-1978 were ipso facto lawful because they were filed at this Commission is incorrect. It is clear under Arizona Grocery v. Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railyway Co. that rates that become effective may subsequently be found to have violated statutory standards.59 It is also clear under the Communications Act that a carrier is under an affirmative duty to revise its rates to conform to outstanding prescription orders.\"' 22. Because Section 205(a) does not expressly contain the word \"refunds\", USITA further contends that any Commission action pursuant to a section 205(a) prescription could not embrace refunds as a mechanism for remediation. While section 205 does not specifidally provide for the enforcement of Commission prescriptions through refund orders, Section 4(i) gives the ,Commission broad authority to \"perform any and all acts, make such rules and regulations, and issue such orders, not inconsistent with this Act, as may be necessary in the execution of its functions.\" 41 In Nader v.

Tricarico, Secretary: Appendi: A-Interest During Construction 1. In correspondence with the Common Carrier Bureau, and in its comments in this proceeding, AT&T has asserted that the earned rate of return measurements that AT&T reported in the ]AM 1 and the 1978 Annual FDC Report should be reduced by 0.203 on the basis of \"full compliance\" with Docket 19129 (Phase II). In the interest of brevity, those adjustments shall be referred to hereinafter as either the \"Interest During Construction\" or \"IDC\" adjustments. The 9.893 measurement of AT&T's earned rate of return for 1978 results from the deduction, by AT&T, of 1978's Interest During Construction from the revenues that AT&T's employed in presenting the 10.9 1978 earned rate of return figure that was contained in AT&T's FDC Report. Similarly, the 10.02\"a measurement results from deducting IDC from the 10.2-- figure that AT&T filed in its IMR-1 Report for December, 1978. To understand the nature of AT&T's contentions it is necessary to review \"IDC\" concepts and our decisions with respect to IDC from the ratemaking prespective that is relevant here. Subsequent paragraphs in this Appendb: discuss EDC, our decisions with respect to MC, AT&T's correspondence with respect to DC, and the measurement of AT&T's earned rate of return during 1978. 2. When a utility constructs plant, the construction of the plant is frequently. although not necessary, financed through the issuance of interest bearing debt. Inclusion of the interest that was incurred to finance the plant construction could result in \"double counting\" I and therefore a double I The \"double countir\"' v.-auld oca:r as a conisqumcnc of allowing the camcr to com it, allowcd rate of return (cost of ep? 1?t] an &t' fardrecovery to the carrier if the plant that was under construction were also included in the carriers rate base for allowed rate of return measurement purposes. As a hypothetical example of this possibility, assume that during 1978 a carrier had 0-373,478,00 of telephone plant under construction and had incurred $0,785,00 in interest during 1978 to finance that plant while it was under construction. If that carrier were permitted to earn an allowed rate of return of 107, on the plant under construction in its revenue requirements for that year, and also receive IDC, the carrier would have been permitted to earn $104,133,0 0 2 or 18.165 on that investment as compared with the allowed rate of return of 10-5. 3. The issue that AT&T raisad in its letters of January 19, 1979, May 3.1979, and in its comments vith respect to ID bad its genesis in our consideration of AT&T's network: capacity in the Phase II Final Dacision and Order in Docket Mo. 19129 64 FCC 2d 1, 44-60 (1977). At that time, we noted that our practice had been to \"[ijnclude plant under construction in the rate base and change interest during construction. The interest during construction is included in income for ratemaking purposes and is added to the construction work in progress to be included in utility plant when the construction wor: is placed in service.\" Id. at 56. An explanation of that treatment for rate making purposes will help to clarify the bachground that underlies AT&T's proposed adjustment. 4. Upon occurrence of the condition - that the constructed plant is actually placed in service,' AT&T has been permitted to add IDC to the cost of that constructed plant, which, in turn, was then included in AT&T's rate base and depreciation expense for ratemaking purposes. To avoid \"double counting'. in the period(s) prior to the constructed plant's actual commitment to service (and subsequent thereto), we required, for ratemaldng purposes, that while the plant was being constructed (termed\"construction work in progress\") the interest that was beinn incurred on the construction be added to the revenues of the carrier to offset the rate of return which the carrier was being permitted to earn upon the plant while it was being constructed. Not including the credit to revenues of IDC for ratemaidng v. h w1e; b- Yr vz:d for 2,1145-53. E-62 (1977).49597 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices purposes would have resulted in the following consequences: (1) The 'carrier would be permitted to earn a rate of return on plant under construction; (2) the carrier would then be permitted to take the portion of return which was associated with the construction of the plant (IDC) and place that money in the rate base (thereby being compensated twice for the use of the money necessary for construction of the same plant); and (3) the carrier would subsequently be permitted to earn the allowed rate of return upon the IDC, for which the carrier had already been compensated when the carrier had been liermitted to earn a rate of return on the plant while it was under construction (see (1), above). 5. A numerical illustration of these concepts may be helpful. Assume thata carrier's allowed rate of return is ten percent, that the carrier borrows at ten percent to finance construction, and that $10,000 in construction expenditures occur during 1978. Under this scenario, the carrier is permitted to recover its cost of capital (the allowed rate of return of ten percent) on the construction, or $1,000 ($10,00ox.1) during 1978. The subsequent inclusion 6f DC ($10,000x.1=$1,000) during 1978 in the carrier's rate base would permit the carrier to recover a second round of capital -costs (the \"double count\") when that carrier is subsequently permitted to recover the $1,000 of IDC in increased depreciation expense in subsequent tim6 periods, arid is also permitted to earn the allowed rate of return upon the IDC - that is in the rate base. The offsetting entry that we had required from Docket No. 16258, 9 FCC 2d 960, 972 (1967), reduced the revenue requirement by adding, for rate evaluation purposes, IDC to the revenues that the carrier was receiving. This had the direct effect of increasing the measurement of the carrier's earnings for ratemaking purposes. 6. The treatment of IDC that was discussed in the three preceding paragraphs was examined by the-Trial Staff in Docket No. 19129. In our Phase II Final Decision and Order in Docket No. 19129, supra at 60, we found \"sufficient merit inthe Trial Staff's criticism of our present procedures -for treating PUC and IDC to institute changes to eliminate some of the problems it has asserted.\" Specifically, our Order stated: [wle shall continue the practice * of including short-term construction projects in the current rate base as the investment is incurred. We shall, however, neither compute nor capitalize IDC on such amounts, but rather * * * treat short-term projects similarly to plant in service. fr '*VFurthermore, we shall require all projects which actually take longer than one year to complete to be removed from the rate base at the end of the year, unless given a waiver by this Commission. In that event, M1C will be computed starting at the end of one year in accordance with the procedures set forth below. Additionally, any project suspended longer than six months will beremoved from the rate base and no 'IDC will be computed on such amounts. Projects designed with construction time exceeding one year will be removed from the rate base adinitio * * * 64 FCC 2d 1, 59 (1977). In addition, we explained that: [w]e realize that changes to the Uniform System of Accounts will 'be required in order to implement theseTate base changes, as projects with completion dates exceeding one year must be isolated from those taking less than one year. We are also concerned that the necessary accounting changes are not inconsistent with regulatory systems of the several states. Accordingly, we are by separate Order instituting a-proceeding, pursuant 'to Section 220(i) of the Act * *, to solicit the views of the states on the proposed accounting changes. Id. at 60. 7. The proceeding to amend :the Uniform System of Accounts (\"USOA\") as suggested in Docket No. -19129 was instituted by a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which was adopted on April 28, 1977 (Docket No. 21230), and published in the Federal Register on May 13, 1977, 42 Fed.-Reg. 24291). In that Notice, we pointed out that in our Phise I! Final decision and Order in Docket No. 19129 we had \"prescribed, among other things, the treatment of certain plant and expense items for ratemaking purposes\"; that \"[a]lthough the investigation in DocketNo. 19129 was limited to the operations of [AT&T] * + * the conclusion reached therein should b& rules of general applicability\". and, that the USOA \"should therefore reflect the rate base prescriptions.\" Our Notice of Proposed Rulemaking repeated the view expressed in Docket No. 19129 that\"orderly implementation of certain of those prescriptions [including plant under construction] will require amendment of the Uniform System,\" 8. On February 24, 1978, subsequent to the institution of the rulemaking proceeding to modify the necessary accounts, we considered on our own motion (FCC 78-103, 67 FCC 2d 1429) the problem of plant under construction and IDC in Docket No. 19129 and observed that: [uinder the provisions of our decision IDocket 19129], see para. 322, our revised treatment of Plant Under Construction [PUC! and Interest During Construction (IDC) for ratemaking purposes became effective for reporting year 1977. It was also originally determined that certain changes to our accounting rules werenecessary for the orderly implepnentatIon of our revised policy. Accordingly, on May 9. 1977, we released a Notice of Rulemaking for comment by various states regarding the proposed amendments to the Uniform System of Accounts * * * .Until that time [i.e., until the USOA is amended In accordance with the requirements of Section 220 of the Act], present accounting rules will remain in effect, although, for ratemaking purposes, interest is notsto be calculated on projects scheduled to be compeleted In less than one year. 67 FCC 2d 1429,1435-36 (emphasis added). We further stated: [wie are using this opportunity to clarify the rate base treatment of IDC accrued before the effective date of the above accounting change. For the reason stated below, we find the appropriate treatment is to disallow such lDCforratemakng purposes during calendar year 1977. Traditionally, IDC has been designed, in part, to compensate investors for funds prudently invested in construction projects, since projects while under construction generally generate neither revenues norprofits. However, because we are allowing investment In construction projects that are completed in less than one year to be included immediately in the rate base, AT&T will have the opportunity to earn an immediate fair return, To allow A TaT the additional opportunity to capitalize IDC at the time the associated PUC goes into service, and thus to .ecover such IDC over the life of the facility, would compeqsate AT&T's investors twice. We findsuch \"double counting\" not to be in the public interest and shall therefore disallow such IDC, effective January 1,1977 from respondent's interest rate base. Id. at 1436 (emphasis added). 9. About a month later, onMarch 27, 1978, Mr. William R. Stump, AT&T Assistant Vice President for FCC Financial and Accounting Matters, wrote to the Chief of the Common Chrrier Bureau seeking additional information as to the treatment of IDC. The letter stated: [ilt is clear that the Commission intends to disallow the inclusion of IDC from the rate base, for ratemaking purposes, during the pendency of changes in the Uniform System of Accounts to avoid any possibility of \"double dipping\" during the Docket 19129 (Phase II Final Order and the necessary accounting changes in Docket 21230. It also appears to be the Commission's intent in Paragraphs 14 and 15 to restore this IDC to the rate base once the new accounting changes go into effect and the opportunity for \"double dipping\" no longer exists. -While this is a logical approach and appears to be the intent of the Commission. the wording in Paragraphs 14 and 15 is not as clear as it might be in this regard. It would be helpful if this point could be clarified In the Order prescribing the necessary acocunting changes.I I I III49508 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 1 Thursday, December 20, 1934 / Notices In reply, the Bureau Chief agreed with AT&T's interpretation that the Commission's intent in Docket No. 19129 was to exclude IDC from the rate base for ratemaking purposes pending necessary accounting changes as a means of avoiding the opportunity for \"double dipping.\" On the other hand, unlike AT&T, the Bureau Chief did \"not read the Commission's orders as evidencing an intent to restore the IDC to rate base once the new accounting changes prescribed by Docket 21230 become effective.\" 10. On May 11, 1978, the Commission issued the Amendment of Part 31 Report and Order (Docket No. 21230), 63 FCC 2d 902. Consistent with our findings in Docket No. 19129, our decision in Docket No. 21230 amended the USOA to require, inter alia, that the account for telephone plant under construction be subdivided into two parts: one to show those projects to be completed within one year (short-term projects); the other to show those projects to be completed in more than a year (long-term projects). Basically, those projects to be completed within one year were to be placed in the plant accounts immediately and no IDC was to be accured thereon. Long term projects (e.g. those which are to be completed in more than one year) were to accrue IDC but were to be placed in plant accounts only when ready for service. Those accounting changes were ordered to become effective on January 1,1 979. See Amendment of Part 31, supra, at 908; recon., FCC 79-678 (released November 6,1979). 11. On June 2,.1978, AT&T filed an \"Application For Review\" challenging the conclusions reached by the Bureau Chief in his May 8, 1978, letter \"as contrary to statutory requirements, case precedent, the Commission's decision in Docket 19129 Phase I and Commission policy.\" AT&T requested that we set aside the Bureau Chief's conclusions and hold instead: 1. That IDC accrued by AT&T on short term Plant Under Construction in 1977 and 1978 was allowable for interstate ratemaking purposes; and 2. That the Bureau Chief exceeded his authority in concluding that interest accrued on short term plant during 1977 and1 978 should be written off AT&T's books as an unrecoverable cost. AT&T's Application For Review also stated: [wjhile it is true, as [the Common Cartier Bureau Chief'sl letter states, that \"capitalized IDC is recovered through increased depreciation charges over the life of the plant on which IDC was initially accrued\" this does not amount to double counting, so long as the IDC is included as income for ratemoling purposes * * * (emphasis added).12. Thus, AT&T's June 21978, Application For Review requested, for ratemaking purposes during 1977 and 1978, that this Commission continue in effect the IDC treatment that AT&T was then using for accounting and ratemaking purposes in its .1IR 1 reports which was, in fact, the same accounting and ratemaking treatment that this Commission had prescribed in 1957 in Docket No. 16258. As noted above, AT&T expressly stated that 1DC, under that method, must be included with income for ratemaling purpoEs to offset the \"double counting\" that would otherise result. Upon further consideration, we granted AT&Ts request that had the consequence that insofar as the ratemaldng treatment of DC on Plant Under Construction was concerned for 1977 and 1978, AT&T would continue its existing rcporting of DC (which included the revenue credit of IDC to offset \"double counting\"] and that our ratemaking assessment would correspond thereto.\" 13. Against this factual backdrop, we now consider AT&Ts statements regarding the appropriate treatment of DC during 1978 insofar as they concern the measurement of AT&T's earned rate of return for 1978. On January 19,1979, AT&T stated, with respect to AT&T's earned rate of return during 1978: \"[i]n 1978, on the basis of full compliance with Docket 19129 (Phase II requirements it was 10.027%-for all practical purposes, right at the upper part of the range * * *.\" (Letter from Mr. William Stump, AT&T, to the Acting Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau, dated January 19,1979). 14. On May 3, 1979. in response to a letter by the Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau with respect to the 10.02S measurement, AT&T stated ylou ask that vwe fully explain the differcnce between the 10 =7 rate of return reported on the Interstate Monthly Report No. 1 ( 1.0 1} and the 10.02 rate of retarn mentioned In my letter as having been calculated on the basis of full compliance with the Doe!:et 191Z.3 (Phase 11) requirements.

(Letter from Mr. William R. Stump. AT&T. to the Chief. Common Carrier Bureau. dated May 3.1979.] (Emphasis added.) 15. In response to further inquiry as to the measurement of AT&T's earned rate of return during 1978, Mr. Stump stated. in a letter to the Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau that was dated July 25. 1979; \"It]he rate of return of 1022, shown on the December 1978 Interstate Monthly Report No. I is the rate of return for 1978 based on the Commission's directives appropriate to that year, including the December 21 decision mentioned above.\" 16. In its comments in this proceeding, AT&T has stated: \"[t~he 10.02 and 9.83 percent measurement differ from the 10.22 and 10.1 percent measurements, respectively, only in that the former two measurements, but not the latter two. reflect full implementation of the Commission's Phase H decision in Doc:et 19129.\" (AT&T comments, para. 63.) AT&T further stated, in a footnote to paragraph e4 of its comments, that: \"[t]he 10.1 percent was a rounding of a 10.03 percent, so that the excess is only 9 basis points.\" 17. Thus, AT&T has stated in its letter of May 3,1979, and in its comments in this proceeding that the difference between 10.02% and the 10.27 reported in AT&T's December. 1978, INR I results from AT&'s \"adjusting out\" IDC for 1978. Similarly. the 9.69o measurement supplied in AT&Ts comments (paras. 60. for 1978 frotn the 10.01% earned rate of return that AT&T reported in its \"1978 Annual FDC Report.\" As heretofore noted, those proposed dowvnward JDC adjustments and the earned rates of return measurements associated therewith have been rejected. As we have heretofore stated for ratemaidng as well as for accounting purpases during 1973, IDC must be added to A T-T's revenues for interstate and forein serices to prevent double counting. In its June 2, 1978, Application For Review, AT&T aclmowledged that IDC must be added to income to prevent double counting during 1978 (see pare. 11, supra), and our June 1.1979, Memorandum Opinion and Order expressly recopized that fact. SO e Memorandua Opinion and Order In The Malter Of The Amaican Telephone and Telegraph Company. 72 FCC 2d 1, 6 (1979). The \"full implementation of the Commission's Phase H decision in Dock:et 19129\" to which AT&T refers49509 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices (AT&T comments, para. 63; AT&T letters of January 19, 1979, and May 3, 1979) not only involved accounting changes that were effective on January 1, 1979, but also involved concommitant ratemaking changes to prevent double counting that were also not effective until January 1, 1979. AT&T's proffered \"full implementation\" of our Phase II Decision in Docket No. 19129, by now including for 1978 inapplicable January 1, 1979, accounting changes (which intentionally were not to become effective until January 1, 1979), would, for 1978, result in the exact result that we have consistently sought to avoid: a double recovery of IDC. Appendix B 1. This Appendix contains a brief history of AT&T filings and FCC proceedings that relate to tariffs under which AT&T was providing interstate services during 1978. 2. On January 29,1976, AT&T filed \"Transmittal No. 12497\" which contained revisions to Tariffs FCC Nos. 259, 260, 263, 264, and 267, which were represented as having been designed to yield a D.5% rate of return. On February 5, 1976, after a full hearing, the Commission released a Memorandum Opinion and Order m Docket No. 20376, 57 FCC 2d 960 (1976), which prescribed a fair rate of return'for AT&T of 9.5% and permitted AT&T to earn an additional 0.5% as \"an incentive to increased productivity and efficiency.\" Id. at 973. On March 1, 1976, we released a Memorandum Opinion and Order in Docket No. 20732, 58 FCC 2d 1 (1976), which considered the tariff revisions that were contained, in Transmittal No. 12497. As noted therein, numerous issues were raised by participants in that proceeding that were also, in part, being considered in Docket Nos. 18128, 19989, and 20288. Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 4(i), 4(j), 204,205, and 403 of Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the tariff revisions that were contained in Transmittal No. 12497 were suspended for one day, a hearing was instituted into the lawfulness of those tariff revisions, the hearing was held in abeyance pending further order of this Commission, and we required \"that AT&T maintain an accounting of the revenues derived under these revised tariffs, for possible refund upon resolution of the lawfulness thereof.\" Id. at 5, On March 26,1976, we released an \"Errata\" in Docket No. 20732, FCC 76- 248, 58 FCC 2d 905 (1976), which, inter alia, revised paragraph 14 of our Memorandum Opinion and Order in Docket No. 20732, supra, at 5, to read:[flor the reasons indicated we shall order AT&T and all participating telephone companies to maintain accounts by service classes and subclasses, in the aggregate, specifying the amounts of all increases and the service classification for which such amounts are accounted. Classifications for which accounts must be kept are as follows: (1) Private line services, by series; (2) MTS and WATS, insofar as rates have been increased, and for each classification of service [e.g., dial station, operator-assisted, inward WATS, outward WATS, etc.]; (3) DDS; and (4] all other services. 58 FCC 2d 1, 5 (1976). Service of the Errata upon AT&T was effected on March 26,1976. On March 29,1976, the Commission released a Memorandum Opinion and Order in Docket No. 20736 (In the Matter of American Telephone and Telegraph Company Revision to Tariff FCC No. 260 (Series 1000)], 58 FCC 2d 899 (1976), which similarly provided for the suspension of certain AT&T tariff revisions, the institution of a hearing at a date to be specified, and the imposition of an accounting order upon AT&T and upon all carriers participating in the provision of the Series 1000 service. Id. at 903. In our Final Decision and Order in Docket No. 19989, 59 FCC 2d 671, 709-10 (1976), after having found the WATS tariff filings at issue therein to be unlawful, we stated: [a]lthough the WATS tariff has been found unlawful as indicated herein, there is a clear public interest requirement for continuity of Inward and Outward WATS service to the public. Further, this procedure will avoid the confusion and administrative difficulties which would likely arise if an alternative WATS tariff was filed to-become effective during the interim period while Bell prepared the tariff filing required by our Decision. Finally, we note that existing accounting .orders shall continue as set forth herein to protect the public and we retain our rights to investigate or reject or impose an accounting order with respect to the tariff revisions wich Bell must file. In view of the foregoing, the course'outlined above will best serve the public interest. Our Designation Order herein imposed an accoimnting order by individual customer account on Bell for all charges which were increased under the filing of Transmittal No. 11935,46 FCC 2d at 86. No accounting order was imposed for the increased charges resulting from Bell's March 1975 filing under Transmittal No. 12303, 52 FCC 2d 155,156, and a 'class' accounting order was imposed for the increased charges resulting from Bell's February 1976 filing under Transmittal No. 12493, Docket No. 20732, 58 FCC 2d 1, 4-5 (1976). Moreover, an accounting order by individual customer account remains outstanding with respect to the 1973 WATS rate increases, 40 FCC 2d 18, 20. As indicated above, we have found the foregoing WATS tariff filing unlawful. In the normal case where charges are found unlawful after hearing, we would prescribe lawful rates, and therefore know what portions of theincreases are lawful. Here, however, we have an insufficient record to support a rate prescription, and we therefore believe It (n appropriate exercise of our discretion not to order any refunds pending consideration of the tariff revisions filed in accordance with this Decision. Accordingly, we will leave the accounting orders now pending in effect. However, to the extent possible, we shall order Bell to convert the existing accounting orders by Individual account into \"class\" accounting orders, Le., for Outward MT, Outward FBD (FT), Inward MT and Inward FBD (FT) services, upon the effective date of this decision It is further ordered, that the accounting orders pursuant to 40 FCC 2d 18, 20 and 40 FCC 2d 81, 80 shall be converted to class accounting orders (for Outward MT, Outward FT/FBD, Inward MT, Inward FT/FBD categories of service) insofar as feasible. Id. at 709-10. By subsequent Memorandum Opinion and Order in Docket No. 19989, 64 FCC 2d 538, 540-41 (1977), which was released on April 18, 1977, we clarified the earlier accounting orders in Docket No. 19989, supra, at 709-10, by stating: [iln its Reply to AT&T's Opposition, National Data restates its view that existing individual accouhts should not be destroyed nor converted to class accounts if the effect would be to eliminate the basis for possible individual customer refunds, for WATS customers who have relied upon the accounting order by individual account issued by the Commission for the period March 14,1973 to March 8. 1975 as the ultimate source of relief. National Data points out that with respect to future Individual account record keeping it has not sought to require compilation of such records. It also does not deny that it is \"concerned about its own hopes for a refund,\" claiming it has suffered several dramatic increases In Its WATS charges since 1973, much to the detriment of its business operations ahd economic well being. National Data further renews its request that the Commission provide AT&T's WATS customers some indication as to its view of the likelihood that individual refunds, for the years 1973, 1974 and 1975, will be ordered so that If necessary, such customers may consider seeking alternate relief. Finally, National Data claims its participation in the informal discussions between AT&T and the Bureau will be of assistance due to its thorough knowledge of the issues which it obtained as a pqrty to Docket No. 19989. To the extent indicated below, we grant the relief requested by National Data. In regard to National Data's concern about accounting orders and records, our March 1, 1970 action in Docket No. 20732, supra. sets forth the public policy reasons justifying the entry of class accounting orders and supports the conversion of accounting orders by individual customer account to class accounting orders as ordered in this lartlcular case, In our March'1, 1976 action, 58 FCC 2d at 4, we stated that \"[in major rate cases * * the49510 Federal Register 1 Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday. December 20, 19P,4 / Notices imposition of individual accounting requiremenls [ils a costly, inefficient, and largely ineffective means of protecting the public interest.\" Although we ordered the conversion to class accounting, and reaffirm that-decision here, we never expected AT&T to physically convert the two accounting orders until we first decided whether or how any alleged refund liability was to be considered or determined. See 59 FCC 2d at 709. Thus, no destruction of existing individual account records, which is National Data's major concern, has occurred or will occur in the future pending further Commission order: 64 FCC 2d 538, 540-41. In the Phase II Final Decision and Order in Docket No. 19129, 64 FCC 2d 100-01, 110, released on March 1,1977, we terminated the outstanding accounting orders with respect to AT&T's Message Telecommunications Service. On May 9. 1977, this Commission issued a clarifying Memorandum Opinion and Order, FCC 77-310, which, inter alia, stated: (Oin March 1,1977. we released the Phase II Final Decision and Order in our Docket No. 19129 investigation of AT&T, FCC 77- 150, -- FCC 2d-- -. We found m that proceeding, inter alia, that the rate level of AT&T's Message Telecommunications Service (MTS], reflected in the earnings ratio from the service through 1975, was just and reasonable during the perod of this proceeding. Para. 253. Accordingly, we concluded that maintenance of the outstanding accounting orders, with the costs thereof placed upon the operating expenses of AT&T, was no longer required and terminated all such accounting orders with respect to MTS. Paras. 276, 328. In the Phase I1 Final Decision, supra, we found the overall rate levels of MTS reasonable through 1975, but we have taken no position on the lawfulness of the 1976 rate increase. As long as the question of the reasonableness of the MTS rate level in that filing remains under question (footnote omitted), we believe it inappropriate to terminate the MTS 1976 accounting order. Therefore, we hereby clarify that para. 328 of the Phase II Final Decision, supra, does not terminate the accounting order in this proceeding [Docket No. 20732]. Accordingly, it was ordered, That the accounts ordered in this proceeding at 58 FCC 2d 1, 5 (1976] shall continue to be kept until further order of this Commission. 3. On May 9,1977, the preceding Memorandum Opinion and Order in Docket No. 20732 was served upon AT&T. Pursuant to section 408 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 408, that order remained in full force and effect during 1978. 4. By Memorandum Opinion and Order in Docket No. 18128, 61 FCC 2d 587, 669 (released October 1, 1976), this Commission terminated all extant accounting orders in Docket No. 18128.However, upon reconsideration, by Memorandum Opinion and Order released on June 13,1977, 64 FCC 2d 971, 993, we reinstituted the accounting orders in Docket No. 18128. Upon further reconsideration, Second Order on Reconsideration in Docket No. 112.8, 67 FCC 2d 1441,1453 (released February 24, 1978), we reaffirmed the reinstitution of the extant accounting orders in Docet No. 18128, and stated: [a]s noted above, certain rate Increases were found unjustified while others like Telpak are still subject to farther proceedings. This circumstance allows that certain users may have been overcharged and may be entitled to refunds either presently or at the outcome of the proceeding. Clearly. the carrier, v;hich has the burden of justifyin- its rales, should carry the risk of failura in the praceeding, not the customer. AT&T would have us place the customer in the position of bearing the entire risk of overp3yilt in the event thst rates are proven un tt fully high. We must reject the view, and therefore huld that maintenance uf the acconting ordvrs is necessary to continue to protect customer interest still extant in this proceedi.- Id. at 1453. 5. During 1973, AT&T had in effect several tariffed rates that the Commission has found to be unlawful or that have been continued pursuant to Court order. During April. 1976, AT&T filed Tariff revisions 1254G and 12547 introducing the multi-schedule private line (MPL rates. On May 19, 1976, the Commission suspended the effective date of the MPL rates, and set those rates for investigation. In the Matter of American Telephone & Telegraph Company, 59 FCC 2d 428 (1976). At that time, we stated: [slubstantial questions have been raised concerning the lawfulnezs of the YfXL rate structure. Some of the specific features of the tariff which need close rcrutiny are, amon3others, the increases In the charges of services of 25 miles or less in length, the high charge for the first mile of service, the possible anti-competitive implications of the decreases in char ,e for Ion, haul servicc, and the possibility of unlawful discrimination between users. Id. at 431. The MPL rates became effective on August 20,1970, followin, expiration of the three-month suspension period. Those rates remained in effect with minor revisions through 1978. On March 19,1979, the Administrative Law Judge, after a lengthy hearing, released his decision. As reported in the Commission's final decision, the Administrative Law Judge: found eight separate violations of DacLet No. 18128 requirements in the MPL cost studies. He thus concluded. that the costing practices and classifications underlying those cost studies are not just and reasonable within the meaning of section 201(b) of theComrunicatiorm Act (47 U.S.C. 202Lb]l; that AT&T has failed ta demonstrate that wsch classifications and practicFs would not constitute cn unjust or unreasonabla disc~rnination in violation of section 202[a) of the Act. (47 U.S.C. 202(a)]; and that AT&T has not met or even attempted to meet the cost allocation guidelines set out in the Docket No. 16133 Decision. The judge concluded that the Series 2000/300a transmittals at issue are unlav.ful and must be rejected. In the Matter of American Telephone and Telegraph Company. 74 FCC 2d 1, 7 (1979). On September 20,1979, the Commission in its Final Decision in Doc!het No. 20314 found that as a consequence of the use of AT&T's basic service philosophy, AT&T had \"failed to carry its burden of justifying the MPL tariff under section 201(b) of the Act in accordance with Doclet No. 18128 requirements.\" 74 FCC 2d 1, 41 (1979). The Commission then concluded that the public interest required that AT&T's tariffremain in effect until the Commission was in a position to prescfrbe new rates, or until a new carrier initiated tariff became effective. In the Commission's Final Decision and Order in Docl:et No. 19339,59 FCC 2d 671 (1976), recon., 64 FCC 2d 538 (1977). the Commission, in considering AT&Ts WATS tariff rates, concluded hat: Pursuant to srction 2,31!b) of 11l57 and thereto) are found unlawful as Indicated herein, are null and void. effective 210 days after publication of this Decision in the Fedcal Re3stcz. It is further o:dcred. That Bell shall file tariff revisio= accompanied by the information required by \u00a7 61.33 of tha Commision's Rules, 37 CFR 61.23. and which meet the guidelines specified herein; It is further ordered. That the provisions of Section G1_3 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 61.-53 are waived. and the tariff revisions to be filed on not Ie33 than 6a days notice; S9 FCC 2d 671. 70-710. In response to this order, AT&T filed Transmittal 12745 which was to become effective on August 1,1977. On July 21, 1977, the Commission concluded that- AT&T's WATS tariff filing. Transmittal No. 12745, is rejected. except to the extent WATS services are to be initiated to and from points outsida the 43 contiguous states* * *. It Is further ordered. That the effective date of paragraph SE3 of our becision in Dacket No. 139, 59 FCC 3d 671,703-710 (197). wuhich declared the present WATS tariffnull and void is deferred. panding further Commission Order. In the Matter of American Telephone and Telegraph Company (Long Lines Department Revisions to Tariff FCC No.49511 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices 259 Wide Area Telecoxnmunications Service [WATS), Transmittal No. 12745, 66 FCC 2d, 62-63 (1977). 6. On November 21, 1978, the Commission, in the preceding WATS Decision, set forth a mechanism for the filing of revised WATS tariffs. Thus, the WATS tariffed rates,found to be unlawful in 1976, remained in effect during 1978 with minor exceptions noted above. On January 17,1977, the Commission released the Memorandum Opinion and Order In The Matter of American Telephone and Telegraph Company Investigation Into The Lawfulness Of Tariff FCC No. 267, Offering A Dataphone Digital Service Between 5 Cities (Docket No. 20288), 62 FCC 2d 774 (1977). recon. denied, 64 FCC 2d 994 (1977), regarding the provision of dataphone digital service. In the Decision, the Commission stated: [T]he rates and conditions of AT&T's Tariff No. 207, as specified herein, are unjust. unreasonable, and unlawful, in violation of \u00a7 201(b) of the Communications Act* * * Accordingly, we require AT&T to file an interim tariff offering dataphone digital service at rates designed to yield the 9.5% return, as provided herein, no later than February 22,1977, effective on tirty days notice. 62 FCC 2d FCC 2d 774, 807 [1977). AT&T filed interim rates patterned after the rates in Tariff No. 260 (Series 2000/3000) under Transmittal 12687 which became effective on March 24,1977. In allowing those tariffed rates to become effective, the.Conimission stated: [we]find that AT&T has substantially complied with our guidelines set forth in the Docket 20288 Decision. Upon examination of the arguments in the petitions for investigation and rejection, we cannot agree that the requested relief is warranted. Therefore, we will allow the tariff revisions which reflect the interim rates to become effective. In The Matter Of American Telephone and Telegraph Company, 63 FCC 2d 936, 937 (1977). On July 25,1977, AT&T filed revised Dataphone Digital Service (\"DDS\") tariffs under Transmittal 12790 to become effective on January 16, 1978. - On January 12,1978, the Commission rejected proposed DDS tariff rates on the ground that the filing did not comply with the Commission's Order in Docket No. 20288. In the Matter Of American Telephone and Telegraph Company Revisions Of Tariff No. 267 Dataphone Digital Service (DDS), 67 FCC 2d 1195 (1978), recon. denied, 70 FCC 2d 616 (1979). Since its initial tariff offering service to five cities, AT&T expanded in phases the number of cities to be served. Each incremental tariff filing for each incremental service was based upon the interim rates that were filed in 1977.7. On October 1, 1976, the Commission released it&Memorandum Opinion and Order in Docket No. 18128, 61 FCC 2d 1444 (1978], aff'd sub nom. Aeronautical Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 642 F.2d 1221 (D.C. Cir., 1980), cert. denied. 451 U.S. 920 (1981). In that Decision, the Commission found that it was: [u]nable to find that the TELPAK offering, as presently structured, constitutes a proper response to the extent of competition posed by private microwave. We nevertheless believe that a properly structured bulk rate offering, which would compete with private microwave or other competitive alternatives is justifiedcHowever, it is clear from the record herein, that the nationwide rate differential existing between TELPAK and like private line service cannot be supported by alleged cost comparability between TELPAK and hypothetical private nucrowave systems. 61 FCC 2d 587, 658 (i976) (emphasis in the original]. In response to this finding, the Commission concluded that: The rate level differential existing between TELPAK and other private line services constitutes an unlawful discrimination between like services, under Section 202(a). We do recognize, however, the benefit to industrial, transportation and government users from a bulk offering. Bell may file within the eight month period outlined below a new appropriately responsive bulk offering consistent with our guidelines herein, which can be supported on the basis of competitive necessity, costs, or other relevant factors. Id. at 659. In response to this directive, AT&T filed tariff changes to eliminate the Transmittal No. 12714 TELPAK (Series 5000) offering. On reconsideration of the Final Decision in Docket No. 18128, the Commission decided that: [c]onfusion on the [scope of the Notice of questions at issue] may have resulted from differing statements contained in orders issued during this somewhat convoluted and protracted proceeding. We shall on this ground reconsider the matter of TELPAK's lawfulness as well as whether the return levels on these discounted rates fall within the zone of resonableness. Consequently, we set aside, and accordingly stay our Order requiring Bell to eliminate TELPAK by June 8, 1977* * * and will conduct an expedited hearing on the question of TELPAK's lawfulness in general under Sections 201(b] and 202(a) of the Act. 64 FCC 2d 971, 985 (1977]. In addition, the Commission stated: [iun conclusion, on reconsideration we find that the TELPAK discounts, now subject to termination at the carrier's option, have not yet been justified on the basis of either a cost differential, an overall return level, or competitive necessity. Such justification will be the subject of the further hearings we are ordering herein.Id. at 989. On June 2,1977, the Commission issued an Order denying petitions to suspend or reject AT&T's tariff filing terminating the TELPAK offering. In the Matter of American Telephone And Telegraph Company Long Lines Department Revisions To FCC Tariffs No. 258 and 260 (series 5000) Termination of TELPAK Service, 64 FCC 2d 959, 968 (1977). On July 21, 1977, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit enjoined AT&T from discontinuing the TELPAK offering to existing customers pending review of the Commission's Order allowing the terminating tariff to take effect. The TELPAK rates remained in effect through the period under consideration here. 8. Thus, the Commission had not only found specific AT&T tariffs that were In effect during 1978 to have been unlawful, but the Commission had also imposed accounting orders with respect to interstate services that were being provided by AT&T. To the extent that services with associated charges that have been found to be unlawful have been provided through common plant with other services at charges that have not been found to be \"just and reasonable\", we confront a situation that, in the absence of an upper bound to the carriers earnings, would potentially permit unlimited rates of return on regulated services. We do not believe that Congress intended such a result. Nor do we believe that such a consequence would be consistent with Section I of the Communications Act of 1934 or the obligations that are Imposed under sections 201-205 of the Communications Act.

Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate portions'of each committee meeting are listed above. The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last that long. It is emphasized, however, that the I hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a mimnmum rather than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee chairman determines will facilitate the committee's work. Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline concerning the policy and procedures for electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings. This guideline was published in the Federal Register of April 13, 1984 (49 FR 14723). These procedures are primarily intended to expedite media access to FDA's public proceedings, including hearings before a public advisory committee conducted pursuant to Part 14 of the agency's regulations. Under this guideline, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including the presentation of participants at a public hearing. Accordingly, all interested persons are directed to the guideline, as well as the Federal Register notice announcing issuance of the guideline, for a more complete explanation of the guideline's effect on public hearings. Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published in this Federal Register notice. Changes m the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting. Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearng portion of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person attending the hearing whodoes not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairman's discretion. Persons interested in specific agenda items to be discussed in open session may ascertain from the contact person the approximate time of dicusslon. A list of committee members and summary minutes of meetings may be requested from the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Rm. 4- 62, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. The Commissioner, with the concurrence of the Chief Counsel, has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended by the Government in the Sunshine Act (Pub. L. 94-409), permits such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed, however, shall be closed for the.shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes, The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature, disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action; and information In certain other instances not generally relevant to FDA matters. Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes; and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute a clearly49514 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee -meetings that-ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, -discussion, and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a-class of drugs or devices; consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review.of data and information on specific investigational orimarketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, notably deliberative sessions to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do-not independently justify rlosing.

License No. 13-10203-01 would have expired on August 31, 19 but for the licensee's timely request for renewal of the license which was submitted on July 10, 1934. 11 As a result of a routine inspection conducted on April 5, 9-11, and 27,1934 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Region III office, the NRC staff determined that the licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance with NRC requirements. A vwritten Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties was served on the licensee by letter dated July 30,1934. Th2 Notice stated the nature of the violations, the provisions of the Commission's requirements that the licensee had violated, and the cumulative amount of the proposed civil penalties. The licensee responded to the Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties by letter that was received by the Region MI office on August 30,1934. I Upon consideration of the licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanation, and arguments for remission or mitigation of the proposed civil penalties contained therein the Deputy Director, Office of Inspection and Enforcement, has determined, as set forth in the Appendix to this Order, that the penalties proposed for the iolations set out in the Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Panalties should be imposed. IV In view of the foregoing, and pursuant to section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. as amended, 4Z US.C. 2232, Pub.

VI In the event the licensee requests a hearing as provided above, the issues to be considered at such hearing shall be: (a) Whether the licensee was in violation of the Commission's requirements as set forth in the Notice 'of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties, and (b) Whether on the basis of such 'violations, this Order should be sustained. Dated at Bethesda, Maryland, this 13th day of December 1984. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. James M. Taylor, Deputy Director, Office of Inspection and Enforcement. Appendix Evaluation and Conclusions The violations and associated civil penalties are identified in the Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties dated July 30, 1984. The licensee's response was received by the Region Ill office on August 30, 1984. In its response, the licensee denies that, with the exception of Item C, the violations occurred as described in the Notice of Violation. Additionally, the licensee offers several.reasons why the civil penalties should not be imposed. NRC's evaluation of these is presented below, followed by conclusions regarding the proposed civil penalties. Item A-Statement of Violation License Condition-No. 17 requires that all licensed material be possessed and used in accordance with statements, representations, and procedures contained in applications dated November 27, 1978 and January 13, 1982, and letters dated January 18,1979 and April 21, 1982. The application dated November 27, 1978 requires that the dose calibrator be checked for constancy on a daily basis by assaying a cesium-137 source and a cobalt-57 source, and that records shall be maintained of the results. Contrary to the above, records for the period of December 28,1983 through April 4,1984 of daily constancy checksfor the dose calibrator, utilizing a cobalt- 57 source, were falsified in that the readings recorded were not the readings obtained from the source. Licensee's Response to Item A 1. The licensee denies that the daily constancy records were intentionally falsified. NRC's Response. There is little dispute that the records did not accurately reflect the daily constancy checks and, thus, that a violation occurred. The question of whether the inaccurate entries were deliberately made goes to the severity level of the violation. As the licensee's letter dated June 13,1984 acknowledges, the technologist entered the same value in the log that had been previously recorded rather than the value that appeared on the dose calibrator. The entries were not inadvertent clerical errors. They were made to conform logs to the technologist's expectations of what the readings should be, not what the readings actually ivere. In this sense, the inaccurate entries were deliberately made and sufficient to support classifidation of the violation at Severity Level 11. 2. The licensee states that the failure to catch the inaccuracies of the constancy recordd does not indicate a lack of management or supervision over thQ department. The licensee also felt confident that thetests were being performed and recorded properly since their consulting physicist audited the program just one month prior to the inspection. NRC's Evaluation. The NRC believes that the failure to identify the inaccuracies does represent a lack of .management of supervision over the department. It appears that licensee management was relying on the quarterly audits performed by the consulting physicist to provide assurance thatthe department was in compliance with NRC rules and regulations and had inappropriately delegated responsibility for ensuring compliance with NRC requirements to the consultant. If the department had had adequate day-to-day supervision, the inaccurary of the records could have been observed. 3. The licensee states that there have been no overexposures or overdoses to patients due to the inaccuracies of the constancy results and thus requests a reduction of the Severity Level and a mitigation of the civil penalties. NRC's Evaluation. In the licensee's June 13, 1984 letter, the individual stated that she attached no significance to the test and felt it was simply to generate numbers. NRC places significance onassuring that quality control tests are performed on dose calibrators to assure that patients are given the prosribed dosage. From the information obtained during the inspection, NRC cannot determine whether patients were given overdoses of radiopharmaceuticals. 4. The licensee states that there was relatively little opportunity to discover the inaccuracy of the records prior to the .inspection due to the minor changes In the daily constancy test results from -December 28, 1983 to April 5, 1984. NRC's Evaluation. If an adequate audit had been performed by the consulting physicist in March of 1984 or if department had adequate day-to-day supervision, the inaccuracy of the records should have been observed. It should be noted that the NRC inspector was able to identify this violation from i review of the licensee's records, 5. The licensee stated that the NRC refers to this violation as a repeat violation and the proposed civil penalty should not be augmented based on past performance. NBC's Evaluation. The NRC's July 30, 1984 letter did not state that this violation was a repeat violation, It did state, however, the violation is similar to one identified in the April 1980 inspection since it related to quality control tests on the dose calibrator. However the amount of the proposed civil penalty was not increased based on poor past peformance and, consequently, will not be mitigated on the basis of the licensee's response. Item B-Statement of Violation License Condition No. 18 requires radioactive waste to be monitorQd with typical low-level laboratory survey instruments to determine that its radioactivity cannot be distinguished from background prior to disposal as normal waste. Contrary to the above, molybdenum- 99/technetium-99m generator columns were disposed of as normal waste on September 30,1983, although surveys revealed readings of 0.8 mR/hr and the background reading was 0.4 mR/hr. Licensee's Response to Item B The licensee denies that the generator columns disposed of on September 30, 1983, were above background levels for the follonwing reasons: 1. The actual background recorded that day was 0.5 mR/hr rather than 0.4 mR/hr as was stated in the July 30,1984 Notice of Violation. NRC's Evaluation. The NRC agrees that the Notice of Violation should have stated 0.5 mR/hr rather than 0.4 mR/hr. It should be noted that surveys made toI I I49524 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday December 20, 1984 / Notices determine the presence of measurable amounts of radioactive material should not be made in the nuclear medicine laboratory, but instead the generator columns should be surveyed in a low background area. This would enable the licensee to easily detect radiation levels well below 0.5 mR/hr. 2. The licensee states that the difference between 0.5 mR/hr and 0.8 mR/hr is indistinguishable with the measuring device used. MRC's Evaluation.-The NRC agrees that the difference between 0.5 mR/hr and 0.8 mR/hr is not easily distinguishable with the licensee's CDV 700 survey meter if one of the instrument's higher ranges is used. However, as stated in Item B.1 above, such measurements should be made in a low background area. This would eliminate this problem and 0.5 Rlhr could then be easily measured. 3. The licensee states that the column disposed of on September 30,1983, had decayed to 2.6X10\"6millicuries, claiming that this was essentially background and far below the level of detectability for the GM survey meter used. NRC's Evaluation. The NRC inspector calculated that the actual activity remaining on September 30,1983, was 4.4 microcuries rather than the 2.6 X10\"G millicuries as stated in the licensee's response. During a September 12, 1984 telephone conversation with the NRC inspector, the licensee's consulting physicist agreed that the actual activity remaining in the generator column was 4.4 microcuries. A generator containing 4.4 microcuries of molybdenum-99 is easily detectable with a GM survey meter, and the violation did occur as stated in the Notice of Violation. Item C-Statement of Violation License Condition No. 17 requires that all licensed material be possessed and used in accordance with statements, representations, and procedures contained in applications dated November 27,1978 and January 13 1982 and letters dated January 18,1979 and April 21,1982. The application dated November 27, 1978 requires all elution, preparation and injection areas to be surveyed daily with a GM meter and decontaminated as necessary. ' Contrary to the above, no surveys were done in the elution and preparation areas from April 3 through 5,1984. Licensee's Response to Item C The licensee admits the violation, yet requests a reduction of the SeverityLevel due to the fact that the hospital has substantially complied ;ith the requirement, having missed only two days since the last inspection fi.ur years ago. NRC's Evaluation. It should be nuted that this is a report of a violation thut was identified during the April l'M0 inspection. If this had been the only violation identified, the severity level would have been lower. Howevcr. as discussed below, this was one of several violations identified which were categorized in the aggregate at Sevi,ty Level I. Licensee's Request for Reduction in Severity Level and Reduction of Proposed Civil Penalties The licensee states that the overall impact of the alleged violations is not of such a serious nature as to justify classification at Severity Level I. It states that Severity Level II encompasses violations such as overdoses to patients or overexposures to workers, and none of these have occurred. NRC's Evaluation. The NRC's Enforcement Policy classifies a falsification of records in which the records were deliberately falsified by or with the knowledge of management as a Severity Level I violation. However, since the NRC staff has concluded that management was not aware of tbe falsification of the records, the violation has been classified at Severity Level U. Falsification of records, in this case, could have led to a misadministration to a patient since the individual performing the test attached no significance to the test and was just generating numbera. Violations B and C are not themselves as significant as Violation A. which involves the falsification of records. As discussed above, Violation A itself fits an example of a Severity Level I1 violation under Supplement VII to the enforcement policy because the violation involved deliberate falsification of records, althounh without management involvemet. V1inlations B and C were included vith Violition A for purposes of clussifying the significance of the violations identified by the NRC to determine the appropriate enforcement sanction. All three violations stem, in NRC's view, from the same underlying problem-lack of adequate management oversght and control of the radiation safety program. Violations B and C were repetitive of the same or similar violations previously identified by NRC inspections and, thus, reinforce this conclusion. Accordin-ly, the grouping of the three violations for purposes of determining the severitylevel was appropriate and in accordance with the policy. The NRC did not increase the base penalty of S4,C0 for a Severity Level H violation, although such factors as poor enforcement history and multiple instances of violations could have been applied here. None of the factors for decreasing the base penalty are applicable here. The licensee's corrective actions were not extraordinarily prompt or extensive enough to warrant mitigation, and the licensee's enforcement history, as noted above, has not been good in this area. Conclusion After reviewing the licensee's response to the violations including corrective actions already completed and those corrective actions that vill be taken1 the NRC staff has concluded that the licensee has not provided a basis for mitigation of the civil penalties. [FR Doc. 84-331C.3 Filed 12-19-8P4; Power (Haddam Neck Plant); Order Modifying License I Connecticut Yanl:ee Atomic Power Company (the \"licensee\") is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR- 61 which authorizes the licensee to operate the Haddam Neck Plant (the \"facility\") in Haddam, Connecticut. II On August 21, 1924, with the refueling cavity filled with reactor coolant water and refueling scheduled to begin within approximately eighteen hours, the reactor refueling cavity seal failed. As a result, about 200.00 gallons of borated reactor coolant water drained from the reactor cavity to the containment floor in approdmately 20 minutes. An NRC inspection was conducted on August 21 through September 4. 19Z4 to review the circumstances associated with the seal failure. In January 1933, the licensee implemented a design change which replaced the flat steel plate previously used as the seal which covered the 28 inch annulus between the reactor and the bottom of the refueling cavity. The new seal design consisted of a stiffened 24-inch annular steel plate with inflatable rubber boots on each side of the plate. Inspection of the cavity seal after its failure found that the outer rubber boot had extruded through the 249525 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices inch gap between the seal assembly and the cavity plate for about 1/4 of the seal circumference. Subsequent testing by the licensee indicated that sufficient margin did not exist in the seal design to prevent such extrusion. A design basis for the seal, namely. holding the static water pressure of the refueling cavity during refueling operations, was not correctly translated into the design modifications in that the rubber boots were neither specified nor suitably tested to meet this basis with an adequate safety margin. This design error was not identified during the required design verification process. In addition, the written safety evaluation associated with the design change stated that the modification was reviewed to assure compliance with 10 CFP. 50.59. The written safety evaluation incorrectly concluded that no- unreviewed safety question would be presented by the proposed change because the modification would not create a type of accident that was not evaluated previously. However, the evaluation failed to provide any basis for concluding that the flexible parts of the new design did not introduce a failure mechansm or malfunction to which the previous bolted all-metal seal was not susceptible. For example, the evaluation did not consider the effect of a dropped object on the unprotected rubber portion of the new seal or extrusion of the seal through the gap between the annular plate and the reactor cavity. Further, the plant design change request associated with the modification was reviewed and approved by the Plant Operations Review Committee (PORC) and the Nuclear Review Board (NRB), even though no basis was provided to support a conclusion that the change did not involve an unreviewed safety question. These events demonstrate inadequacies in the methods used during the seal modification for design and design verification, written safety evaluations, and PORC and NRB reviews. The violations associated with this event are set forth in the Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty issued to the licensee on this date which is incorporated herein by reference. These recent violations at the facility represent a continuing problem of equipment being rendered inoperable because of inadequate controL and implementation of design changes. Specifically, in October 1983, the Post Accident Sampling System was found to be inoperable because a valve was improperly installed, and the preoperational test to verify system operability had not identified theimproper installation. Further, in May 1984, high range containment radiation monitors were not environmentally qualified because the design specifications were not correctly translated into instructions fot the installation of the monitors. As a result. the electrical leads were not properly insulated and one monitor subsequently failed. These incidents demonstrate the need for effective corrective measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future- III Collectively, these occurrences at the facility represent inadequate planning. direction, and control of activities involving design modifications with the potential for affecting the public health and safety. These occurrences are indicative ofprogrammatic deficiencies in the design change program and demonstrate the need for significant generic corrective measures to prevent similar occurrence in the future to assure public health and safety. IV In view of the foregoing, and pursuant to sections 103, 161(i), 161(o), and 182 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.204 and 10 CFR Part 50, it is hereby ordered that: A. Within 60 days of the effective date of this Order, the licensee shall submit to the Regional Administrator, Region I. for review and approval, a plan for review and appraisal of the following items by an independent organization: (1J Design modification packages approved since January 1,1979 to determine the adequacy of design control and of implementation of the packages' and to determine whether each such modification introduced any previously unanalyzed failure mode or mechanism. (2) The process for initiating, evaluating, reviewing, approving, and implementing design change modifications to determine if any deficiencies exist in the process, and to specify recommendations for improvement. The identity and qualifications, including resumes, of each member of the independent organization assigned to perform the review and appraisal, shall also be provided to the Regional Administrator with the plan. The plan shall describe the methods for performing the review and appraisal and for documenting the results. B.

A copy of the final appraisat report specifying identified deficiencies and recommendations, and any drafts thereof, shall be submitted to the Regional Administrator, Region I, at the same time they are submitted to or reviewed by the licensee. The licensee shall also direct the appraisal team to submit to the Regfonal Administrator any status report, including drafts, whenever any such report or draft is submitted to the licensee. C. Within 2 months after the date of issuance of the final appraisal report required by section IV. of this Order, the licensee shall submit to the Regional Administrator, Region I, for review and approval-, a plan for improvements based on evaluation of the appraisal findings and recommendations. This plan shall include (1) action items to be performed and (2) a schedule for completion of each specific action Item. This plan shall also provide justification if any of the recommendations of the appraisal report are not adopted. D.

If a hearing is to be held concerning this Order, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of hearing. If a hearing is held, the Issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Order shall be sustained.

For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. James M. Taylor, Deputy Director, Office oflnspection and EnforcemenL Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty On August 21,1984, at about 8:00 a.m., with the reactor refueling-cavity filled in preparation for removing spent fuel from the reactor, the cavity seal failed and about 200,000 gallons of borated reactor coolant water drained to the containment floor in about 20 minutes. If the seal had failed during the planned refueling, which was scheduled to begin about 18 hours after the failure, as many as four fuel assemblies could have been partially or fully uncovered in the reactor cavity and the upper three feet of the fuel stored in the spent fuel pool could also have been uncovered. Further, as more of the highly radioactive assemblies were moved from the reactor vessel to the spent fuel pool, the consequences of a seal failure would increase. However, at the time of the failure, refueling fuel movements had not begun and the fuel transfer tube was isolated. The licensee immediately suspended refueling operations and notified the NRC of the occurrence at about 8:25 a.m. An NRC inspection was conducted on August 21 through September 4,1984, to review the circumstances associated with the seal failure. In January 1983, the licensee implemented a design change which replaced the flat steel plate previously used as the seal which covered the 28 inch annulus between the reactor and the bottom of the refueling cavity. The new seal design consisted of a stiffened 24-inch annular steel plate with inflatable rubber boots on each side of the plate. Inspection of the cavity seal after its failure found that the outer rubber boot had extruded through the 2 inch gap between the seal assembly and the cavity plate for about 'A of the seal circumstance. Subsequent testing by the licensee indicated that sufficient margin did not exist in the seal design to prevent such extrusion. A design basis for the seal, namely, holding the static water pressure. of the refueling cavity during refueling operations, was not correctly translated into the design modifications in that the rubber boots were neither specified nor suitably tested to meet this basis with an adequate safety margin. This design error was not identified during the design verification performed by another engineer.In addition, the written safety evaluation associated with the design change states that the modification was reviewed to assure compliance with 10 CFR 50.59. The written safety evaluation incorrectly concludes that no unreviewed safety question existed because the modification did not create a type of accident that was not evaluated previously. However, the evaluation does not describe any basis for concluding that the flexible parts of the new design did not introduce a failure mechanism/mulfunction to which the previous bolted all metal zeal was not susceptible. For example, the evaluation did not consider the effects of a dropped object on the unprotected rubber portion of the new seal or extrusion of the seal through the gap between the annular plate and the reactor cavity. Further, the plant design chanse request associated with the modification was reviewed and approved by the Plant Operations Review Committee (PORC) and the Nuclear Review Board {NRB), even though no basis was provided to support a conclusion that the change did not involve an unreviewed safety question. These occurrences reflect deficiencies in the design change modification program and they demonstrate the need for generic corrective measures to assure improvements in the program. To emphasize the importance the NRC places on an effective design change process for modifications that may affect public health and safety, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposes to impose a civil penalty in the cumulative amount of Eighty Thousand Dollars ($80,000) for this matter. In accordance with the General Statement of Policy and Pro-:edure for NRC Enforcement Actions, 10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C, as revised. 49 FR 83a3 (March 8,1984) and pursuant to section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2282, Pub. L. 80-295, and 10 CFR 2.205, the particular violations and associated civil penalty are set forth below. -A. Technical Specification 6.5.1, requires that the Plant Operations Review Committee (PORC) function to advise the Station Superintendent on all proposed changes or modifications to plant systems or equipment that affect nuclear safety. Technical Specification 6.5.2 requires that the Nuclear Review Board (NRB) shall function to provide independent review and audit of activities, including safety evaluations for changes completed under the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59. Contrary to the above, both the PORCand the NRB conducted inadequate reviews of a plant design change request for the refueling cavity seal. Specifically, in January 1983, Plant Design Change REquest PDCR-461 was implemented involving replacement of the steel plate refueling cavity seal with a newly designed seal which included inflatable boot seals. Even though the new design created the possibility of a different seal malfunction and susceptability to physical damage other than was credible with the previous all-metal seal desi;gn, the PORC did not advise the Station Superintendent that such was the case and the NEB did not provide an independent raview of this aspect. In the written safety evaluation which certified compliance with 10 CFR 50.59, and in the associated PORC and NRB review3, a rationale was not provided for the erroneous conclusion that there was no possibility of a different malfunction. B. 10 CFR 50, Appendix B. Criterion III. requires establishment of measures to assure that appropriate quality standards are specified and included in design documents and that the design control measures provide for verifying or checking the adequacy of design by design review,4 calculations, or suitable testing. Contrary to the above, appropriate quality standards were not specified nor included in design documents for a design change performed in 1933 to the refueling cavity seal and the design review did not provide adequate verification of the design. Specifically, rubber boot seals were included in the new design, replacing an all metal seal, without those boots being specified or suitably tested to withstand refueling cavity water pressure with an adequate safety margin and the reviews of the design failed to identify this deficiency. These violations have been categorized in the aggregate as a Severity Level II problem (Supplement U). (Cumulative Civil Penalty--30,000 assessed equally among the violations.) Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 2.201, Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company is hereby required to submit within 30 days of the date of this Notice, a written statement or explanation, including for each alleged violation: (1) admission or denial of the alleged violation; (2) the reasons for the violation, if admitted. (3] the corrective steps which have been talcen and the results achieved: (4] the corrective steps which will be taken to avoid further violations; (5) the date when full compliance will be achieved.49527 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices Considerations may-be given to, extending the response time for good cause shown. Under the authority of Section 182 of the Act, U.S.C. 2232, this response shall be submitted under oath or affirmation. Within the same time as provided for the response required above under 10 CFR 2.201, Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company may pay the civil penalty in the amount of $80,000 or may protest imposition of the civil penalty in whole or in part by a written answer. Should Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company fail to answer within the time specified, the Deputy Director, Office of Inspection andEnforcement. will issue an order imposing the civil penalty in the amount proposed above. Should Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company elect to file an answer in accordance with CFR 2.205 protesting the civil penalty, such answer may: (1) deny the violations listed in the Notice on whole or in part; (21 demonstrate extenuating circumstances- (3) show error in this Notice; or show other reasons why the penalty should not be imposed. In addition to protesting the civil penalty in whole or in part, such answer may request remission or mitigation of the penalty. In requesting mitigation of the proposed penalty, the five factors contained in, section V. B of the revised 10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C should be addressed.

Paul Cotter, Jr., Chief AdmiusfratlvejudgeAlomlcSafety Sacramento Municipal Utility District; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating Ucense and Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination and Opportunity for Hearing The.U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the'Commission] is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR- 54, issued to Sacramento Municipal Utility District (the licensee); for operation of the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station located in Sacramento County, California. The amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to allow on a one time only basis, the extension of the definition of refueling interval from 18 months to two months beyond the maximum 25% extension for performance of the refueling interval surveillance test of the Reactor Internal Vent Valves..The temporary definition of the refueling interval for the ReactorInternal Vent Valves will expire on startup from the 1985 refueling outage, Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated-, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. TheRancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station has experienced a number of unscheduled shutdowns (outages) n recent months due to steam generator leaks. As a result of these shutdowns, the expected refueling outage was extended until March 1905. Therefore, the 18-month refueling interval since the last refueling outage plus the 25%, extension provided for in the current Technical Specifications will be exceeded. Since surveillance of the Reactor Vent Valves necessitates removal of the ReactorVessel Head and the Reactor Vessel Head was not removed during any of the unscheduled outages, the ventvalves could not be surveilled. All other surveillance schedules for the planned 1985 refueling outages were completed during the unscheduled outages. The licensee has Inspected its previous surveillance records for past inspections and found only one case where the reactor or vessel internal vent valves degraded. HoWever, the valves were still operational and still capable of performing their Intended function. In addition, the proposed two month extension in thesurveillance Interval for the internal vent valves will be small compared to, the allowed interval under the current Technical Specifications, Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated or a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Because no changes in operating conditions will result from the increase in' the surveillance interval, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or diffekent.kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, Because no changes In anyII I ' I49528 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1934 / Notices accident analyses will result from the increase in the surveillance interval, the proposed amendment does not involve any increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. On these bases, the NRC staff proposes to determine that this proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commission will not normally make a final determination unless it receives a request for a hearing. Comments should be addressed to the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555, ATTN: Docketing and Service Branch. By January 22, 1985, the license may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a-party in the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Request for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's \"Rule's of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings\" in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave for intervene shall set -forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding and how that interest may be affected by thi results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; [2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which thepetitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contention set forthwith reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and crozs-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination Is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it effective, notvithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hesing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would tahe place before the issuance of any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notic3 pEriod. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action.it will publish a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a heaing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action vill occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed v.ith the Secretary of the Commission. US. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20355.

All interested persons are referted to the application on file with the Commission for a statement of the representations contained therein, which are summarized below, and to the Act and rules thereunder for the complete text of the applicable provisions. Applicant states that the Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ziegler, a publicly traded financial services holding company with ten directors, no employees, and no substantial business enterprise other than the ownership of Ziegler and four other subsidiaries. Applicant also states that appro.imately 70 percent of the Ziegler's income is derived from the activities of the Adviser. Applicant represents that it maintains a continuous public offering of its shares at their respective net asset value plus a sales load ranging from 4.5 percent to 0.5 percent of the offering price, depending upon the dollar amount of the purchase. Applicant further represents that, pursuant to Rule 2d-1 under the Act, five directors of Ziegler who are also directors of the Adviser may purchase Applicant's shares at net asset value without a sales charge. Applicant proposes to sell its shares at a reduced sales load of 0.5 percent to the remaining five directors of Zic1elr w-ho are not directors of the Adviser (\"Ziegler Directors\").

After tle determination is made as to which tenders are accepted, an interest rate vAil bu established, on the basis of a 1, of one percent increment, which results in an equivalent average accepted price close to 1CO.00 and a lowest accepted price above the original issue discount limit of (3.591. That rate of interestv il be paid on all of the securities. Based on such interest rate, the price on each competitive tender allotted will be determined and each successful competitive bidder will be required to pay the price equivalent to the yield bid Those submitting noncompetitive tend&r, will pay the price equivalent to the weighted average yield of accepted competitive tenders. Price calculations r.ill be carried to three decimal places on the basis of price per hundred, e.g., 23.923, and the determinations of the Secretary of the Treasury shall be final. If the amount of noncompetitive tenders received would absorb all or most of the offering, competitive tenders vill be accepted in an amount sufficient to provide a fair determination of the yield. Tenders received from Government accounts and Federal Reserve Banks will be accepted at the price equivalent to the weighted average yield of accepted competitive tenders. 3.7. Competitive bidders will be advised of the acceptance or rejection of their tenders. Those submitting noncompetitive tenders will be notified only if the tender is not accepted in full, or when the price is over par. 4. Reservations 4.1. The Secretary of the Treasury exprossly reserves the right to accept oz reject any or all tenders in whole or in part, to allot more or less than the amount of securities specified in Section 1, and to make different percentage allotments to various classes of applicants when the Secretary considers it in the public interest. The Secretary's action under this Section is final. 5. Payment and Delivery 5.1. Settlement for allotted securities must be made at the Federal Reserve Bayk or Branch or at the Bureau of the Public Debt, wherever the tender was submitted.

In addition, Treasury Tax and Loan Note Option Depositaries may make payment for allotted securities for their own accounts and for account of customers by credit to their Treasury Tax and Loan Note Accounts on or before Monday. December 31,19K. When payment has been submitted with the tender and the purchase price of allotted securities is over par, settlement for the premium must be completed timely, as specified above. When payment has been submitted with the tender and the purchase price is under par, the discount will be remitted to the bidder. Payment will not be considered complete where registered securities are requested if the appropriate identifying number as required on tax returns and other documents submitted to the Internal Revenue Service Can individual's social security number or an employer identification number) is not furnished. When payment is made in securities, a cash adjustment will be made to or required of the bidder for any difference between the face amount of securities presented and the amount payable on the securities allotted. 5.2. In every case where full payment has not been completed on time, an amount of up to 5 percent of the face amount of securities allotted, shall, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, be forfeited to the United States. 5.3. Registered securities tendered in payment for allotted securities are not required to be assigned if the new securities are to be registered in the same names and forms as appear in the registrations or assignments of the securities surrendered. When the new securities are to be registered in names and forms different from those m the inscriptions or assignments of the securities presented, the assignment should be to \"The Secretary of the Treasury for (securities offered by-this circular) in the name of (name and taxpayer identifying number).\" Specific instructions for the issuance and delivery of the new securities, signed by the owner or authorized representative. must accompany the securities presented.

L 95-621) signed into law on November 9,1978, mandated a new framework for the regulation of most facets of the natural gas industry. In general, under Title II of the NGPA, interstate natural gas pipeline companies are required to pass through certain portions of their acquisition costs for natural gas to industrial users in the form of surcharge. The statute requires that the ultimate costs of gas to the industrial facility should not exceed the cost of the fuel oil which the facility could sue as an alternative. Pursuant to Title H of the NGPA, section 204(e), the Energy Information Administration (EIA) herewith publishes for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) computed natural gas ceiling prices and the high cost gas incremental pricing threshold which are to be effective January 1, 1985. These prices are based on the prices of alternative fuels. For further information contact: Leroy Brown, Jr., Energy Information Administration, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Room BE-034, Washington, D.C. 30585 Telephone: (202) 252-6077 Section I As required by FERC Order No. 50, computed prices are shown for the 48 contiguous States. The District of Columbia's ceiling is included with the ceiling for the State of Maryland. FERC, by an Interim Rule issued on March 2, 1981, in Docket No. R.M79-21, revised the methodology for calculating the monthly alternative fuel price ceilings for State regions. Under the revised methodology, the applicable alternative fuel price ceiling published for eachof the contiguous fuel price ceiling published for each of the contiguous States shall be the lower of the alternative fuel price ceiling for the State or the alternative fuel price ceiling for the multistate region in which the State is located. The price ceiling is expressed in dollars per million British Thermal Units(BTU's). The method used to determine the price ceiling is described in Section III. 4 16GC!Cr -d 2 43 PorBi 42Agu.............. 4 G:ha 415 wa 131. Ln1.97 per barrl.n 2~0 Rm :=:rAeveF.Gu J z :) m,:: Section ff. Incremental Pricing Threshold for High Cost Natural Gas The EIA has determined that the volume-weighted average price for No.2 distillate fuel oil landed in the greater New York City Metropolitan area during October 1984 was s31.97 per barrel. In order to establish the incremental pricing threshold for high cost natural gas, as identified in the NGPA Title 1, section 203(a)(7), this price was multiplied by 1.3 and converted to its equivalent in millions of BUT's by dividing by 5.8. Therefore, the incremental pricing threshold for high cost natural gas, effective January 1, 1985, is $7.17 per million BUT's. Section IL Method Used to Compute Price Ceilings The FERC, by Order No. 50, Issued on September 29, 1979, in Docket No. RM79-21, established the basis fordetermining the price ceilings required by the NGPA. FERC also, by Order No. 167, issued in Docket No. RIM81-27 on July 24,1931. made permanent the rule that established that only the price paid for No. 6 high sulfur content residual fuel oil would be used to determine the price ceilings. In addition, the FERC, by Order No. 181, Issued on October 6, 1931, in Docliet No. M 81-8, established that price ceilings should be' published for only the 48 contiguous States on a permanent basis. A. Data Collected The following data were required from all companies identified by the EIA as sellers of No. 6 high sulfur content (greater than I percent sulfur content by weight) residual fuel oil: for each selling price, the number of gallons sold to large industrial users in the months of August 1924, September 1934. and October 194.1 All rcports of volume sold and price were identified by the State into which the oil was sold. B. Methad Used to Determine Alternatire Price Ceilings (1) Calculation of Volume-Weighted Price The price which will become effective January 1,1935, (shown in Section !) are based on the reported price of No. 6 high sulfur content residual fuel oil, for each of the 48 continguous states, for each of the 3 months, August 1934, September 1924, and October 1934. Reported prices for sales in August 1934 were adjusted by the percent change in the nationwide volume-weighted average price from August 1934 to October 1934. Prices for September 1934 were similarly adjusted by the precent change in the nationwide volume-r. eighted average price from September 1934 to October 194. The volume-weighted 3-month average of the adjusted August 1934 and September 1934, and the reported October 1934 prices were then computed for each State. (2) Adjustment for Price Variation States were grouped into the regions Identified by the FERC (see Section 111.C.]. Using the adjusted prices and associated volumes reported in a region during the 3-month period, the volume- weighted standard deviation of prices was calculated for each region. The volume-weighted 3-month average price ipusao tuI'fc oil in qusn!ti:s of 40 aeOg ,s er j:catcr for consumption in a busines. indudingilhue exclud.d_49535 Federal Register / VoL 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices -, (as calculated in Section Ill.B.(1) above) for each State was adjusted downward by two times this standard deviation for the region to form the adjusted weighted average price for the State. (3) Calculation of Ceiling Price The lowest selling price within the State was determined for each month of the 3-month period (after adjusting up or down by the percent change in oil prices at the national level as discussed in Section III.B.(1) above). The products of the adjusted low price for each month times the State's total reported sales volume for each month were summed over thd3-month period for each State and divided by the State's total sales volume during the 3 months to determine the State's average low price. The adjusted weight average price (as calculated in Section IILB.(2)) was compared to this average low price, and the higher of the values was selected as the base for determining the alternative fuel price ceiling for each State. For those States which had no reported sales during one or more months of the 3-month period, the appropriate regional volume-weighted alternative fuel price was computed and used in combaination with the available State data to calculate the State alternative fuel price ceiling base. The State's alternative fuel price ceiling base was compared to the alternative fuel price ceiling base for the multistate region in which the State is located and the lower of these two prices was selected as the final alternative fuel price ceiling base for the State. The appropriate lag adjustment factor [as discussed in Section ILB.4) was then applied to the alternative fuel price ceiling base. The alternative fuel price (expressed in dollars per gallon) was multiplied by 42 and divided by 6.3 to estimate the alternative fuel price ceiling for the State (expressed in dollars per million BTU's). There were insufficient sales reported in Region G for the months of August 1984, September 1984, and October 1984. The alternative fuel price ceilings for the States in Region G were determined by calculating the volume-weighted average price ceiling for Region E,Region F, Region G, and Region H. (4) Lag Adjustment The EIA has implemented a procedure to partially compensate for the two- month lag between the end of the month for which data are collected and the beginning of the month for which ceiling prices become effective. It was determined that Platt's Oilgram Price Report publication provides timely information relative to the subject. The prices found in Platt's Oilgram Price Report Publication are given for each trading day in the form of high and low prices- for No. 6 residual oil in 20 cites throughout the United States. The low posted prices for No. 6 residual oil in these cities were used to calculate a national lag adjustment factor was obtained by calculating a weighted average price for No. 6 high sulfur residual fuel oil for the ten trading days ending December 14,1984, and dividing that price by the corresponding weighted average price computed from prices published by Plalt's for the month of October 1984. A regional lag adjustment factor was similarly calculated for four regions. These are: One for FERC Regions A and B combined; one for FERC Region C; one for FERC Regions D. E, and G combined; and one for FERC Regions F and H -combined. The lower of the national or regional lag factor was then applied to the alternative fuel price ceiling for each State in a given region as calculated in Section 1LB43). Listing of States by Region States were grouped by the.,FERC to form eight distinct regions as follows: Region A Connecticut Maine Massachusetts New Hampshire Rhode Island Vermont- C Alabama Floinda Georgia Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee VirginiaRegion B Delaware Maryland New Jersey New York Pennsylvania D Illinois, Indiana Kentucky Michligan Ohio West Virginia WisconsinRegion E Iowa Kansas Missouri Minnesota Nebraska North Dakota South Dakota G Colorado Idaho Montana Utah WyomingRegion F Arkansas Louisiana New Mexlco Oklahoma Texas H Arizona California Nevada Orccon Washington, Issued in Washington, D.C., December 18, 1984.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 1. Previous Notice of Intent DOE published a Notice of Intent (49 FR 47801] on December 6, 1984, regarding the intention to issue the draft EAs for public review and comment and to conduct public hearings and information meetings. II. Background By the end of this century, the United States plans to begin operation of a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.\" Pub. L. 97-425, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (the Act], specifies the process for selecting a repository site and assigns to DOE the responsibility for locating, constructing, operating, closing, and decommissioning the repository. After the final EAs are issued, the Secretary of Energy will, in accordance with the Act, nominate at least five (5) sites as suitable for characterization, i.e. suitable for futher study. The Secretary of Energy will then recommend not fewer than three (3] of the nominated sites to the President for characterization as candidate sites for the first repository. As part of the site characterization program, DOE intends to construct one or more exploratory shafts at-each of the recommended sites to the depth of the proposed repository and then intends to conduct tests at that depth to determine whether subsurface conditions will allow construction ofa repository that will safely isolate radioactive wastes.After characterization is completed, DOE will again evaluate each site in terms of the guidelines, complete an environmental impact statement, and recommend one site to the President for the first repository. The President may then recommend the site to Congress, At this point, the host State may Issue a notice of disapproval that can be overriden only by a resolution of both Houses of Congress. If the notice of disapproval is not overridden, the President must submit another repository site recommendation within 12 months. If no notice of disapproval is submitted, or if the notice of disapproval is overridden, then, as prescribed by the Act, the site designation is effective, and DOE will proceed to file an application with the NRC to obtain a construction authorization for a repository at that site. II. Siting Guidelines In accordance with the Act, DOE issued general guidelines for the recommendation of sites for nuclear waste repositories on December 6, 1084, (49 FR 47714]. The guidelines establish performance objectives for a geologic repository system, define the basic technical requirements that candidate sites must meet, and specify how the DOE will implement its site-selection process. IV. Content of the EAs The Act requires that DOE prepare EAs to accompany site nominations. The draft EAs contain the following kinds of information and evaluations to meet the requirements of the Act: * A description of the decision process which led to nomination; * A description of the site and Its surroundings;. * An evaluation of the effects of site characterization at such site on the public health and safety and the environment;\"e An assessment of the regional and local impacts of locating the proposed repository at the site; * An evaluation as to whether the site is suitable for site characterization: * An evaluation as to whether the site is suitable for development as a repository; and * A reasonable comparative evaluation of the site with other sites and locations that have been considered. V. Comment Procedures A. Availability of Draft EAs Copies of the draft EAs have been distribdted to Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as to organizations49540 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices and individuals which have requested information about the nuclear waste repository siting process.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Registration Standards program is EPA's approach to the reassessment and reregistration of pesticides as mandatedby Congress in section 3(g) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The 48,000 pesticide products currently registered by EPA are grouped into 600 distinct active ingredients. The scientific data base underlying each chemical is thoroughly reviewed, and essential but missing scientific studies are identified. The Teassessment may; require new testing or retesting to ensure the safety of the compound by contemporary scientific standards. The results of the review are reflected in a Registration Standard, which states the regulatory position resulting from the review, the rationale for that position, additional data needed to complete the assessment, and label warnings or other regulatory restrictions resulting from the review. A Special Review is initiated when the Agency believes that a pesticide may pose an unreasonable adverse effect on man or the environment, The purpose of this notice is to Inform the public of measures being implemented to improve the process and to announce the schedule for reviewing pesticides under the Registration Standards program. This document lists chemicals reviewed in FY 84 and those currently being reviewed, provides an opportunity for persons to present and elaborate on data pertinent to the reviews, and explains how information resulting from the reviews can be obtained. It provides registrants an opportunity to inform EPA If they are not planning to support the chemicals under review. Registrants should also inform EPA if they are not willing to support specific use patterns for these chemicals. This notice also lists Special Review outputs for FY 84 and scheduled outputs for FY 85, the Data Call-In schedule and list of required data as of September 30,1984. The public is encouraged to provide information relevant to the Ageny's review of pesticides. Typically,\" information should be in one or more of , the following categories: human toxicology, residue chemistry, product chemistry, environmental fate, human exposure or ecological effects. L The Process and Schedule for Reregistration Review EPA is implementing measures for reregistration which will serve two purposes: (1) To assure that key data are available at the time of the initial review. (2) To move up in the review queue those chemicals which have the greatest49544 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, _19Z4 / Notices potential for causing unreasonable adverse effects. A. Assuring That Key Data Are Available for the InitialReviei, 1. Chronic toxicity data call-in for food use chemicals. Since 1981, the Agency has been requiring registrants to generate data to fill gaps in the eyisting long-term chronic toxicity data base. These data include chronic effects. oncogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive effects. These studies generally take the longest time to generate of all those which could be required. They are needed routinely for food use chemicals, and are most likely -to form the basis of a Special Review should risk-related concerns be identified. The Agency has been calling in these data for about 70 chemicals per year, which is almost three times the rate at which chemicals are undergoing Registration Standard review. At the current rate, the call-in of chronic toxicity data for food use chemicals would be completed by 1987. However, the Agency has assigned additional resources to this project to complete the notification of registrants in FY 85. 2. Product chemistry data cal-in. Withbut adequate and up-to-date product chemistry data, it is difficult for OPP scientists to characterize a chemical adequately so as to identify the types of data needed for a full health -and safety assessment. Thus, when the Registration Standard review begins, it is essential that the.product chemistry data set for the active ingredient is complete, including the Confidential Statement ofFormula. It is also necessary to identify products which contain particular inert ingredients of concern and registrants who are responsible forgenerating generic chemical data. The product chemistry data call-in will be completed in FY 85. 3. Require registrants to identify and fill data gaps. One way to generate data .quickly and to reduce the Agency resources spent in identifying data gaps is to require registrants to identify and fill data requirements. The Agency has not yet instituted a Data Call-In program for non-food use-chemicals. But under a pilot program in FY 85, registrants of certain non-food use chemicals will be required to apply Agency data guidelines to their chemicals, identify which use patterns they are willing to support and which data are applicable to their chemical's use pattern, determine-which data have already been submitted to the Agency, and identify what data gaps remain to be -filled. Registrants then must commit to and generate-any missing data in advance of Agency review of existingdata. Depending on the results of the pilot program, this approach may be expanded to other non-food use chemicals in the future. B. Assign Priority to Chemicals With the Greatest Potentialfor Causing Unreasonable Adveroe Effects The current ranling scheme for Registration Standards groups the approximately 600 active ingredients into 48 use clusters based on their predominant use pattern. Each chemoical was scored based on an equation talin- into account production, potential human exposure, and potential ecological exposure factors. The ranling scheme was heavily veighted toward food uses. as requested by Congress. Once each chemical was rated, each cluster was given a score based on the average score for chemicals in the cluster. Clusters were then ranked in descending order of their scores. Originaliy. EPA anticipated that human toidcity would be a factor in the ranking equation. However, upon examination, it was found that for many chemicals there were insufficient data on which to base such a ranking and the effort to review available data in order to assign a score would be too resource- intensive. Thus, the equation was limited to factors such as volume and registered use patterns, which were easily accessible and could act as surrogate indicators of potential risk. The following revisions to the ordering scheme will be made to en.tue that chemicals with the greatest potential to cause unreasonable adverse effects are reviewed first: 1. Defer lo6w\" volume or other.'ise lo;v priority chemicals. Some of the chemicals in a use cluster have large market shares and others have very low market shares. Chemicals with inherently limited utility would probably not have increased exposure even with changes in the availability of competing chemicals. Where this is the case, and there Is no known hazard associated with the chemical, its review will be deferred. 2. Accelerate reie;i schedule for chemicals w.ith identifiedadveme effects. FIFRA section 6(a)[2) requires registrants to submit data or other information to the Agency which show the chemical to present potentially unreasonable adverse effects. The Agency is currently strengthening its policy regarding the use of sections 6(a)(2) and 3(c(2)(B) to require registrants to submit data showing certain types of effects, such as excess residues on food or feed crops or ground water contamination for immediate Agency attention. Depending on theoutcome of EPA's review of submitted data, the chemical may be scheduled for early Registration Standard review. 3. Accelerate review schedule for chemical with ground water contamination potantial. The Agency has completed the call-in of data nececoary to assess the ground water contamination potential of over 149 peoticides. When the data are received, the Agency will assess each chemical's potential for contaminating ground water and pesticides with such potential will ba considered for early review. 4. Accelerate revieIw of chemicals with to-eranceprablems. A number of chemicals have tolerances which were cet wvhEr little or no residue data were available, tolerance exemptions which can no longer be justified. interim tolerances, or theoretical maximum rwidue concentrations which exceed the acceptable daily intake, based on FDA'S market basket of the typical American diet. These chemicals will also be considered for accelerated Registration Standard review. All of these actions are designed to accelerate the reregistration review of pesticidea with the greatest potential for causing concern. IL Data Submittal and Issuance of Standards and Fact Sheets Registration Standards were completed for the following chemicals the followin- table are scheduled for Registration Standard review in FY 85; pertinent information should be submitted and Standards issued by the dates listed.

Special Review Outputs When scientific studies suggest that a chemical may meet or exceed a risk criterion, the chemical is subject to Special Review. In the initial investigation, if a risk criterion is met, the validation if the trigger studies combined with the exposure analysis produces the Agency's preliminary position on a pesticide's potential risk. The document describing this position Is -referred to as position document one (PD 1). After a PD 1 is published, there Is a comment period during which stated risks may be rebutted. If all trigger studies are successfully rebutted, the pesticide is returned to the registration process and the Special Review is terminated for all or some of the uses. The results of this phase are incorporated into'a second position document (PD 2) which states the Agency's regulatory action for the pesticide. If rebuttals are successful for all or some of the uses, a PD 2 Is published as the final document of the Special Review. When rebuttals are not successful, the rebuttal assessment, risk analysis, benefits analysis, risk/benefit synthesis and the proposed regulatory position are presented in a document termed PD 2/3. The proposed decision (PD 2/3) is submitted to a Scientific Advisory Panel for review of its scientific basis and to the Secretary of Agriculture for comment. These comments, plus any industry or public comments on the49546 I , Ii i Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Notices proposed decision, Are evaluated, The Agency's assessment of these comments and the final decision on the regulatory action are contained in a document termed PD 4.SPECIAL REVIEW IN FISCAL YEA Continued Chemical The Agency may deviate from the Lvadex................................ aforementioned procedures and issue P lentachorophenol (wood use) ........................... documents simultaneously, for example, as long as circumstances necessitate The following table lists che such action and there is compliance he foreialeie with FIFRA. scheduled for Special Reviewand the position documents scl The following table lists chemicals the issu n du t which were subject to Special Review in FY 84 and the position documents which SPECIAL REVIEW IN FISCAL YEA were issued that year.

ACTIOr: Amendment to rule. SUMMARY: This amendment modifies the irrigation ditch exemption contained in -EPA's Section 404 State Program Regulations, 40 CFR 233.35(a](3), to ensure consistency with the recently modified Corps of Engineers' regulation on the same subject, 33 CFR 323.4(a)(3). The modification clarifies the extent to which facilities appurtenant to irrigation ditches are included in the exemption. This modification was approved by EPA and adopted by the Corps of Engineers as a final rule following notice and comment rulemaking pursuant to the settlement agreement in National Wildlife Federation v. Marsh. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 20,1984. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. John W. Meagher, Office of Federal Activities (A-104), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20460, (202) 382-5043. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Arfny Corps of Engineers (Corps) bothdescribe the extent of the Section 404W0 exemption from permit requirements for discharges of dredged or fill materials under the Clean Water Act. In particular, 33 CFR 323.4(a)(3) of the Corps' regulations and 40 CFR 233.35(a)(3) of the EPA regulations address the Section 404[(f(1](C) exemption relating to irrigation ditches. These regulatory provisions are intended to be consistent with one another. As a result of the recent settlement agreement in National Wildlife Federation v. Marlh, No. 82- 3632 [D.D.C., complaint filed December 22,1982), a number of changes, including 33 CFR 323.4(a)(3), were proposed to the Corps' regulations on March 29, 1934. Fojlowing rulemaldng, the proposed clarification to Section 323.4(a)(3) was approved by EPA and was promulgated by the Corps on October 5,1984, at 49 FR 39482. Accordingly, to bring its regulations up-to-date, EPA is incorporating the revised exemption language into 40 CER 233.35(a)(3), effective today. As explained in more detail in the preamble to the Corps' revised regulation at 49 FR 39479, this change is intended to clarify the extent to which facilities related to irrigation ditches are eligible for the irrigation ditch exemption. I have determined that it is unnecessary to provide notice and comment on this change to 40 CFR 233.35(a)(3), because it merely incorporates a substantive change which has already been the subject of notice and comment rulemakingpursuant to the settlement agreement and because EPA approved the final irrigation exemption wording pursuant to that rulemaldng, in accordance with our responsibility for the administrative interpretation of section 404(f' of the Clean Water Act.

Background On May 19,1980, as part of its regulations implementing Section 3001 of RCRA, EPA published a list of hazardous wastes generated from specific \"sources. This list has been amended several times, and is published in 40 CFR 261.32. EPA proposes to add to the list four wastes generated during the manufacture of 1,1- dimethylhydrazine (also known as unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, or UDMH) from carboxylic acid hydrazides. These wastes are column bottoms from products separation, condensed column overheads from products separation and condensed reactor vent gases, spent filter cartridges from production purification, and condensed column overheads from intermediate separation. The hazardous constituent in all of these wastes is UDMH, which is present in significant concentrations. UDMH is carcinogenic, teratogenic, and I mutagenic. In addition, the condensed column overheads from product separation and condensed vent gases from the reactors contain methanol in sufficient concentrations to make this waste ignitable (flash point=52-55 OF.) See 40 CFR \u00a7 261.21(a)(1). Also, the column bottoms from product separation contain sodium hydroxide in sufficient concentrations to make this waste corrosive (pH=13-14]. See 40 CFR 261.22(a)(1). These wastes consequently are of particular environmental concern. EPA has evaluated these wastes against the criteria for listing hazardous wastes (40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)), and has determined that: (1) They typically contain high concentrations of UDMH; (2) this toxicant is mobile mismanagement, and may reach environmental receptors, and (3) the wastes are generated in large volumes and have the potential to be mismanaged. UDMH is covered by other EPA regulations (i.e., 40 CFR 261.33(o, as EPA Hazardous Waste No. U098) as well as by regulations of other governmental agencies. The Agency believes, therefore, that these wastes are capable of posing a substantial present or potential threat to human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed, and thus-are hazardous wastes. 1I. Summary of the Proposed Regulation A. List of Wastes This proposed regulation would list as hazardous four wastes generated during' the productibri of UDMH from carboxylic acid hydrazides. These wastes are:* from carboxylic acid hydrazines. * K10--Condensed column overheads from product separation and condensed reactor vent gases from the production of 1, 1- dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) from carboxylic acid hydrazines. * K109-Spent filter cartridges from product purification from the production of 1, 1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) from 6arboxylic acid hydrazines. & Kl0-Condensed column overheads from intermediate separation from the production of 1, 1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) from carboxylic acid hydrazines. Currently, only one manufacturer, Uniroyal Corporation, uses this proprietary process to produce UDMH. Available information in the Section 3007 RCRA Industry Studies data base indicates that approximately 4,970 kkg (metric tons] per year of lotal wastes would be covered by this proposed regulation. The major contaminant of concern in these wastes in UDMH, which is currently listed in Appendix VIII of Part 261. The wastes are formed as residuals as several points in an integrated series of reactors and associated purification units using carboxylic acid hydrazide feedstock. The first listed waste (K107) is the column bottoms from the final purification step to produce commercial UDMH, and contains approximately 0.01% UDMH (100 parts per million], Approximately 2,810 kkg of this waste are generated annually and managed by deep well injection. The second listed waste (K108) Is a combination. of condensed column overheads from the final product purification and condensed vent gases from the chemical reactors used to synthesize UDMH. This waste contains between 1-10% UDMH (10,000-100,000 parts per million). Approximately 91 kkg are generated annually and also managed by deep well Injection. The third listed waste (K109) is spent filter cartridges from product purification, and is estimated by the Agency to contain between 40-50% UDMH. The filter cartridges used to purify a small fraction of the UDMH manufactured, and have not required disposal yet. Uniroyal intends to dispose of these in a secure landfill, The fourth listed waste (1K110) is from the condensation of separation column overheads from an intermediate purification step before final UDMH- synthesis. This waste may contain from a few parts per million to as high as 100 parts per million UDMH, based on a potential for trace contamination, More definitive concentration information49556 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Proposed Rules would need to be supplied by Uniroyal if there is any reason to believe that this waste may not contain environmentally significant UDMH concentrations. Approximately 1,250 kkg of this waste are produced annually and currently managed as a hazardous waste by off- site incineration. The Listing Background Document (available from the Public Docket at EPA Headquarters-see \"ADDRESSES\" section-and from the EPA Regional Libraries] and the sources cited there describe this production process in detail. Sections of the Background Document, however, are confidential business information (CBI); these sections are not available to the public, and will be deleted. The Agency has made a preliminary estimate that persons face a one per million increased risk of cancer as a result of a lifetime daily dose of 1.15X 10-7 milligrams UDMIH per kilogram for a seventy kilogram man (U.S. EPA, 1980-1984). The basis for this estimate is explained further in the Listing Background Document The corresponding concentration in drinking water ingested over a lifetime resulting in a one-per-million increased risk of cancer is 4.03X10 milligrams per liter (parts per million), or 4.03X 10-20 percent. The concentrations of UDMH in these wastes are many orders of magnitude greater than the levels related to this human health risk. If the condensed column overheads from product separation (the least contaminated waste) were contaminated with even one part per million UDMH, then the concentration would approach one million times the level related to human health risks in drinking water. UDMH is soluble in water in all proportions (miscible) (U.S. EPA, 1980- 1984) and is present in wastes which are liquids. The UDMH in the wastos thus has a high mobility and migratory potential. In addition, under conditions typical of waste mismanagement, UDMH is persistent enough to cause harmful exposures. Only a fraction of the toxicant present in these wastes need migrate and reach environmental receptors to pose the potential for substantial harm. UDMH's low octanol-water partition coefficient and complete miscibility with water indicate that UDH in any waste contacting soil may migrate and contaminate ground water without being absorbed onto the soil matrix. UDMH has been shown to leach and migrate in experimental soil columns (Braun, 1983). The primary degradation mechanism of UDMH in the unsaturated soil zone oraerated surface waters is expected to be oxidation, presumably with dissolved oxygen and free radicals. n the absence of microbial degradation the half-life of UDh-I was reported to be 10 to 14 days in ponds and seawaters (Zirrolli, 1983). In anaerobic conditions, such as in ground water, however, UDMH has the potential for persisting for much longer periods. UDMH was found Jo be extremely stable in distilled water (Braun, 1933). The potential for aerobic biodegradation of UDMH in water has not been explored thoroughly, but may be minor relative to oxidation under neutral to basic conditions. UDMH oxidation was found to proceed at the same rate in sterile or non-sterile lake water as well as in pure distilled water (Banerjee; 1977,1981). Under anaerobic conditions, the loss of UDMH with anaerobic bacteria was 26 after a six- day bioassay. Biodegradation of UDMH may also be limited by its toicity; aerobic bacterial degradation was inhibited when UDMH concentrations were as low as 20 parts per million (Kane, 1983). UDMH could also be released to the atmosphere by evaporation from spills, leaks, and venting during loading, transfer, storage, or treatment. Evaporation of UDMH from water solutions are expected to be significant (MacNaughton, 1975; Stauffer, 1977). Once volatilized, UDMH may degrade by reaction with hydroxyl radicals (Pitts, 1931), N02 or ozone (Tuazon, 1982). 1, 1-Dimethylnitrosamine is a potential degradation product of UDMH in the environment, and has also been determined by the U.S. CAG to be a potential human carcinogen.1 A major product of the reaction of UDMH with ozone.(Tuazon, 1982); however, 1.1- dimethylnitrosamine appears to degrade rapidly in the atmosphere by sunlight (Hanst, 1977; Callahan 1979, Tuazon, 1932). The formation of 1,1- dimethylnitrosamine may also result from the oxidation of concentrated aqueous solutions of UDIMH (Banerjee, 1981), such as would result from spills. The subsequent environmental degradation of 1, 1-dimethylnitrosamine is expected to be significantly longer than that of UDMNH in water and soil (Tate, 1975; Callahan. 1- dimethInitrzamln a a toxdcant of conccrn because of uncertainty of V3 0 to.xcant of concern.The U.S. EPA's Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG) has determined that UDMH is a potential human carcinogen. For example, when UDMIH was administered orally, it produced angiosarcomas, pulmonary adenomas or adenocarcinomas, malignant lymphomas, and kidney adenomas in male and female Swiss mice (Toth: 1972, 1973); tumors in the cecum and blood in Syrian golden hamsters (Toth, 1977); lung tumors in female Swiss mice (Roe, et al, 1957); and liver tumors in rats (Druckrey, et al], 1957). UDMH is also teratogenic. Teratogenic effects were observed in South African clawed toad larvae, Xenopus iaevis, following continuous embryonis exposure to )jgl (Greenhouse. 1976). UDMH was teratogenic during the neurolation period of embryogenesis, and the malformations affected the head, trunk and tail; the-most frequent malformation was tail kinks. The overall weight of evidence from a variety of microbial and mammalian assays indicates that UDMH is also mutugenic. In numerous Ames Salmonella assays, results were generally inconsistent, blthough most prositive reponses were observed with strain TA93, a frameshift mutant (Bruce, 1979; Parodi et o.. 191; de Flora, 1931). In mutagenesis assays with cultured mouse lymphoma cells, UDMH caused forward mutation to thymidine (Brusick. 1976; 1981), but not to ouabain, thioguanine or cytosine arabinoside resistance (Rogers. 1931). Unscheduled DNA synthesis occurred in human embryonic lung cells that were treated with UDMH in vitro (Brusick, 1976), and in vivo exposure to UDMHI inhibited testicular DNA synthesis in mice (Seiler, 1977). In vivo treatment of mice also caused DNA fragmentation in liver and lung cells (Parodi, 1981). but did not induce micronuclei in bone marrow cells (Bruce, 1979) or sperm abnormalities (Bruce, 1979; Wyrobek, 1975). UDMH is rapidly absorbed from the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, injection sites, and skin. Rats exposed to UDMI had grand mal seizures, brain glycogen degradation, and inhibition of glutamic acid decarboxylase (U.S. EPA, 1984). The potential of this contaminant to cause harm to human health and the environment is described in more detail in the listing Background Document, and the Health and Environmental Effects Profile (available at the RCRA Public Docket at EPA Headquarters (see \"ADDRESSES\" section) and at EPA Regional Libraries).49557 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 2G, 1984 / Proposed Rules In summary, and as detailed-in the listing Background Document, these wastes typically contain UDMH at concentrations that are of concern, the toxicant in these wastes is capable of migrating from the waste, persisting in the environment, and reaching environmental receptors,'so are capable of causing substantial harm if mismanaged. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to add these wastes to the hazardous waste list in 40 CFR 261.32. B. Test Methods for Compounds Added to Appendix V11 In 49 FR 38786-38809, October 1, 1984, the Agency proposed test methods (both those newly designed, as well as those previously available in SW-846) for use in detecting specified substances by applicants who wish to conduct waste evaluation in support of delisting petitions, and by owners or operators of hazardous waste management facilities who must conduct ground-water monitoring (see 40 CFR \u00a7 264.99) or incinerator monitoring (see 40 CFR \u00a7 264.341). These methods will, upon promulgation, be included in 40 CFR Part 261, Appendix IIl. In this proposal, Method Number 8250 was designated for testing for UDMH. This method is in \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste: Physical/ Chemical Methods,\", $W-846, 2nd ed.. July 1982, as amended; available from: Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402 (202) 783-3238, Document Number 055-002-81001-2. III. CERCLA Impacts All hazardous wastes designated by today's proposed rule will, if made final, automatically become hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). (See CERCLA Section 101(14).) CERCLA requires that persons in charge of vessels or facilities from which hazqrdous substances have been released in quantities that are equal to or greater than the reportable quantities (RQs) immediately notify the National Response Center of the release. (See CERCLA Section 103, and 48 FR 23552- 23605. May 25,1983.) For those hazardous wastes containing constituents which already have been assigned RQs, the RQ assigned to the waste will represent the lowest RQ associated with the hazardous constituents. Since 1,1- dimethylhydrazine,2 the only hazardous, 2 Criteria are currently being developed for potential carcinogenssuch as UDMH to adjust theconstituent of the four wastes (1107, K108, K109 and Kilo) has a statutory RQ assigned at one pound, then all four wastes also have proposed statutory RQs of one pound. IV. State Authority Once a State receives interim or final authorization, it operates the RCRA program instead of EPA. If promulgated, this listing and the related-management standards will not apply in interim authorized States unless the State listed these UDMH wastes at the time it received interim authorization. Unless a State received final authorization on the basis of a universe of hazardous wastes which included these UDMH wastes, this listing and the related standards wquld not apply in States with final authorization until the State revises its program to add these UDMH wastes to the universe of hazardous wastes and the revision is approved by EPA. The process and schedule for State adoption of these regulations is described in 40 CFR \u00a7 271.21, as amended by 49 FR 21678-21682, May 22, 1984. If this proposed listing is made final, States which now-have .final authorization would have to revise their programs within one year from the date of promulgation if only regulatory changes are necessary and within two years from the date of promulgation if statutory changes are required. This deadline maybe extended in exceptional cases (see 40 CFR -271.21(e)(3)). States now in the process of applying for final authorization would be able to receive final authorization 'withoutincluding these UDMH wastes in their universe of hazardous wastes if the official state application is submitted less than 12 months after this listing, if made final, is promulgated. The date by which States must modify their programs is governed by 40 CFR 271.21(e)(iii). V. Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulation is \"major\" and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. The total additional incurred cost for disposal of the wastes as hazardous, is less than $2,00, well under the $100 million constituting a major regulation. This cost is insignificant and results from minimal additional compliance requirements as these wastes already are handled as if they were hazardous. .In addition, we do not expect that there will be an adverse impact on the one pound RQ to a level adequately protective of human health.ability of US.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markett. This proposed amendment is not a major regulation; therefore, no Regulatory Impact Analysis is being conducted. The proposed amendment was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12291, Any coniments from OMB to FPA, and any EPA responses to those comments, are available for public inspection in Room S-212A at EPA. VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of rule-making for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on small entities. The hazardous wastes proposed to be listed here are not generated by small entities (as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act), and the Agency dobs not believe that small entities will dispose of them in significant quantities. Accordingly, I hereby certify that this proposed amendment would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis (See 5 U.S.C. 603.) VII.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On May 19,1980, as part of its final and interim final regulationsimplementing Section 3001 of RCRA. EPA published a list of hazardous wastes generated from specific sources. This list has been amended several times, and is published in 40 CFR 261.32. EPA proposes to add to the list four wastes from the production of ethylenebisdithiocarbamic acid (EBDO) and its salts.1 These wastes are (1) aqueous wastes from product purification (K123), (2] reactor vent scrubber water (1124], (3) purification solds from filtration, evaporation, and centrifugation operations (K125), and (4) baghouse dust and floor sweepings in milling and packaging operations (K126) from the produ'ction or formulation of EBDC and-its salts. .The hazardous constituent in these wastes, ethylene thiourea (ETU), is a carcinogen in animals, a potential carcinogen in humans, a teratogen, a mutagen, and also causes thyroid effects. ETU is a contaminant, a degradation product, and a metabolite of EBDC and its salts. The Agency has previously listed as hazardous, discarded commercial chemical productd, off-specification species, container residues, and spill resideues contairiing ETU, under 40 CFR 261.33(f) (EPA Hazardous Waste No. U116, Ethylene thiourea). In addition, ETU appears in Appendix VIII. ETU typically is present in high concentrations in each waste stream. This constituent also is mobile and persistent, and can reach environmental receptors in harmful concentrations if these wastes are mismanaged. The reactor vent scrubber water also is corrosive because it has a pH greater than 12.5. Evaluated against the criteria for listing hazardous wastes (40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)), EPA has determined that these wastes are hazardous because they are capable of posing a substantial present or potential threat to human health and the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed. 1. Summary of the Regulation A. List of Wastes This proposed regulation would list as hazardous four wastes generated during the production and formulation of EBDC and its salts.2 I The Agency currently is evaluating other wastes from the production of carbamates and may propose to list additional wastes in the near future. 2 We considered listing as hazardous wdstes the following streams: (1) Spent carbon from the pretreatment or treatment of the wastewater. (2) still bottoms from the stream stripping of the wastewater. (3) sludges from the metals precipitafloif or separation of the wastewater, and (4) sludges from the biological treatment systems. However, because these waste streams are denvedThese residual wastes are: , K123-Process wastewater etbyleneblsdlthlocarbamlc acid and Its salts. 9 K124-Reactor vent scrubber water from the production of ethyleneblsdlthiocarbamlc acid and its salts. * K125-Puriilcation solids (including filtration, evaporation, and centrifugation solids) from the production of ethylenebtsdithiocarbamic acid and Its salts. * K120--Baghouse dust and floor sweepings in milling and packaging operations from the production or formulation of ethyloneblsdlthlocarbamic acid and its sales. In 1982, four domestic companies were producing EBDC at four locations, with a total annual production capacity of 26,090 kkg (57.4 million pounds). For fungicide use, EBDC compounds aro principally sold either as the sodium salt (nabam), the manganese salt (maneb), the zinc salt (zineb), as a mixture of the manganese and zinc salts (mancozeb), as the diammonium salt (amobam), or as salt (metiram, polyram). Production of EBDCs totalled 12,000 kkg (27 million pounds) in*1977, and 9,000 kkg (20 million pounds) in 1982. The total volume of the organic residual wastes from production of EBDC and its salts by the process described here at nameplate capacity Is approximately 92,400 kkg (203 million pounds) of process wastewater (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K123), 4,120 kkg (9.06 million pounds) of reactor vent scrubber water (EPA Hazardous Waste No, K124) 1,300 kkg (2.86 million pounds) of purification solids (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K125), and 39 kkg (86,000 pounds) of baghouse dust and floor sweepings (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K126). EBDC and its sales typically are produced by reacting ethlenediamino with carbon disulfide in the presence of a base (usually sodium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide), and then adding the desired metal to precipitate the EBDC product. The wastes that are being listed from this operation are formed as residuals at several points In the production of EBDC and its salts, Waste K123 includes any of a collection of aqueous wastes and Is formed from either of the following operations: (1) Separation of the aqueous supernate generated after the precipitation of the insoluble EBDC product (formed as either a transition metal salt and/or its thiuramsulfide), (2) concentration of this aqueous supemate in the evaporator, resulting in the formation of an aqueous from the waste streams being listed, they are automatically considered hazardous wastes.49562 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Proposed Rules waste, and (3] the washing of the product, also producing process wastewater. Waste K124 is formed from the -passage of reactor vent gases through a scrubber, typically generating a caustic aqueous waste. Due to the high [greater then 50%) concentration of sodium hydroxide in waste K124, this waste has a pH greater than 12.5. This waste, therefore, meets the corrosivity characteristic specified in 4O CFR 261.22. Waste K125 is the purification solids, formed from the evaporation of water from the mother liquor and from the filtration and centrifugation of the EBDC salt during wastewater treatment. Waste K126 is dust and floor sweepings from milling and packaging operations. Our proposal to list these wastes is based on the similarity of the production processes employed by the facilities manufacturing EBDC and its salts. The Listing Background Document and the sources cited there describe these production processes in detail. As derived from both questionnaires and sampling analyses, these wastes typically contain significant concentrations of ETU. a side reactant contaminant and major degradation 'product ofEBDC.3.4 EPA ha a d u Est! te c = ,t ~ o f ETUwaste Nos.] ppm t 0.1 to 02. IRA to 1.0. K126 __ 20D to 2.500 0.02to025. In addition, these wastes typically contain otherpotentially toxic constituents, such as ethylenebisisothiocyanate and carbon disulfide. Ethylenebisisothiocyanate also is a degradation product of EBDC. However, the Agency does not have sufficient toxicity data to propose including these additional compounds as hazardous constituents at the present time. When more information is available, we will determine whether they should be added. *Thesevmastes also contain EBDC at eignificant concentrations. EBDC. althougli toxic. Is not very persistent e-S.g one of the salts of ESDC. mancozeb. has a half-life of less than one day in sterile water). Therefore, we are not listing it as a constituent of concern. The Agency. however. solicits comment on our decision not to list EBDC asa toIcant of concern. 4 These levels are considered significant based on the carcinogenicity of ETU and the doses That were required to elicit the carcinogenic response in the studyby Graha et aL (see the HEEP for ELT. From that study. the Agency's CAG. using doses that ranged from 5-SON ppm. calculated an oncogenic risk to humans from from Incestionof 2.8X1O-4 mglkglday The leve!s used to-calculate the risk are much (one to three orders of magnitude) less than the concentration of ETU in the wastes.The Agency's Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG) has identified ETU as potentially carcinogenic. The International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC) also has indicated that there is evidence that ETU is \"probably carcinogenic in humans.\" BRL and Innes (as stated in the Health and Environmental Profile HHEP) for ETU) reported significantly increased incidences of hepatomas in both sexes of two strains of mice and significantly increased incidences of lymphoma in females of one strain when compared with controls. In comparison with pooled controls, dietary administration of ETU at the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) (350 ppm) significantly increased the incidence of thyroid follicular carcinom in both male and female rats (Weisburger, as reported in the HEEP for ETU). Ulland [as stated in the HEEP for ETU) also reported increased thyroid carcinoma incidence in rats fed ETU at the MTD for 18 months. In addition, rats developed thyroid gland carcinomas and adenocarcinomas at dietary levels of 250 and 500 ppm when treated for 1 or 2 years (Graham. as reported in the HEEP for ETU). Rats and hamsters administered ETU exhibited teratogenic effects. ETU was a potent teratogen in rats at daily oral doses as low as 20-40 m2/kg during gestation with no toxicity to dams (Khera, Chernoff, Teramoto, as reported in the HEEP for ET]U). The fetal responses included central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities in the BEEP for ETU}. Skeletal anomalies were also observed by these investigators. CNS and skeletal defects were also produced in offspring of hamsters treated with ETU at relatively high single oral dose levels of >1200 mg/kg (inera), although Lu and Su found fetal abnormalitie3 in hamsters at repeated doses of >120 mg/g and CNS defects with multiple does of .0-0 or 3M0 mg/kg (as reported in the HEEP for ETU). In addition, dermal application of ETU to pregnant rats at a relatively low dose of 50 mgf/r/day for 2 gestational days also resulted in CNS and skeletal abnormalities in fetuses (Stula and Krauss, as reported in the HEEP for ETU). ETU is mutagenic in some bacteria and yeast systems. ETU was positive in some strains of Salmozella t4pimurlum in the reverse mutation assay to histidine independence (Seiler. Schupbach. Teramoto). in B. subtillsspores in the rec assay (Kada), in a cell transformation assay with hamster kidney cells (Daniel and Dahnel), and in the unscheduled DNA synthesis of cultured HeLa cells (Martin and McDermid] (as reported in the HEEP for ETU. ETU also was positive in the mitochondrial DNA petite mutation assay in Sacchamomyces cerevislae (Diala. reported in the HEEP for ETU]. The Agency's Office of Pesticides Programs has called for additional testing for mutagenicity on both ETU and EBDC and its salts. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that ETU handled as a carcinogen and terato-en in the wor-place. ETU, therefore, exhibits toxicological properties of regulatory concern. The listing Backgound Document and HEEP contain additional details on the health effects of ETM. The Agency also has data which indicate that EBDC andits salts degrade rapidly to ErU in the waste and the environment. As a result of this rapid breakdown. ETU normally is present with EBDC and its salts in wastes. In addition, mancozeb has a half-rife of less than one day in sterile water before degrading to ETU. Based on the solubility ofETU in water (20 grams perliter at 30 C], the Agency further believes that ErU is mobile in the environment. EIU will migrate from the matrix of the waste and is expected to be capable of entering the aquatic environment either through runoff or leaching through soil. Based on the volume of waste that could be generated from EBDC production, approximately 231 kkg (0.51 million pounds) of ETU could escape into the enaironment from waste K123, 8.24 kkg (18,128 pounds] of ETU could escape into the environment from waste K124, 13.0 kkg (28,600 pounds) of ETU could escape into the environment from waste M125, and 0.1 \"g (220 pounds) of ETU could escape into the environment from waste K126.5 Furthermore, due to the rapid breakdown of EBDC salts to ETU, EBDC wastes containing EBDC salts could produce even more =ru after the wastes are released into the environment. The Agency also has determined that ET is persistent in ground water. This is based on data that shows that ETU is $Tha aomnt of ETU that could ezcpe Into EEDC wnstas is a wante total EUIn ofwst p=cIs=.T hu the ana=:nt of49563 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Proposed Rules stable to hydrolysis in distilled water for at least 40 days (see the HEEP for ETU). If waste disposal sites are improperly designed or managed-for example, sited in areas with highly permeable soils or constructed without effective natural or artificial liners-it is likely that ETU could escape from EBDC wastes to surface water or ground water. As indicated by the high solubility of ETU in water and moderate solubility in other polar solvents such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and pyridine, ETU, if improperly disposed, may be dissolved by the solvents found in mixed wasts and leach out of these wastes into ground water. The Agency, therefore, believes that ETU from EBDC wastes which are improperly managed, is likely to enter and remain in the environment, posing substantial risk. Moreover, the Agency believes that current industry waste management practices do not adequately protect human health and the environment from significant exposure to ETU. For example, centrifuge solids, which contain high levels of ETU, typically are disposed of in a sanitary landfill. These practices do not prevent ETU from leaching from these wastes and contaminating surface water and ground water at significant levels. EBDC wastewaters typically are processed in wastewater treatment systems. The Agency has data, however, which indicates that significant amounts of ETU can survive wastewater treatment (see the HEEP for ETU). In addition, ETU can inhibit activated sludge treatment of wastewaters. The ETU present significantly inhibits nitrification from occurring within the activated sludge, a process which is critical to the efficacy of the sludge, and thus, to wastewater treatment. It follows from this that ETU can inhibit nitrification in the receiving stream, thus interfering with the natural ecological development of the'stream. Wastewater treatment of EBDC wastes containmng significant amounts of ETU therefore, is not likely to remove the ETU, contaminating the environment with a highly mobile, persistent carcinogen and environmental toxicant. The Listing Background Document and the HEEP contain additional details on the management, fate, and transport of ETU. Consequently, by virtue of the high concentrations of ETU in these wastes, which are generated in large volumes, the mobility of ETU via leaching and runoff, and its persistence in ground water, EPA has determined that these wastes pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health and the environment, when improperly stored, transported, disposed of, orotherwise managed. The Agency, therefore, is proposing to add these wastes to the hazardous waste list in 40 CFR \u00a7 261.32. III. Regulatory Status of Hazardous Wastewaters Under the existing hazardous waste regulations, tanks that are treating or storing hazardous wastewaters are exempt from the Parts 264 and 265 management standards when the treatment unit is part of a wastewater treatment facility that is subject to regulation under either section 402 or section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act. Treatment units, such as concrete basins, which may or may not be in- ground, routinely provide for certain steps in a wastewater treatment process such as equalization, neutralization, aeration (in biological treatment facilities), settling (in both biological and physical/chemical treatment facilities), flocculation or treated wastewater storage prior to recycling. Where such units are constructed primarily of non-earthen materials designed to provide structural support, they are defined as tanks forpurposes of the hazardous waste regulations. See 40 CFR 260.10 (definition of \"tank\"). In applying this definition, the Agency has provided guidance that a unit is to be evaluated as if it were free-standing and filled to its design capacity with the material it is intended to hold. If the walls or shell of the unit alone provide sufficient structural support to maintain the structural integrity ofthe unit under these conditions, the unit is considered to be a tank. Alternatively, if the unit is not capable of retaining its structural integrity withput supporting earthen materials, it is considered to be a surface impoundment. Therefore, when wastewaters, including those covered by the listing proposed today, are stored or treated in containment devices which qualify as tanks, these devices are presently exempt from the Parts -264 and 265 management standards. IV. Test Methods for Compounds Added to Appendix VII In 49 FR 38786-38809,'Monday, October 1, 1984, the Agency proposed test methods (both those newly designed; as well as those previously available m SW--846--see below) for use in detecting specified substances by applicants who wish to conduct waste evaluations in support of delisting petitions,'and by owners or operators of hazardous waste management facilities who must conduct ground-water monitoring (see 40 CFR 264.99) or, ihcinerator monitoring (see 40 CFR 264.341). These test methods will, upon promulgation, be included in 40 CFRPart 261, Appendix III. In this proposal, Method Numbers 8250 and 8330 were designated for testing for the presence and concentration of ETU. These methods are in \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste: Physical/ 'Chemical Methods\", SW-846, 2nd ad,, July 1982, as amended; available from: Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, - .Washington, D.C. 20402, (202) 783-3230, Document number: 055-002-81001-2. V. CERCLA Impacts The hazardous wastes designated by today's proposed rule will, if made final, automatically become hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA]. (See CERCLA section 101(14).) CERCLA requires that persons in charge of vessels or facilities from which hazardous substances have been released in quantities that are equal to or greater than the reportable quantities (RQs) immediately notify the National Response Center of the release. (See CERCLA section 103 and 48 FR 23552, May 25, 1983.) For those hazardous wastes containing constituents which have already been assigned RQs, the RQ assigned to the waste will represent the lowest RQ associated with the constituents. Since ETU, the only hazardous constituent of all four wastes has a statutory RQ of one pound,0 all four of these wastes also have statutory RQs of one pound. (See 48 FR 23552- 23605.)- - VI. State Authorhly Once a State receives Interim or final authorization, it operates the RCRA program instead of EPA. If promulgated, this listing and the related management standards will not apply in interim- authorized States unless the State listed these EBDC wastes at the time It received interim authorization. Unless a State received final authorization on the basis of a universe of hazardous wastes which included these EBDC wastes, this listing and the related standards would not apply in States with final authorization until the State revises Its program to add these EBDC wastes to the universe of hazardous wastes and the revision is approved by EPA. The process and schedule for State adoption of these regulationg is described in 40 CFR 271.21, as amended by 49 FR 21678- 21682, May 22, 1984. 0 Criteria are currently being developed for potential carcinogens such as ETU to adjust the one pound RQ to a level adequately protective of human health and the environment.4956449564 I Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1934 / Proposed Rules If this proposed listing is made final, States which now have final authorization would have to revise their programs within one year from the date of promulgation if only regulatory changes are necessary, and within two years from the date of promulgation if statutory changes are required. This deadline may be extended in exceptional cases [see 40 CFR 271.21(e)(3)). States now in the process of applying for final authorization would be able to receive final authorization without including these EBDC wastes in their universe of hazardous wastes if the official state application is submitted less than one year after this listing, if made final, is promulgated. The date by which States must modify their programs is governed by 40 CFR 271.21(e](iii). VII. Regulation of EBDC Compounds Under FIFRA EBDC compounds are used as fungicides and, therefore, are subject to reulation under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The statutory test is a risk- benefit balance: Products are\"registered\" [authorized] if they generally will n6t cause any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of use. Accordingly, pesticides which present substantial risks can be approved if benefits outweigh risks. (See FIFRA sections 3(c)(5) and 2(bb).] The amount of information on which this decision is based has increased as the techniques to assess risks have improved. Moreover, many pesticide products, including some containing EBDCs, were approved under statutory criteria which preceded the current test. .The burden of proof is on the proponents of registration to demonstrate that a pesticide meets the statutory test. If the Agency decides to cancel a pesticide's registration, proponents of the pesticide are afforded opportunities to contest the Agency's determination. The Agency issued a notice on August 10, 1977 (42 FR 40618] informing the public that evidence of hazards from the use of EBDCs (and ETU) warranted an in-depth evaluation of risks and benefits. On October 14, 1982, the Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances concluded that, while there was valid and significant evidence of hazards, additional data was necessary to decide whether or not to cancel EBDCs, and registrations could continue withmandatory restrictions on use practices Additional hazard data has been requested from registrants. The Agency believes that the decision to list EBDC waste streams for which a different statutory standard applies, is fully consistent with the treatment of EBDC pesticides under FIFRA. VIII. Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulation is\"major\" and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. The total additional incurred cost for disposal of the wastes as hazardous is appro:dmately 133,100, well under the $100 million constituting a major regulation. This cost is insignificant and results from minimal additional compliance requirements, as these wastes are already being managed as if they were RCRA hazardo\"tn wastes. In addition, we do not expect that there will be an adverse impact on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Since this proposal is not a major regulation, no Regulatory Impact Analysis is being conducted. This amendment was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any comments from OMB to EPA and any EPA responses to, those comments are available for public inspection in Room S-212A at EPA. IX. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on small entities. The hazardous wastes proposed to be listed here are not generated by small entities (as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act), and the Agency does not believe that small entities will dispose of them in significant quantities. Accordingly, I hereby certify that this proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. (See 5 U.S.C. 603).List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 251 Hazardous materials, Waste treatment and disposal, Recycling.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency is today promulgating an amendment to the hazardous waste management regulations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). This amendment allows generators of hazardous wastes to accumulate up to 55 gallons of hazardous waste, or one quart of acutely hazardous waste listed in 40 CFR 261.33(e), in satellite areas at the generator's facility. Generators can accumulate wastes in satellite areas provided that: (1) The wastes are placed in containers that are in good condition; (2) the wastes are compatible with their containers; and (3) the containers are marked with the words \"Hazardous Wastes\" or other words that identify the contents. Any amount in excess of 55 gallons of hazardous waste or one quart of acutely hazardous waste must be managed in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 262.34(a) or transported to a storage area regulated under 40 CFR Parts 264 or 265 within -three days of the accumulation of that amount.

Chaz Miller, Office of Solid Waste (WH-563), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. (202) 382-4535, or the RCRA Hotline at (800) 424-9346 or (202) 382-3000, SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. Background On February 26, 1980, May 19, 1980, and November 19,1980, EPA promulgated regulations pursuant- to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6901, et seq. The regulations established a system to managehazardous waste, including standards for generators of hazardous waste (40 CFR Part 262, 45 FR 12732, FR 1251). In \u00a7 262,34(a) of the regulations. EPA allows generators to accumulate hazardous waste onsite for up to 90 days without obtaining a storage permit if they accumulate the waste in accordance with certain standards. These standards include requirements for the use of tanks and containers, personnel training, and the preparation of contingency plans. In establishing these standards, EPA assumed accumulation generally occurred at one or two discrete locations within an industrial facility. EPA also assumed the \u00a7 262.34 requirements would apply to storage buildings, sheds, and other central areas where wastes are accumulated. In response to this provision, members of the regulated community pointed out that within an industrial complex there may be dozens of places where hazardous wastes are initially generated and collected during daily opdrations prior to consolidation. The regulation, as onginally written, made no distinction between the initial accumulation of. hazardous waste at various points of generation (\"satellite\" accumulation) and the accumulation at a central storage area where these wastes are consolidated for on-site management or transportation off-site. As a result, the standards for 90-day accumulation applied to both areas, regardless of the amount of waste in the satellite areas. In response to these points, EPA raised the issue, in the preamble to the November 19, 1980, Federal Register notice amending \u00a7 262.34 (45 FR 76624), of whether a distinction should be drawn between satellite accumulation areas and central storage areas. EPA expressed the view that the requirements of \u00a7 262.34(a) apply to all types of accumulation areas, but requested comments on this issue. Various groups responded that there is a major difference between a satellite area which is used to accumulate wastes as they are generated and central storage areas which receive and are used to accumulate wastes from numerous satellite areas. These commenters supported a reduction or deletion of regulatory requirements for the initial accumulation of -hazardous wastes at or near points of generation. In response to these comments, on January 3,1983 (48 FR 118), EPA proposed to amend \u00a7 262.34 by adding a new subsection (c) to \u00a7 262.34 that would allow generators to accumulate up to 55 gallons of hazardous waste (except for acutely hazardous waste as listed in 40 CFR 261.33(e)) at eachsatellite area for any length of time without complying with the 90-day accumulation standards. Generators could accumulate wastes tinder this provision provided that: (1) The wastes were placed in containers. which were In good condition, (2) the wastes were compatible with their containers, and (3) the containers were marked with the words \"Hazardous Wastes\" or other words that identify their contents. Within 72 hours of accumulating over 55 gallons, the generator would be required to comply with all applicable requirements under RCRA for further management of any waste in excess of 55 gallons. II. Comments on Proposed Rule and EPA Response EPA received 95 comments on the proposed amendment to \u00a7 262.34, The majority of the commenters favored the proposal without exception. These commenters said the proposed rule would fit in with presently established industrial practices without'causing any adverse effect on human health or the environment. Most of the remaining commenters favored some aspects of the proposal. Commenters raised four major issues about the proposed rule: (1) The amount of hazardous waste allowed to accumulate at on-site satellite areas; (2) the requirement to remove the amount of hazardous waste over 55 gallons to the central storage area within 72 hours of its accumulation; (3) the need for a definition of satellite area; and (4) the exclusion of acutely hazardous waste from this rule and the effect of this exclusion on laboratories. In addition, commenters raised issues concerning the application of this rule to small generators, the absence of training and contingency plan requirements for satellite areas, the application of this rule to state hazardous waste regulations, and the absence of a requirement that containers of certain wastes be covered. Finally, one commenter objected to the proposal on the grounds that it would be more burdensome than the present regulations because it would require additional recordkeeping of waste quantities and accumulation time. These comments are discussed in detail below. A. The Amount of Hazardous Waste Allowed to Accumulate In the January 3, 1983, preamble, EPA discussed several alternatives it had considered before deciding on the 55 gallon limit. These alternatives included accumulation by weight (200 kilograms) and-accumulation by time (10 days). Federal Register / Vol. 49. No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations 49569 EPA requested comments on these -alternatives as opposed to the 55 gallon accumulation limit. Commenters did not support either alternative. Several specifically stated that either option would be burdensome and unworkable. As an alternative to the 55 gallon limit at each satellite area, a number of commenters suggested a limit on the total amount of hazardous wastes allowed in satellite areas at a generator's facility. Commenters suggested various means of doing this. including a limitation on the number of specific wastes in satellite areas and a total limit on the amount of hazardous waste in satellite areas at the facility. Other commenters suggested a higher limit than 55 gallons at any particular satellite area. These commenters cited the availability of reusable shipping bins of up to 110 gallons in capacity. Finally. several commenters urged EPA to apply this rule to the accumulation of the initial 55 gallons instead of applying it only to the amount in excess of that accumulation. After considering all the comments, EPA has decided not to change the 55 gallon threshold for accumulation of hazardous wastes. EPA believes that the accumulation at satellite areas of amounts of up to 55 gallons of non- acutely hazardous waste is reasonable and safe and does not pose a threat to human health or the environment. Accumulation of the amount in excess of 55 gallons is covered by this rule and. after three days. by the requirements of \u00a7 264.34(al or by the requirements of Parts 264 or 265. Most commenters from the regulated community supported the 55 gallon level as meeting their needs since satellite areas are normally used to manage one waste generated by an individual industrial process and commenters said they typically use a 55 gallon drum to store this waste before removing it to a central storage area. EPA believes that it is the amount in excess of 55 gallons that must be regulated under the requirements of \u00a7262.34(a) or Parts 264 or 265. EPA is establishing minimal requirements covering the accumulation of less than 55 gallons of nonacutely hazardous wastes in satellite accumulation areas because these amounts do not pose a significant threat to human health or the environment. A spill at an industrial site of 55 gallons or less of nonacutely hazardous waste is easy to control and clean up because of the small amount of waste involved. In addition to the lack of environmental threat, the widespread use of the 55 gallon drum makes it the most practicable threshold level for satellite accumulation. EPA is convincedthat amounts up ta 55 gallons of nonacutely hazardous wastes can be safely managed at satellite accumulation sites without the full requirements of \u00a7 264.34(a). Because the weight of evidence suggests limited use by the regulated community of containers larger than 53 gallons and because spills of 110 gallons of nonacutely hazardous wastes would pose a greater environmental threat. EPA does not believe that the satellite accumulation level should be higher than 55 gallons. Finally. EPA is not limiting the total amount of hazardous waste that could be accumulated at various satellite areas at a generator's facility because EPA does not believe that there is a strong environmental basis for such a requirement. Today's rule is intended to allow accumulations to set a limit that can be safely accumulated and removed (i.e.. 55 gallons for hazardous waste and one quart for actutey hazar dous waste]. thus, alleviating more frequent movement of smaller quantities of hazardous waste within the generator's facility. A total facility amount limitation would contravene that purpose. In addition, the practical effect of such a requirement would b. to discriminate against those facilities with many initial points of waste gmneration. forcing them to select come satellite areas for accumulation of 53 gallons. while immediately removing wastes generated at other satellite areas to central storage areas. Limiting the total amount of wastes accumulated under this rae would present enforcement difficulties for EPA and administrative complexities for the regulated comindaity w~ithout providing any significant additional protection to human health and the environment. B. The 72 Hour Tranmportation Requirement Several commenters argued that the proposed requirement to move the amount of hazardous waste over 55 gallons to a central storage area within 72 hours was an insufficient amount of time. These commenters argued the rule is too restrictive because of management scheduling problems and three-day holidays. Other commenters angued the 72 hour period was unenforceable without a requirement to label the containers with the date and time the excess amount began accumulating. EPA believes the proposed 72 hour period allows generators adequate lead time to manage the excess waste in accordance with the requirement, of \u00a7 262.34(a). Most facilities should be aware of process waste generation rateand should be able to arrange for the removal of any excess accumulation within that time frame. In addition, good management should be able to use advance scheduling to manage the excess waste in spite of a three-day holiday. However. EPA agrees that this rule will be difficult to enforce without any indication of when excess amounts began accumulating. Thus, EPA is requiring that containers be marked with the date when the excess accumulation began. This requirement will not impose any undue burden on the regulated community since EPA is not requiring special labels or any additional internal recordkeeping- Marling the container clearly vith the date excess accumulation begins will be sufficient. In addition. EPA is changing the time requirement from 72 hours to three days. The added precision of both the date and time of day is unnecessary and this change lessens the additional burden imposed by the labelling requirement. Finally, industry can avoid the labelling requirement completely by moving containers prior to the accumulation of more than 55 gallons. C. The Definition of Satellite Area Several commenters requested guidance on the definition of satellite areas on the grounds that EPA has not adequately defined what it means by satellite areas. Others argued the concept is unenforceable without a precise ragulatory definition. One commenter raised the possibility of a generator storing 55 gallon drums 5 feet apart along the wall of his facility in an attempt to circumvent further regulatory responsibilities. Satellite areas are those places where wastes are generated in the industrial process or the laboratory and where those wastes must initially accumulate prior to removal to a central area. This point of accumulation is under the control of the operator of the process that is generating the waste. In order to clarify the meaning of \"satellite areas\" EPA has added language to this ruie delineating the meaning of satellite areas. Certainly the example given by the commenter. of a row of full 55 gallon drums spaced 5 feet apart along the factory wall. does not meet the requirements established by this regulation. D. The Excluolon of A cutely Hazardous Wastes From This Rule andIts Impact on Lab.r A number of commenters raised questions about the exclusion of acutely hazardous wastes listed in \u00a7 261.33(e) 49570 Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20, 1984 / Rules and Regulations from the proposed rule. These commenters argued there is no basis for the exclusion, that there is a danger from moving these wastes through the plant site to a central storage area and that these wastes are safer at the satellite area than in a central area where other, possibly incompatible, wastes will be stored. Some commenters argued in favor of limiting acutely hazardous wastes at satellite areas to a lower accumulation amount than other hazardous wastes. These commenters felt it is acceptable to allow accumulations of up to one gallon at satellite areas before requiring management under \u00a7 262.34(a]. EPA specifically requested comments on the effect of the satellite accumulation rule on laboratories. EPA stated that this proposed rule, together with the small generator rule of \u00a7 261.5, would alleviate most of the operational problems associated with the accumulation of hazardous waste by laboratories. Most of the comments presented on this issue, however, concerned the exclusion of acutely iazardous waste from the satellite iccumulation rule. The commenters irgued this exclusion is unnecessarily jurdensome for laboratories. They -laimed that laboratory workers are ,specially well trained in handling iazardous wastes and that the cost of ransporting these wastes to a central itorage point is high, while there is no .orresponding benefit to the ,nvironment. One commenter suggested illowing acutely hazardous wastes from iatellite areas at laboratories to be ilaced in 500 gram containers. This :ommenter argued that most laboratory :hemicals are delivered in 500 gram :ontainers which would make suitable .torage vessdls for the wastes. Coupled with the training given to laboratory workers in recognizing the hazards associated with chemicals, this commenter's proposal would give laboratories the necessary flexibility to h1andle acutely hazardous wastes in a safe manner without being burdened'by t ie immediate removal of these wastes t the central storage area. After considering these comments, I PA believes a blanket exclusion of 1 cutely hazardous wastes from this rule i unnecessary because of the problems r osed by the almost constant c ccumulation of small amounts of E cutely hazardous waste through the .rorkplace. Accordingly, EPA is c hanging the exclusion of acutely .azardous wastes as proposed to allow t ie accumulation of one quart of these E cutely hazardous wastes at each E itellite area. This change will givelaboratories and other generators of' acutely hazardous wastes the opportunity to accumulate small amounts of acutely hazardous waste at the satellite area before managing the wastes under \u00a7 262.34(a) or moving the wastes to a storage area regulated under the requirements of Part 264 or Part 265. It also recognizes that acutely hazardous wastes should be handled with extra precaution and should not be allowed to accumulate at satellite areas to the extent that other hazardous wastes are allowed to accumulate. EPA has selected an accumulation limit of one quart since it is the volumetric equivalent of the one kilogram threshold used in other parts of the RCRA regulations (e.g., 40 CFR 261.5) to distinguish the application of the regulations to acutely hazardous and nonacutely hazardous waste. One quart was chosen instead of one kilogram as the threshold for accumulation of acutely hazardous waste consistent with the volume threshold for satellite accumulation of nonacutely hazardous waste and because of the complete opposition by commenters to the use of a weight measure as the initial threshold for the accumulation of hazardous wastes. Finally, this limitation accommodates laboratories who choose to move acutely hazardous waste in the workplace in 500 gram, liter, or quart- sized containers. E. Small Generators and Satellite Accumulation Several commenters questioned the relationship between this rule and the small quantity generator rule of \u00a7 261.5. The latter rule exempts generators of less than 1000 kilograms per month of (nonacutely) hazardous waste from the hazardous waste management regulations, including 40 CFR Part 262. It also exempts generators of less than one kilogram of acutely hazardous waste per month from regulation. Accordingly, those facilities covered by the small quantity generator rule are not subject to any of the requirements of the satellite accumulation rule so long as they do not generate more than 1000 kilograms of hazardous waste (or one kilogram of acutely hazardous waste] per month. Conversely, if the facility generates more than 1000 kilograms of hazardous waste (or one kilogram of acutely hazardous waste), it is subject to all hazardous waste management regulations including those for accumulation in satellite areas. F. Other Issues Several commenters raised other issues. The first issue concerns EPA's decision not to require worker trainingor contingency plans for wastes in satellite areas. In the January 3, 1983, preamble, EPA discussed the relationship between its proposed satellite accumulation rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) proposed regulations covering hazardous materials in the workplace. EPA stated it should retain the responsibility for some regulations on the accumulation of hazardous waste in the workplace because OSHA does not specifically regulate hazardous wastes as defined under RCRA or deal specifically with aspects of accumulation that affect human health and the environment outside the workplace. This would include such aspects as the condition of the containers used for accumulation. OSHA does, however, regulate other activities, such as the training of employees of manufacturing industries who work with hazardous materials and safety procedures that closely parallel contingency plans. OSHA promulgated its \"Hazard Communication\" regulations on November 25, 1983 (48 FR 53280). The management of all RCRA hazardous wastes, including contingency plan and training plan requirements, is specifically exempted from these regulations (29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(5)(1)). As a result, the OSHA regulation does not duplicate EPA's regulation in any respect. Several com'nenters stated that EPA should require contingency plans and training plans for the satellite areas. EPA believes, however, that since only one waste will normally be accumulated at each satellite area, and since only limited quantities are allowed to accumulate, contingency plans and training plans are not necessary. As -EPA stated in the January 3, 1983, preamble, these requirements were intended for more centralized, higher volume accumulations of waste. When waste generated in a satellite area Is transported to a storage area regulated under \u00a7 262.34[a) or Parts 284 or 205, the training and contingency plan requirements will apply. Several commenters questioned EPA's decision not to make the satellite accumulation rule a requirement for authorized States. One commenter argued that by failing to make This rule a requirement for authorized States, EPA is making it possible for States to have hazardous waste regulations that are. not consistent with Federal regulations. Consistency between EPA and State hazardous waste management regulations is explained by 40 CFR 271.4 whiich establishes three areas where State regulations cannot be inconsistent Federal Register / Vol. 49, No. 246 / Thursday, December 20. 1934 1 Rules and Regulations 49571 with EPA's hazardous waste regulations. The failure of a State to adopt the-satellite accumulation regulation does not fit within any of the three areas indicating \"inconsistency\" with the Federal program. Further. section 3009 of RCRA allows States to be more stringent in their regulations than EPA. The Agency would consider a State that does not provide an analogue to \u00a7 262.34(c) to allow for satellite accumulation to be implementing a more stringent program. Thus, States need not provide for satellite accumulation of hazardous waste. A third issue was raised by a commenter who suggested that EPA require covers on containers of certain wastes in order to reduce potential fire hazard that might be associated with the accumulation of flammable waste solvents. EPA agrees with this commenter and is requiring all containers holding hazardous wastes in satellite accumulation areas to be covered except when necessary to add or remove waste. This requirement should not place added burdens on the regulated community since commenters assert, and EPA's own information confirms, that covering containers is common industrial practice. The final issue raised by a commenter is that the proposed satellite accumulation rule would actually lead to an increase in recordkeeping in order to ensure and demonstrate compliance with the waste accumulation limits and the three day time period requirements. EPA does not agree. There are no additional internal recordkeeping requirements caused by this regulation. Although the final regulation requires that containers be labelled with the date excess accumulation begins, this can be accomplished by merely marking the containers and avoided completely by removing the containers before excess accumulation begins. Further, since recordkeeping requirements for contingency plans do not apply to satellite accumulation areas, there is actually a decrease in recordkeeping. III. Today's Amendment After reviewing all of the comments received on the proposed rule, EPA is today promulgating the rule as originally proposed, with the four exceptions of allowing the accumulation in a satellite area of up to one quart of those acutely hazardous wastes listed in \u00a7 281.33(e), requiring the generator to mark thecontainers with the date the excess accumulation began. requiring that containers holding hazardous waste be covered except when they are opened to add or remove waste, and adding additional language delineating the meaning of a satellite area. IV. Effective Date Section 3010(b) of RCRA provides that EPAs hazardous waste regulations and revisions thereto take effect six months after their promulgation. In addition, 5 U.S.C. 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act requires that substantive rules not become effective until at least 30 days after promulgation unless there is good cause for shortening the period. Accordingly, these amendments will become effective six months after publication in the Federal Register. V. Compliance With Executive Order 12291 Under Ex;ecutive Order 12291. EPA must judge whether a regulation is\"major\" and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This regulation is not major because it will not result in an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, nor will it result in an incrcase in costs or prices to industry. There will be no adverse impact on the ability of U.S. based enterprises to compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Because this amendment is not a major regulation. no Regulatory Impact Analysis is being conducted. This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review as required by Executive Order 12291. VI. Paperwork Reduction Act Under the Papervork Reduction Act. 44 U.S.C. 3501 etseq., Federal agencies must consider the paperwork burden imposed by any information collection request contained in a proposed rule or final rule. This rule will not impose any new information collection requirements on the regulated community. In fact, this rule will reduce the information collection requirements contained in the cleared OMB request #200-0)11. VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for all proposed rules to assess their impact on small entities. No regulatory analysis Isrequired, however, vhen the head of the agency certifies that the rule vill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The economic impact of this regulation will be to reduce the costs of complying with EPA's hazardous waste management regulations for generators of hazardous waste, including those which are small entities. Accordingly, I hereby certify, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. C01(b). that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. VIII.

ACTION: Extension of comment period on petition for rulemaking. SUMMARY. The FAA has received a petition for rulemaking from the ATA proposing that the FAA adopt an administrative review mechanism and require certificated airports to submit all proposed airport use restrictions to the FAA for review as to lawfulness before implementation. Under the proposal, the FAA would publish them in the Federal Register and, if necessary, temporarily suspend the proposed restrictions in order to call a public hearing to receive comments from interested persons. The FAA published the petition in the Federal Register on October 25,1984 (49 FR 43020], with the comment period closing December 24,1984. Based on requests for extension of the comment period, the FAA is extending the comment period for an additional 30 days. DATES: Comments on the petition must identify the petition docket number 24246 and be received on or before- January 25,1985. ADDRESS: Send comments on the petition in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel, Attn: Rules Docket (AGC-204], Petition Docket No. 24246 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, D.C. 20591.FQR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. The petition, any comments received. and a copy of any final disposition are filed in the assigned regulatory docket and are available for examination in the Rules Docket (AGC-2104), Room 916, FAA Headquarters Building (FOB 10A). Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW.. Washington, D.C. 20591; telephone (202) 426-3644. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FAA has received requests for extension of the comment period on the subject proposal from the National Organization to Insure a Sound-controlled Environment (N.O.LS.E.) and the United States Conference of Mayors. N.O.I.S.E. is an organization of cities, citizen groups, and individuals affected by and concerned with aviation noise. It asserts that the process contemplated by the ATA petition would result in a major reshaping of the relationships between the Federal Government, represented by the FAA, and State and local governments who are airport proprietors. N.O.LS.E. contends that exploring, defining, and commenting on such a program will require considerable amounts of time. It states that the timing of the comment period is extremely difficult for State and local governments, because of local elections and the occurrence of both Thanksgiving and Christmas during the comment period. N.O.I.S.E. also states that for national and regional city organizations, as well as community and citizen organizations. the response process is slow. often requiring study by a committee, submission of a recommendation to a membership, and approval of a position before comment. It cites specific examples of groups it considers will need further time to prepare their comments, including the United States Conference of Mayors. For thesereasons. N.O.IS.E. requested an extension of the comment period for an additional SD days. The United States Conference of Mayors. in its request for an extension. stated that the proposed rule is of great concern to Mayors across the country. It asserts that. with the press of other business and the holiday season, the short comment period is insufficient. It states that the issues raised by the proposed rulemaking should be fully revieved through the appropriate Conference policy process, and that the Conference Transportation and Communications Committee meets next on January 18.1935. at which time the proposal -ill be placed on the agenda. The Conference requests an extension of the comment period until February 28, 1935. The FAA has considered these requests for extension of the comment period and does not consider extensions of the length requested to be warranted. it is concerned, however, that all interested persons have an adequate opportunity to comment. In view of the concerns raised by N.O.LS.E. and the United States Conference of Mayors, the FAA believes it would be appropriate to extend the comment period for an additional 30 days. Accordingly. the comment period on the petition of the ATA published in the Federal Register on October 25. 1934 (49 FR 43020) is extended until January 25, 1935. This notice is published pursuant tW paragraphs (b) and (f) of \u00a7 11.27 of Part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 11). Issued in Washington. D.C. on December 18 194. Edward P.
