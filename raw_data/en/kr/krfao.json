N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNAs is the most pervasive and highly conserved RNA modification in eukaryotic cells; it exerts powerful impact on almost all aspects of mRNA processing that is mainly endowed by its binding with m6A reader proteins. In this study, we investigate the previously uncharacterized regulatory roles of YTHDC1, an m6A reader in mouse SCs. Our results demonstrate that YTHDC1 is an essential regulator of SC activation and proliferation upon acute injury-induced muscle regeneration. The induction of YTHDC1 is indispensable for SCs and mouse C2C12 myoblasts identifies m6A-mediated binding targets of YTHDC1. Next, splicing analysis defines splicing mRNA targets of m6A-YTHDC1. Furthermore, nuclear export analysis also leads to the identification of potential mRNA export targets of m6A-YTHDC1 in SCs and C2C12 myoblasts;interestingly, some mRNAs can be regulated at both splicing and export levels. Lastly, we map YTHDC1 interacting protein partners in myoblasts and unveil a myriad of factors governing mRNA splicing, nuclear export, and transcription, among which hnRNPG appears to be a bona fide interacting partner of YTHDC1. Altogether, our findings uncover YTHDC1 as an essential factor controlling SC regenerative ability through multifaceted gene regulatory mechanisms in mouse myoblast cells. Editor's evaluation This valuable study has convincingly identified a specific regulator in skeletal muscle regeneration through a series of elegant experiments. It will form a foundation for further mechanistic investigation. The work will be of future importance in the clinical management of muscle injury and promotion of regeneration. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.82703.sa0](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.82703.sa0) Introduction Skeletal muscle has a robust regenerative capacity, with rapid re-establishment of full power occurring even after severe damage that causes widespread myofiber necrosis. This is accomplished by satellite cells (SCs) that normally lie quiescent and uniquely labeled by the expression of paired box (Pax) transcription factor Pax7 ( [Fujita and Crist, 2018](#bib9)). Upon injury, the master myogenic regulator MyoD is expressed to enable rapid activation of SCs, which then expand as proliferating myoblasts; the myoblasts then differentiate and fuse into myofibers to repair the damaged muscle, while a subset self-renews to restore the quiescent SC pool. Deregulated SC activity contributes to the development of many muscle diseases; it is thus imperative to understand the way SCs contribute to regeneration. Intrinsically, both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulations constitute key governing SC activities ( [Chen et al., 2021b](#bib5); [Relaix et al., 2021](#bib30)). In this study, we investigate the post-transcriptional gene regulation mediated by N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. m6A is the most pervasive and highly conserved RNA modification in eukaryotic cells and exerts powerful impact on almost all aspects of mRNA processing, including alternative splicing, nuclear export, stability maintenance, and translational efficiency, thus regulating diverse cellular processes ( [Shi et al., 2019](#bib34)). The past decade has witnessed rapid technical and conceptual advances that allowed transcriptome-wide interrogation of m6A dynamics and galvanized interest in m6A function. It is widely accepted ( [Murakami and Jaffrey, 2022](#bib26); [Shi et al., complex (the 'writer') comprising METTL14, METTL3, WTAP, etc., and can be removed by specific demethylases (the 'erasers'), including FTO and ALKBH5. However, it is the so-called 'reader' proteins that bind m6A and impart the epitranscriptomic information engraved in RNA m6A to functional signals; thus, these proteins are considered key effectors and executors of m6A functions. So far, a category of m6A readers has been identified and classified as several families, among which YTH domain family proteins, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, YTHDC1, and YTHDC2, specifically recognize m6A sites through YTH domain and are the most well-known readers. YTHDC1 is a unique m6A reader because of its dominant location in the nucleus endowing its post-transcriptional regulatory functions such as pre-mRNA splicing ( [Kasowitz al., al., 2020](#bib48)). The pioneer study from ( [Xiao et al., 2016](#bib41)) shows that YTHDC1 promotes exon inclusion of targeted mRNAs in Hela cells by recruiting pre-mRNA splicing factor SRSF3 while blocking SRSF10 binding ( [Xiao et al., 2016](#bib41)); however, in a separate study ( [Roundtree et al., 2017](#bib31)), YTHDC1 interacting with SRSF3 facilitates the delivery of methylated mRNAs to export receptor NXF1 for cytoplasmic export, pointing to YTHDC1 and SRSF3 as adaptor proteins coupling mRNA splicing and export ( [Roundtree et al., 2017](#bib31)). Interestingly, rapidly evolving evidence from the past two years implicates YTHDC1 in epigenetic and transcriptional al., 2021](#bib18); [Xu et al., 2022](#bib44)). There is thus a current advent in illuminating molecular underpinnings of m6A-dependent functions of YTHDC1 as well as in demonstrating its biological importance in vivo. In this project, we elucidate m6A-YTHDC1 functional mechanisms in skeletal muscle stem cells and muscle regeneration. Our findings identify YTHDC1 as an essential regulator of SC activation/proliferation in the acute injury induced muscle regeneration. Inducible YTHDC1 knockout impairs SC activation muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, combining transcriptome-wide YTHDC1 binding profiles and global m6A map we define m6A-YTHDC1 regulatory targets in myoblasts. Further analyses demonstrate that YTHDC1 loss substantially alters target mRNA splicing; in addition, it also impacts nuclear export of a subset of target mRNAs. Lastly, we uncover that YTHDC1 interacts with a myriad of proteins in proliferating myoblasts, including regulators of mRNA splicing, mRNA nuclear export, as well as transcriptional regulators. We further demonstrate that hnRNPG interacts with YTHDC1 and synergistically promotes myoblast proliferation. Altogether, our findings suggest that YTHDC1 is a previously uncharacterized factor governing SC activities and muscle regeneration, and it can exert pleiotropic gene regulatory functions by interacting with different proteins in myoblast cells. Results m6A regulators are dynamically expressed during SC lineage progression, and YTHDC1 is induced upon SC activation/proliferation To investigate possible roles of m6A regulators in SCs, we analyzed the expression dynamics of a panel of m6A writers, readers, and erasers using our recently generated RNA-seq datasets ( [He et al., 2021](#bib11)) from SCs at various time points of lineage progression ( [Figure 1A](#fig1)). Freshly isolated SCs (FISCs) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) are considered as early activating cells due to the disruption of their niche by the isolation process ( [Machado et al., 2017](#bib25)); quiescent SCs (QSCs) were obtained through a pre-fixation step with paraformaldehyde (PFA) before the dissociation to preserve the quiescence status; FISCs were cultured for 24, 48, and 72 hr to obtain fully activated, proliferating, and differentiating SCs (ASC-24 hr, -48 hr, and -72 hr). As a result, we found that many m6A regulators were dynamically expressed in the lineage progression course ( [Figure 1B-C](#fig1) and [Figure 1\u2014source data 1](#fig1sdata1)), reflecting their possible importance in controlling different phases of SC activities. Specifically, we found the reader Ythdc1 mRNA was expressed at all stages with the highest level in FISCs ( [Figure 1B-D](#fig1)). By western ( [Figure 1E and F](#fig1)), we observed a very low level of YTHDC1 protein in FISC, an evident increase in activating cells (ASC-24 hr) and continued increase in proliferating cells (ASC-48 hr); YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 reader proteins appeared to show similar expression dynamics. Consistent with prior studies ( [Xiang et al., 2017](#bib40); [Xiao et al., 2016](#bib41)), YTHDC1 protein was predominantly detected in the nucleus but not cytoplasm ( [Figure 1F](#fig1)). This was also confirmed in mouse C2C12 cell line (a commonly used surrogate for ASCs) by fractionation assay ( [Figure 1G](#fig1)), suggesting regulatory in myoblast cells. Inducible YTHDC1 deletion in SCs abolishes acute injury-induced muscle regeneration Despite intensive investigation of YTHDC1 regulatory mechanisms, genetic evidence remains largely lacking to support its roles in biological processes. To test its biological function in SCs, we crossed a recently available Ythdc1 floxed allele ( [Lepper et al., 2009](#bib19)) to generate an inducible knock out (iKO) mouse to inactivate YTHDC1 specifically in SCs ( [Figure 2A](#fig2)). After successful removal of YTHDC1 by five consecutive plus two extra doses of tamoxifen (TMX) ( [Figure 2B and C](#fig2)), BaCl2 was injected into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle to induce acute damage ( [Chen et al., 2021b](#bib5)). In both control (Ctrl) littermate and the iKO mice, massive immune cell infiltration was observed on the first day post injury (dpi) (data not shown); at 3 dpi, SCs were rapidly activated and reached a peak of proliferation in Ctrl (data not shown); by 5 dpi, they were mainly differentiating and labeled with eMyHC+ (expressed only in newly regenerating fibers) ( [Figure 2D and E](#fig2)), coinciding with the initiation of myofiber repair. As a striking contrast, muscle regeneration was nearly completely abolished in the iKO muscles; excessive immune infiltration was still present at 5 or 7 dpi with no signs of repair ( [Figure 2D](#fig2)); a sharp decrease of eMyHC+ myofibers was detected at both time points ( [Figure A complete loss of Pax7+ cells ( [Figure 2F and G](#fig2)) was also observed in iKO vs. Ctrl despite no difference was observed on uninjured muscles ( [Figure 2F and G](#fig2)). At 14 dpi, injured were largely repaired ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A-C](/articles/82703/figures#fig2s1)). But the regeneration was never observed even at 28 dpi; iKO muscle remained significantly smaller than Ctrl ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C](/articles/82703/figures#fig2s1)). Altogether, the above data indicate the essential function of YTHDC1 in acute To pinpoint the major defects of iKO SCs that cause the blocked regeneration, we suspected YTHDC1 loss impaired SC activation and proliferation considering it was induced upon SC activation and highly expressed in proliferating myoblasts ( [Figure 1D and E](#fig1)). To this end, FISCs from Ctrl or iKO mice were cultured for 24 or 48 hr; and indeed the iKO cells displayed evident growth arrest ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A and B](/articles/82703/figures#fig3s1)). This was confirmed by 4 hr EdU treatment and staining; activation (24 hr) and proliferation (48 hr) were drastically inhibited in the iKO compared to the Ctrl ( [Figure 3A](#fig3)). On isolated single myofibers, SCs also failed to proliferate, confirmed by EdU staining of the fibers cultured for 48 hr ( [Figure 3B](#fig3)). Consistently, staining for Pax7 and MyoD showed that a lower percentage of double positive cells were detected at both ASC-24 hr and 48 hr in the iKO compared to the Ctrl ( [Figure 3C](#fig3)); the protein levels of Pax7 and MyoD were also largely diminished in the iKO cells at 48 hr ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C](/articles/82703/figures#fig3s1)). On single myofibers, the number of Pax7+ MyoD+ SCs was also reduced at both 24 hr and 48 hr ( [Figure 3D](#fig3)). 2 days after BaCl2 -induced injury and SCs were isolated 12 hr later for staining. A significant reduction of EdU+ cells was observed in the iKO compared to the Ctrl muscles ( [Figure 3F](#fig3)). Altogether, the above findings demonstrate that YTHDC1 loss causes a severe defect in SC activation and proliferation, thus solidifying the essential function of YTHDC1 in these stages of SC activities. [see all](/articles/82703/figures#fig3) Next, transcriptomic analysis using RNA-seq was conducted in ASC-24 hr and ASC-48 hr cells to validate the above observed phenotypical defects in iKO cells. As a result, a total of 547 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in iKO vs. Ctrl SCs with 431 and [Supplementary file 1](/articles/82703/figures#supp1)); and the downregulated genes were enriched for GO terms as 1272 DEGs (556 down- and upregulated) were identified hr ( [Figure 3H](#fig3)) and again the downregulated genes were enriched for similar GO terms as the above ( [Figure 3H](#fig3) and [Supplementary file 1](/articles/82703/figures#supp1)). These findings thus substantiate the activation/proliferation defects observed in the iKO cells. Lastly, to further solidify the function of YTHDC1 in proliferating myoblasts, we generated a C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line with of 5-Ph-IAA (auxin, IAA) but not DMSO (negative control) induced rapid of the mAID-tagged YTHDC1 ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E and F](/articles/82703/figures#fig3s1)). In line with the results obtained from ASCs, decreased proliferation rate was observed in two independent AID-YTHDC1 clones treated with IAA for both 48 hr and 72 hr ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G and H](/articles/82703/figures#fig3s1) that YTDHC1 functions to promote myoblast proliferation. Furthermore, to validate the causative role of YTHDC1 in driving the above phenotype, rescue experiments were performed by overexpressing a WT or a single (W429A) or triple (K362A, S363A, and mutant to [Liu al., 2014](#bib42)) the AID-YTHDC1 C2C12 cells. As expected, only the WT but not mutant YTHDC1 could partially rescue the proliferation defect caused by YTHDC1 degradation ( [Figure 3J](#fig3), [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement indeed YTHDC1 is essential to promote myoblast proliferation and this function is dependent on its m6A binding function. LACE-seq defines transcriptome-wide YTHDC1 binding profiles in myoblasts To fathom the underlying mechanism, we conducted transcriptome-wide binding analysis for YTHDC1, reasoning ultimately it is the binding sites/targets that determine its function. To this end, we harnessed the recently developed LACE-seq (the Linear Amplification of Complementary DNA Ends and Sequencing) method ( [Figure 4A](#fig4)) that enables global profiling of RNA-binding protein (RBP) target sites with a relatively low quantity of starting cellular material ( [Su et al., 2021](#bib36)). Around 1 million ASC-48 hr were subject to LACE-seq with two biological replicates (B1, B2) and four technical replicates (T1, T2) ( [Figure 4B](#fig4)). As a result, a total of 2444 shared peaks corresponding to 951 genes were identified from comparing the four replicates and defined as YTHDC1 binding targets ( [Figure 4B](#fig4) and [Supplementary file 2](/articles/82703/figures#supp2)). All of these replicates were well correlated with each other (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.82~0.91). These genes were enriched for GO terms such as 'Cell projection organization,' 'Cell [Supplementary 2](/articles/82703/figures#supp2)). To the result, we also performed LACE-seq with C2C12 myoblasts; two technical replicates were included, and a much higher number of cells (10 million) were used for each replicate ( [Figure 4A and B](#fig4)). Our results showed that data from C2C12 was of very high quality with the two replicates displaying high correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.96). A total of 29107 shared peaks corresponding to 5897 genes were identified as YTHDC1 binding targets ( [Figure 4B](#fig4) and [Supplementary file 2](/articles/82703/figures#supp2)). Very similar to the above result from ASCs, these genes were also enriched for a variety of GO terms such as 'Cell projection organization,' 'Cell In 1501 out of the 2444 identified peaks in ASCs could be found in C2C12 ( [Figure 4E](#fig4) and [Supplementary file 2](/articles/82703/figures#supp2)), testifying the success of the assay. Next, further probing into the binding locations, we found that in both C2C12 ( large portion of the peaks (73% and 43%) were mapped to protein coding genes, which is largely consistent with prior reports from conducting YTHDC1 global profiling through CLIP-seq or RIP-seq in other cells [Chen et 2016](#bib28); [Xiao et al., 2016](#bib41)), suggesting that regulating mRNA processing is probably the dominant role of YTHDC1 in mouse myoblasts. Interestingly, small portions of the peaks were mapped in lincRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs, etc., and a substantial portion was mapped to repeat regions such as SINE (4%) and LINE (3%) ( [Figure 4G](#fig4)), which [Liu et al., 2021](#bib24)). [see all](/articles/82703/figures#fig4) To further tease out m6A-dependent function of we obtained the published from C2C12 ( [Gheller et al., 2020](#bib10)), which was of good quality shown by the enrichment of a classical RRACH motif in the identified binding sites and also dominant enrichment found at 3'UTR genomic regions (data not shown). By integrating the dataset with the above C2C12 LACE-seq dataset, a total of 5356 peaks (1771 genes) were identified; 41% of the in set of 1771 m6A-YTHDC1 targets were enriched for variable GO terms ( [Figure 4I](#fig4) and [Supplementary file 2](/articles/82703/figures#supp2)), among which related ( and [Supplementary file 2](/articles/82703/figures#supp2); al., 2008](#bib27)). Besides, a large group of m6A-YTHDC1 targets was enriched for mRNA processing ( [Figure 4I](#fig4)). Interestingly, Ythdf2 [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/82703/figures#fig4s1) and [Supplementary file 2](/articles/82703/figures#supp2)). Next, intercepted the ASC LACE-seq with the above C2C12 MeRIP-seq data and identified a total of 56 peaks (corresponding to 50 genes) ( [Figure 4J](#fig4) and [Supplementary file 2](/articles/82703/figures#supp2)); interestingly, these genes were highly enriched for GO terms such as 'RNA splicing,' ( [Figure 4I](#fig4)), suggesting that m6A-YTHDC1 not only modulates RNA processing but also controls the processing of RNA processing factors. To solidify the findings that YTHDC1 regulates its targets through m6A binding, we 2021](#bib45)) in C2C12 and examined the binding of YTHDC1 to three selected m6A-YTHDC1 targets, Ythdf2, Ythdf3, Pi4kb, using as a ( [Wang et al., 2021](#bib37)). As expected, STM2457 treatment significantly reduced the m6A modification level on the three targets as revealed by meRIP-qPCR ( [Figure 4L](#fig4)); concomitantly, YTHDC1 also decreased ( [Figure 4M](#fig4)), indicating indeed the regulatory function of YTHDC1 relies on m6A binding. YTHDC1 depletion in ASCs leads to altered splicing events Next we tested whether YTHDC1 plays a role in modulating mRNA splicing that represents its best known function ( [Kasowitz et al., 2018](#bib16); [Xiao et al., 2016](#bib41)). To this end, we analyzed the splicing events using the RNA-seq data from [Figure 3G and H](#fig3) hr and hr, a high number of differential splicing events (DSEs) were uncovered in the iKO compared to the Ctrl cells ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)); skipped exons (SEs) and mutually exclusive exons (MXEs) dominated these events, which was consistent with previously reported role for YTHDC1 in promoting exon inclusion ( [Xiao et al., 2016](#bib41)). Among the 951 targets of YTHDC1, a total of 189 displayed DSE ( [Figure 5B](#fig5) and [Supplementary file 3](/articles/82703/figures#supp3)), thus defined as YTHDC1 splicing targets. These targets were enriched for file 3](/articles/82703/figures#supp3)), among which we experimentally validated the altered Scn5a, pinpoint m6A-YTHDC1-dependent splicing events, we then intercepted the DSEs with the 50 m6A-YTHDC1 targets identified in ASCs ( [Figure 4J](#fig4)). As a result, 11 of them were defined as m6A-YTHDC1 splicing targets ( [Figure 5D](#fig5)), among which the altered splicing on E](#fig5)). [see all](/articles/82703/figures#fig5) To ascertain the above findings, we then performed RNA-seq in C2C12 cells with inducible YTHDC1 deletion (cells were treated with IAA for 8 hr to capture the immediate effect only). A total of 2555 genes with DSE were detected upon YTHDC1 degradation and a large portion (1040) were its binding targets defined in [Figure 4D](#fig4) ( [Figure 5F](#fig5) and [Supplementary file 3](/articles/82703/figures#supp3)). This evidence suggests that YTHDC1 possibly plays a dominant role as a splicing regulator in C2C12. Of note, these targets were highly enriched for Also, 75 of these YTHDC1 splicing targets were found in ASC ( out of the m6A-YTHDC1 identified in C2C12 cells [Supplementary file 3](/articles/82703/figures#supp3)); and 5 of these targets were shared NEK1 is known to play a role in regulating cell cycle ( [Chen et al., 2008](#bib2)). Altogether, these findings lead us to conclude that m6A-YTHDC1 orchestrates splicing of mRNAs that have important functions in myoblast cells, and its role in promoting myoblast proliferation is mediated through a wide spectrum of mRNA targets. YTHDC1 loss inhibits mRNA nuclear export In addition to splicing regulation, we also wondered whether YTHDC1 plays a role in controlling mRNA nuclear export as hinted by prior studies ( [Lesbirel et al., 2018](#bib20); [Roundtree et al., 2017](#bib31)). To test this notion, nuclear (nuc) and cytoplasmic (cyto) fractions were prepared from ASC-48 hr cells of Ctrl or YTHDC1 iKO muscles and subject to RNA-seq, respectively. As a result, a total of 11,637 mRNAs were found to be expressed in cyto or nuc fractions and the cyto/nuc ratio was calculated to assess the change of mRNA distribution after YTHDC1 knock out. No significant difference was detected in the average cyto/nuc ratio of these expressed mRNAs in iKO vs. 4](/articles/82703/figures#supp4)), suggesting that YTHDC1 loss may not cause global alteration in mRNA nuclear export. Nevertheless, 1045 mRNAs did show altered cyto/nuc ratio and they 'Methylation,' 4](/articles/82703/figures#supp4)). To specifically examine whether YTHDC1 binding could directly modulate nuclear export, we found a total of 687 of the above-identified YTHDC1 binding targets were expressed in cyto or nuc fractions; no significant difference was detected in the average cyto/nuc ratio of these mRNAs in the iKO compared to the Ctrl ( [Figure and B](#fig6) and [Supplementary file 4](/articles/82703/figures#supp4)), suggesting that YTHDC1 binding may not have a major impact on global nuclear export of its target mRNA. Nevertheless, 54 mRNAs did display significant cyto/nuc decrease in iKO vs. Ctrl thus defined as YTHDC1 export targets ( [Figure 6C and D](#fig6) and Of note, 13 were also defined as YTHDC1 splicing targets ( [Figure 6C](#fig6)), suggesting that YTHDC1 may simultaneously regulate both splicing and export of these target mRNAs. [see all](/articles/82703/figures#fig6) To solidify YTHDC1 regulating myoblast mRNA we performed the above assay/analysis in C2C12 mAID-YTHDC1 cells. Similarly, no global impact on the distribution of all expressed mRNAs (11175) was detected upon YTHDC1 analyzing YTHDC1 bound mRNAs, a much higher number (5000) compared to the ASC (because of the higher number of LACE-seq targets from C2C12; [Figure 4](#fig4)) was found to be expressed in cyto or nuc fractions and a significant decrease in the average cyto/nuc ratio was found upon YTHDC1 degradation ( [Figure F](#fig6) and [Supplementary file 4](/articles/82703/figures#supp4)), suggesting that YTHDC1 loss caused global impact on its target mRNA nuclear export in C2C12. Similarly, a total of 813 binding targets were defined as YTHDC1 export targets and displayed reduction in cyto/nuc ratio upon YTHDC1 degradation ( [Figure 6G-I](#fig6) and 25% of also identified as YTHDC1 splicing targets ( [Figure 6H](#fig6)). Similarly, a total of 322 m6A-YTHDC1 export targets were defined in C2C12 cells and also for 4](/articles/82703/figures#supp4)). And 75 of also splicing targets of C2C12 m6A-YTHDC1 ( [Figure 6M](#fig6) and [Supplementary file 4](/articles/82703/figures#supp4)). Altogether, the above results demonstrate that YTHDC1 binding can indeed promote nuclear export of target mRNAs in myoblast cells, suggesting that YTHDC1 plays pleiotropic roles in regulating both splicing and export of mRNAs in myoblasts. Co-IP/MS leads to the identification of YTHDC1 interacting partners Lastly, to further fathom the mechanism underlying the above-identified YTHDC1 regulatory functions in myoblasts, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) to identify its protein interactome knowing that the function of YTHDC1 is largely mediated by its transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally interacting partners ( [Widagdo et al., [Figure 7A B](#fig7)); the interacting proteins were retrieved by anti-Flag beads and subject to MS analysis ( [Figure 7A](#fig7)). The results identified a total of 912 potential interacting partners ( [Figure 7C](#fig7) and [Supplementary file 5](/articles/82703/figures#supp5)). Of note, they were highly enriched for RNA splicing and mRNA export factors ( [Figure 7D](#fig7)), which was in accordance with the above findings, solidifying that the dominant functions of YTHDC1 in myoblasts are splicing and export regulations. - Figure 7\u2014source data 1 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/82703/elife-82703-fig7-data1-v2.zip](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/82703/elife-82703-fig7-data1-v2.zip) - Figure 7\u2014source data 2 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/82703/elife-82703-fig7-data2-v2.zip](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/82703/elife-82703-fig7-data2-v2.zip) - Figure 7\u2014source data 3 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/82703/elife-82703-fig7-data3-v2.zip](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/82703/elife-82703-fig7-data3-v2.zip) Among the splicing factors ( [Figure 7E](#fig7)), hnRNPG (also called RNA binding motif protein X [RBMX]) ranked very high (no. 14) on the list. It is a ubiquitously expressed RBP best known for its function in splicing control ( [Elliott et al., 2019](#bib8); [Heinrich et al., 2009](#bib13)). Their physical interaction was validated by performing co-IP followed by WB using also validated in 293T cells ( [Figure 7J](#fig7)). To demonstrate the functional relevancy of hnRNPG in SCs, we knocked down hnRNPG in ASCs and found cell proliferation was reduced ( [Figure 7K](#fig7)), which phenocopied YTHDC1 loss caused defect. The finding thus demonstrates that hnRNPG functions synergistically with YTHDC1 in promoting SC proliferation. Furthermore, we also identified the well-known binding partners of YTHDC1, SRSF3 ( on the list ( [Figure 7E](#fig7)), strengthening its function in regulating splicing in myoblasts. Examining the list of mRNA export factors ( [Figure 7F](#fig7)), several components of the THO subcomplex of the TREX (transcription export) complex were identified. The bulk of the mRNA nuclear export is a complex yet well-characterized process mediated by the TREX complex and the heterodimeric nuclear export receptor NXF1:NXT1 ( [Lesbirel et al., 2018](#bib20); [Lesbirel and Wilson, 2019](#bib21)). As the key initiating complex, TREX has 14 known subunits with the multimeric THO complex as the core. Strikingly, all the known THOC members, including THOC7, 1, 6, 3, 5, and 2, were retrieved by YTHDC1 ( [Figure 7F](#fig7)). We validated the interaction of YTHDC1 C2C12 by co-IP followed by [Figure 7L](#fig7)), reinforcing YTHDC1 function in controlling mRNA export. Furthermore, we also identified some known transcriptional regulators, including RTRAF, MED29, and MED11 ( [Figure 7G](#fig7)), pointing to previously unknown means via which YTHDC1 may regulate transcription. Altogether, the results from the co-IP/MS are in line with the findings from [Figures 5](#fig5) and [6](#fig6) to reinforce the notion that YTHDC1 plays pleiotropic regulatory functions in myoblasts. Discussion In this study, we investigate the functional role of m6A reader YTHDC1 protein in skeletal muscle stem cells and muscle regeneration. Our findings demonstrate the expression dynamics of several m6A regulators including writers, readers, and erasers during the course of SC lineage progression, implicating their possible involvement in governing SC activities. Among these m6A regulators, we characterize YTHDC1 function in depth and uncover it as an essential factor controlling SC activation and proliferation. Inducible depletion of YTHDC1 in SCs drastically impairs SC activation and proliferation; regeneration. Mechanistically, LACE-seq identifies YTHDC1 binding mRNA targets among which a portion are m6A dependent. Further splicing analyses provide evidence for m6A-YTHDC1 participation in modulating splicing events in myoblast cells. Additionally, subcellular fractionation/RNA-seq also defines potential mRNA export targets of YTHDC1 in myoblasts. Lastly, co-IP/MS defines a wide array of interacting protein partners of YTHDC1, including mRNA splicing and export factors, as well as transcriptional regulators, and they may function in synergism to mediate the pleiotropic functions of YTHDC1 in myoblasts. Among these factors, hnRNPG appears to be a bona fide functional partner of YTHDC1 to synergistically regulate myoblast proliferation. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that YTHDC1 is an indispensable intrinsic regulator of SC activities and muscle regeneration through multifaceted controlling of RNA metabolism in myoblast cells ( [Figure 8](#fig8)). Until now the study of m6A regulation and function in SCs is scarce ( [Diao et al., 2021](#bib7); [Kudou et al., 2017](#bib17); [Liang et al., 2021](#bib23)). This is the first study to identify potential functional m6A regulators and provides a holistic investigation of a writer protein, YTHDC1 function in SCs and muscle regeneration. The transcriptomic profiling uncovered that an array of m6A regulators were dynamically expressed in the course of SC lineage progression; notably, YTH-domain containing reader proteins, including YTHDC1, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3, were all highly expressed in SCs. The mRNA level of YTHDC1 was high across the entire course albeit showing an induction in FISC; its protein level, nevertheless, was induced in ASC-24 hr and continued to increase until ASC-48 hr, suggesting its dominant role in governing activation/proliferation. The discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression also suggests that there may be post-transcriptional regulation to control YTHDC1 protein production. It is possible that the induction of Ythdc1 mRNA occurs early upon activation, but the protein translation occurs later in myoblasts, where it executes the mRNA splicing and export functions. Indeed, the subsequent dissection using the YTHDC1-iKO mouse provided solid evidence supporting its positive role in promoting SC activation and proliferation; inducible depletion of YTHDC1 largely inhibited SC activation and proliferation ( [Figure 3](#fig3)). We believe the incompetence of SC activation/proliferation is the major cause of nearly blocked regeneration after acute injury-induced muscle damage. Nevertheless, the potential defects in other aspects such as differentiation, self-renewal, and survival need to be investigated in the future. Of note, YTHDC1 expression can also be detected in QSCs albeit to a very low level. We also noticed decreased SC numbers after long-term loss of YTHDC1 (data not shown), suggesting that it may play a critical role in QSC maintenance. Our findings thus suggest that YTHDC1 plays an indispensable role in SCs and muscle regeneration, which is not replaceable by other m6A readers. This study also adds genetic evidence for the importance of YTHDC1 in cellular processes, which is largely lacking in the field. In the future, it will also be interesting to test the functionality of other readers such as YTHDF1, 2, and 3 in SCs. To investigate the functional mechanism of YTHDC1 in promoting SC activation/proliferation, recently developed LACE-seq was harnessed both ASCs and C2C12 myoblasts. Even though the number of peaks identified in ASCs was not comparable with the number in C2C12, LACE-seq has enabled the profiling of transcriptome-wide YTHDC1 binding in ASCs, which was previously impossible using traditional mRNA binding probing methods. By combining with the m6A MeRIP-seq dataset available in C2C12 ( [Gheller et al., 2020](#bib10)), we were able to define m6A-modified binding targets of YTHDC1. From out data, YTHDC1 selectively bound a subset [Figure 4H This by dynamic multivalent interactions of YTHDC1, RNAs, and regulatory proteins that self-organize into distinct condensates (nuclear subcompartments) within the nucleus ( [He and He, 2021](#bib12); [Widagdo et al., 2022](#bib39)), It is also worth pointing out that a large portion of the YTHDC1 binding targets do not seem to possess m6A modification ( [Figure 4H](#fig4)), suggesting that YTHDC1 may have m6A-independent functions. However, it is commonly believed that YTHDC1 regulatory functions are largely dependent on its m6A binding capacity ( [Chen et al., 2016](#bib41)). In the mutants myoblast defect in YTHDC1-depleted C2C12 myoblasts, strongly suggesting its pro-proliferative function in myoblasts relies on its m6A binding ability. Nevertheless, since YTHDC1 is now known to participate in liquid phase separation ( [Widagdo et al., 2022](#bib39)), it is likely that m6A-modified RNAs may initiate the recruitment of YTHDC1 through the YTH m6A binding domain, YTHDC1 then promotes condensate formation through the two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) independent of its m6A reading function. It is also interesting to notice that about 12% of YTHDC1 binding peaks were mapped to retrotransposons cell et al., 2021a](#bib4); [Liu et al., 2021](#bib24); [Xu et al., 2021](#bib43)), it would thus be interesting to explore the possible functional relevancy of YTHDC1 regulation of retrotransposons in SCs. In the future, it will also be necessary to generate transcriptome-wide m6A mapping in SCs, which has become possible by the recently developed methods enabling the use of low number of cells. Next, we examined YTHDC1 regulation of mRNA splicing in depth by examining altered splicing events upon YTHDC1 loss, which unveiled the splicing targets of m6A-YTHDC1. The number was relatively small in ASCs due to the relatively small number of YTHDC1 binding targets from LACE-seq; a much higher number was found in C2C12 cells but constituted only a small number (20%) of m6A-YTHDC1 targets. Additionally, we examined the potential effects of YTHDC1 loss in mRNA nuclear export and indeed identified a set of mRNAs possibly regulated by m6A-YTHDC1; upon YTHDC1 loss, the nuclear enrichment level was significantly increased. Interestingly, 20% of these mRNAs are also splicing targets of m6A-YTHDC1, suggesting that YTHDC1 binding to an m6A-modified mRNA can control mRNA metabolism at multiple levels. Of note, our study identifies a large number of splicing or/and export targets of m6A-YTHDC1, and they play a wide range of cellular functions directly or indirectly related to cellular proliferation. The observed proliferative defects upon YTHDC1 loss thus could be a combinatorial effect of many downstream targets that were enriched for a wide range of GO functions important for SC proliferation ( [Figure 5\u2014figure canonical Wnt signaling is known to induce SC proliferation during adult skeletal muscle regeneration ( [Otto et al., 2008](#bib27)). Lastly, co-IP/MS was performed in myoblasts and led to the identification of an array of RNA processing regulators mainly including splicing and nuclear export factors. This finding is in concordance with the above demonstrated YTHDC1 functions in splicing and export regulations. In addition, transcriptional regulators were also identified. The m6A-dependent functions of YTHDC1 in regulating splicing, export, or transcription have all been individually reported in various cell types ( [Kasowitz et al., 2018](#bib16); [Lee et al., 2021](#bib18); [Roundtree et al., 2017](#bib31)); our finding thus hints pleiotropic roles of YTHDC1 in myoblasts. In terms of splicing regulation, Xiao et al. showed that YTHDC1 binds competitively to the splicing factor SRSF3, while antagonizing the binding of SRSF10 to promote exon inclusion ( [Xiao et al., 2016](#bib41)). The top-ranked binding partner on our list, however, was not SR splicing factors ( [Figure 7E](#fig7)); instead, hnRNPG appeared as the most likely interacting partner. Its specific interaction with YTHDC1 was validated by co-IP/WB using both exogenously and endogenously expressed proteins in C2C12 and also in 293T cells ( [Figure 7](#fig7)), thus pointing to hnRNPG as a bona fide interacting partner of YTHDC1. Interestingly, hnRNPG also represents a multifaceted gene regulator. Originally known as a hnRNP family splicing factor via interactions with it was later shown to bind with m6A-modified mRNAs, thus possessing m6A reader function. It can co-transcriptionally interact with both RNAPII and m6A-modified nascent splicing ( [Zhou et al., 2019](#bib50)). Its implicated role in transcription repression was also reported ( [Elliott et al., 2019](#bib8)). Therefore, both hnRNPG and YTHDC1 are versatile m6A-dependent gene regulators yet no study so far has made functional connection between these two key m6A readers despite their physical interaction being mentioned ( [Heinrich et al., 2009](#bib13); [Xu et al., 2022](#bib44)). Our result in [Figure 7K](#fig7) demonstrates their functional synergism in promoting C2C12 myoblast proliferation. Future efforts will be focused on further delineating the regulatory and functional synergism between YTHDC1 and hnRNPG in SCs. In addition, the co-IP/MS also identifies a number of TREX components as potential interacting partners of YTHDC1, and a prior report also demonstrated the physical interaction between TREX complex with YTHDC1 in HEK293T cells ( [Lesbirel et al., 2018](#bib20)). The modulation of nuclear export by YTHDC1 is thus very likely exerted together with TREX proteins, which will need to be further investigated in the future. Altogether, biologically, our findings uncover YTHDC1 as an essential post-transcriptional regulator of SC activities and muscle regeneration. In the coming years, more solid genetic evidence will be needed to demonstrate the key roles of m6A regulators in various biological systems. It will also be interesting to determine whether YTHDC1 deregulation is implicated in muscle-related diseases such as aging-associated sarcopenia. Mechanistically, we demonstrate multifaceted roles of YTHDC1 in decoding m6A-marked transcripts in myoblasts; a wide range of mRNA targets are controlled by YTHDC1, thus mediating its effect in promoting myoblast proliferation. Although this study mainly focuses on delineating its post-transcriptional actions, we believe that YTHDC1 also modulates transcriptional events in myoblast nucleus and hnRNPG seems to constitute an important co-factor that may synergistically regulate both splicing and transcription functions of YTHDC1. In addition, it will be interesting to explore whether YTHDC1, hnRNPG, and the target mRNAs self-organize into distinct condensates within the myoblast nucleus as emerging evidence suggests RNA, m6A readers, and co-factors can cooperatively form distinct nuclear condensates at specific genomic loci ( [Widagdo et al., 2022](#bib39)). Furthermore, although YTHDC1 is predominantly found in the nucleus of myoblast cells, it may transiently shuttle into the cytoplasm as described in [Rafalska et al., 2004](#bib29); [Shima et al., 2017](#bib35) and execute unexpected post-transcriptional functions such as in mRNA destabilization ( [Shima et al., 2017](#bib35); [Zhang et methods Mice Pax7CreER (Pax7tm1(cre/ERT2)Gaka) and Tg: Pax7-nGFP mouse strains were kindly Shahragim Tajbakhsh.

The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 \u00d7 g and supernatant was discarded. The pelleted nuclei were washed once with hypotonic lysis buffer and then resuspended in hypertonic buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.6% NP-40, and Protease Inhibitors [Roche]), digested with the DNase I (AM2238, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 min at 4\u00b0C, and spun down at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The nuclear lysates were diluted twofold with IP buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 M NaCl, cOmplete Protease Inhibitors [Roche]) and then flag-beads (Anti-Flag Magnetic MCE, HY-K0207) were added and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing five times, proteins were eluted with elution buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 0.2% SDS) at 99\u00b0C for 10 min, and 20% elution was subjected to western blot verification. Mass spectrometry experiment was performed using the Bruker timsTOF Pro Mass-spectrometer with the help of Biosciences Central Research Facility, HKUST.

Unique YTHDC1 interacting proteins were selected comparing flag-YTHDC1 sample and flag-vector sample (excluding nonspecific binding targets). Co-immunoprecipitation [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82703?item=s4-16) Co-IP of C2C12 cells and 293T cells was performed based on published protocol ( [Xu et al., 2021](#bib43)). Briefly, cells were incubated in buffer A for 5 min on ice and then homogenized as described for cell fractionation. The nuclei were pelleted by 2000 \u00d7 g, 5 min centrifugation and resuspended in hypertonic buffer mM HEPES, 10% 0.42 M KCl, mM DTT, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). After 30 min incubation on ice, nuclear extract was collected by high-speed centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 15 min, 4\u00b0C). Same volume of hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 1\u00d7 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) was added to nuclear extract. Lysate was precleared with protein G beads (Dynabeads Protein G for Immunoprecipitation, Invitrogen, 10003D) at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr with rotation and 10% was saved as input. After incubation with indicated antibodies overnight, protein G beads were added and incubated for another 2 hr at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed five times with IP buffer and proteins were eluted with 1\u00d7 SDS loading buffer at 99\u00b0C for 5 min. LACE-seq and data analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82703?item=s4-17) LACE-seq was performed as described. ( [Su et al., 2021](#bib36)) Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and subjected to 400 mJ UV treatment to crosslink proteins with their interacting RNAs. After crosslink, cells were pelleted and kept at -80\u00b0C before library preparation. YTHDC1 antibody (Abcam, ab122340) was used to pull down specific protein-RNA complex from lysate. In brief, MNase was used to cut RNAs into YTHDC1-associated short fragments on beads. The 3 ends of fragmented RNAs were then dephosphorylated and ligated with a 5 pre-adenylated containing four randomized nucleotides. Biotinylated primer containing the T7 promoter was used for reverse transcription, which stopped at crosslinking site (YTHDC1 binding site). cDNAs were poly(A) tailed and with streptavidin beads. Second-strand cDNAs were synthesized on beads with an containing oligo-(dT). After a pre-amplifying step by PCR, T7 RNA polymerase was used to amplify trace amounts of truncated cDNAs linearly. Then the products were PCR converted into libraries for single-end sequencing on Illumina platform (NextSeq 550). For the LACE-seq data analysis, first, the adapter sequences and poly(A) tails at the 3 end of raw reads were removed using Cutadapt (v.1.15) with the following 2 -a A{15} --quality-base=33. reads were first aligned to mouse pre-rRNA using Bowtie software (v.1.2.3) with default parameters, and the remaining unmapped reads were then aligned to the mouse (mm9) performed using multiBamSummary module of deeptools. LACE-seq peaks are called by Piranha software ( [http://smithlabresearch.org/software/piranha/](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/piranha/), v.1.2.1) in ASC 0.001 -b 20 -d ZeroTruncatedNegativeBinomial. For motif analysis, LACE-seq peaks were first extended 20 nt to upstream and downstream, respectively. Enriched motifs are scanned by findMotifsGenome.pl from Homer. Whole-cell RNA-seq and RNA splicing analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82703?item=s4-18) For the splicing analysis, RNA-seq reads were first aligned to the mm9 reference genome using STAR, and splicing events were then detected by rMATS with default parameters ( [Shen et al., 2014](#bib32)). A cutoff of absolute value of 'IncLevelDifference' < 0.1 was used to define DSEs in YTHDC1 iKO vs. Ctrl. DSE targets are the genes that having DSE in its transcripts. Subcellular RNA-seq and mRNA exporting analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82703?item=s4-19) For the subcellular RNA-seq analysis, reads were aligned to reference genome and the quantification of gene expression was performed by Cufflink. A cutoff of FPKM > 1 either in cytoplasmic (cyto) or nuclear (nuc) was used to determine the expression of genes. To identify the nuclear-enriched mRNAs upon YTHDC1 knockout or degradation, the log2(cyto/nuc) of knockout or degradation should be less than the Ctrl sample and the log2(cyto/nuc) of knockout or degradation should be less than -1.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Nuclear m6A Reader YTHDC1 Promotes Muscle Stem Cell Activation/Proliferation by Regulating mRNA Splicing and Nuclear Export\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hong Cheng (Reviewer #1). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: All three reviewers were positive and supportive but had significant suggestions for revision prior to acceptance. (A) Reviewer 1 confirmed the view that your paper provides new insight into YTHDC1 function in regulating SC activation/proliferation but added that some of the data could be improved to fully support the conclusions. Specifically: 1. The title \"Nuclear m6A Reader YTHDC1 Promotes Muscle Stem Cell Activation/Proliferation by Regulating mRNA Splicing and Nuclear Export\" seems a bit overstated. Their data are not sufficient to show YTHDC1 regulating nuclear export. From figure 6 we could see some mRNAs export was inhibited upon YTHDC1 loss but intron retention also occurs on these mRNAs, for example, Dnajc14. Since intron retention could lead to mRNA nuclear retention, the mRNA export inhibition may be caused by splicing deficiency. From the data they provided we could not draw the conclusion that YTHDC1 directly affects mRNA export. I think they could not emphasize this point in the title. 2. The mechanism of YTHDC1 promoting muscle stem cell activation/proliferation is not solidified. The authors could strengthen their evidence through bioinformatics analysis or give more discussion. Besides, the previous work done by Zhao and colleagues (Zhao et al.,. Nature 542, 475-478 (2017).) reported another m6A reader Ythdf2 promotes m6A-dependent to facilitate Does YTHDC1 regulate mRNA clearance during SC activation/proliferation? The authors should explore this possibility by deep-seq data analysis and give some discussion. 3. The authors should further improve the logical connections between and within paragraphs. For example, the narration of results from lines 138 to 148 would be better if it goes on as a series of phenomenal comparisons between control and iKO muscles but not as bulk descriptions for different groups. More specifically, in lines 139-140 the author described \"massive immune cell infiltration was not observed on the first-day post-injury (data not shown)\" supposedly of the control group (without any clear indications in this sentence), while in lines 145 and figure 2D immune infiltration was compared between control and iKO muscles. There are also cases where the wording falls short of scientific interpretations such as in line 200, the phrase \"since there was no difficulty growing and obtaining C2C12 cells\" is quite inappropriate. 4. It is quite confusing to have an AID-YTHDC1 cell line starting in line 178. The authors might want to further explain the purpose of this design. In line 168 the authors used the phrase \"early stages\" and appeared to focus mainly on the early stage defects in the regeneration of satellite cells. So it is necessary to clarify how C2C12 as a more later-stage myoblast could help explain the mechanism/effect of YTHDC1 loss on SC regeneration activation/proliferation.\" 5. In figure 2G, the X-axis labels are missing. 6. In figure 3B and 3D, the IF background is too high. The authors need to provide higher-quality images. 3D, the arrows are off-target. (C) Reviewer (3) was similarly positive, flagging that these preliminary analyses provide a valuable foundation for further mechanistic investigation. The identification of YTHDC1 as a regulator in skeleton muscle development would be beneficial for the field of muscle injury and regeneration. Reviewer (3) had the following concerns and suggestions: 1. Does skeleton muscle cell activation and proliferation depend on YTHDC1's m6A binding function? Rescue experiments by overexpressing YTHDC1 and LACE-seq-identified m6A-targets by inactivating m6A writers. 3. What are the roles of YTHDC1's splicing and export targets in skeleton muscle development? 4. hnRNPG is identified as YTHDC1's partner in RNA splicing, what is the role of hnRNPG in skeleton muscle development? Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): 1. The authors should further improve the logical connections between and within paragraphs. For example, the narration of results from lines 138 to 148 would be better if it goes on as a series of phenomenal comparisons between control and iKO muscles but not as bulk descriptions for different groups.

In figure 2G, the X-axis labels are missing. 4. In figure 3B and 3D, the IF background is too high. The authors need to provide higher-quality images. 3D, the arrows are off-target. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): I suggest that the authors should rewrite the manuscript in a more concise manner. Given the multiple readers in satellite cells, it remains unclear whether YTHDC1 selectively interprets a subset of m6A or all m6A in a non-discrimination manner. In other words, does YTHDC1 play redundant or unique compartment and stage-dependent functions in satellite cells? Another question is if YTHDC1 could also exert an additional function in addition to as a reader of m6A. These should be discussed. Figure 1B-C is meant to support the dynamics of m6A-related genes, especially Ythdc1. However, the dynamics of Ythdc1 were not obvious from these panels (especially in 1C). The results are also in contrast with the western blot results in Figure 1E. Please clarify. H-E staining in Figure 2 shows that there was no regeneration whatsoever in the KO, but the laminin staining shows many signals. Are these ghost fibers or other cell types? Immunofluorescence images in Figure 3 are very difficult to visualize. Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors): I have the following concerns and suggestions: 1. Does skeleton muscle cell activation and proliferation depend on YTHDC1's m6A binding function? Rescue experiments by overexpressing YTHDC1 and LACE-seq-identified m6A-targets by inactivating m6A writers. 3. What are the roles of YTHDC1's splicing and export targets in skeleton muscle development? 4. hnRNPG is identified as YTHDC1's partner in RNA splicing, what is the role of hnRNPG in skeleton muscle development?

(A) Reviewer 1 confirmed the view that your paper provides new insight into YTHDC1 function in regulating SC activation/proliferation but added that some of the data could be improved to fully support the conclusions. Specifically: 1. The title \"Nuclear m6A Reader YTHDC1 Promotes Muscle Stem Cell Activation/Proliferation by Regulating mRNA Splicing and Nuclear Export\" seems a bit overstated. Their data are not sufficient to show YTHDC1 regulating nuclear export. From figure 6 we could see some mRNAs export was inhibited upon YTHDC1 loss but intron retention also occurs on these mRNAs, for example, Dnajc14. Since intron retention could lead to mRNA nuclear retention, the mRNA export inhibition may be caused by splicing deficiency. From the data they provided we could not draw the conclusion that YTHDC1 directly affects mRNA export. I think they could not emphasize this point in the title. Thanks for the suggestion. It is true that in our initial submission, we had more data to support YTHDC1 regulation of mRNA splicing but not enough on nuclear export. It will take substantial amount of time and efforts to have thorough dissection on both mechanisms. Nevertheless, we argue that our data does provide evidence on YTHDC1 regulation of nuclear export. For example, in Figures 6 C, H, and M, only ~20% of the target mRNAs (such as Dnaj14) showed alteration in both splicing and export upon YTHDC1 loss while the majority of the export targets showed no splicing deficiency. For example, Btbd7 and Tiparp in Figure 6 N showed no intron retention. In addition, we have now performed Co-IP experiments to validate the interaction between YTHDC1 and THOC7 (new result added in Figure 7L), which provides extra evidence to support YTHDC1 function in regulating mRNA nuclear export. We thus would like to keep the original title in order to reflect the multifaceted function of YTHDC1 in muscle stem cells. 2. The mechanism of YTHDC1 promoting muscle stem cell activation/proliferation is not solidified. The authors could strengthen their evidence through bioinformatics analysis or give more discussion. Besides, the previous work done by Zhao and colleagues (Zhao et al.,. Nature 542, 475-478 (2017).) reported another m6A reader Ythdf2 promotes m6A-dependent to facilitate Does YTHDC1 regulate mRNA clearance during SC activation/proliferation? The authors should explore this possibility by deep-seq data analysis and give some discussion. Thanks for the critical comment. For the first concern, we think YTHDC1 promotes muscle stem cell activation/proliferation through the multi-level gene regulatory capabilities of YTHDC1 on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes and the myriads of targets regulated by YTHDC1. In addition, with the newly added data, we believe that YTHDC1's function is largely dependent on its synergism with hnRNPG (Figure 7 K). We have added the discussion in lines 421-427 of the revised text. For the second question, our data showed that YTHDC1 predominantly localizes in the nucleus of SCs and myoblasts (Figure 1 F and G), thus it may not have a role in regulating mRNA clearance in the cytoplasm like YTHDF2. Nevertheless, there are a few existing reports1, 2 suggesting its possible role in mRNA degradation and stability which may arise from its transient shuttling to cytoplasm of cells. We have now added this point in lines 469-472 of the revised text. 3. The authors should further improve the logical connections between and within paragraphs. For example, the narration of results from lines 138 to 148 would be better if it goes on as a series of phenomenal comparisons between control and iKO muscles but not as bulk descriptions for different groups. More specifically, in lines 139-140 the author described \"massive immune cell infiltration was not observed on the first-day post-injury (data not shown)\" supposedly of the control group (without any clear indications in this sentence), while in lines 145 and figure 2D immune infiltration was compared between control and iKO muscles. There are also cases where the wording falls short of scientific interpretations such as in line 200, the phrase \"since there was no difficulty growing and obtaining C2C12 cells\" is quite inappropriate. Thanks for the suggestion. We apologize for the poor logic. We have now edited throughout the text to improve the logical connections between and within paragraphs. And also modified the mentioned sentences. Please see the changes in lines 127-139 and lines 196-198 in the revised text. 4. It is quite confusing to have an AID-YTHDC1 cell line starting in line 178. The authors might want to further explain the purpose of this design. In line 168 the authors used the phrase \"early stages\" and appeared to focus mainly on the early stage defects in the regeneration of satellite cells. So it is necessary to clarify how C2C12 as a more later-stage myoblast could help explain the mechanism/effect of YTHDC1 loss on SC regeneration \"Inducible YTHDC1 knockout impairs SC activation/proliferation.\" Thanks for the suggestion. We used the phrase \"early stages\" to emphasize the function of YTHDC1 in the activation/proliferation stage comparing the later differentiation stage during muscle regeneration. C2C12 is a proliferating myoblast cell line, which is an acceptable cell line model to study the proliferation of myoblasts. We have now changed the description in lines 156-158 and 168-170 to avoid misunderstanding. 5. In figure 2G, the X-axis labels are missing. Sorry for the missing labels. We have now included the X-axis labels in Figure 2G. 6. In figure 3B and 3D, the IF background is too high. The authors need to provide higher-quality images. 3D, the arrows are off-target. Thanks for the suggestion. We apologize for the poor quality of the images. We have now provided images with better quality in Figures 3B and 3D. We have also adjusted the arrows in Figure 3D. (C) Reviewer (3) was similarly positive, flagging that these preliminary analyses provide a valuable foundation for further mechanistic investigation. The identification of YTHDC1 as a regulator in skeleton muscle development would be beneficial for the field of muscle injury and regeneration. Reviewer (3) had the following concerns and suggestions: 1. Does skeleton muscle cell activation and proliferation depend on YTHDC1's m6A binding function? Rescue experiments by overexpressing YTHDC1 and its m6A-binding mutants would help. Thanks for the great suggestion. We have now performed rescue experiments by overexpressing WT or m6A-binding mutants of YTHDC1 in the AID-YTHDC1 C2C12 cells. and found only the WT but not mutant YTHDC1 could partially rescue the proliferation defect, solidifying our finding that YTHDC1 promoting myoblast proliferation is dependent on its m6A binding function. The data is included in the revised Figure 3 J and Figure 3-\u2014figure supplement 1 I and lines 177-183 of the revised text. 2. Validation of meRIP and LACE-seq-identified m6A-targets by inactivating m6A writers. Thanks for the great suggestion. We have now used STM245710 to inactivate the m6A writer METTL3 and found it decreased m6A level (by MeRIP-qPCR) and also YTHDC1 binding (by RIP-qPCR) on its targets. The data is included in Figure 4 L and M and in lines 223-225 and 230-236 of the revised text. 3. What are the roles of YTHDC1's splicing and export targets in skeleton muscle development? Thanks for the question. In Figure 5-\u2014figure supplement 1 D, we performed the GO analysis of m6A-YTHDC1 splicing targets to uncover that YTHDC1 splicing targets were enriched for mRNA processing, Wnt signaling pathway, RNA splicing, etc. In Figure 6 G and L, we also performed GO analysis of YTHDC1 export targets and found these targets were enriched for histone modification, chromatin organization, etc. These YTHDC1 splicing/export targets were important for SC proliferation. For example, canonical Wnt signaling induces satellite-cell proliferation during adult skeletal muscle regeneration11. These data suggest that YTHDC1 regulates a wide range of targets important for SC proliferation and muscle development. We have now revised the text in lines 421-427 to clarify the above points. 4. hnRNPG is identified as YTHDC1's partner in RNA splicing, what is the role of hnRNPG in skeleton muscle development? Thanks for the question. The function of hnRNPG in skeletal muscle stem cells and muscle regeneration/development has barely been studied. To demonstrate its functional relevancy in SCs, we have now knocked down hnRNPG in activated satellite cells and found SC proliferation was reduced. The data suggests that YTHDC1 and hnRNPG function synergistically in promoting SC proliferation. The data is included in Figure 7K and in lines 326-329 of the revised text. Reference: 1.

However, it remains largely elusive how cell cycle recovery is initiated after DNA damage. In this study, we discovered the upregulated protein level of MASTL kinase hours after DNA damage. MASTL promotes cell cycle progression by preventing PP2A/B55-catalyzed dephosphorylation of CDK substrates. DNA damage-induced MASTL upregulation was caused by decreased protein degradation, and was unique among mitotic kinases. We identified E6AP as the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediated MASTL degradation. MASTL degradation was inhibited upon DNA damage as a result of the dissociation of E6AP from MASTL. E6AP depletion reduced DNA damage signaling, and promoted cell cycle recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint, in a MASTL-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that E6AP was phosphorylated at Ser-218 by ATM after DNA damage and that this phosphorylation was required for its dissociation from MASTL, the stabilization of MASTL, and the timely recovery of cell cycle progression. Together, our data revealed that ATM/ATR-dependent signaling, while activating the DNA damage checkpoint, also initiates cell cycle recovery from the arrest. Consequently, this results in a timer-like mechanism that ensures the transient nature of the DNA damage checkpoint. - - Cancer Biology - Cell Biology Blocking a protein known as EPAC1 may prevent the development of heart-related side effects caused by a chemotherapy drug.
