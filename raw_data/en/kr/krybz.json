Interns attend these hour-long seminars regularly. Didactics - This series covers a wide range of topics including multidisciplinary team consultation, sleep, bariatrics, neurological disorders, pediatric obesity, family functioning, ADHD, child abuse and neglect, psychiatric medications, complementary and alternative medicine, ethics, diversity, treatment adherence, business of psychology, and personalized predictive medicine. Colloquia - Monthly presentations give interns a chance to learn more about research and clinical practice. Presentations cover a variety of topics, and are jointly attended by faculty and trainees from the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology and the Division of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics. Hospital-Sponsored Programs - Cincinnati Children's offers a variety of educational programs, such as pediatric grand rounds, nursing grand rounds, neurology grand rounds, quality in action and child psychiatry grand rounds. Evidence-based Care Manual - Interns are provided with access to a manual of recent articles regarding evidence-based assessment and treatment. Seminar Series on Applied Research - This series offers training in statistics, grant writing, research ethics / human subject protection and community-based participatory research methods. Psychology Research Group -This monthly meeting fosters the development and review of research projects within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology. Faculty members present grant applications, manuscripts or research ideas that are reviewed by at least one junior faculty member, one senior faculty member and one post-doctoral fellow. Through discussions of these internal reviews, interns learn about writing and reviewing manuscripts, the grant application process, research with diverse populations, research design and data analytic methods. CITI training - All interns are required to complete the Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI) program. CITI raises the bar for general knowledge about clinical research and will improve the overall quality of clinical research. It is in use in at least 22 of 26 AAHRPP-approved institutions. This series offers interns the opportunity to meet with members of several multidisciplinary teams with whom the faculty and residents work. Didactics include different models of care, effective communication between disciplines, roles and responsibilities of team members. This series, which is a part of the pediatric behavioral medicine and clinical psychology series, focuses on helping residents develop the necessary professional skills of independent professional psychologists. Topics include ethics, career paths, vitae building, APA and licensure. Each O'Grady resident receives approximately four to six hours of face-to-face supervision a week. Supervision includes direct observation of clinical activity, as well as planning and discussing assessment or treatment issues. A supervisor's approach to supervision varies, but we are all committed to the philosophy of using an individualized approach and formulating specific objectives with each intern. Once per year, interns give a formal case presentation focusing on integrating research or evidence with practice. Interns receive training and support from supervisors as needed while they prepare for these presentations. This series features didactic and experiential training in a broad range of topics designed to promote awareness of diversity and increase competencies in culturally responsive care. Topics focus on increasing understanding of the factors that affect our patient's experience of care in the health system. The Diversity Seminar Series includes presentations from individuals within BMCP, Cincinnati Children's, and the community; dedicated time to study DEI topics of interest; and opportunities to learn from one another as we examine and process our own professional behavior and experiences as it relates to diversity. All employees at Cincinnati Children's - interns included - are required to participate in hospital-sponsored diversity training. Learn more about these training sessions from the [Office of Diversity and Inclusion](/careers/diversity) at Cincinnati Children's. A special effort is made to focus on diversity issues in supervision of assessment and therapy cases. Interns are provided an opportunity to explore their comfort level and develop goals related to working effectively across cultures. The Supervision Seminar meets bimonthly and includes case presentations, group supervision of interesting or challenging cases, simulated case practice, and didactics regarding practical aspects of supervision. Multiple faculty members lead these seminars in order to provide a variety of perspectives. For more information, contact Denisse Herrera "}
