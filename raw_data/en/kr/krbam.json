Kurka stated there are doctors using their clinical judgment to determine ivermectin is useful 289 for case of COVID -19, adding that if patients are interested and willing to experiment with this 290 medication and the doctors prescribe this judgment, it should be filled. Rep. Kurka stated that 291 ivermectin has recei ved a Nobel Prize for treatment in humans , reiterating prescribers should be 292 able to treat their patients with this, but that there are some pharmacies not filling those 293 prescriptions . Dr. Ruffridge thanked Rep. Kurka for his comment and encouraged the pu blic to 294 review their draft Q and A, which will be discussed later in the meeting. Ms. Carrillo provided the 295 page number, 250 , located in the public packet. 296 297 Representative Ken McCarty: 298 Rep. McCarty stated he wants to ensure our state has all the medicati ons necessary to combat 299 COVID. As the representative for Eagle River -Chugiak, he has looked at monoclonal antibodies 300 and ways to get this into communities. Rep. McCarty added he is hearing about patients unable to 301 receive monoclonal antibodies around the state and is now hearing ivermectin can't get into the 302 hands of patients. Rep. McCarty is interested in helping with the supply, stating he is a trustee with 303 the Mental Health Trust along with trustee, John Sturgeon, who was instrumental in delivering 304 PPE a ll over communities in Alaska by plane. McCarty state d it would be ideal for the same to 305 occur with ivermectin and is happy to help with that effort. 306 307 Dr. Ruffridge stated for the public that ivermectin is not a commonly prescribed human drug in 308 the U.S. a nd that the current supply is well below the current demand. Dr. Ruffridge stated he has 309 dispensed 10 years' worth of this drug in about 10 hours , that it is a difficult drug to stock and any 310 concerns about supply right now is valid . Dr. Ruffridge stated he has not experienced a similar 311 supply issue with monoclonal antibodies, but that as the situation continues to unfold, it may 312 become scarce. Ms. Bell added that the supply is being controlled by the federal government and is 313 based on an allocation. The Alaska Department of Health and Social services is working with the 314 federal government and advocating for supply, though it is ultimately not controlled by the state. 315 316 TASK 2 317 Dr. Ruffridge will submit written responses to Representat ives Kurka and McCarty's questions 318 following the meeting. 319 320 Agenda Item #6 Investigative Update 11:32 a.m. 321 322 Imposition of civil fines 323 The board returned to the investigative review of imposition of civil fines. 324 325 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell to accept the imposition of civil fine for case #2020 - 326 000163 in the amount of $250.00, and seconded by Ashley Schaber, it was: 327 328 RESOLVED to accept the imposition of civil fine for #2020 -000163. 329 330 9 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 331 Leif Holm x 332 Ashley Schaber x 333 Justin Ruffridge x 334 Lana Bell x 335 Tammy Lindemuth x 336 James Henderson x 337 Sharon Long x 338 The motion passed with no further discussion. 339 340 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell to accept the imposition of civil fine for case #2020 - 341 000790 in the amount of $1,000.00 and seconded by Ashley Schaber, it was: 342 343 RESOLVED to accept the imposition of civil fine for #2020 -000790. 344 345 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 346 Leif Holm x 347 Ashley Schaber x 348 Justin Ruffridge x 349 Lana Bell x 350 Tammy Lindemuth x 351 James Henderson x 352 Sharon Long x 353 The motion passed with no further discussion. 354 355 Voluntary surrender 356 The board then moved to review matters relating to voluntary surrenders. 357 358 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridge to accept the voluntary surrender for case 359 #2020 -000655, and seconded by James Henderson, it was: 360 361 RESOLVED to accept the voluntary surrender for #2020 -000655. 362 363 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 364 Leif Holm x 365 Ashley Schaber x 366 Justin Ruffridge x 367 Lana Bell x 368 Tammy Lindemuth x 369 10 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting James Henderson x 370 Sharon Long x 371 The motion passed with no further discussion. 372 373 Consent agreement 374 The board then reviewed a matter related to a continuing education consent agreement. 375 376 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell to accept the consent agreement for case #2021 - 377 000087, and seconded by James Henderson, it was: 378 379 RESOLVED to accept the consent agreement for #2021 -000087. 380 381 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 382 Leif Holm x 383 Ashley Schaber x 384 Justin Ruffridge x 385 Lana Bell x 386 Tammy Lindemuth x 387 James Henderson x 388 Sharon Long x 389 The motion passed with no further discussion. 390 391 TASK 3 392 Ms. Carrillo will send the imposition of civil fines, voluntary surrender, and consent agreement to 393 Dr. Ruffridge for signature s and will forward these to Investigator Bowles. 394 395 James Henderson called for break. 396 397 Off record at 11:35 a.m. 398 On record at 11:4 1 a.m. 399 400 Agenda Item # 8 Board Business 11:44 a.m. 401 402 Application review 403 The board then moved onto board business, beginning with application review. 404 405 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell in accordance with AS 44.62.310(c)(2), and seconded 406 by Ashley Schaber , the board unanimously moved to enter executive session for the 407 purpose of discussing subjects that tend to prejudice the reputation and character of any 408 person, provided the person may request a public discussion. 409 410 11 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting RESOLVED to enter into executive session in accordance with AS 44.62.310(c)(2 ). 411 Staff, Michael Bowles and Laura Carrillo were authorized to remain in the room. 412 413 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 414 Justin Ruffridge x 415 Lana Bell x 416 Tammy Lindemuth x 417 James Henderson x 418 Ashley Schaber x 419 Leif Holm x 420 Sharon Long x 421 The motion passed with no further discussion. 422 423 Off record at 11:46 a.m. 424 On record at 12:28 p.m. 425 426 Upon return from executive session, Chair Ruffridge clarified that no motions were made during 427 executive session.

The board then addressed the topic ivermectin, which is 509 included in the board's draft COVID Q/A presented to the board for their consideration to 510 publish. 511 512 Ms. Bell stated the board needs to remain cognizant of what it publishes and be aware of potential 513 liability issues, particularly when it comes to agents that are not EUA approved . Ms. Bell stated she 514 is unsure if the board should create an opinion but agrees it doesn't h elp licensees or patients to be 515 silent. Dr. Ruffridge stated it would be wise to address high dosage amounts because it tends to 516 cause the most concern, adding that p harmacists are stuck on a front line making decisions to fill 517 or not to fill , which leads to discussions on what role the pharmacist plays. Dr. Schaber stated the 518 draft does a good job presenting al l the facts together and gives good guidance to patients and 519 pharmacists. Dr. Ruffridge commented that if the board were to publish this individually, it may 520 find themselves front, center, and alone in the discussion, so wants to ensure the board thoroughl y 521 discusse s this. 522 523 Dr. Ruffridge added that ivermectin falls into a gray area ; that the reason why there is opposition 524 is because there is n't clear evidence for its use. Dr. Ruffridge believes there should be a 525 mechanism for knowing whether ivermectin has been a benefit or detriment to the patient , not 526 only from the perspective of pharmacists, but in follow -up by the prescriber on how the patient 527 fared with the drug . Dr. Ruffridge added that some ivermectin prescriptions are being issued by 528 non-resident pre scribers and wondered how that was being addressed by the medical board, 529 particularly for remote prescribing . 530 531 Dr. Schaber mentioned receiving information from DHSS's section of epidemiology and inquired 532 whether the board should work in tandem with this se ction to ensure there is consistency in the 533 board's messaging. Dr. Ruffridge agreed it would be ideal to get DHSS' input and again see if 534 prescribing boards would be amenable to collaborating on it. 535 536 14 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting On a motion duly made by Lana Bell to create and distribute a fact sheet on the use of 537 ivermectin for the treatment of COVID -19 with feedback with DHSS' section of 538 epidemiology , and seconded by James Henderson , it was: 539 540 RESOLVED to proceed with pursuing a fac t sheet on therapeutic treatment of 541 COVID -19, including the use of ivermectin, in collaboration with DHSS' section of 542 epidemiology . 543 544 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 545 Leif Holm x 546 Ashley Schaber x 547 Justin Ruffridge x 548 Lana Bell x 549 Tammy Lindemuth x 550 James Henderson x 551 Sharon Long x 552 The motion passed with no further discussion. 553 554 TASK 7 555 Laura will reach out to DHSS' section of epidemiology to collaborate with the board on its draft 556 Q/A addressing therapeutic treatment of COVID -19, including the use of ivermectin. 557 558 Agenda Item # 9 Lunch 1:03 p.m. 559 560 Chair Ruffridge called for lunch at 1:03 p.m. 561 562 Off record for lunch at 1:03 p.m. 563 On record from lunch at 1:40 p.m. 564 565 Agenda Item # 8 Board Business 1:41 p.m. 566 567 The board returned to board business to discuss the PDMP disciplinary matrix . The board 568 reviewed its last approved matrix from their May 20 -21, 2021 meeting, which included a plan for 569 referring pharmacies to the investigative unit that appeared to not be complaint. Ms. Carrillo 570 explained that until we understand which providers are dispensing and until reporters can benefit 571 from a delayed reporting notification module, tracking compliance aggress ively may need to be put 572 on hold. Ms. Carrillo added that there still isn't an easy way to tell whether a delinquent reporter 573 has since submitted or corrected their data. Ms. Sherrell reiterated the tedious process in 574 synthesiz ing the volume of data into o ne spreadsheet . Dr. Schaber inquired what other boards' 575 matrices look like, to which Ms. Carrillo stated we generally haven't delved into reporting 576 compliance tracking because there are many unknowns with regards to who is direct dispensing . 577 15 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting The board discussed its reporting disciplinary matrix and agree d there is further discussion needed 578 to implement a compliance tracking plan and matrix. 579 580 Agenda Item # 11 Budget Report 2:08 p.m. 581 582 Melissa Dumas provide d the board's budget report. The total expenditures for the 4th quarter is 583 slightly over $601,000, which was used for the board's fee analysis. Ms. Dumas explained the 584 division's proposed fee adjustments, which includes decreases between 17% and 30%. Ms. Du mas 585 explained that statute (AS 08.01.065) requires the division to annually review fees and determine 586 whether expenditures and revenues are approximately equal . The division strives to maintain 587 approximately one years' worth of revenue in reserves; however , fee setting is ultimately up to the 588 director. 589 590 Ms. Dumas stated the board has an estimated biennium surplus of over $1 million. Dr. Schabe r 591 inquired what happens to the board's budget when there is a surplus and over what period of time. 592 Ms. Dumas stat ed the division as a whole essentially has one pot of money; when another 593 program is in a deficit, the program is using the surplus of other programs. In reality, the board of 594 pharmacy has its own budget, which currently has an ending cumulative surplus of $614,000, 595 which is being carried as a surplus every year. 596 597 Dr. Ruffridge inquired whether the initial license fee could be adjusted . Ms. Dumas affirmed and 598 posed options: does the board want current or existing licensees to bear the cost of running the 599 program, or does the board want new and existing licensees to share the cost equally? Dr. 600 Ruffridge stated the costs may hinder new licensees. Ms. Dumas suggested that if the board's goal 601 is to encourage new technician applicants, both the initial and renew al fees could be adjusted. Ms. 602 Dumas added that the fees take into account the number of licensees in that category. Dr. Schaber 603 stated that cost may be a barrier to licensure, specifically for technicians. 604 605 Agenda Item # 11 Industry/Profession Updates 2:32 p.m. 606 607 Molly Gray provided an update on events, including its Alaska Pharmacy Leadership 608 Development program on September 24th, the Academy of Health -System Pharmacy Fall CE 609 Conference on Saturday, September 25 , which is b eing offered for 7.25 credits . The association is 610 also partnering with the University of Alaska/Idaho State University (UAA/ISU) Doctor of 611 Pharmacy Program. This partnership includes a change in the association's Executive Director 612 position for AKPhA, whic h will now be a shared position with the UAA/ISU Doctor of 613 Pharmacy Program. Ms. Gray also announced that she will be leaving the association with her last 614 day being the 25th. 615 616 Caren Robinson provided a legislative update on telehealth, adding that some influences may 617 weigh down and cloud the initial intent of this bill. Ms. Gray also added that the association will 618 continue to progress efforts on white bagging and expanding pharmacists' autho rity for the next 619 session. 620 16 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting 621 Agenda Item # 10 Subcommittee Updates 2:42 p.m. 622 623 PDMP board chairs 624 Chair Ruffridge stated these meetings are continuing to occur twice per month for inter -board 625 communication on issues related to the database and compliance with it. Dr. Ruffridge added 626 there's been discussions on how to identify the \"bad actors\" through use of a new provider outlier 627 module. 628 629 Healthcare board chairs 630 Dr. Ruffridge stated COV ID-19 continues to be the main topic of discussion at this meeting. The 631 overall take -home is to acknowledge the work healthcare workers are doing to respond to the 632 ongoing pandemic, particularly in hospital settings. 633 634 CSAC 635 There was no update. 636 637 Compounding Subcommittee 638 There was no update. 639 640 Agenda Item # 13 Administrative Business 2:46 p.m. 641 642 A bit ahead of schedule, Dr. Ruffridge called for license statistics. 643 644 License statistics 645 Ms. Carrillo stated there are still emergency permit applications coming in for pharmacists, interns, 646 and technicians. At present, there are 23 active pharmacist permits, 5 technician permits, and 1 647 intern. Ms. Carrillo also added that courtesy licenses ar e no longer being issued because applicants 648 can now apply for a permanent license, given the PREP Act allows these individuals to administer 649 COVID -19 vaccines. 650 651 Form updates - inspection discrepancy 652 The first form update included a draft pharmacy/facility inspection discrepancy form. Ms. Carrillo 653 recalled from the board's May meeting discussions regarding a revised inspection process, which 654 would include the board's assigned investigator. The board previously discussed options on how 655 to handle pharmacy fin dings and deliberated potential acknowledgment requirements for 656 pharmacies should findings occur. 657 658 One option was to require pharmacies to sign an inspection discrepancy form acknowledging the 659 issues will be corrected and another option was to submit an a cknowledgement form including 660 documents demonstrating the issues indeed were corrected. Another option discussed was a 661 combination of both; to submit an acknowledgement form attesting that the issues will be 662 17 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting corrected within a certain timeframe, and then a subsequent submission showing proof the 663 corrections were made. The draft included in the packet was the first option. 664 665 Dr. Ruffridge commented that this could be a mechanism to track patterns of inspection issues 666 and to address them accordingly. Ms. Carrillo suggested the board could include in its disciplinary 667 matrix a threshold to address appropriate action, e.g.: x occu rrences within y timeframe will be 668 treated with z action. Ms. Carrillo stated the board would need to finalize language to further 669 inform the process and to align the inspection form with. 670 671 Form updates - pharmacist reinstatement 672 Ms. Carrillo shared that t his form was updated to reflect the qualifying years for which a 673 pharmacist can apply for reinstatement, which is when a license has lapsed for more than two but 674 less than five years. 675 676 Form updates - PIC/facility manager 677 The incoming and outgoing forms wer e updated to include pharmacist -in-charge language as the 678 previous version was confusing in its use of language for facility managers only. 679 680 Task list 681 The board reviewed the task list. There were 34 tasks from the May meeting and two carry -over 682 tasks from February. The majority of tasks were complete and remaining tasks will be ongoing. 683 684 Ms. Bell addressed task #6, providing the update that she met with Investigator Bowles twice and 685 on one of those occasions, with the new PDMP investigator, Brenda Smith. Ms. Bell stated she 686 would be updating the inspection checklist . Ms. Bell then provided an update on task #33, stating 687 it was in relation to a pharm acist who wanted to work with AIDS patients with autonomy and that 688 it required a collaborative practice agreement. The board then discussed new tasks. 689 690 TASK 8 691 Dr. Schaber and Ms. Carrillo will meet to work on a draft disciplinary matrix in preparation for 692 board discussion during its November 18 -19, 2021 meeting. 693 694 TASK 9 695 Dr. Ruffridge will take over the expiration date project in 12 AAC 52.480. 696 697 TASK 10 698 Ms. Carrillo will send a poll via email to confirm availability for the November 18 -19, 2021 699 meeting. 700 701 Travel/conferences/workshops 702 There were no upcoming board member travel requests for out -of-state training or conferences; 703 however, Ms. Carrillo stated there were some PDMP related travel Ms. Sherrell would be 704 participating in, including the NASCSA conference in October. 705 18 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting 706 Agenda Item # 8 Board Business 3:26 p.m. 707 708 Ahead of schedule, the board returned to discussion on the PDMP disciplinary matrix. Mr. 709 Henderson inquired how the board would quantify dollar amounts for fines related to a variety of 710 actions the board could choose to take. Dr. Ruffridge suggested there may need to be some 711 prioritizing of what types of licensees and violations to refer . 712 713 Dr. Ruffridge and Mr. Henderson discussed limitations with data visibility and lingering 714 frustrations with dialing into certain datapoints that conceptually would seem simple but in reality, 715 is difficult and time -consuming. Dr. Ruffridge emphasized that the difficulty of data mining may 716 hinder the board's ability to articulate to the legislature the changes that may need to occur to 717 make the system more effective. Dr. Ruffridge acknowledge the database contains an inordinate 718 amount of data that may be dir ectly contributing to analytics delays. 719 720 Ms. Sherrell agreed there were some functionalities needing to be assessed but did share there 721 were some improvements underway to make analysis easier. Ms. Sherrell added that as of Tuesday, 722 September 21st, there appeared to be less than 100 delinquent pharmacies. Ms. Carrillo clarified 723 this was out of 800 potential delinquent submitters, with pharmacies constituting a small 724 percentage, but that the total # of delinquent submitters may be skewed by providers who are not 725 required to submit. 726 727 Dr. Ruffridge revisited establishing a tiered system where there are levels of action taken and fines 728 imposed commensurate with the severity or frequency of the delinquency, e.g.: $200 for the first 729 violation and $500 for t he second. Ms. Carrillo commented that compliance monitoring may need 730 to be simplified to assess the presence or absence of a violation rather than assessing based on 731 level of egregiousness. The other consideration was reviewing compliance every day since the 732 system isn't currently capable of searching within a tailored timeframe. 733 734 Dr. Ruffridge entertained random audits of PDMP compliance. Mr. Henderson agreed it would be 735 a way to make the large volume of data more manageable and Dr. Schaber also expresse d support 736 for this approach . Ms. Carrillo said it could work in the same way continuing education audits 737 work: 5% of randomly selected licensees would be audited for compliance through reports 738 generated within the licensing system , and if the licensee fail s the audit, a consent agreement and 739 fine could be pursued . Mr. Henderson suggested that if a licensee fails an audit, they automatically 740 audited be audited in the next renewal , to which Dr. Ruffridge agreed. 741 742 Ms. Carrillo's initial idea is that licensees appearing on the audit would be searched in the PDMP 743 based on the DEA number, which would generate reports on daily compliance. The system 744 currently allows a three -year lookback period by quarter. Ms. Carrillo estimates that 5% of 745 licensees would be 24 pharmacies, but the board could determine how often to run these audits. 746 Notices to licensees advising them the new process would be taking place was recommended and 747 it was noted the delinquent reporting module wo uld help prime reporters to report daily. 748 19 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting 749 Agenda Item # 14 Public Comment #2 3:45 p.m. 750 751 There were no public comments. 752 753 Agenda Item # 8 Board Business 4:02 p.m. 754 755 The board returned to discussing the PDMP disciplinary matrix. Ms. Carrillo stated she would 756 need to double check on whether a regulation change in 12 AAC 52 is permitted since the existing 757 CE audit language is in centralized regulations, 12 AAC 02. 758 759 TASK 11 760 Ms. Carrillo will inquire with the regulation specialist or Department of Law as to whether the 761 board can adopt PDMP audit regulations under 12 AAC 52 instead of 12 AAC 02. 762 763 Agenda Item # 15 Recess 4:06 p.m. 764 765 Chair Ruffridge recessed the meeting at 4:06 p.m. and will resume the meeting at 9:00 a.m. on 766 Friday, September 24th. 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 20 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting State of Alaska 792 Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development 793 Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing 794 795 Alaska Board of Pharmacy 796 797 MINUTES OF THE EMERGENCY MEETING 798 799 September 23 -24, 2021 Videoconference 800 801 By authority of AS 08.01.070(2), and in compliance with the provisions of AS 44.62, 802 Article 6, a scheduled meeting of the Board of Pharmacy via videoconference on 803 August 12, 2021 . Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, in -person attendance was not 804 available. 805 806 Agenda Item 1 Call to Order/Roll Call Time: 9:46 a.m. 807 808 The day 2, September 24, 2021 videoconference was called t o order by Chair, Dr. Ruffridge at 809 9:46 a.m. 810 811 Board members present, constituting a quorum: 812 813 Justin RPh #PHAP1683 817 818 Division staff present: 819 820 Laura Carril lo, Executive Administrator (joined at 10:40 a.m.) 821 Heather Noe, Occupational Licensing Examiner 822 Lisa Sherrell, PDMP Manager 823 Sara Chambers, CBPL 824 825 Members from the public present/registered: 826 827 Pamela Samash, The people 828 Olga Brophy, Carrs 829 Michael Coons, Matsu Chapter, AMAC Action 830 Jessica Adams, TelePharm a Cardinal Health Company 831 Kendra Croker, Cardinal health 832 Caren Robinson, AkPha 833 21 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting Christopher Kurka, Office of Rep. Kurka 834 Samantha Chessie, Animal Policy Group 835 Hannah Muasher, University of A rizona College of Pharmacy 836 Kevin McCabe, Alaska House of Representatives 837 Reggie Dilliard, Gladstone 838 Gordon DeVries, Concerned Citizen 839 840 Agenda Item 2 Review/Approve Agenda Time: 9: 52 a.m. 841 842 The board reviewed the day 2 meeting agenda. Dr. Ruffridge called for a motion. 843 844 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell to approve the meeting agenda, seconded by Ashley 845 Schaber, and approved unanimously, it was: 846 847 RESOLVED to accept the September 2 4th meeting agenda as written. 848 849 APPR OVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 850 Justin Ruffridge x 851 Lana Bell x 852 Tammy Lindemuth x 853 James Henderson x 854 Ashley Schaber x 855 Leif Holm x 856 Sharon Long x 857 The motion passed with no further discussion. 858 859 Agenda Item 3 Ethics Disclosures Time: 9: 55 a.m. 860 861 As with day 1, Dr. Schaber disclosed that she is a member of AKPhA and the Past -President (incl. 862 Board Member; By -Laws & Nominations Committee Chair) (through 2/22); Co -treasurer 863 (through 2/22); and a member of the Legislative & Convention Committees. 864 865 Agenda Item 4 Public Comment #3 Time: 10:02 a.m. 866 867 Representative McCabe: 868 Several pharmacist claim they are being threatened by this board or possibly by federal agencies 869 because ivermectin is claimed to be contraindicated for COVID -19, even though the NIH states it 870 is a better therapeutic option than re mdesivir. I think the board of pharmacy can at least get out of 871 the doctors' way. I did read the board's draft statement, though I would suggest there be a link to 872 the NIH website. I know pharmacists are last line of defense for mistakes with codeine and heroin 873 and tho se sorts of drugs, but since the FDA has approved it for other diseases, pharmacists should 874 22 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting be part of the solution by letting prescribers do their jobs. It is effective in India and Scotland, so I 875 would appreciate this to be considered in the board's draf t. 876 877 Pamela Samash: 878 I was hoping to hear the conversation regarding your response to Representative McCabe. I want 879 to encourage you to really consider allowing ivermectin and malaria drugs to be available to the 880 public because it would take pressure off of the hospitals. I keep hearing that hospitals are 881 overwhelmed, and how some states are importing foreign healthcare workers. I think we should 882 try instead to keep people as healthy at home as possible. What we are doing at home is putting 883 together a COVID test kit. The kit was suggested by Trump's doctor who is going for a Nobel 884 Prize - he has a list of things that can be taken for preventative measures. The board should 885 consider issuing COVID kits. 886 887 Michael Coon s: 888 I am a retired United States Air Force serviceman and was in Honduras were it was a highly 889 malaria -infested country. I ended up taking hydroxychloroquine and took it for the 90 -day 890 duration I was there as well as upon my return to the states. I had zero pr oblems with taking this 891 drug off label. There isn't just anecdotal evidence that it works, like with President Trump, that is 892 an actual person who has benefited from this drug. I'm also a commissioner on the commission 893 on aging, so I'm concerned about seni ors. I'm also the president of the Matsu chapter of the 894 Association of Mature American Citizens (MAC). As seniors, we need to have the ability to get 895 treatment we need. My doctor has no problem giving my hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin, but 896 Fred Meyer, Ca rrs, and Walgreens are flat out refusing out of worry their license will be revoked 897 by the CDC. The CDC does not have anything to do with licensure, but the board has everything 898 to do with it. The bottom line is that when a patient and doctor has decided o n a treatment, it is 899 the pharmacy's job that the medication won't cause any adverse action or will contact the 900 prescriber if there are concerns. Ultimately the pharmacy must dispense the drug. 901 902 Agenda Item 5 Legal Opinion Updates Time: 9: 50 a.m. 903 904 The board then moved to reviewing legal opinion updates. 905 906 Drug takeback programs (guidance complete) : 907 The guidance provided back on this request on June 3, 2021 is that the board can implement 908 regulations for drug takeback programs and can require that pha rmacies notify the board when 909 they have become a receptacle site. Dr. Ruffridge stated the board could continue to look into 910 whether they would like to adopt regulations to implement this. 911 912 TASK 1 2 913 Ms. Carrillo will add drug takeback programs to the board's agenda for N ovember to determine 914 whether the board intends to pursue this in regulation. 915 916 Delegate reporting (guidance pending) : 917 23 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting The request to DOL for clarification was to understand whether pharmacies and individual 918 prescribers can delegate repor ting to third -party fulfillment companies. Ms. Sherrell explained that 919 currently, we verify that the primary contact for the data submitter is the PIC because statute 920 requires that they report on behalf of the pharmacy. I n reality, many pharmacies are set up to 921 report automatically for pharmacies and provider clinics/institutions. The ways this typically 922 happens is the pharmacy's corporate IT gives permission to the vendor to take their dispensation 923 data and transmit it to ClearingHouse (the PDMP data repor ting repository), so that it can be 924 uploaded as a secure file transfer protocol (STFP) on a daily basis. 925 926 Ms. Sherrell further explained that it doesn't make sense to only accept data submissions when the 927 primary contact is a PIC because if the contact is a regulatory, IT, or third -party individual, which 928 often is the case, denying their data submission based on the wording of the statute would 929 effectively prevent required patient data from being included in the PDMP. Ms. Sherrell stated we 930 are still waiting for a response from DOL. 931 932 TASK 1 3 933 Ms. Carrillo or Lisa Sherrell will follow -up with DOL as to whether third -party vendors can report 934 on behalf of pharmacies and prescribers given delegates must be licensed under AS 08, and third - 935 party vendors are not. 936 937 PDMP reviewing and authorized refills (complete) : 938 When looking at reviewing requirements in AS 17.30.200(k)(4)(B), DOL clarified that prescribers 939 are exempt from reviewing controlled substance prescriptions written for 3+ days only if they do 940 not contain any authorized refills. 941 942 DOL also clarified that emergency providers are not blanket exempt from the review requirement , 943 which has been a misunderstanding . If an emergency provider issues a schedule II or III 944 controlled substance, it is not in a scenario included in AS 17.30.200(k)(4)(A ) and written for more 945 than a 3 -day supply, that provider must review the patient's prescription history. 946 947 The board reviewed DOL's explanation that there is no preemption of federal rule, 75 CFR Sec. 948 1306.22, on the board's ability to refill schedule III controlled substances after more than 6 949 months of the original date of issue that doesn't exceed 5 refills . The response further stated 950 federal law sets the floor but gives states the ability to be more stringent, but that the board had 951 opted to restrict pharmacists and interns from exercising discretion to dispense any quantity of a 952 schedule II -IV controlled s ubstance. Dr. Ruffridge's understanding was there was discretion in 953 regulation, to which Mr. Henderson agreed but noted the response from DOL seems to indicate 954 there is no discretion; prescriptions must be filled in the quantity indicated on the order. Dr. 955 Schaber pointed to 12 AAC 52.465, which does allow the pharmacist to dispense a lesser quantity 956 of a schedule II. 957 958 24 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting In further read of regulation 12 AAC 52.470, Dr. Ruffridge noted it states refills can be dispensed 959 in any quantity but only for non -contro lled substances. Chair Ruffridge inquired to the board as to 960 whether they wish to pursue potential changes to this section. 961 962 TASK 1 4 963 Ms. Carrillo will add refills of controlled substances to the board's agenda for November to 964 determine whether the board intends to pursue this in regulation. 965 966 Medical examiner + investigator access (complete) : 967 Guidance previously provided to the board in 2018 stated that medical examiner delegates could 968 access the database on behalf of the medical examiner/coroner's o ffice. The follow -up question to 969 the initial assessment was whether a subpoena was required either by the ME/ C or the delegate, 970 e.g.: medicolegal investigator. Ms. Sherrell stated these staff are not licensed under AS 08 but are 971 state employees. DOL's resp onse was that only the ME/ C could access the data to determine 972 cause of death without a subpoena, but that delegates cannot access the data either with a 973 subpoena or without, since their duty is not to determine cause of death, which is the 974 responsibility of the ME/ C. 975 976 DOL suggested the board amend their regulations to clarify only medical examiners can have 977 access to the system upon a written request for access. 978 979 TASK 1 5 980 Ms. Carrillo will add ME/C and delegation to unlicensed support staff to the board's agenda for 981 November to determine whether the board intends to pursue this in regulation. 982 983 Agenda Item 6 Regulations Time: 10:24 a.m. 984 985 Laura Carrillo joined the meeting at 10:45 a.m. 986 987 The board then moved to discussion regulations, including reviewing public comments. 988 989 Regulations overview 990 The board reviewed the steps in the regulation process, including steps in the regulations process 991 and the effective regulations approach. 992 993 PDMP regulations : 12 AAC 52.855 994 These regulations went into effect on May 6, 2021 and included language pertaining the required 995 timeframe to register with the system and clarified the mechanism for which to be assigned a 996 unique PDMP account. Dr. Ruffridge read each comment, which were included in the board 997 packet, out loud for the record. 998 999 PDMP regulations : 12 AAC 52.855, 12 AAC 52.856, and 12 AAC 52.857 1000 25 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting These regulations went out for public comment through September 16, 2021 and includes 1001 additional changes to registration, creates a section on renewal requirements, and adds language 1002 requiring pharmacies and pharmacists to notify the board when there is a change in dispensing 1003 status. These regulations were ready for adoption . 1004 1005 TASK 16 1006 Ms. Carrillo will include the affidavit of board action and certification order for the board to 1007 entertain a motion adopting changes to 12 AAC 52.855, 12 AAC 52.856, and 12 AAC 52.857 1008 during the November 18 -19, 2021 meeting. 1009 1010 PDMP regulations : uniform agreement 1011 Dr. Ruffridge informed the board this topic relates to an ongoing discussion with PDMP -affected 1012 boards. Dr. Ruffridge explained that the intent is for the boards to identify and come to a 1013 consensus on specific matters for which to p rioritize and pursue investigations on, such as 1014 egregious prescribing/dispensing matters , high MMEs, dangerous combination therapies, over - 1015 prescribing , etc. Dr. Schaber expressed her support, stating that a unified approach with 1016 prescribing boards is a useful and ideal approach b oth for the public and profession. If regulations 1017 need to be amended to align with the agreement, the board will pursue that. 1018 1019 Dr. Ruffridge commented the Board of Pharmacy doesn't have the ability to enforce or discipline 1020 prescribers, but that because the PDMP is statutorily housed under the board, it is appropriate and 1021 obligated to pursue a uniform agreement with regards to best practices. Dr. Ruffridge asked 1022 whether other members had specific ideas on what else could be included in the agreement. Mr. 1023 Henderson expressed support for the criteria Dr. Ruffridge mentioned, adding that too many 1024 thresholds may complicate standardization. 1025 1026 Ms. Sherrell provided an example of variation amongst boards where standardization would be 1027 useful ; the State Medical Board has set a 50 MME limit whereas the Board of Dental Examiners 1028 has set a 60 MME. Ms. Sherrell also discussed the 5 -5-3 rule (5 or more prescriptions from 5 or 1029 more prescribers/pharmacies within a 3 -month period), and informed the board that when 1030 recently te sting the provider outlier module, it was found patients going to 2 or more pharmacies 1031 was where the highest risks was occurring. 1032 1033 Dr. Schaber commented on the uniform agreement and the 5 -5-3 rule, which Ms. Sherrell 1034 previously explained has been the boar d's criteria in the past, but that other states have different 1035 threshold levels. Dr. Schaber stated it may make sense to lower this criteria because of the 1036 geographical distribution of pharmacies across the state . Ms. Carrillo stated the 5 -5-3 rule was 1037 voted on during the board of pharmacy during a meeting in 2014 because at the time, that was a 1038 common threshold amongst other states, but suggested since it was voted previously, that a 1039 change to this should be on the record for consistency. Mr. Henderson inq uired how many alerts 1040 were triggered for meeting this threshold, to which Ms. Sherrell stated there were 61. Dr. 1041 Ruffridge inquired how this alert is documented , which Ms. Sherrell explained appears in the 1042 patient's record as an alert. 1043 26 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting TASK 17 1044 Ms. Sherrell will poll other states, specifically those with geographic/accessibility similarities, on 1045 what criteria they use for the doctor shopper alert and provide the board the information by their 1046 November meeting. 1047 1048 National certification notification 1049 Ms. Bell explained that pharmacies, specifically the PIC, should verify that a technician is 1050 nationally certified. Ms. Carrillo recalled the board came to a consensus to repeal and readopt 12 1051 AAC 52.990, which would effectively require licensees to provid e copies of any credentials they 1052 hold, including licenses, registrations and certifications. Ms. Bell inquired if the license certificate 1053 indicates 1054 1055 Ms. Bell added she's been discussing with the state that there are two categories of technicians: 1056 those who are nationally certified and those who are not. Dr. Ruffridge stated the board's 1057 regulations covers the responsibility of the PIC to ensure nationally certified techs are delegated 1058 duties only for which they are trained for. Dr. Ruffridge added that one PIC on duty may feel that 1059 pharmacy technician is qualified whereas another PIC on duty may not be comfortable with that 1060 technician performing th e same duties. 1061 1062 Ms. Carrillo stated there was guidance provided by LAW that a separate license category for 1063 nationally certified pharmacy technicians requires a statute change. Dr. Schaber supports 1064 designating two separate categories because technicians are leaving their employers due to lower 1065 pay rates. Dr. Schaber provided exampl es with laboratory technicians and x -ray technicians who 1066 are nationally certified and therefore are entitled to higher pay, adding that creating a separate 1067 category may help with retention. D r. Ruffridge also supports adding this to their statute project. 1068 1069 Regulations for recommended approval 1070 Dr. Ruffridge went over the recommended approval document located in the packet, which 1071 include d a summary of proposed changes the board has previously expressed support on but have 1072 not yet moved forward through the adoption process . 1073 1074 12 AAC 52.020 (facility license) - no other proposed changes 1075 12 AAC 52.030 (change of facility location or name) - no other proposed changes 1076 12 AAC 52.040 (change of facility ownership) - no other proposed changes 1077 12 AAC 52.070 (pharmacist license by exam) - no other proposed changes 1078 12 AAC 52.092 (pharmacist approval to sit for exam) - no other proposed changes 1079 12 AAC 52.095 (pharmacist license by reciprocity) - Ms. Bell commented there should still 1080 be a verification of the status of all licenses in which the applicant holds or has ever held a 1081 license . Ms. Bell's concern is that the license from which the applicant is seeking reciprocity 1082 from may be in good standing, but that other states in which the applicant holds a license 1083 may not be. Dr. Schaber expressed similar concerns. Dr. Ruffridge referred to AS 1084 08.80.145 which requires the applicant to provide proof the applicant has not been 1085 27 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting disciplined. It is not the intent to disqualify an applicant from being licensed if they have 1086 been disciplined, but Ms. Carrillo stated this is covered in question #1 of the professional 1087 fitness se ction . The board may choose to license with conditions. Ultimately, there were no 1088 other proposed changes. 1089 12 AAC 52.080 (internship requirements) - no other proposed changes 1090 12 AAC 52.120 (pharmacist intern license) - no other proposed changes 1091 12 AAC 52.13 0 (out-of-state pharmacies) - no other proposed changes 1092 12 AAC 52.140 (pharmacy technician license) - no other proposed changes 1093 12 AAC 52.200 (pharmacist -in-charge) - Dr. Ruffridge inquired whether there should be a 1094 limit as to the number of pharmacies a PIC can be in charge of. Mr. Henderson recalled 1095 previous discussions on the hour requirement in which a PIC must be present and Ms. 1096 Carrillo stated this question has come up before as there seemed to be a need to clarify t his 1097 in regulation . Dr. Schaber agreed it would be reasonable to set a limit. Ms. Bell suggested 1098 such restrictions should just apply to central and remote pharmacies. Ms. Carrillo also 1099 shared pharmacists have also inquired whether there is a minimum amount of time for how 1100 long they must be physically present at a pharmacy for, to Dr. Ruffridge stated confirmed 1101 there is no requirement in regulation. 1102 12 AAC 52.230 (pharmacy technician functions) - no other proposed changes 1103 12 AAC 52.300 (license renewal) - no other proposed changes 1104 12 AAC 52.585 (mandatory patient counseling) - no other proposed changes 1105 12 AAC 52.610 (wholesale drug distributor license) - no other proposed changes 1106 12 AAC 52.696 (outsourcing facility license) - no other proposed changes 1107 12 AAC 5 2.697 (third -party logistics provider license) - no other proposed changes 1108 12 AAC 52.993 (executive administrator) - no other proposed changes 1109 1110 TASK 18 1111 Ms. Carrillo will send a copy of the motion and draft wording for the board's large regulation 1112 project f or review by Department of Law and for public comment. 1113 1114 Emergency permit - 12 AAC 52.110 1115 Ms. Carrillo addressed the board's emergency permit and courtesy license regulations in 12 AAC 1116 52.110, inquiring whether in (a), a pharmacy can even operate if there is no pharmacist available, 1117 explaining that as written, technicians and interns can only a pply for a permit if there is no 1118 pharmacist on staff. Dr. Ruffridge agreed this needed correction, stating it should say that the 1119 absence of pharmacy personnel and not a pharmacist constitutes a need for a permit. The board 1120 further discussed changes to thi s section, including repealing (d) relating to courtesy licenses since 1121 adjustments to the emergency permit to quickly staff the pharmacy would make the courtesy 1122 license moot. 1123 1124 The regulation also states a permit can be applied for under other emergency circumstances . Ms. 1125 Carrillo asked the board to clarify what other circumstances constitutes an emergency. Dr. 1126 Ruffridge suggested it may be an emergency declaration, such as our current pandemic, but 1127 28 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting recalled the intent of the permit is to quickl y staff a pharmacy with personnel e.g.: in the event 1128 staff must quarantine. 1129 1130 Ms. Carrillo added that there seems to be an opportunity for applicants to attest to being qualified 1131 by having an existing license in another state; however, there is no requirem ent to provide 1132 documentation. Dr. Ruffridge expressed there should be no self -attestation and instead require 1133 verification of licensure. The board continued to discuss emergency permit language changes, 1134 including changing the duration of the language from 90 days to 120 days. Ms. Carrillo stated she 1135 would draft language during lunch for the board to consider. 1136 1137 TASK 19 1138 Ms. Carrillo will draft language to amend the emergency permit regulation, 12 AAC 52.110 to 1139 replace \"pharmacist\" in (a) with Chair Ruffridge called for lunch at 12:31 p.m. 1144 Off record for lunch at 1:03 p.m. 1145 1146 Agenda Item 6 Regulations Time: 1:03 p.m. 1147 1148 Prior to lunch, the board concluded review of proposed changes to their large regulations project. 1149 Upon return from lunch and with no further comments on this project, the board was ready to 1150 entertain a motion. 1151 1152 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell, seconded by Ashley Schaber, and approved 1153 unanimously t o accept changes to 12 AAC 52.020, 12 AAC 52.030, 12 AAC 52.040, 12 AAC 1154 52.070, 12 AAC 52.092, 12 AAC 52.095, 12 AAC 52.080, 12 AAC 52.120, 12 AAC 52.130, 12 1155 AAC 52.140, 12 AAC 52.200, 12 AAC 52.230, 12 AAC 52.300, 12 AAC 52.585, 12 AAC 52.610, 1156 12 AAC 52.6 96, 12 AAC 52.697, 12 AAC 52.993 as discussed on record, and for the 1157 amendments to be forwarded to the Department of Law for cursory review before 1158 releasing changes to the public for written comment for board consideration during its 1159 November 18 -19, 2021, it was: 1160 1161 RESOLVED to accept the changes to 12 AAC 52.020, 12 AAC 52.030, 12 AAC 52.040, 1162 12 AAC 52.070, 12 AAC 52.092, 12 AAC 52.095, 12 AAC 52.080, 12 AAC 52.120, 12 AAC 1163 52.130, 12 AAC 52.140, 12 AAC 52.200, 12 AAC 52.230, 12 AAC 52.300, 12 AAC 52.585, 12 1164 AAC 52.610, 12 AAC 52.696, 12 AAC 52.697, 12 AAC 52.993 for review by LAW and to 1165 release amendments for written public comment. 1166 1167 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 1168 Justin Ruffridge x 1169 Lana Bell x 1170 29 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting Tammy Lindemuth x 1171 James Henderson Schaber x 1174 Sharon x 1175 1176 The motion passed without further discussion; however, it was noted remaining proposed changes 1177 in the large regulation packet were not ready to move forward. This includes langua ge related to 1178 veterinary prescriptions, automated kiosks, security, and substitution. 1179 1180 TASK 20 1181 Ms. Carrillo will add prescription drug order information, veterinary prescriptions, automated 1182 kiosks, security, and substitution to the board's agenda for regulations discussion at the November 1183 meeting. 1184 1185 Collaborative practice agreements 1186 Dr. Ruffridge inquired about an update on proposed changes to collaborative (cooperative) 1187 practice agreements, which includes the medical board's pro posal to repeal language in their 1188 regulation, 12 AAC 40.983. Ms. Carrillo stated that as currently written, the regulation requires 1189 these agreements to be approved by the full Board of Pharmacy as well as the State M edical 1190 Board; however, the board of pharmacy's intent has been to administratively approve these. Dr. 1191 Ruffridge clarified for the board that the proposed changes went out for public comment and 1192 ended on the end of July 29. Ms. Carrillo stated she would follow -up on the status of this change. 1193 1194 Ms. Carrillo then addressed proposed corresponding amendments to the board's regulations, 12 1195 AAC 52.240, which reflects significant deletions. Ms. Carrillo clarified the language markups are 1196 duplicative of what currently exists in the medical board's reg ulations and would be appropriate 1197 changes to make should their proposed changes take effect. Dr. Ruffridge inquired whether the 1198 board could preemptively approve this language, to which Ms. Carrillo stated seems reasonable. 1199 1200 TASK 21 1201 Ms. Carrillo will follow up with the division's regulation specialist on the status of proposed 1202 changes to 12 AAC 40.983 dealing with physician -pharmacist practice agreements. 1203 1204 TASK 22 1205 Ms. Carrillo will submit to the regulation specialist the board's proposed corresponding regulation 1206 changes for collaborative practice agreements in 12 AAC 52.240 once 12 AAC 40.983 takes effect. 1207 1208 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell, seconded by Ashley Schaber, and approved 1209 unanimously to preemptively accept changes to 12 AAC 52.2 40 dealing with simplifying 1210 collaborative practice a uthority in anticipation of corresponding changes in the State 1211 Medical Board's regulations, 12 AAC 40.983. 1212 30 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting RESOLVED to accept the changes to 12 AAC 52.240 to be sent to the regulation 1213 specialist once changes to 12 AAC 40.983 are in effect. 1214 1215 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN Bell Leif Holm x 1222 Sharon Long x 1223 The motion passed w ith a question from Dr. Schaber, who inquired about the differences and 1224 similarities chart included in the board's packet. Ms. Carrillo affirmed, stated she created the chart 1225 to analyze differences and similarities between the medical and pharmacy boards' language, which 1226 was used to make proposed deletions to 12 AAC 52.240. 1227 1228 Board of nursing letter update 1229 The board then moved to discussing the board's letter to the State Board of Nursing relating to 1230 prescription order requirements in 12 AAC 44.440(c)(2), which states that a valid prescription 1231 from an APRN must include their credentials, e.g.: license #. This has raised the question as to 1232 whether pharmacists can legally dispense prescriptions absent this information. Ms. Carrillo 1233 provided an e xcerpt of the Board of Nursing's discussion from their August 4, 2021 meeting, but 1234 noted there was not yet proposed language to provide the board with. 1235 1236 TASK 23 1237 Ms. Carrillo will follow -up with the Board of Nursing on the status of addressing 12 AAC 1238 44.440 (c)(2) dealing with required credentials on drug order. 1239 1240 Military licensing 1241 Included in the board's packet was draft military language Ms. Carrillo provided for the board's 1242 initial deliberation in advance of Director Chambers joining the meeting to discuss the military 1243 license bill, SB 21 . Ms. Carrillo explained the draft regulato ry language aligned with bill language to 1244 identify and accept equivalent military training in lieu of traditional academic /onsite training. 1245 1246 The draft outlined potential application checklist requirements, military extension criteria , and 1247 alternatively ac ceptable education and experience , but also proposed repealing the temporary 1248 pharmacist license in 12 AAC 52.100 . This repeal is suggested because the new military language 1249 would replace that section. Ms. Carrillo explained that the temporary license is not effective as a 1250 means to quickly obtain licensure due to the requirement to take and pass the national exams, 1251 which is also required for permanent licensure . The temporary license is also valid for 90 days, 1252 whereas the military license bill provides a minimum of 180 days. Ms. Carrillo clarified the draft 1253 wasn't necessarily to be approved by the board but rather was to serve as a starting point. 1254 31 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting Dr. Ruffridge inquired how the military license is different from the board's existing reciprocity 1255 application. Ms. Carrillo stated the military license is to be issued on an expedited basis, but added 1256 that the division already has a process in place: when app lications for expedited military or military 1257 spouse licensure are received, they are scanned into the licensing system as an expedited military 1258 application and are therefore prioritized. Ms. Bell added there has been a push for a few years to 1259 acknowledge A laska's strong military presence by formalizing the expedited applications under the 1260 statute, AS 08.01.063. Dr. Ruffridge acknowledged this obligation to expand licensure during an 1261 all-time high of expediting applications during the current pandemic, but a lso recognized and 1262 expressed concern that the division staff was seemingly at an all -time low. Ms. Bell reiterated 1263 boards are being compelled by legislation to participate, that it is not optional. The legislation takes 1264 effect in January 2022. 1265 1266 The board w ill return to military regulation discussions following Director Chambers' 1267 presentation. 1268 1269 Agenda Item 8 Statute Projects Time: 1:36 p.m. 1270 1271 Affidavits of moral character 1272 This requirement is in AS 08.80.110 and AS 08.80.145 for licensure via examination and 1273 reciprocity, respectively. Dr. Ruffridge acknowledge this was a requirement that seems to be 1274 unnecessary as it does little to help boards assess competency. This is an area the board continues 1275 to pursue repealing through legislation. 1276 1277 White bagging 1278 Dr. Schaber provided an overview that this practice involves an insurance payer requir ing the 1279 medication to go through the specialty pharmacy or pharmacy of the insurance 1280 S choice hospital instead of the pharmacy , adding it is complicated and time -consuming for staff. 1281 Dr. Schaber stated the biggest issue is that the pharmacy that's preparing the medication and 1282 dispensing it to the patient isn't getting paid for that medication because it's going through the 1283 specialty pharmacy. T his results in a financial impact, specifically to infusion pharmacies. Dr. 1284 Schaber added that the AKPhA is working on draft language for a statute change and that the 1285 association acknowledges it will need to go through the Division of Insurance. 1286 1287 Dr. Ruf fridge expressed support for limiting or prohibiting this practice, stating it seems to also 1288 fall within the Board of Pharmacy's purview to address with regards to liability and safety. Dr. 1289 Schaber stated there is also brown bagging, which is when medicati on is shipped to the patient, 1290 and the patient then goes to the hospital or clinic to have administered there. Brown bagging is 1291 different from white bagging in that only the latter involves direct shipment to the patient. Mr. 1292 Henderson stated he does see th is occasionally in his practice. 1293 1294 TASK 24 1295 Dr. Schaber will provide model language from the AKPhA on the issue of white bagging to share 1296 with the board. 1297 32 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting TASK 25 1298 The board will continue to address white bagging at its November 18-19, 2021 meeting. 1299 1300 Internet pharmac ies 1301 Dr. Ruffridge reviewed materials in the packet related to online pharmacies and the NABP's 1302 research findings showing that 96% of Internet sites were operating in conflict with pharmacy 1303 laws and practice standards. Ms. Carrillo stated this topic was looked at a few years ago but that 1304 there has been recent concern about w here patients are receiving their prescriptions from, whether 1305 online from outside of Alaska or through out -of-state pharmacies not registered by the board. 1306 1307 Ms. Carrillo explained that the NABP's .Pharmacy Verified Websites Program is a solution 1308 allowing regulatory bodies to confirm whether an online mail order pharmacy has been vetted by 1309 and verified by the NABP as a safe and alternative source to obtain prescriptions. Dr. Ruffridge 1310 acknowledged there are a huge number of medications being shipped into Al aska from online 1311 sources and that it would helpful to know if there are any states that have had success participating 1312 with the program . 1313 1314 TASK 26 1315 Ms. Carrillo will reach out to the NABP for success stories from states that have participated in 1316 the .Pharmacy Verified Websites Program. 1317 1318 Chair Ruffridge called for break. 1319 1320 Off record at 1:57 p.m. 1321 On record at 2:04 p.m. 1322 1323 Agenda Item 9 Military Licensing Statutes Time: 2:01 p.m. 1324 1325 Military licensing 1326 Director Chambers joined the board to provide an overview of military licensing, which has been 1327 in statute as optional for boards to adopt additional regulations on. Director Chambers informed 1328 the board that after increased encouragement throughout the sta te, the legislature changed the 1329 wording from being an encouragement to a mandate. Director Chambers stated this change is a 1330 result of continuous feedback that the military is suffering because of a lack of support from 1331 communities in which they're based , that ultimately this legislation aims to help military members 1332 and military spouse s to quickly work following relocation. 1333 1334 Director Chambers stated the biggest piece of this legislation and area potentially needing the 1335 most deliberation on is evaluating fo r substantially equivalent experience. As already written, the 1336 statute will require the applicant to be licensed elsewhere without discipline from a state has 1337 substantially the same licensure requirements as Alaska. Ms. Chambers stated programs are 1338 require d to both accept military training and education towards licensure and issue licenses on an 1339 expedited basis per AS 08.01.064. 1340 33 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting Dr. Ruffridge stated that clarification is needed on how military language is different from 1341 emergency licensing language and whet her there is an opportunity to amend existing language 1342 there. Ms. Chambers agreed, stating the Medical Board is also thinking about language they already 1343 have that can be expanded to incorporate this. For next steps, Director Chambers suggested the 1344 board c ould appoint a member to take ownership of the project, stating it would be ideal for the 1345 board to make an actionable assignment for discussion at its next meeting. The other option is to 1346 delegate the task to EA, Ms. Carrillo, who can then work with her on fine tuning the language. 1347 1348 Agenda Item 6 Regulations Time: 2:24 p.m. 1349 1350 Following the presentation of military licensing with Director Chambers, the board returned to 1351 discussing amendments to the board's existing emergency regulation section, 12 AAC 52.110. Dr. 1352 Ruffridge agreed using the existing tools may be more efficient . As previously discussed, the 1353 division has existing forms, 08 -4850 and 08 -4633, to request expedited processing for military 1354 members and spouse of military members, which curre ntly must be submitted with permanent 1355 applications . Ms. Bell expressed concerns with duplicating work and creating new requirements 1356 for a process that already exists. Mr. Henderson also expressed support for using existing forms to 1357 fast-track these. 1358 1359 The board continued to discuss changes, including substantially equivalent language and the 1360 administrative process to ensure military applications can be prioritized. Dr. Schaber also 1361 expressed support for this direction. Ultimately, the board agreed using the division's existing 1362 cover forms for military spouse and active duty military personnel in addition to submitting a 1363 military courtesy license form was reasonable. 1364 1365 On a motion duly made by Ashley Schaber, seconded by Lana Bell, and approved 1366 unanimously to accept the military and emergency permit language amendments to 12 1367 AAC 52.110 as discussed on record to be sent for cursory review by Department of Law, 1368 and for written public comments to be returned for board considered during its November 1369 18-19, 2021 me eting, it was: 1370 1371 RESOLVED to accept the changes to 12 AAC 52.110 for review by LAW and released for 1372 public comment. 1373 1374 APPROVE Tammy Lindemuth x 1380 James Henderson x 1381 Sharon Long x 1382 34 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting The motion passed with no further discussion. 1383 1384 TASK 27 1385 Ms. Carrillo will send the draft language and motion excerpt regarding military courtesy and 1386 emergency courtesy changes to 12 AAC 52.110 to the regulation specialist. 1387 1388 (Words in boldface and underlined indicate language being added; words [CAPITALIZED AND 1389 BRACKETED] indicate language being deleted. 12 52.110 is amended to read: 1392 12 AAC 52.110.

Ms. Carrillo stated that she believ es it falls under title 21 but can 1460 request DOL guidance, to which the board supported. 1461 1462 TASK 28 1463 Ms. Carrillo will review AKPhA's model language on white bagging from Dr. Schaber and will 1464 submit a request for DOL guidance as to whether it falls under title 21 with the Division of 1465 Insurance or if there are any components that fall under AS 08.80. 1466 1467 Agenda Item 11 p.m. 1468 1469 Michael Coons : 1470 We Alaska have major problems: a divide that is being caused by politics and people like Dr. 1471 Fauci, the CDC, and the NIH, and mandates from the President and far -left states. The attempts 1472 to deny our civil liberties of our choice is our medical care. The m edical community cannot come 1473 together to work with each other. The Hippocratic oath is do no harm, but by not working 1474 together, this is doing harm. Having doctors search for pharmacies that will fill prescriptions 1475 creates and adds frustration. Having pharm acies declining prescriptions also adds to the amount of 1476 time it takes to get medications into the hands of patients to treat COVID -19. Getting pharmacies 1477 to work with doctors will lessen the divide. 1478 1479 Representative Kurka: 1480 There are a large number of pharmacists who are not filling prescriptions of ivermectin for 1481 treatment. Are there pharmacists not doing this? I'm hearing from doctors and the community 1482 that pharmacists are feeling threatened that if they dispense ivermectin, that their licensure is b eing 1483 threatened. Who is doing the threatening and where is that coming from? Who is liable? Rep. 1484 Kurka also inquired whether amendments to the PREP Act included changes to dispensing 1485 ivermectin and recommended the board provide more links for both sides of the argument. Rep. 1486 Kurka concluded his comment by reiterating that ivermectin is an approved medication and has 1487 won the Nobel Prize. 1488 1489 38 Alaska Board of Pharmacy September 23 -24, 2021 Meeting Dr. Ruffridge stated that b oth the prescriber and dispenser are equally liable but that a thorough 1490 response will be prov ided in writing. Dr. Ruffridge added he would look at the PREP Act and 1491 respond accordingly. 1492 1493 Gordon DeVries: 1494 I'm calling as a concerned citizen. I was able to read through some of the slides. I'm concerned 1495 around the policy that if a prescriber issues a pr escription for ivermectin, the pharmacist is not 1496 obligated to fill it. By making this policy, it is creating a gap between a patient and their provider. 1497 1498 Dr. Ruffridge stated it is a fact sheet, not a policy, but something the board will continue to 1499 discu ss and send to other licensing boards and DHSS for their thoughts on. 1500 1501 TASK 29 1502 Dr. Ruffridge will provide written responses to Representative McCarty, Representative Kurka, 1503 and Representative McCabe's comments relating to pharmacist dispensing ivermecti n. 1504 1505 TASK 30 1506 Ms. Carrillo will send Dr. Ruffridge's written comments to the representatives to the division's 1507 legislative liaison. 1508 1509 TASK 3 1 1510 Ms. Carrillo will add the board's fee analysis to the November agenda for further discussion. 1511 1512 Agenda Item 12 Adjourn Time: 4:30 p.m. 1513 1514 Dr. Ruffridge thanked the board for their participation and reminded them of the upcoming 1515 quarterly meeting scheduled for November . 1516 1517 1518 "}
