S. ABSTRACT 'Swasthasya Swasthya Rakshanam' is the very first aim of Charaka Samhita.[1] In other words Ayurveda has given much priority to live healthy and disease free life. Vaccination plays a crucial role in preventive medicine by providing protection against infectious diseases. It has been instrumental in controlling and eradicating numerous diseases that once posed significant threats to public health. However, despite the effectiveness of vaccines, the prevention of all diseases remains a challenge. Microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, continually evolve and adapt, sometimes acquiring resistance to existing vaccines or mutating into new strains. For prevention of diseases, Ayurveda had advocated the adherence to concepts like dina charya(Daily regimen), ritu charya(Seasonal regimen), sadvritta (code of good conduct for mental health and social behavior), Na vega dharana( Non-suppressible natural urges) etc. these measures are useful in preventing the lifestyle related diseases but for preventing the Aupsargika rogas (communicable diseases), Asatmyaj roga (allergic disorders), the concept of Vyadhikshamtva (Immunity) is propagated by the Ayurvedic science .[2] "}
