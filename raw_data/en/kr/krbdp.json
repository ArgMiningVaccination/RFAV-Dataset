Essential oils are distilled from the leaves, stems, flowers, bark, roots, and/or other parts of a plant. The term is a contraction of the original word 'quintessential oil,' which originated from the Aristotelian idea that matter is composed of four elements: fire, air, earth, and water. The fifth element, quintessence, is the spirit or life force. The chemical composition and aroma of essential oils are said to provide many psychological, emotional, and physical therapeutic benefits for people. These benefits can be gained by either inhaling the scent or by applying diluted versions to the skin, as directed. Essential oils are obtained from plants through distillation, usually by using steam. Manufacturers also use the expression solvent extraction, absolute oil extraction, resin tapping, and cold pressing. Despite the use of the word 'oil,' most essential oils don't have an oily feeling. They are usually clear, too, though patchouli, orange, and lemongrass essential oils can be amber or yellow. Some people may believe essential oils are the same as perfume or fragrance oils, but they are not. Essential oils are derived from actual plants and contain the true essence of the plant. Fragrance oils are different because they contain artificial ingredients and substances. They do not have the therapeutic benefits essential oils can provide. Today, essential oils can be diluted and applied to the skin and used in aromatherapy, which is the act of inhaling the aroma from plant-based essences for holistic wellness. While essential oils for autism is considered an alternative form of treatment by mainstream medicine, the practice has caught the attention of parents who have children on the spectrum because of its potential for therapeutic benefits.

The truth about autism and essential oils for children with autism and ADHD First, it's imperative to note essential oils are not a cure for autism or any other medical condition. Their use does not improve cognitive skills, communication skills, or [social skills](https://www.autismparentingmagazine.com/autism-social-skills/). Scientific research on autism and essential oils is limited and not conclusive at this time. Some essential oils can have negative side effects if used or applied incorrectly. Note that not all essential oils can be used for children. Always consult with your child's doctor about the safe use of essential oils before using them on your child, especially if he/she has a medical condition or is taking medication. The dangers of essential oils if misused It's important to point out essential oils can be toxic if misused. Never eat or drink essential oils. According to the University of Minnesota Taking Charge of Your Health and Wellbeing website, extra caution should be taken when selecting essential oils for babies and young children. Peppermint, for example, should not be used with children under six years old because menthol, a major chemical in peppermint oil, has caused serious complications including respiratory issues. Not all oils are considered safe for people with epilepsy or other coexisting conditions. Essential oils can also be damaging to the skin, liver, and other organs if misused. When first trying an essential oil, always start with a patch test and watch for an allergic reaction. And keep in mind some oils are harmful to family pets, so contact your veterinarian to confirm safety before diffusing. Safety tips for using essential oils with children Even after discussing essential oils with your child's doctor, there are basic precautions you still need to take when using essential oils. - When you use essential oils for autism spectrum disorders you must be very careful. The oils are potent. Always use as little as needed. - When using essential oils topically, dilute them with a safe carrier oil. Carrier oils can be fractionated coconut oil or grapeseed oil. It helps prevent the skin from getting burned when it comes into contact with certain types of essential oils. - Essential oils known for being 'hot' and therefore require dilution are birch, cassia, ginger, lemongrass, oregano, peppermint, thyme, and wintergreen. Before using any of these oils, it's recommended you test them first by applying them on the wrist or the bottom of the feet. Make sure to keep them away from the eyes. - You should consult a qualified aromatherapist or doctor before applying any type of essential oil on the skin, especially on children. Apart from applying essential oils topically, you can inhale it using a diffuser. Some research has shown aromatic use can be more effective and potentially safer. - When not in use, essential oils should be kept in a glass bottle with a closed lid and away from extreme temperatures, so they last longer. Ways to apply essential oils for autism The application of essential oils for autistic children will depend on each child. Although most oils can be rubbed onto the skin, such as the back of the neck, some children's skin might be sensitive or get an allergic reaction. In this case, using an essential oil diffuser might work better. It is important to note that children's skin is more sensitive than adults, so diluting the oil before applying it to the skin is a great idea. Diluting oils involves adding a carrier oil like coconut oil, grapeseed oil, or avocado oil to the essential oil. You can refer to a [dilution chart](https://mommypotamus.com/essential-oil-dilution-chart-guidelines/) to ensure you are using the right amount of oils. What should you consider when buying essential oils for your child with autism? Quality is a key consideration when determining the best essential oils for autism. If the oils are of low quality, you may not be able to get optimum results. Manufacturers may stamp the word \"pure\" on their labels, but it doesn't ensure quality. And since essential oils are not regulated, some manufacturers may say they are 'organic' when they are not. Some manufacturers use chemicals when extracting the essential oil from plants, thus making the oils neither pure nor organic. That's why you must take a closer look at how it is extracted. This will help you determine if the manufacturers' claims are true. Also, you should avoid anything that says 'fragrance' or 'perfume.' Essential oils considered 100 percent pure and therapeutic grade are those extracted from plants, flowers, trees, roots, and seeds using low, slow steam distillation (for non-citrus essential oils) or cold-pressed (for citrus oils). Depending on the product and company, pure essential oil extracts can be 50 to 200 times more concentrated than their source. Single oils can be blended to create another type of essential oil or to enhance their effects. But they should only be blended to ensure they are effective, safer, and easier to use. Purity is one of the most important characteristics of essential oils. Among the things that can affect purity are poor production processes and the development of synthetic essential oil variations. If you want to get the best results possible, opt for Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade (CPTG) essential oils. These oils, like doTerra essential oils for ADHD and Young Living Essential Oils, undergo testing to ensure purity and quality. Here are some more facts to consider when choosing essential oils: - Always look for quality, organic oils to ensure that it does not contain harmful ingredients that might have adverse effects on your child. - Even though essential oils come from plants, some of them may contain materials that are toxic or irritating. If in doubt, check the US Food & Drug Administration Poisonous Plants Database. - Always buy essential oils in dark glass bottles as these prevent light from entering which can spoil the oil. Some oils can melt in plastic bottles, so it's best to avoid these. - Buy essential oils with its common name along with its Latin name to ensure you are getting the exact type of oil. How is essential oil quality testing done? CPTG quality testing is done to ensure essential oils are made using proper methods of growing, harvesting, and distilling their plant source. It's done through a series of processes that include: - Validation of Quality Each essential oil is reviewed for chemical composition after plant selection, harvesting, and distillation. It is then tested two more times to confirm it remained free of contaminants and unexpected alterations during production. - Organoleptic Testing This testing involves the use of the human senses to determine the quality and acceptability of the product. - Microbial Testing Under microbial testing, a batch of essential oils is analyzed and tested for the presence of micro-organisms like fungi, bacteria, viruses, and mold that can be detrimental to your health. Samples are taken before and after the essential oils are packed to ensure they haven't been contaminated during the packaging process. - Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry Analysis (GC/MS) In this process, essential oils are vaporized and passed through a long column to separate them into individual components. This is to determine the exact chemical composition of a particular essential oil. - Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR is designed to ensure each batch of essential oil is potent and consistent. As part of this test, structural components of essential oil compounds are analyzed by passing them through infrared light. - Heavy-Metal Testing Heavy-metal testing determines the heavy metal content in the essential oil. Ideally, pure essential oils do not contain heavy metals when distilled. Essential oils for autism testimonials Parents have reported improved sleep and overall behavior when using essential oils for their children. In a 2015 article, [The Epoch Times](https://www.theepochtimes.com/parents-say-essential-oils-help-with-autism_1894047.html) interviewed Shannon Coconis, mother to 12-year-old Sam, who was diagnosed with autism. She read about essential oils and autism in an online forum and decided to try it on her son. Coconis said she didn't notice any difference for the first month until she ran out and noticed his son's behavior became challenging. \"All of a sudden he started going crazy. The only thing I could figure was that he didn't have his oils. We got back to the oils and his behavior improved,\" Coconis said. Some children with autism have difficulty sleeping or staying asleep. Traditional treatment might involve melatonin [supplements](https://www.autismparentingmagazine.com/best-supplements-vitamins-autism/). However, some parents use essential oils for autism sleep because it gives better results. Chamomile oil is the popular oil of choice for improving sleep, even for people who are not on the spectrum. A [2005 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0952-3383.2005.00385.x) conducted by Professor Steve Solomons from the University of Birmingham's special education center investigated if aromatherapy, which used essential oils, increased shared attention in four children with autism. The study returned positive results, with all children displaying an improvement in shared attention.

Are essential oils right for my family? Essential oils that contain chemicals or artificial ingredients may not be as potent and effective as pure and organic essential oils. They may cause more problems than they solve, so be vigilant and stay informed. The health benefits of essential oils are many. But as with anything that can affect your health and well-being, educate yourself. Research and seek expert advice to avoid allergies and other harmful side effects.
