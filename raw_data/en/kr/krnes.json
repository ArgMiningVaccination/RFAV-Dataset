Functional medicine does not diagnose disease but rather looks at systems in the body that could be improved with acupuncture, therapeutic massage, medical nutritional supplements and Chinese herbal medicine. Lee Acupuncture strives to treat the whole person using a variety of techniques. At times we find it necessary to investigate a little deeper using functional medicine. By using specialized laboratory testing to look at how the body is performing, we detect and treat imbalances before they become a diagnosable disease. Traditional labs provide basic information and we may suggest further testing using your saliva, stool, urine and/or blood from specialty labs. Our goal is to find and correct your dis-ease, before disease sets in. At Lee Acupuncture we use all information obtained through your medical doctor plus and additional information regarding your health that you can obtain directly through independent labs such as BioHealth, Genova Diagnostics and others. We have developed questionnaires to help identify possible areas that warrant additional investigation or treatment. Depending on your specific situation, we will either recommend natural treatment methods or refer you to your medical doctor. Our expertise lies in identifying areas of imbalance and recommending nutritional support, traditional Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture and lifestyle coaching to improve health. Digestive Health and Functional Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine believes all healing begins in the digestive system. The body generates energy and produces blood based on the digestion of foods and nutritional supplements. Fatigue, bloating, excessive gas, abdominal pain, intestinal cramping, constipation, diarrhea, and loose stools all indicate your digestive system is not functioning optimally. Food intolerance testing identifies the diet that fuels your body the most efficiently. Understanding which foods to focus on in your daily diet can empower you to develop a healthier lifestyle and expand your culinary skills while fueling your body to heal itself. Learning to rotate your acceptable foods is the key to long-term optimal digestive health. Pathogen testing screens for chronic low-grade pathogenic bacterial, fungal and parasitic intestinal infections often considered \"normal\" by Allopathic Doctors. Both follow-up functional medicine testing and the clients reports of feeling better when they are free of chronic infections attest to the value of this approach to better health. If aggressive infections such as Helicobacter pylori (H-Pylori) bacteria, Giardia or Clostridium difficile are identified on routine stool screenings, a referral to your allopathic Physician will be made for treatment. Balancing Hormones with Functional Medicine Balancing hormones helps people feel better emotionally, optimizes the reproductive organs and slows down the aging process. Hormone levels considered acceptable in functional medicine are within a smaller range than what is acceptable in allopathic medicine. Allopathic medicine is looking for hormone imbalances that indicate a disease or serious endocrine gland dysfunction. Functional medicine is looking for a balance between the hormones to optimize health. Information on our website is not intended to diagnose, treat, or be a substitute for regular medical care.
