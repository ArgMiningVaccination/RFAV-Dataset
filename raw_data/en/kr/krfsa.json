Mounting studies have focused on the role of inflamm-agingin disease progression and many advances have been made in the last decade. However, the underlying mechanisms by which inflamm-aging affects pathological changes and disease development are still unclear. Here, we review studies of inflamm-aging thatexploretheconcept,pathologicalfeatures,mechanisms,intervention,andthetherapeuticstrategiesofinflamm-agingindiseaseprogression. 1. Introduction Inflamm-aging [1] was first named by Franceschi et al. in 2000, and it is a new addition to the types of aging studies.Inflamm-aging plays an increasingly important role in therate of aging and age-related diseases. Research in thisarea has attracted attention of scholars in many fields andsignificant progress has been made in the last decade.Here, we review the concept of inflamm-aging and describevarious research strategies that have led to insights into itsinflammatory characteristics and mechanisms of action. Wealso discuss the relationship of inflamm-aging with diseasesand novel interventions to delay or prevent inflamm-aging-relateddiseases. 2. The Concept of Inflamm-Aging A main feature of the aging process is a chronic progressiveincreaseintheproinflammatorystatus,whichwasoriginallycalled\"inflamm-aging\"[1].Subsequentlyothersimilarterms wereusedsuchas\"inflammaging\"[2],\"inflamm-ageing\"[3], and\"inflammageing\"[4].Inflamm-agingistheexpansionofthenetworktheoryofaging[5]andtheremodelingtheoryof aging[6,7].Thenetworktheoryofagingpositsthatagingis indirectlycontrolledbythenetworkofcellularandmoleculardefense mechanisms. The remodeling theory, which was put forward to explain immunosenescence, is the gradually ada p tiv r ocesso fthebod yfigh tin gmalig-nant damage and is a dynamic process of optimization of the trade-off in immunity [6, 7]. In the process of aging, some researchers pointed out that the phenomenon where adaptive immunity declines is called immunosenescence, while the phenomenon where innate immunity is activated, coupledwiththeriseofproinflammation,iscalledinflamm- aging [8]. Some regard the chronic inflammatory process with age as inflamm-aging [9], while others proposed the oxidation-inflammationtheoryofaging[10].DespitethelackHindawi Publishing Corporation Journal of Immunology Research Volume 2016, Article ID 8426874, 12 pages http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/84268742 JournalofImmunologyResearch ofagreementondefinitionsandterminology,thereisconsen- sus that the primary feature of inflamm-aging is an increasein the body's proinflammatory status with advancing age.Furthermore,anewconceptof\"anti-inflammaging\"wasalsoproposed, which influences progressive pathophysiologicalchanges, as well as lifespan, and acts along with inflamm- aging[11].Inthenextsectionthecharacteristicsofinflamm- agingaredescribedinmoredetail. 3. The Inflammatory Characteristics of Inflamm-Aging Thefivestatesofinflamm-agingareasfollows[12]:low-grade, controlled, asymptomatic, chronic, and systemic. However,theinflammationduringinflamm-agingisnotinacontrolledinflammatory state. We propose that inflammation in theprocess of inflamm-aging belongs to nonresolving inflam-mation [13]. Inflammation is a series of complex responseeventswhicharecausedbythehostsystemfacingapathogeninfection or various types of tissue injury. These responseevents are characterized by interactions between the cellsand factors in the microenvironment and by regulation ofthebalancebetweenphysiologicalandpathologicalsignalingnetworks. In common conditions, inflammatory responsesdisappear when proinflammatory factors in infection andtissue injuries are eliminated and then change into a highly active and well regulated balanced state, which is called resolving inflammation [13]. However, in the presence ofsome as yet uncertain factors, such as persistent and lowintensity stimulation and long-term and excessive responsein target tissues, inflammation fails to move into a steadystate of anti-infection and tissue injury repair; instead theinflammationcontinuesandmovestoanonresolvinginflam-mationstate[13].Giventhisbackground,inflammationintheprocessofinflamm-agingbelongstothestateofnonresolvinginflammation. 4. The Relationship between Inflamm-Aging and Diseases Like the immune response, inflammation has a physiolog- ical function in the normal body. Moderate inflammatoryresponse is beneficial to the body but when excessive, theresponse becomes harmful. Changes in the inflammatorycytokine network control the direction of the developmentof inflammation. The dynamic balance of the network of proinflammatorycytokinesandanti-inflammatorycytokines maintains the physiologic function of inflammation in thenormalbody.Tippingthebalancefromanti-inflammationtoproinflammationcanleadtopathologicalchanges.Persistentinflammation during the inflamm-aging process may causeinflammation-relateddiseases. Inflamm-agingisadeterminantofthespeedoftheaging process and of lifespan and is highly related to Alzheimer'sdisease[2],Parkinson'sdisease,acutelateralsclerosis,multi-ple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, heart disease, age-related mac-ulardegeneration[14],typeIIdiabetes[15],osteoporosisandinsulin resistance [16], cancer, and other diseases. Inflamm-aging also increases morbidity and mortality, significantlyharming the health of patients, and causes a decline in the qualityoflifeofpatients[16].Chronic,subclinicalinflamma-tionandimmunedisorderscoexistintheprocessofinflamm-aging. Epidemiological studies show that with age there isan imbalance in the loss of old bone and the formation ofnew bone. Inflamm-aging may be one of the contributing factorstotheimbalanceandtothesubsequentexcessiveloss of bone. Inflammatory markers of inflamm-aging provideclinicians with the necessary data for risk assessment ofosteoporosis. Inflammatory cytokines may be therapeutictargets for improving the formation of bone in the elderlyafter bone operations [16]. Excessive inflammation duringinflamm-aging increases the morbidity and mortality ofpatients after bone operations, even though the mechanismforthisremainsunclear[17].Intheprocessofinflamm-aging,t h ep a t h o p h y s i o l o g i c a lc h a n g e si nt h ec o l o na r er e v e a l e da tthe cellular and molecular levels, and these culminate in theinflammation that leads to injury of the gastric mucosa andepithelium as well as a decrease in the epithelium's ability toregenerate[18](Figure1). However, inflamm-aging seems to be a autoreactivity of the body [17]. Inflamm-aging is benefi-cialtothebodybyneutralizingtheharmfulcytokinesintheearlystageofthelifebuthasadetrimentalroleinthelaterlife[17]. Unfortunately, the strong correlation between inflamm- aging and disease development is complex and unclear.Becauseimmunosenescenceandinflamm-agingcoexist,itisdifficulttodistinguishwhethertheinflammation-relateddis- eases are caused by inflamm-aging or immunosenescence. Moreover, the crucial question is whether there is a causalrelationship between inflamm-aging and diseases, whichneedsintegratedbiologicalandclinicalresearchtoresolve. 5. The Mechanisms of Inflamm-Aging While the mechanism of inflamm-aging is not completelyunderstood,thecurrenttheoriesinthefieldaresummarizedbelow. 5.1. The Theory of Stress. Generally, stress is either beneficial or harmful to the body. During inflamm-aging, the body isconstantlyinthestressenvironment,whichiscausedbydif-ferentkindsofstressorsthatinduceandmaintainthechronicproinflammatorystatusinthebody.Stress,asoneofregulated factorsofimmunity,provokesthegreatestimmuneresponse in the bodies of young persons, whereas it provokes thatweakestresponseinelderlypersonswithsignsofimmunose-nescence and inflamm-aging [19, 20]. According to a seriesof studies involving different species from invertebrates tohumans, from an evolutionary perspective, inflammation isclosely related to innate immunity and stress [20]. Basedon evolutionary studies, immune response, stress response,and inflammation form a defensive network in the body.However,thecompatibilitybetweeninflammatorystatusandlongevity and the paradoxical proinflammatory character inhealthy centenarians strongly suggest the existence of physi-ologicalinflammation[21].Therefore,inflammationandtheJournalofImmunologyResearch 3 Inflamm-agingAlzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease Heart diseases Atherosclerosis Age-related macular degeneration Multiple sclerosisIncrease of morbidity lateral sclerosisInsulin resistanceOsteoporosisType II diabetesCancer Figure1:Therelationshipbetweeninflamm-aginganddiseases. proinflammatory status in healthy persons and centenarians show a beneficial response that helps the elderly deal withthestimuligeneratedbychronicantigenstressors[19].How-ever, excessive stress response, as well as an accompanyingincreasinglyhighproinflammatoryresponse,leadstohumaninflamm-aging. 5.2. The Theory of Oxidation-Inflammation. There are close relationships between oxidative stress and inflamm-aging [21].Basedonthecloserelationshipbetweenoxidativestress,inflammation,andaging,theoxidation-inflammatorytheoryofaging(oxi-inflamm-aging)wasproposed[10].Inthisthe-ory, oxidative stress leads to inflamm-aging and influencest h eh o m e o s t a s i sa n dh e a l t ho ft h eb o d y .Th er e l a t i o n s h i pbetween the redox state and the function of immune cellsinfluences the speed of aging and lifespan [10]. Accordingto this theory, sufficient antioxidants in food may improveimmune function, decrease oxidative stress, and extend thelifespan[22]. 5.3. The Theory of Cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in inflamm-aging caused by chronicinflammation[23].TypeIcytokines(suchasIFN- andTNF- ) and type II cytokines (IL-4) in unactivated memory CD4+ T lymphocytes participate in the proinflammatoryprocess [24]. Further research shows that CD8+ and CD4+Tlymphocytesplayapivotalroleinthedevelopingcytokinenetwork, and this can lead to the chronic proinflamma-tory state and inflamm-aging [25]. In animal experiments,increased expression of IL-1,I L - 1 5 ,I L - 1 8 ,T N F -mRNA,and TNF-protein in the peripheral blood of elderly horses appearstobeadistinctivefeatureofinflamm-aging[26]. Elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF- in the serum of the elderly are associated with disease, disability, and mortality[3].Studiesemployinglargepatientcohortsprovideevidencethat the level of serum IL-6 is a reliable marker, or apredictive index, of inflamm-aging [3]. Experiments withhealthy elderly people show that aging relates to increasedproinflammatory status. The cause of the increased proin-flammatory status is elevated levels of proinflammatorycytokinesinthecirculationincludingIL-1,IL-6,TNF- ,and PGE2 [27, 28]. Although the identity of cells that secreteproinflammatory mediators in elderly persons remains con-troversial,theprevailingviewisthat,duringinflamm-aging, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the circulation create an inflammatory environment for tissues and organs [29]. However, differences in levels of IL-10 and TNF- in individuals may play an important role in the final outcomeofinflammation[29].IL-6andTNF- areupregulated,while growthhormoneandIGF-1aredownregulatedintheprocess of aging. The overall balance of cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-, appears to play a decisive role in aging. As well, genetic variations in the promoter regions of proinflamma-tory and regulated cytokine genes have effects on inflamm-agingandsusceptibilitytoage-relateddiseases[29]. Pes et al. [30] found that the frequency of the -174C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoterregion of IL-6 gene is increased in Italian male centenariansand the frequency of the -1082G SNP at the 5 flanking region of the IL-10 gene coding sequence is increased4 JournalofImmunologyResearch among male centenarians. These data indicate that differ- ent alleles in different cytokine cytokinegenepolymorphismsforimmunesystemgenesmayregulate immune-inflammatory responses. Gene polymorphisms of proinflammatory cytokines associated with high levels ofIL-6 have decreased capacity to reach extremely old age,whereas genotypes associated with high levels of IL-10w e r ei n c r e a s e di nc e n t e n a r i a n s[ 3 0 ] .G e n e t i cp o l y m o r p h i s min proinflammatory cytokine genes is necessary and hasimportant consequences in the body. On the one hand,moderate levels of proinflammatory cytokines contribute toinducing a protective response, when the body is invadedbypathogens.Ontheotherhand,excessiveproinflammatorycytokines may cause immune-inflammatory diseases andeven death. Indeed, the process of evolution has shaped theabilityofthebodytofightandcontrolpathogens.Therefore,theproinflamma toryresponsema ybebeneficialtothebodyinfightingpotentiallyfatalinfections.Thus,highlevelsofIL-6andlowlevelsofIL-10areassociatedwithenhancedabilityagainstpathogens[30]. The vicious cycle of reciprocal proinflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence aggra-vates cytokines induce Proinflammatorycytokines,suchasTNF-,IFN-,andIFN-,inducecellular senescence in epithelial senescent cells secretegrowthfactors,proteases,chemokines,andcytokinessuchasIL-6andIL-8[33]. Most phenotypes of aging can be explained by an imbalancebetweenproinflammationandanti-inflammation,which results in inflamm-aging with a low chronic proin-flammatory status. However, centenarians have high levelsof inflammatory mediators and more anti-inflammatorycytokines, suggesting that inflamm-aging can coexist withlongevity,eventhoughtheunderlyingmechanismshavenotbeenuncovered[34]. 5.4. The Theory of DNA Damage. Sustained telomere DNA and mitochondrial DNA damage, caused by exogenous andendogenousfactors,caninduceerrorsofDNAreplicationortranslation,whichleadstopointmutationsorchromosomalrearrangements and stress reactions via various signalingpathways, which eventually contributes to cellular senes-cence. Researchers found that, in human senescent primarycells,theshortesttelomereslack mostofthetelomererepeatsequence, which leads to DNA damage accumulation andterminal cell cycle arrest and further induces replicativesenescence [35]. A persistent DNA damage response (DDR)caused by telomere shortening is a key mechanism involvedin replicative senescence and aging process [36]. New evi- denceindicatesthatDNAdamageresponse(DDR)signalingis a major link between cell senescence and organism aging.DDR activation of senescent cells contributes to an increaseintheproinflammatorysecretoryphenotype(PSP),whichinturn triggers the activation of adjacent cell DDR and PSP. This local inflammatory environment eventually becomes systemic.TheincreasingnumberofcellswithDDRactivationmay exacerbate inflamm-aging [37]. These results suggestthatcellsinaninflammatoryenvironmentinduceagingatthesystemic network breaks down, inducinginflamm-aging as a result of the accumulation of DNAdamage [38]. Proinflammatory cytokines in the microenvi-ronmentofcellswithDNAdamagefurtherinduceinflamm-aging. effects ofinflamm-aging, amplify inflamm-aging self-propagation viaa cascade effect on the local and systemic proinflammatoryresponse[38]. 5.5. The Theory of Autophagy. Autophagy plays an impor- tant role in stress, removing harmful substances in cellsto maintain homeostasis and normal metabolism [39, 40].Autophagy transfers the abnormal substances of the cell tol y s o s o m e sf o rd e g r a d a t i o na n da l s op l a y sar o l ei nm a n y pathophysiological processes [41]. For example, autophagy playsimportantrolesinremovingabnormalproteins,adapt-ing to hunger, and cancer. More and more evidence showsthat autophagy is important in increasing longevity. Forexample,knockingouttheautophagygeneAtg7leadstotheaccumulation of proteins and organelles in the cell, causingcellularsenescence[42]. Theprocessofagingaccompaniesdisorderinhomeosta- sis. However, autophagy plays an important role in main-taining homeostasis and delaying aging. In the processof aging, autophagic cleansing capacity declines gradually,whichinducesmitochondriondisorderingandproteinaccu-mulation. This leads to increased reactive oxygen species(ROS) and consequently oxidative stress. Destabilized lyso-somes release Nod-like receptor 3(NLRP3),andthisinitiatesaninflammatorycascadereaction.Duringthisprocess,inactiveprecursorsofIL-1 andIL-18are increased, and IL-1and IL-18 release is stimulated, which causesaninflammatoryreactionandacceleratedaging[43]. 5.6. The Theory of Stem Cell Aging. Stem cell aging is closely r e l a t e dt oi n fl a m m a t i o n[ 4 4 ] .S t e mc e l la g i n gi st h ec e l l u l a rbasis of aging and chronic inflammation is one of themain factors that induces stem cell aging. In the chronicinflammatoryprocess,proinflammatoryfactorsactivateNF-B/MAPKs,TOR,RIG-I,andJAK/STATsignalingpathways to induce cells to synthesize and to secrete large amounts ofinflammatorycytokines,suchasTNF andIL-1[45],which leadstoachroniclowdegreeofinflammationintheenviron-ment of cells, thereby inhibiting the regenerative capacity ofstemcells.Thisleadstodysfunctionaldifferentiationofstemcells, damage of the stem cell microenvironment (i.e., thatstemcellniche),homeostasis,andstemcellaging[44].JournalofImmunologyResearch 5 6. Regulatory Signaling Pathways of Inflamm-Aging In principle, the pathways controlling inflammation are potential regulatory signaling pathways of inflamm-aging.The NF-B and TOR signaling pathways, in particular, have beeninvestigated. 6.1.NF-BSignalingPathway. NF-B,anucleartranscription factor, is regarded as the main molecular switch of inflam- matory pathways. The NF-Bs i g n a l i n gp a t h w a ym a ya l s o regulate inflamm-aging [8]. However, the longevity gene,S I R T 1 ,c a nb ec o m b i n e dw i t has u b u n i to fN F - B, Rel/p65, to deacetylate K310 and inhibit the transcriptional activityof NF-B[ 4 6 ,4 7 ] .N F -B can regulate the occurrence of aging,whereasSIRT1mayregulateNF- Btodelayaging[48]. Thus,NF-Bcanregulatebothagingandinflammation[49]. NF-Bcanalsoinhibitinflammatoryreactionsbyregulating SIRT1(Sir2homolog)andFoxODAF-16[8]. 6.2. TOR highly conserved ser- ine/threonine protein kinase, plays an important role in theregulatinggrowthandproliferationofcells[50].Accordingtoits different functions, TOR can be divided into TORC1 andTORC2.Theformerissensitivetorapamycin,participatinginthebiologicalprocessoftranscriptionandtranslationincells.The latter is insensitive to rapamycin and mainly regulatesremodelingthecytoskeleton[51].TheTORsignalingpathway regulates longevity. When TOR signaling is decreased or inactivated, the lifespan of wireworms and Drosophila is extended. Similarly, thelifespan of yeast can be increasedbyexposure to a low dose of rapamycin [52]. At present, it isbelievedthatTORC1participatesinregulatingaging.S6KisapositiveregulationtargetofTORC1. In themouseknockoutof the S6K gene, lifespan is extended. 4E-BP is a gene that isnecessary to lifecycle and is a negative regulator of TORC1.When4E-BPisoverexpressed,lifespanisprolonged[53]. In terms of the physiological function of TOR signal regulation,TORregulatesgrowthduringembryonicdevelop-ment, and in maturity TOR regulates metabolism. However,in old age TOR signaling regulation is excessively acti-vated and is associated with many age-related diseases. Theexcessive production of cytokines and inflammatory factorsinduces aging and the changes to the local microenviron-ment, causing age-related diseases. TOR regulates cells and interactswith increased levels of IL-6 and IL-8. The activation ofRIG-I signaling pathway upregulates IL-6 expression [55].RIG-Iisacaspaserecruitmentdomain-(CARD-)containingprotein that functions as a cytoplasmic RNA sensor [55].Liu et al. [55] showed that IL-6 and IL-8 levels increasein replicating senescent cells. They reported senescentcells with show secretion of of RIG-I in senescent cells leads tothe extension of the lifespan of cells, which shows that RIG- I-inducedinflammationplaysaroleinpromotingandmain-tainingaging.InterferingwithRIG-Iexpressionsignificantlydecreases the levels of inflammatory cytokines in senescentcells [55]. This imbalance in the inflammatory process maycausechronicinflammationduringaging. 6.4. Notch Signaling Pathway. The Notch signaling pathway is a major intercellular communication pathway that ishighly conserved through evolution. Notch signaling playsan essential role in aging [56]. At the cellular level, aging ofvascularendothelialcells(EC)leadstosenescence.SenescentEC secrete proinflammatory cytokines and this is oftenaccompaniedbyalow-gradechronicupregulationofcertainproinflammatory responses activation ofNotch signaling induces EC senescence. Consistent withtheseresults,HeyL,aNotchdownstreamtarget,iselevatedinaged compared to young EC. Notch activation also triggersEC inflammatory responses by upregulating expression of apanel of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and adhe-sion molecules in EC. This has revealed a novel functionof Notch1 signaling in EC biology and may shed light onthe mechanism whereby Notch signaling may contribute tosome age-related vascular diseases characterized by chronicinflammation. 6.5. Sirtuin Signaling Pathway. Silent information regulator (Sir) proteins regulate lifespan in multiple model organ-isms [57]. Sir2 (SIRT1-7 in mammals) is a NAD-dependentdeacetylasethathasbeenimplicatedinagingandinflamma-tion in yeast, worms, and flies. SIRT1, the most extensivelystudiedinmammals,hasahighlyconservedNAD-dependentsirtuincoredomainandisagoodcandidatelifespanregulatoralong with the other six homologs.

TGF-1belongstothegroupofcytokineswithanti-inflammatory effectsandisadeactivatingfactorofmacrophageswithpotentanti-inflammatory properties. Because of the role played bythetransforminggrowthfactor 1(TGF-1)ininflammation and the regulation of immune responses, variability of the TGF-1 gene may affect longevity by playing a role in inflamm-aging. The potential role of TGF- 1i na g i n ga n d longevity has been suggested by many in vitro and in vivostudies. In particular, TGF-1 gene overexpression has been observed in human fibroblasts that display a senescent-likephenotypefollowingexposuretooxidativestress,whichmayhelptoseekanewproposaltotreatdisease-relatedaging[59]. 6.7. Ras Signaling Pathway. R a si sa ni m p o r t a n ts i g n a l i n g molecule involved in atherogenesis and is a proinflamma-tory molecule involved in inflammation and aging. Raspromotes aging in yeast and cellular senescence in primaryhumanfibroblasts.ActivationofRasdrasticallyincreasestheexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, in part through extracellularsignal-regulatedkinaseactivation.Introduction of Ras into arteries enhances vascular inflammation andsenescence[60].

At present, the mechanisms of inflamm-aging remain unclear, because the methods and tools used for researchinto the mechanisms of inflamm-aging are not sufficientlysophisticated to explain inflammatory reactions caused bycomplex inflammatory cytokine cascades during inflamm-aging. Unfortunately, an adequate and reliable assessmentsystem for aging has not yet been established. Furthermore,the causal relationships between inflammation and aginghave not yet been elucidated. Moreover, the mechanisms referredtoaboveneedtobefurtherverified.Inflamm-aging influences all levels of function, from cells to tissues, organs,a n dt h ew h o l eb o d y .I n fl a m m - a g i n ga l s oi n v o l v e sa b e r r a n tgene regulation and an imbalance in energy metabolism aswell as interactions between these two factors.

The main biological markers of aging can be categorized as follows: (1) the marker is related to age; (2) the marker doesn o tc h a n g ew i t hd i s e a s e ;( 3 )t h em a r k e rd o e sn o tc h a n g e with metabolic and nutrient conditions; (4) the marker is influenced by the process of aging; (5) the marker does notchange in immortalized cells. Unfortunately, the biologicalmarkers of aging have not yet been defined and need to befurther investigated. This will facilitate the evaluation of thedegreeofinflamm-agingandassistinidentifyingthemolec-ular mechanisms underlying inflamm-aging. The potentialmarkersofinflamm-agingmayinclude immunecell markers, serumcytokine markers,andmicroRNAs. 7.1. Immune Cell Markers. Am a i nc h a r a c t e r i s t i co ft h e immune system in the elderly is antigenic T cell accu-mulation. The shortage of naive CD8+ T lymphocytes isregarded as a reliable biological marker related to the risk ofdeath. The increase in CD8+ T cells, a decrease in CD4+ Tcells and CD19+ B cells, and inhibition of mitogen-inducedproliferation of T cells may be predictors of inflamm-aging[3]. 7.2. Serum Cytokine Markers. The increase in serum IL-6 in the elderly is related to diseases, disability, and mortality. AstudyonalargecohortshowedthatIL-6intheserumisareli-ablemarkerofdisabilityintheelderlyandcontributestothe predictiveindexofdisabilityandmortality[3].Thefunctions ofsomecytokines,suchasIL-10andTNF- ,arecomplexand play opposing roles in the systemic inflammatory reaction.IL-10inhibitsinflammatoryreactions,whileTNF- activates inflammatory reaction locally and systemically. Differentregulation of IL-10 and TNF-may be essential to the final outcome of the inflammatory reaction. Therefore, levels ofIL-6, TNF-, and IL-10 may be regarded as serum markers ofinflamm-aging[3]. 7.3. MicroRNA Markers. MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression andJournalofImmunologyResearch 7 Table1:Inflamm-aging-relatedmechanismsandregulatedsignalingpathways. i R sm a yb e associated with inflammation, cellular senescence, and age-related diseases and they can be senescence-associated (SA-miRs) [61]. miR-based anti-inflammatory mechanisms crucial role during aging, where a chronic, low-levelproinflammatory status is likely sustained by the cell senes- cence secretome and by progressive activation of immune cells over time. Circulating miRs seem to be promisingbiomarkersofmajorage-relateddiseases[60].SomemiRsarefoundinplasmaandleukocytesincentenarians.SomemiRs,suchasmiR-21,miR-126,andmiR-146a,whichtargetmRNAsbelonging to the NF-B pathway can be considered as both SA-miRs and inflamm-miRs [61]. Thus specific inflamm-miRsmayberegardedasbiomarkersofinflamm-aging[62]. 8. Intervention in Inflamm-Aging A significant feature of inflamm-aging is that there is achronic, low-grade, microinflammatory state in the body.Therefore, drugs used for the treatment of inflamm-agingmust be effective, safe, nontoxic, and appropriate for long-term use. Calorie restriction, zinc (Zn), resveratrol, Epimedium totalflavonoids,andicariinhavethesecharacter- isticsandmaybecandidatedrugstotreatinflamm-aging. 8.1.CalorieRestriction. Calorierestriction(CR),alsoknown as dietary restriction (DR), has been regarded as the gold standardofmanyaginginterventionstocounteractaging.CRtogether with adequate nutrient intake prolongs maximumlifespan possibly through beneficial hormonal,and functional [63]. The antiaging action and oxidative stress induced age-relateddiseases [64, 65]. CR can modulate many important inflam-matory signaling pathways involved in aging and inflam-mation such as NF-B ,m T O R ,a n dM A P K[ 6 6 ] .Th ea g e of NF-B, IL-,IL -6,a attenuated byCR[67].8.2.

The elderly frequently lack adequate levels of Zn. A moderate amount of Zn added to thedietmayexpandthelifespanoftheelderly,whichsuggeststhatZnmayinterveneininflamm-aging[68]. 8.3. Resveratrol. Some studies have found that resveratrol affects aging and lifespan in mammals [22]. Researchersreported that this potent natural compound is a SIRT1 acti-vator and may help in preventing the aging-related declinein heart function and neuronal loss and suppressing However, knockdown of Sirt1 by RNAinterference cells stimula- the These data demonstrate that resveratrolmayhaveinhibitoryeffectoninflamm-aging. gland, and spleen ofelderly rats. We also detected the proteins corresponding8 JournalofImmunologyResearch to the genes referred to above. The findings showed that overexpression of some proinflammatory cytokines at thetranscription and protein level may be involved in thehighlyproinflammatoryreactivestateduringinflamm-aging.Additionally, our experiments showed that Epimedium total flavonoids (EF) Metformin. The biguanide drug metformin, a type of hypoglycemic drug, is widely prescribed to treat type 2diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Researchers have alsonoted the effect of metformin on delaying aging, an effectv a l i d a t e di nr o d e n t s[ 7 5 ]a n di nt h en e m a t o d e Caenorhab- ditis elegans [76]. Recently, Hall conducted a clinic trial called \"Metformin, Anti-aging,\" which was supported bythe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [77]. Thiswas a landmark event in the history of aging research andshowed that metformin may be used as an antiaging drug to improve the health span of humans. The mechanisms underlyingtheantiagingeffectsofmetforminremainunclear.Several lines of evidence support that metformin may actby inducing metabolism associated with dietary restriction(DR) to increase lifespan and thereby limit the onset ofage-associated diseases across species [78, 79]. A potentialmediator of metformin benefits is the metformin can be viewed as DR-like com-pound[76].Cabreiroetal.reportedthatmetformindisruptsthe bacterial folate cycle, leading to reduced levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and decelerated aging in C. elegans[80]. Meanwhile, Moiseeva et al. showed that met- formin inhibits the expression of genes coding for multipleinflammatorycytokinesseenduringcellularsenescence,andmetformin blocks the activity of NF- B[ 8 1 ] .Th ee ff e c t s of metformin on anti-inflammation and antiaging imply itspotentialoninflamm-aging. 9. Novel Research Strategies in Inflamm-Aging Research into inflamm-aging is still at an early stage. Themechanisms,biomarkers,evaluationmethod,researchmod-els, and intervention methods of inflamm-aging have notbeen fully elucidated. Moreover, inflamm-aging involvescells,organs,andthewholebodyandthisrequiresanexten- siveandvariedrangeofresearchinvestigations. Based on the essential effects and our understanding of inflammatory cytokine pathways in the process of inflamm-aging, we can begin to explore the inflammatory cytokinenetwork and perform a quantitative evaluation of inflamm-aging.Inflammatorycytokines,includinginterleukins,tumornecrosis factor, and interferon, mediate their effects bybinding to their receptors and competing in a complex cell-cell network. These cytokines act in both paracrine andautocrine ways to exert direct effects on the microenvi-ronment. This plays an important regulatory role by acti-vating inflammatory and immune cells and by releasingcytokines. In addition, inflammatory cytokines induce thesystemic inflammatory response in the circulation. Inter- actions between many inflammatory cytokines comprisethe inflammatory cytokine network, which features poly-phyletism,pleiotropy,andoverlappingeffects.Inflammatorycytokines form a complex network which extends in alldirectionsandthroughoutthewholebody.Theinflammatory cytokine network can be divided into the proinflammatory cytokine network and anti-inflammatory cytokine network.As with the immune reaction, the inflammatory reactionis also a normal defense function. A moderate inflamma-tory reaction is advantageous to the body, whereas a highreaction is harmful and the outcome of these reactionsis determined by changes in the inflammatory cytokinenetwork. The dynamic balance between the proinflamma-tory cytokine network and the anti-inflammatory cytokinenetwork maintains the normal function of inflammation inbody.Oncethebalanceisbroken,pathologicalinflammationoccurs[82,83].Therefore,weinferthatthecauseofinflamm-aging is an imbalance in the proinflammatory cytokineand anti-inflammatory cytokine networks, which leads to aproinflammatorystatuswithincreasingage.Thismaybethemechanismofinflamm-aging. The changes in the inflammatory cytokine network have three characteristics: parallelity, multilevel action, and non-linearity.Unravelingtheinflammatorycytokinenetworkwillrequire nonlinear research methods such as systems biologymethods. The inflammatory cytokine network is a typicalsystems biology issue, which needs to replace the modelinvolvingindividualgeneswithasystemsbiologymodel. Systems biology is an interdisciplinary field integrating multiple disciplines such as biology, medicine, mathemat- ics, physics, and chemistry. It integrates many kinds ofexperimental data and biological information to build amathematical model tested and verified by experimentaldata and finally predicts the behavior of biological systems[84]. Systems biology provides an excellent opportunity toelucidate the essential features of the inflammatory cytokinenetwork. It also provides a theoretical guide and new waystoillustratetherelevantmechanismsandbuildaquantitativeevaluation system for the inflammatory cytokine network,which may provide a breakthrough in research on inflamm-aging. Aging (including inflamm-aging) is also a systems biol- ogy issue involving a complex process that results from thecombined effects of many factors. Cellular senescence is theb a s i cu n i to fb i o l o g i c a la g i n g .O r g a na g i n gi sn o to n l yt h emacropresentation of cellular senescence but also a bridgethatconnectscellularsenescenceandintegralaging.Cellularsenescence, organ aging, and integral aging form a chain ofaging,andcellularsenescenceisthecriticallinkinthechainofaging.Intheagingprocess,atalllevels(i.e.,genes,proteins,metabolites, cells, and tissues), the organism undergoesvarying degrees of change in these structures, such that thebody's systems (e.g., the nervous system, endocrine system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, digestive system, urinary system, and motor system) undergo a significantfunctional decline. Aging is not the result of a unilateralfactor, but a systemic decline in body function, and thedistinctive features of aging are systemic [85]. The systemicJournalofImmunologyResearch 9 featuresofagingstronglyreflectthegradualchangesinbody function. Functional changes in the process of aging appeargradually with age, and all the changes are the results ofprogressiveaccumulation;timeisthedrivingfactor.Thebodyis composed of various tissues and organs, so aging is agradual process, not a point but an evolution of tissues and organsovertime. Multidisciplinary research including the fields of medicine, biology, mathematics, computer science, and sys-t e m sb i o l o gys h o ul dbea p p l i eda n dd ev e l o pedt oi n v e s ti g a t ethe mechanisms of inflamm-aging and the relationshipbetweeninflamm-agingandage-relateddiseases.Specifically,the important scientific problems that need to be addressedarethefollowing:(1)theregulatorymechanismsresponsibleforthedevelopmentofinflamm-agingand(2)themolecularmechanisms,theregulatorynetwork,andthekey roleofthetransformationfrominflammationtoage-relateddiseasesintheprocessofinflamm-aging. In summary, inflamm-aging and the inflammatory cytokine network are both classical systems biology issues.Theinflammatorycytokinenetworkisinvolvedintheprocessofinflammationandsenescenceandmaybetheidealbreak-throughpointofresearchintoinflamm-aging.Omics,suchasgenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics,are excellent methods to solve systemic biology problems.Therefore,undertheguidanceofsystemsbiology,itwouldbenovel strategy to conduct basic research into inflamm-agingusingomicsmethodstoidentifycharacteristicinflammatorycytokine genes in the process of aging and to uncovernewmechanismstoregulateinflammatorycytokinesduring inflamm-aging. This will also illustrate the mechanism of inflamm-aging and provide new ways to assess inflamm-aging. 10. A Novel Concept of Immuno-Inflamm-Aging There is an essential relationship between inflammation and immunity. Both the inflammatory steady state and immunesteadystatehavedefensefunctions,protectingthebodyfrominjury[86].However,whentheinflammatorysteadystateandimmunesteadystatearebroken,excessiveinflammationandpathological immunity ensue and the normal physiologicalfunctionofthebodyiscompromised,whichcausesimmune-inflammatory diseases. Inflammation and immunity coexistin the same pathological process, the two sides of a whole, and are inseparable. In a sense, inflammatory cells are immune cells [87]; therefore, they have the same cellularfoundation. Many inflammatory and immune cells have thesame cytokine receptors [88], which mediate cell-cell andcell-cytokine interactions. The internal relationship betweeninflammationandimmunityisnotknown,andthecausesandpathologicalmechanismsofimmune-inflammatorydiseasesare not understood and this limits effective treatments forimmune-inflammatorydiseases[86]. EF and Ica, anti-inflammatoryimmunomodulatoryChi- nesetraditionalmedicines,notonlyreduceinflammationbutalsoregulateimmunity.Asanti-inflammatory,immunomod-ulatory Chinese traditional medicines, EF and Ica have thedouble effects of intervening in immunosenescence and inflamm-aging, suggesting an intimate relationship betweenimmunosenescenceandinflamm-aging[73,74]. B a s e do nt h ei n t e g r a t e dr e l a t i o n s h i pb e t w e e no x i d a t i v e stress and inflammatory stress, De La Fuente and Miquelproposed an innovative oxidation-inflammation theory of aging (oxi-inflamm-aging) [10]. The oxi-inflamm-aging the- ory posits that chronic oxidative stress affects all immunecells, and particularly regulatory systems such as neural,endocrine, and immune systems, as well as the mutualinteractions among these systems. These events lead tostable, internal environment disorders that are harmful tohealth.Therelationshipbetweentheredoxstateandimmunefunction affects the speed of aging and lifespan. A diet withsufficient antioxidants improves immune function, reducesoxidative stress, and prolongs lifespan, which supports thenotion that the inflammatory response of immune cellsand the immune system play an important role in oxi-inflamm-aging [10]. Inflamm-aging and immunosenescenceareconnected,andtheycauseandaffecteachother.Thiscanresult in a vicious cycle that further aggravates the occur-rence and development of age-related diseases includingatherosclerosis,metabolicsyndrome,type2diabetes,insulinresistance, osteoporosis, bone arthritis, muscle mass andmuscleweakness,cancer,andneurodegenerativediseases. Itiscurrentlynotpossibletodistinguishwhetherdiseases are caused by inflamm-aging alone or immunosenescencealone [30, 89]. Therefore, we propose that inflamm-agingis accompanied by immunosenescence, and they occurtogether. We propose the novel concept of immune/inflam- matoryaging(immuno-inflamm-aging),insteadoftheindi- vidualconceptsofinflamm-agingandimmunosenescence.
