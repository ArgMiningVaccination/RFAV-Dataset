Includes fit tests on 4 popular crib mattresses plus my personal experiences with these crib sheets! How Important are Organic Crib Sheets? First of all, let me say: I'm not an organic cotton die hard, and I don't think you need to be either. That's why I've called this article \"Non Toxic and Organic Crib Sheets,\" rather than focusing entirely on organic crib sheets. If you're looking for the best organic crib sheets, you'll still find them in this article! But also, I've included some other options. I own some organic crib sheets, and also some conventional ones. They all have pros and cons. If you can afford organic cotton for your crib sheets, by all means, go for it. There are a lot of benefits to doing so, which I've laid out later in this article. But if you can't afford organic cotton, that's okay too. In that case, I suggest you focus your attention on what kinds of inks and dyes the company uses, and make sure they are water-based, non-toxic, and/or azo free. Because that does matter, in my opinion, when it comes to safety. While organic baby stuff does tend to be more expensive, you can find a fairly wide range at an affordable price these days. There are certainly super bougie brands out there, but major retailers like [Target](https://rstyle.me/+bK7EbQwmjp3G9KUh1G5fXw), [Walmart](https://rstyle.me/+XS10owxz574U-1GdezzYMA) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=organic+crib+sheets&crid=1YDTK3842GQI7&sprefix=organic+crib+sheets%2Caps%2C163&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=4c522b7e03b5a5f2db63e7ee3c83ace7&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) have pretty affordable options. [Burt's Bees Baby crib sheets](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E798E0B1-8D05-4722-A947-72DB314A300D?ingress=2&visitId=72358e15-91f3-4251-ab39-cab9d2143cc1&store_ref=bl_ast_dp_brandLogo_sto&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=01015b4c4968529a5d62e4ca863f6e91&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) are a brand I have used personally and can recommend, and they can be found for a fairly affordable price, either through [their two-packs on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E798E0B1-8D05-4722-A947-72DB314A300D?ingress=2&visitId=72358e15-91f3-4251-ab39-cab9d2143cc1&store_ref=bl_ast_dp_brandLogo_sto&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=01015b4c4968529a5d62e4ca863f6e91&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), or [on the sale section on the Burt's Bees Baby website](https://rstyle.me/+EWTvSGU_2hZq3Q1Xirvvkw) (I've even seen organic crib sheets on there for about the same price as a Starbucks coffee, before!). [KeaBabies on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/2-Pack-Jersey-Fitted-Baby-Sheets/dp/B08HYS8HCQ?crid=20YI241QG8N1O&keywords=american%2Bbaby%2Bco%2Borganic%2Bcrib%2Bsheets&qid=1668038786&sprefix=american%2Bbaby%2Bco%2Borganic%2Bcrub%2Bsheets%2Caps%2C164&sr=8-3-spons&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=a27250c5c88c9b21ac8b2123dc8bb813&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) also tends to have affordable organic crib sheets that are GOTS certified. That said, I don't think organic crib sheets are essential, and would argue the dyes and pigments are a more important barometer of \"non toxic.\" I've formed this opinion based on my own research, [looking at peer reviewed studies](http://www.fibtex.lodz.pl/46_18_67.pdf), and laid out in my articles about [whether organic cotton is safer for babies and kids](https://greenactivefamily.com/chemicals-and-materials/is-organic-cotton-better-for-babies/), and [why azo free inks are a good idea for babies and kids](https://greenactivefamily.com/chemicals-and-materials/azo-free-dyes/). Key Takeaways About Whether You Need Organic Cotton Crib Sheets - Organic cotton is definitely [a more environmentally friendly choice](https://ejfoundation.org/resources/downloads/the_deadly_chemicals_in_cotton.pdf)as compared to conventional cotton, and in an idea world we'd all be able to afford it. If you can afford it, it's a great choice for this reason, as well as some other reasons I've laid out further in this article. - Some cotton products are absolutely worth buying organic. Anything with cotton batting in the finished product (i.e. quilts, duvets, [mattresses](https://greenactivefamily.com/nursery/cribs-bedding/best-organic-kids-mattress/), [pillows](https://greenactivefamily.com/nursery/cribs-bedding/best-organic-toddler-pillow/)), buy organic if you can. That's because conventional cotton batting tends to retain some of the pesticide residue and chemicals used when growing and harvesting the crop. My family sleeps on organic mattresses (me and my husband, and my daughter) for this reason. - Buying organic when we're talking about finished fabrics (i.e. clothes and sheets) is less important from a \"pesticide residue\" point of view. That's because pesticide residues tend to be gone when it comes to finished fabrics. This isn't my opinion - [people have studied this](http://www.fibtex.lodz.pl/46_18_67.pdf), and I personally feel sources that claim pesticide residue is a problem in finished cotton fabrics are being misleading. - When considering finished fabric products, such as sheets, consider what kind of dyes the company used. While pesticide residues in finished conventional cotton fabric does not appear to be a widespread problem we need to worry too much about, heavy metal contamination from dying cotton with toxic dyes DOES appear to be a problem worth our consideration as parents. Most organic cotton sheets also use non-toxic dyes, making it an easy \"two birds, one stone\" purchase, but it's always worth double checking on the dyes. Crib Sheets with Safe Dyes and Pigments > Organic Crib Sheets I've chosen to focus this article on non-toxic and organic crib sheets, rather than organic baby crib sheets only. I hope it offers you more choice, and also allows you to choose sheets in a budget range that suits your family. I've started out by listing some non-toxic and organic sheets I think are great. I've used some of them personally, and am able to offer my personal experiences with those ones, including testing them out on a few different crib mattresses for fit. Other brands I haven't had the chance to use personally yet, but I've included them in this list based on research into the brand. I believe the best crib sheets are ones that use safe fabrics AND safe dyes and pigments, as well as being user friendly for parents (washing, getting on the crib mattress) and soft and safe for baby. I hope this article helps you make a choice that's right for your family. My Personal Experience with these Non Toxic Organic Crib Sheets Of the 17 brands of organic and non toxic crib sheets I recommend in this article, I have personally used and tested 4 of them: [Burt's Bees Baby](https://rstyle.me/+3o4AGFqCs3FZwmOCw5PyUA), [Little Unicorn](https://rstyle.me/+3o4AGFqCs3FZwmOCw5PyUA), [Pehr](https://rstyle.me/+JAjreM4NwvGytWLdrcsRPw), and have yet to try the [Naturepedic crib sheets](https://shrsl.com/3sbsj), although I love our Naturepedic mattresses, so feel confident recommending the brand. The other options I've included on this list of best crib sheets are based on research, not personally trying and testing them. That includes: [Nestig](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1537362&u=1156891&m=97236&urllink=www%2Enestig%2Ecom%2Fcollections%2Fsheets&afftrack=Bestorganiccribsheets), haven't used any of the sheets in the Alternatives Section, including [Touched by [Honest Baby](https://rstyle.me/+jJNUPi_pTOLKom97VmoDVw). Also worth noting, of the crib sheets I own, I have tested them on 4 different crib mattresses for fit and ease of getting on As far as the Nook Mattress, I tested it on the Nook Air, which seems to be out of stock everywhere. However, it's the same dimensions as [ the Nook Pebble Pure](https://rstyle.me/+K_iVum2WkvE5VxtxAxu3ww) which is still available! 17 Best Crib Sheets (Non Toxic and Organic) Best Overall: [Burts Bees Crib Sheets](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E798E0B1-8D05-4722-A947-72DB314A300D?&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=5b7d3fba9253b36aff8d604925b7e3ac&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) We give Burts Bees Sheets 5/5 [Our ](https://www.amazon.com/Union-3-in-1-Convertible-Crib-Grey/dp/B00JL6LOT0/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li3&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=ca6974b7f3f96c8dfbb6f2412d450ed7&language=en_US) [Burt's Bees Baby Sheet](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E798E0B1-8D05-4722-A947-72DB314A300D?&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=5b7d3fba9253b36aff8d604925b7e3ac&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) in Grey Stripe Best Organic Crib Sheets + Best Jersey Knit Crib Sheets - Certifications: GOTS - Made in: India - Made from: 100% GOTS certified organic cotton jersey knit with GOTS regulated dyes and printing techniques - Care instructions: Machine wash cold on the gentle cycle with like colors and tumble dry low. If required, only use non-chlorine bleach - Size: 28 x 52. Fits a standard US crib mattress up to 6 in depth - Elastic: The elastic runs around the entire perimeter of the sheet We own these sheets, and can speak with personal experience about how great they are. The cotton jersey knit makes them incredibly soft to the touch. They are softer than our [Pottery Barn Kids organic crib sheets](https://rstyle.me/+2lMfobamut1MsFwClaZHzA). They're a similar softness to our [Little Unicorn Cotton Muslin crib sheets](https://rstyle.me/+W9ptzYsnYhUpAfLxykhP7w), although it's a different feel: the jersey knit of the Burts Bees vs the muslin of the Little Unicorn sheets. These sheets also a bit warmer to the touch than standard cotton percale, which is a design feature meant to help when you're transitioning your baby from your arms to their crib. I was skeptical of this as a marketing thing, but they really are a bit cozier than our other crib sheets, making them a great choice in cooler weather. My [Burts Bees sheets](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E798E0B1-8D05-4722-A947-72DB314A300D?&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=5b7d3fba9253b36aff8d604925b7e3ac&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) are well used, and have very minimal, almost non-existent pilling. That's another design feature, as these sheets are made from ringspun (which makes finer fibers) and combed cotton (which removes impurities after picking). This is meant to increase durability and softness, and reduce pilling. The elastic is 360-degree design, which means it goes around the entire perimeter of the crib mattress, which is meant to keep them firmly in place. These sheets also have a ton of extra fabric to go around the bottom of the mattress, and help keep the sheet in place. Comparing [the Burt's Bees sheet](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E798E0B1-8D05-4722-A947-72DB314A300D?&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=5b7d3fba9253b36aff8d604925b7e3ac&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) to [the Pottery Barn sheet](https://rstyle.me/+2lMfobamut1MsFwClaZHzA), as an example, and you can see how much more fabric the Burt's Bees comes with. Both are absolutely adequate and meet safety requirements. However, the extra fabric on [the Burt's Bees sheet](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E798E0B1-8D05-4722-A947-72DB314A300D?&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=5b7d3fba9253b36aff8d604925b7e3ac&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) makes it a bit easier to get pulled tightly onto the mattress, in my opinion based on personal experience. [The Burts Bee sheets](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E798E0B1-8D05-4722-A947-72DB314A300D?&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=5b7d3fba9253b36aff8d604925b7e3ac&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) fit a standard sized crib mattress and toddler mattress, with depth of up to 6. It's worth noting, these sheets fit very tightly. Reading reviews from other customers, some people don't love how tight they are. To me, however, this is a feature, not a bug: you really don't want loose fabric in your kiddo's crib, for safety reasons.

It's a bit loose on the [Nook Sleep Pebble](https://rstyle.me/+K_iVum2WkvE5VxtxAxu3ww) Air, but if you're diligent about really pulling the extra fabric over the edges and around the bottom, it works and the sheet stays put. This wouldn't be my top choice crib mattress/crib sheet combination. That said, it's worth noting [ the Nook Pebble mattresses](https://rstyle.me/+K_iVum2WkvE5VxtxAxu3ww) can be used without sheets. I've also found mentions from past customers who've successfully used these sheets on an [Avocado crib mattress](http://avocadomattress.n5ka.net/5bVmPN), [Sealy Soybean Serenity mattress](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/FCEB131B-4CB9-45CF-BCAD-09203FF26F6F?ingress=2&visitId=b5e8fe02-18f1-4adb-a290-ce22b1fb2139&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=243147ed5e5c0d3533b35c4d07d37738&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), and [Newton Mattress](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1019236&u=1156891&m=72395&urllink=www%2Enewtonbaby%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fnewton%2Dcrib%2Dmattress%3F&afftrack=Bestorganiccribsheets) (you can [read my review of the Newton here](http://avocadomattress.n5ka.net/5bVmPN)).

I am a bit enamoured with Nestig as a company to be honest - they make gorgeous and ethically made cribs, crib sheets, nursery rugs, and more, and IMO the company is quite transparent about manufacturing and materials, which is a huge plus in my books. Their handmade [GOTS certified crib sheets](https://shrsl.com/3sbvd) are made using GOTS certified organic cotton and printed using Oeko-Tex\u00ae certified dyes that are all natural and non toxic. The designs somehow strike the perfect balance between modern and vintage-whimsy, and there are plenty of Instagram-ready prints to choose from. Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to try these sheets out yet. Because of this, I can't offer a personal opinion or my own photos like I do with many of the other brands. I also don't know if they use 360-degree elastic, or just elasticize the ends. From what I see of [Nestig crib sheets](https://shrsl.com/3sbvd), I really like them, and they get rave reviews. But I can't offer any personal hot takes.

[Little Unicorn](https://rstyle.me/+dssqTDlzFHClrfqdwu5yBg) is known for a massive range of adorable prints, making them a great choice if you have a specific nursery theme in mind, or are simply looking for super stylish crib sheets. They make cotton muslin sheets in both [an organic cotton option](https://rstyle.me/+yiOd_dBm-GDktfIwZV1EVA), and [a conventional cotton option](https://rstyle.me/+OQQKh1xzMfhoTWTvoz7AHw). The sheets are very soft and breathable, and would be a great choice if you want cool crib sheets, due to living in a hotter climate or to use during the summer. The organic cotton crib sheets are GOTS certified and Oekto-Tex Standard 100 certified, meaning they're good to go in terms of \"non toxic\" with dyes, pigments, and other chemicals. We have the Narwhal print cotton muslin crib sheets. I thought they were organic when I bought them, and then got them home and realized - whoops - they aren't, and they were final sale. I've reached out to Little Unicorn to ask what kind of dyes and inks they use on their conventional cotton sheets, and will update this article when (if) I hear back. [Little Unicorn](https://rstyle.me/+dssqTDlzFHClrfqdwu5yBg) does have this to say as far as a general statement on the issue: \"We are parents too. And it is a lot of work. The last thing you want to worry about is the safety of the products you choose for your kids. We test and test and test again our product before it gets to you. We ensure it is free of harmful chemicals and meets global safety standards, so you can enjoy the wonderful moments through it all.\" Like most crib sheets, the bottom of the sheet uses elastic around the entire perimeter.

They fit well on all of them, and because the weave is so open, they have the slightest bit of stretch and give to the fabric, which makes it easier to pull them tight! I also really like the packaging of the [Little Unicorn sheets,](https://rstyle.me/+dssqTDlzFHClrfqdwu5yBg) which is plastic free.

They are made from a 300-thread count, long staple cotton, that is super soft. And they forgo prints and designs in favor of keeping the sheets natural and free from dyes and pigments. This makes them a great choice for babies with sensitive skin or skin conditions, in particular. However, they're also a great choice if you want a minimalist look in your nursery, and are looking for plain white crib sheets that are also organic and non-toxic.

Add to that, they are 400-thread count (again: super soft) and are pre-washed and processed to ensure they have a neutral pH when they get to your crib. This is another feature meant specifically to be gentle on your baby's skin. Available in crisp white only, these use GOTS certified organic cotton, and are MADE SAFE certified. Best Brushed Cotton with Prints: [Pehr](https://rstyle.me/+FN_g9NS0Y5XSWs2Mmd5SyA) We give Pehr 5/5 Best Printed Cotton N/A - Made in: Designed in Canada; artisan made in India - Made from: Brushed organic cotton and all natural, azo-free dyes - Care instructions: Machine wash on cold and tumble dry on low; if required, iron on low - Size: 52L x 28 W x 8 H - Elastic: The elastic runs around the entire perimeter of the sheet I really like Pehr products. We have a Pehr organic cotton baby play mat, and it is so soft, I want to snuggle with it whenever I pull it out. It's an [awesome non-toxic baby mat](https://greenactivefamily.com/healthy-home/child-safety/best-non-toxic-play-mat/), and I have come to appreciate Pehr's commitment to organic fabrics and non-toxic inks. Pehr also offers a wide range of [adorable crib sheets](https://rstyle.me/+FN_g9NS0Y5XSWs2Mmd5SyA) with awesome prints, including gender-traditional prints, gender-neutral, bold and modern, and more subdued, traditional baby prints and colors. In terms of safety, I love that Pehr's screen printing is done by hand using azo free dyes, and the sheets are brushed organic cotton. The company only uses natural dyes and treatments, including softeners. If choosing eco friendlier bedding is important to you, Pehr is working to reduce its packaging footprint by using fabric bags made from excess packaging for product packaging, instead of plastic. If I was looking for a brushed cotton sheet, [I'd personally choose Pehr](https://rstyle.me/+FN_g9NS0Y5XSWs2Mmd5SyA) over Pottery Barn, based on my personal experience. I find the sheets are a bit easier to get on, and also have a bit more fabric around the bottom edge.

Not 360-degree elastic. - ***Note: Pottery Barn kids lists their crib sheets as fitting mattresses up to 10 deep, but in my experience, I can't see how that would work. In the photo below, you can see the edges of the crib sheet barely fit over a Lullaby Earth crib mattress, which is 6 deep. There's a lot to love about the [Pottery Barn Kids organic crib sheets](https://rstyle.me/+UsRG-1ptmjIN9wmTDneRLQ). Our PBK sheets are a cotton percale, and they're a super soft 200-thread count with a lovely design. They've been through the wash many, many times, and there is no pilling to speak of, and the print is still nice and bright. Notice how faded the care tag is in the photo below, compared to the print on the sheet! In fact, [Pottery Barn kids](https://rstyle.me/+UsRG-1ptmjIN9wmTDneRLQ) has some of the widest variety of organic crib sheets that I've found. Their organic line offers sheets made from an organic percale, organic velour, and organic flannel - all 100% cotton. They also offer a huge range of designs, as well as seasonal sheets (i.e. Christmas) and some character sheets, as well. Incredibly popular, good quality, and extremely cute...sounds great, right? Don't get me wrong: I really like our [Pottery Barn Kids organic crib sheets](https://rstyle.me/+UsRG-1ptmjIN9wmTDneRLQ). However, I think there are a few cons with them as well. The first thing to note about the Pottery Barn organic crib sheets is they use elastic around the top and the bottom only, not the entire edge. This is unique among the crib sheets I've tried - every other brand I have direct experience is has a \"360-degree\" elastic system. My [Pottery Barn Kids crib sheets](https://rstyle.me/+UsRG-1ptmjIN9wmTDneRLQ) do stay in place really well. But it's certainly worth pointing out this is a different design than you might expect. A bigger issue for me is fit. Pottery Barn indicates the sheets should fit up to a 10 deep mattress, but there isn't a lot of fabric left over on the bottom when I put it on my [Lullaby Earth Crib mattress](https://www.amazon.com/Lullaby-Earth-Breathe-Breathable-Mattress/dp/B07C8G5ZRD?crid=KKC2IPC8P2GF&keywords=lullaby%2Bearth%2Bcrib%2Bmattress&qid=1668444321&sprefix=lullaby%2Bearth%2Bcr%2Caps%2C451&sr=8-1-spons&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.c3015c4a-46bb-44b9-81a4-dc28e6d374b3&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&smid=A1ALLJIIN25GZO&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=5e63ffa4764070266cdd79818d8c1cc7&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (pictured immediately below), which is 6 When I put them on our 6 deep [Colgate Eco Classica III](https://www.amazon.com/Colgate-Classica-Firmness-Eco-Friendlier-Mattress/dp/B004O6M4M8?crid=2DRWI3QETTUTV&keywords=colgate+eco+classica+iii+crib+mattress&qid=1668034757&sprefix=coglate+eco+c%2Caps%2C138&sr=8-1-spons&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=528916660b65bc7f2bc200f437c5962c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), the fabric on the non-elasticized edges of the crib sheet don't wrap around to the bottom of the mattress - there simply isn't enough fabric. The sheet fits wonderfully on our [Nook Pebble](https://rstyle.me/+K_iVum2WkvE5VxtxAxu3ww) Air (pictured below) which is a lower profile mattress (it's only 4 deep) compared to [the Naturepedic mattresses I tested this sheet with. I think this sheet fits a 6 depth mattress just fine - it stays put. But, I can't really see how it would work on a 10 deep mattress, without being frustrating to get on and off. That said, I don't have a 10 deep mattress to try it on, so I am just guessing here. Overall, I think [Pottery Barn sheets](https://rstyle.me/+UsRG-1ptmjIN9wmTDneRLQ) are durable, soft, and adorable, and should work with most mattresses up to 6 deep, but I'd be wary about buying them for deeper mattresses.

[Available at Target.](https://rstyle.me/+jJNUPi_pTOLKom97VmoDVw) What to Look for in Organic Crib Sheets Here's a checklist to consider if you want to choose the best crib sheets for your family. Remember, safe sleep guidelines dictate that nothing else should be in your baby's crib: just the crib, a tight-fitting firm crib mattress, and a tight-fitting crib sheet with no loose or extra fabric. That means no stuffed animals, pillows, blankets, crib bumpers, etc. While you're sure to come across plenty of adorable crib bedding when decorating your nursery, a lone, tight-fitting crib sheet is the only baby bed linen you need for the first year. A Tight Fitting, Fitted Sheet The American Academy of Pediatrics Safe Sleep guidelines [call for](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx) using a tight fitting, fitted sheet in your baby's crib or bassinet. Most (but not all) baby crib sheets have elastic along the entire perimeter of the sheet, not just at the top and bottom, or around the four corners, as with fitted sheets meant for older kids and adults. This 360\u00b0 elastic design is meant to ensure the fitted sheet stays snugly in place while your baby is sleeping. That said, some reputable brands (eg. Pottery Barn Kids) only have elastic at the ends of the sheet. I own crib sheets with both a full perimeter elastic design, and elastic just at the end. In my personal experience and opinion, both have been fine, and have stayed in place well. However, you'll need to ensure your specific sheets fit well (aka: tightly and securely) with your specific crib mattress before letting your baby sleep on them. Sheets that don't fit snugly, or that don't stay put, risk loose fabric gathering near your baby while sleeping, which is hazardous. Before using your new crib sheet with your baby, try it out on the crib mattress, and ensure it fits properly and tightly, and stays put without too much slipping. Pre-washed Cotton Given the importance of a tight fit when it comes to crib sheets, you'll want to buy a sheet that has been pre-washed to minimize shrinkage when it comes time to launder it yourself. Pre-washed sheets also tend to be softer, making for a happier baby, and less irritated baby skin. Cotton in particular is well-suited for crib sheets, as it can stand up to frequent laundering, and organic cotton tends to be more durable due to the way its picked and processed. Mattress Depth While some brands of crib sheet fit up to 9 mattress depth, others are much shallower, fitting a crib mattress depth of only 5. Be sure to check your own crib mattress depth when shopping for a crib sheet to ensure the sheet will fit. I've personally tested some of the sheets included on this list with 4 different crib mattresses I have at Non Toxic Dyes and Inks If you plan to buy a printed crib sheet, look for bedding brands that use water-based, natural and non-toxic dyes, and azo-free dyes in particular. While many organic crib sheet makers choose to highlight the fact that they use non-toxic dyes, not all do, so it's worth checking. Crib sheets that are certified as GOTS or Oeko-Tex have to follow the independent rules and regulations around dyeing - both the dyes used and the process - set by those organizations as safe. If you're concerned, or your baby is particularly sensitive, you might want to consider unprinted, plain white organic crib sheets from either [Naturepedic ](https://shrsl.com/3sbsj)or [Avocado](http://avocadomattress.n5ka.net/GjvDEB). Eco Friendly Choosing organic baby bedding is certainly a step up from conventional cotton and synthetic fibers from an eco friendly and sustainable point of view. However, if you're looking for the best eco crib sheets, consider the packaging as well. Many of the companies I've listed below use fabric packaging for their sheets, instead of plastic or vinyl, which is a huge win in my books! Certifications GOTS - GOTS stands for Global Organic Textile Standard, and it refers to the finished product. That means both the raw inputs (i.e. yarn and fabric; dyes and pigments; etc.) and the processes and techniques used to create that finished product must be compliant. GOTS requires dyes be biodegradable and non toxic [during \"wet processing\" which you can read about here](https://global-standard.org/certification-and-labelling/who-needs-to-be-certified/wet-processing), and has a wide-ranging set of requirements within [their main key features](https://global-standard.org/the-standard/gots-key-features). [OEKO-TEX\u00ae Standard 100 certified: ](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/our-standards/oeko-tex-standard-100)Several of the organic baby crib sheets listed below are OEKO-TEX\u00ae Standard 100 certified. This means every aspect of the sheet has been tested for for harmful substances and found to be harmless for human health, including decorative prints as well as any coatings or fabric finishes used on the finished product. With regards to dyes, OEKO-TEX\u00ae Standard 100 certified crib sheets have had their inputs tested for banned azo dyes, and colorants/pigments that are known to be carcinogenic or allergenic. [MADE SAFE:](https://madesafe.org/) Of the sheets I've included in this list of the best crib sheets, only Naturepedic and Avocado have achieved the MADE SAFE certification. This certification means the product has been made with safe \"ingredients\" and it focuses on safety from both a human health and ecological/environmental point of view. Terms Worth Knowing When Shopping for Crib Bedding If you're struggling to figure out the difference between sateen and percale, brushed cotton and jersey knit - and what it all means for your baby - I've outlined it below. Note, lots of brands don't specify which type of knit or finish they use on their crib sheets. If they do specify, I've listed the brands below as best as I could. Jersey Knit Jersey knit is super soft and has a bit of stretch, which is honestly pretty handy when it comes to stretching a crib sheet over your baby's mattress. My pick for the best crib sheets ever [(Burt's Bees Baby)](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E798E0B1-8D05-4722-A947-72DB314A300D?&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=04cdcefe33ed7ff627a2d48e47e35dbc&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) are jersey knit, and it's no coincidence: the softnesss and the stretch makes them awesome. Other 100% cotton jersey knit sheets I've included on this list include [those from Nestig](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1537362&u=1156891&m=97236&urllink=www%2Enestig%2Ecom%2Fcollections%2Fsheets&afftrack=Bestorganiccribsheets), [Touched by Nature at Target](https://rstyle.me/+gvwqwqg7Xy2wAEW-Pb43xg), and [Natemia Solid Color crib sheets](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/59E9C9D1-F6C7-4447-852A-5F9968929D12?ingress=0&visitId=03fc0fb7-237d-4630-a4cf-8bd5ffa68150&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=3ddee65d25460ea0fc935e3d42f12684&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). Organic Muslin Muslin crib bedding has a larger, more open weave than other types of cotton, so is particularly breathable. Choose an organic cotton muslin crib sheet if you live in a hot climate or want something extra breathable for the summer and warm nights. Brushed Cotton A woven fabric that is brushed during processing to add softness. Also sometimes [known as flannelette](https://linencupboard.co.uk/collections/what-is-brushed-cotton-bedding-why-are-brushed-cotton-sheets-so-warm#:~:text=Brushed%20cotton%20is%20a%20woven,level%20of%20aesthetics%20and%20functionality.). Caring for Organic Crib Sheets While babies love super soft crib sheets, parents and caregivers tend to love products that last a long time, and don't need constant replacements. As it happens, how you choose to care for your baby's crib sheet can achieve both of those goals. Proper care will help keep it soft and extend its lifespan, allowing you to use it well into the toddler years. Almost all of the crib sheet brands I've listed above recommend you use the gentle cycle when (machine) washing your sheets, and washing with like colors. Use eco-friendly and/or gentle/mild detergent to care better for the organic fabric, and choose fragrance free to reduce phthalates in your home. In terms of drying your crib sheet, you can line dry or tumble dry on a low heat setting. If you do use your dryer, remove the crib sheet promptly once the cycle is complete to reduce wrinkles. If needed, iron using low heat. When using a tumble dryer, [don't use dryer sheets for baby bedding and clothes](https://greenactivefamily.com/healthy-home/green-cleaning/dryer-sheets-for-baby-clothes/) - opt for dryer sheet alternatives like Attitude anti-static sheets or natural wool dyer balls. If your crib sheet has stains that require heavier duty treatment, check with the specific brand you're using before using [a baby-safe stain remover](https://greenactivefamily.com/healthy-home/best-stain-remover-for-baby-clothes/) or non-chlorine bleach. Certain pigments or dyes used to print the sheets may require specific care in terms of stain removal. Why Choose Organic for Your Baby's Crib Sheet? While I don't think organic crib sheets are essential, and families shouldn't feel ashamed if they choose not to buy organic, there are some legitimate reasons you might want to choose organic crib sheets. Organic Cotton Sheets are Softer and More Durable Generally speaking, organic cotton crib sheets are softer and more durable than those made from conventional cotton. This comes down to how organic cotton is picked and processed vs the conventional stuff, leaving organic cotton with longer, smoother and stronger fibres. In conventional [cotton harvesting](https://www.fibre2fashion.com/industry-article/3373/organic-cotton-processing), chemical herbicides are applied to the plants to make mechanical picking easier. Both the chemicals and the machine picking can damage the cotton fibers, resulting in shorter cotton fibers than in organic cotton, which tends to be hand-picked, without the use of defoliating chemicals. Those shorter cotton fibres found in conventional cotton products explain why its not as soft or as durable as organic cotton fibres. They're Better for the Environment Conventional cotton (and the pesticides used during growing, and chemicals used during harvesting) is horrendous for the environment. If you'd like to learn more about this, [The Deadly Chemicals in Cotton](https://ejfoundation.org/resources/downloads/the_deadly_chemicals_in_cotton.pdf) is a comprehensive read on the subject. Choosing organic cotton helps to protect workers, eco systems, and our drinking water supplies. There is a Great Selection The demand for organic cotton - and the organic cotton market size - has grown massively since 2017. And organic cotton is no longer completely out of reach, price wise, due to the demand. Now it's easier than ever to choose organic. Frequently Asked Questions Final Thoughts Whether you choose organic crib sheets or conventional, the best crib sheets for your family are ones that fit your crib mattress well, are easy to get on and off, and work without your needs - budget included. Personally, I have both conventional and organic cotton crib sheets, and there are a lot of merits to choosing organic. If you're not as concerned about organic, I encourage you to consider what kind of dyes and inks the company uses, and ensure those are non toxic. My favorite organic crib sheets are [the Burt's Bees brand](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E798E0B1-8D05-4722-A947-72DB314A300D?&linkCode=ll2&tag=greenactive-20&linkId=04cdcefe33ed7ff627a2d48e47e35dbc&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), based on personal experience.
