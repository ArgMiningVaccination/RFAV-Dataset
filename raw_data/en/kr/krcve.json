Rather than looking for a drug to cover up the symptoms, we seek to remove things that stimulate the problem, supplement core building materials needed for health, examine lifestyle habits, personal stressors and needs, and lead the patient to a state of balance and health. The standard American Allopathic medical model was designed to treat acute emergency problems like injuries or infections, and it has done that quite well. But we are now overrun by an epidemic of chronic diseases, weight gain, fatigue, high blood pressure, heart disease and cancer that were rare in earlier times. Dr. Robert P. Goldman and Donna Smyth, P.A. have done extensive reading and have taken many courses from the Jeffrey S. Bland, PhD, originally working with double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling, PhD, began the functional medicine movement over thirty years ago. Dr. Bland's latest book is The Disease Delusion, Conquering the Causes of Chronic Illness for a Healthier, Longer and Happier Life. As a founder of the IFM, Dr. Bland has worked tirelessly to develop the foundations of this paradigm-shifting way of looking at illness. There are a small but growing number of Functional Medicine physicians and other health practitioners helping patients all over the United States and around the world. Functional Medicine is a journey more than a treatment. We see our patients as whole people not just body parts. Everything is connected, and we can't treat the part without balancing the whole. It is a partnership between the patient and our physicians. Holistic Medicine Holistic medicine is inclusive rather than restrictive. Holistic physicians do not reject modern medicine \u2014 they are aware of a broader range of treatments (some used for thousands of years). In ancient times, there have always been men and women who took a special interest in caring for other members of their tribe. Secret formulas using local plants and animals were orally passed down from medicine men or healers containing healing herbs and remedies. One difference between herbal medicine and modern pharmaceutical medicine: Generally, the herbs are gentler, yet more complex. The staff at Georgia Hormones have taken many courses from the American Holistic Medical Association and the American Board of Holistic Medicine. Both organizations have merged and now known as the Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine An inclusive view of patient care is best for guiding our patients to health as safely and gently as possible.
