These recommendations are meant to support public health staff in hepatitis C programs in accordance with the Ontario Public Health Standards and the Sexual Health and Sexually Transmitted Infections Prevention and Control Protocol . This document is also intended for decision -makers who are responsible for program policies and resource allocations (e.g. medical officers of health, associate medical officers of health and program managers). It may also be of interest to other health care providers who work in the field. This document was developed in consideration of the Ontario Hepatitis C Strategy, which was developed by the Ontario Hepatiti s C Task Force and endorsed by the Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care. The Ontario Hepatitis C Strategy is based on information obtained during 13 community consultations held across Ontario with stakeholder representation, including Aboriginal health a nd social services, social service agencies, health care providers, correctional facilities and people living with/affected by the hepatitis C virus. The Ontario Hepatitis C Strategy builds on existing programs and supports new initiatives that focus on he patitis C care and treatment in four key areas: enhanced services and supports; prevention; education and outreach; and better coordination.

Adjusted relative risk A relative risk adjusted for confounding factors. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) A liver enzyme used as a marker to screen for possible acute or chronic liver inflammation. This is a non-specific test; further testing is required to determine the presence of specific hepatitis infections or other liver diseases. Case A person who has been diagnosed with hepatitis C. Case management Appropriate counselling, testing and referral for t reatment for those who are eligible and willing. It also includes contact tracing, as appropriate. Contact A person who has had significant or repeated direct or indirect blood -to- blood exposure to an individual who is newly or chronically infected with hepatitis C; this includes an infant born to an infected mother. Direct exposures (such as sharing injection equipment) carry the highest risk of transmission. Indirect exposures or exposures that may involve only minute quantities of blood (e.g. sexual co ntact or sharing personal -hygiene items) carry a much lower risk. Casual contact, such as shaking hands, speaking with or being in the same room with an infected person does not constitute exposure. Contact tracing The process of identifying relevant con tacts of a person with an infectious disease. The purposes of contact tracing are to ensure that contacts are aware of their exposure, encourage contacts to be tested, and facilitate epidemiological investigation of disease clusters. For blood -borne infect ions (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and hepatitis C), contact tracing involves needle - and drug equipment -sharing contacts, transfusion recipients and those who may have been exposed to blood by other means, as well as those with relevant sexua l exposures. In the case of hepatitis C, this refers to higher -risk sexual exposures involving possible blood contact (see Chapter 3, Modes of Transmission and Infection Risks). Chronic case A person infected with hepatitis C who does not clear the virus within six months. Harm reduction Public health policies, programs and practices intended to reduce the risk of negative consequences associated with specific behaviours. In this document, harm reduction focuses on strategies to decrease the risk of hepat itis C virus transmission. Higher -risk sexual behaviour Sexual practices that may cause bleeding or abrasions, resulting in blood -to- blood contact between participants. Examples may include unprotected anal intercourse, fisting, the use of sex toys, roug h sex, unprotected sex between participants with open lesions from a sexually transmitted infection, sex during menstruation, or unprotected oral sex in the presence of open sores, abrasions or bleeding ulcers from smoking crack (\"crack mouth\"), etc. The risk of infection is also known to be increased among those infected with Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario ix Term Description human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The risk of heterosexual transmission in the absence of the above activities among people who are not infected with HIV is generally thought to be low. HIV/HCV co -infection The coexistence of human immunodeficiency virus and chronic hepatitis C infection in the same person. Index case The first person to be identified with an infection in a disease outbreak or cluster. The index case may or may not have infected others, but he or she represents a starting point for the process of contact tracing. Newly acquired case A person recently infected (within the previous 24 months). Primary case The person who introduces an infection into a group of peop le. The primary case may or may not be the index case. The primary case for a cluster of infections may never become apparent. Safer inhalation (drug use) equipment Pipes, straws etc. used for smoking or snorting drugs. For this document, the focus will b e on equipment used for smoking drugs such as crack and methamphetamine: rubber mouthpieces, stems and brass screens. These are considered \"safer\" because they are less likely to cause cuts, burns or other injuries. Safer use also requires that each person has his/her own equipment and does not share. Alternative equipment, such as medicinal inhalers, car antennae, pop cans, metal pipes, Brillo pads for screens etc. are not considered safer, even if they are not shared, because of the injury risk they pose. Safer injection drug use The administration of injectable drugs in a way that substantially reduces the risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Safer injecting is possible only if hands remain clean. Injec ting equipment (including mixing implements, water and filters) should never be shared, and hands touching the equipment should not be contaminated with blood. Reusing equipment that has been cleaned with bleach is not completely safe and not recommended, as both HIV and hepatitis C are known to have been transmitted despite bleaching. Seroconversion Development of an antibody response to an infectious agent, so that tests of serum that were previously negative are now positive. Sustained virological response (SVR) Undetectable levels of the virus six months after the cessation of hepatitis C therapy. Trace -back period The period prior to diagnosis for which a case is asked to identify contacts for contact tracing. Unsafe injection drug use practices Using previously used needles or other injection equipment (such as cookers, filters, water etc.) that may contain even minute quantities of blood. Sharing of any of these items is considered unsafe. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 1 Executive Summary Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronic infection that is responsible for a significant burden of illness worldwide. In Ontario, it has been associated with the highest burden of any communicable disease. It is therefore essential that the public health res ponse to hepatitis C be as effective as possible. Hepatitis C is a blood -borne infection. It was once related to the receipt of blood or blood products, but since the introduction of blood donor screening, this source of infection has become extremely rar e. The majority of new hepatitis C infections in Canada and other developed countries occur via the sharing injection equipment and other forms of direct or indirect blood -to-blood contact. Preventive measures aimed at minimizing unsterile injections (such as harm -reduction programs that distribute sterile needles and other injection equipment) have been successful in reducing the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but have had less impact on hepatitis C. Nevertheless, they remain impor tant components of the overall response to blood -borne infections. In 2010, 4,512 new cases of hepatitis C were reported in Ontario. Reported cases are either newly acquired or chronic infections that were acquired in the past but have only recently been d iagnosed. Modelled estimates suggest that the true incidence of new cases is increasing slightly. Modelling also suggests that in the absence of effective interventions, a large number of people will experience the sequelae of chronic hepatitis C in the coming years, including cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantati on, as well as many hepatitis C -related deaths. It should be possible to significantly reduce these outcomes by ensuring effective treatment through screening, diagnosis, improved access to treatment initiation and well -managed therapy. New treatments have much higher success rates than older therapies. For surveillance purposes, anyone reported as positive for hepatitis C antibodies is considered to be a case, since he or she has evidence of being infected at some point in the past. However, to effectively counsel cases, determine the need for treatment and prevent further transmission, those who are positive for HCV antibodies must also be tested to determine t he presence of HCV RNA. At least 15 per cent of those who become infected with HCV will spontaneously clear the virus, becoming RNA -negative. These cases will remain antibody -positive but are no longer at risk for transmission and do not require treatment. They can become re -infected with further exposure to HCV, however, and need to be counselled accordingly. The best science to date suggests that cases who are RNA -negative following successful treatment remain antibody -positive but are not infectious; how ever, they are also at risk for re -infection if exposed again. Hepatitis C -infected cases are often at increased risk for other blood -borne infections, such as HIV and hepatitis B, and may also be at risk for sexually transmitted infections because of lif estyle factors. Technical difficulties and data -sharing barriers must be resolved to ensure effective surveillance of co -infections for case management and other program purposes. Since many cases with chronic hepatitis C can be asymptomatic for years and remain unaware of their infection, screening is required to identify these individuals. Public health providers should offer or encourage/facilitate screening for those at risk as a result of the following: Previous or current unsafe injection drug use practices Sharing of intranasal or inhalation equipment Receipt of blood, blood products or organs prior to 1990 Receipt of a tattoo or piercing in a setting where the equipment may not have been sterile Sharing items that may become contaminated with bloo d of a hepatitis C -infected person (e.g. razors, nail clippers or toothbrushes) Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 2 Infection with HIV or hepatitis B High -risk sexual behaviour (i.e. involving potential for blood -to-blood contact) with a hepatitis C case or a current or former injection d rug user Blood -to-blood contact with a person who has hepatitis C, including infants born to mothers with hepatitis C Immigration from high -prevalence countries It is also reasonable to suggest that those at significant ongoing risk be tested at least ann ually. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended general population screening for adults in the 1945 -1965 birth cohort. However, the estimated prevalence of undiagnosed hepatitis C in Canada is substantially lower than in the United States; the appropriateness of this approach for Canada cannot be assumed, but it should be assessed. Public health units have a key role to play in the investigation and management of newly reported hepatitis C cases. As part of the initial in vestigation, all clients should be encouraged to undergo RNA testing (if it has not already been done) to determine whether they have active infection or have cleared the virus (spontaneously or through treatment). Cases infected within the preceding two y ears are the highest priority for follow -up because of the greater opportunity to identify sources of infection and prevent transmission to others. Public health providers should endeavour to find new infections by taking histories and working with the pub lic health laboratory. For newly acquired infections in particular, detailed inquiries should be made about possible exposures, and further investigations should be undertaken if appropriate. Cases should be educated about how to avoid transmission to othe rs, and known contacts who may have had blood -to-blood exposure during the period of infection should be informed and offered testing. Cases should also be assessed for drug and alcohol use and offered counselling, referrals and harm -reduction measures as appropriate. Other needs \u2014 including housing, social support, mental health care etc. \u2014should also be assessed and appropriate referrals offered. Where services are unavailable or unable to meet clients' needs, public health can advocate for service improveme nts. There is also a role for public health, in partnership with local corrections authorities and others, to help to ensure the availability of hepatitis C education, counselling, testing and support for inmates in their jurisdiction. Public health shoul d also work to ensure that inmates being paroled or released to the community have information and referrals related to harm -reduction programs, hepatitis C treatment services and other available supports. There is some evidence to suggest that Aboriginal people have a higher prevalence of hepatitis C, and public health units should seek to ensure effective access to harm -reduction and treatment programs, including appropriate coordination and continuity with federal on -reserve care for Aboriginal people w ho live off - reserve. There is also evidence that street -involved youth are at increased risk for hepatitis C infection. Public health units should assess the availability of services to ensure youth have access to hepatitis C counselling, testing, harm -reduction services and referrals for care and treatment. Public health units should ensure the provision of appropriate immunization for hepatitis A and B to those who meet the criteria for publicly funded vaccines under Ontario's Publicly Funded Immunizati on Schedules, including all cases of hepatitis C. Immunizations are to be provided in accordance with the Canadian Immunization Guide ; please refer to this guide for further informat ion about immunizing individuals with a chronic infection . Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 3 Recommendations SURVEILLANCE AND TESTING (CHAPTER 4) Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care, Public Health Ontario and Local Public Health Units 4.1 Public health units, Public Health Ontario and the Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should use surveillance data to examine the epidemiology of newly acquired hepatitis C infections and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) co -infections; they should use this information to identify possible clusters that require immediate investigation , as well as to identify the need for further prevention measures tailored to the risk factors being reported. Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care and Public Health Ontario 4.2 Public Health Ontario and the Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should work towards making both positive and negative hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) laboratory results reportable to public health (when these are avai lable after a positive antibody result) for surveillance and, where appropriate, case and contact management. 4.3 Public Health Ontario and the Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should divide the surveillance case definition for hepatitis C into more specific ones for newly acquired and chronic cases. Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care 4.4 The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should use surveillance data to plan and evaluate hepatitis C control in Ontario. Public Health Ontario 4.5 Laborato ries undertaking HCV antibody testing should include with each positive test result a recommendation to clinicians to conduct follow -up RNA testing. They should facilitate this by providing a testing form and information. Local Public Health Units 4.6 All hepatitis C cases may benefit from (and should have access to) treatment. Where resources are sufficient, follow -up of all newly reported cases (with collection of risk -factor information) should be undertaken, whether cases are newly acquired or chronic. Where resources are limited, priority should be given to active follow -up of newly acquired cases (those infected within the preceding two years). 4.7 Positive RNA tests after sustained virological response to treatment should be investigated as possible re-infection. 4.8 Public health units and the Public Health Laboratory should work together to improve the identification of newly acquired hepatitis C infections by matching HCV -antibody -positive tests with previous negative tests. 4.9 People infected wit h HIV or hepatitis B should be strongly encouraged to undergo testing for hepatitis C, and vice versa. If not already immunized for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, people with hepatitis C should be encouraged to be appropriately immunized for these, unless co ntraindicated or unnecessary (i.e. already known to be immune to or infected with hepatitis B). 4.10 People who are severely immunocompromised but are potentially chronically infected based on exposures that put them at risk for hepatitis C should have RNA testing, even if antibody testing is negative. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 4 SCREENING (CHAPTER 5) Public Health Ontario 5.1 Research is recommended to determine whether the recent recommendation from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about birth cohort scr eening is applicable in Canada. Local Public Health Units 5.2 Public health units should offer or facilitate access to hepatitis C screening for people at increased risk of infection (see list in Chapter 5). 5.3 Public health units should make specific efforts to offer or facilitate hepatitis C screening to all people at increased risk because of current or former sharing of injection drug use equipment or drug inhalation equipment. Screening may be offered through street outreach and partnership with community agencies or services offering harm -reduction programs. 5.4 Public health units should facilitate access to primary care follow -up for those found to be infected, either on -site at harm -reduction programs or via referral. 5.5 As an essential part of screening, patients must be provided with pre - and post -test counselling about hepatitis C (see Appendix H) so that they understand the reasons for testing and the implications of the results and can provide informed consent. Those who test positive must be given education, the means to prevent transmission to others, information about the availability of treatment, and referral to follow -up care. 5.6 People with ongoing risk of exposure to the hepatitis C virus should be offered counselling and support services to reduce risk behaviour (see Chapters 6 and 7), advised of methods to prevent transmission to others in the event that they do become infected, and encouraged to undergo testing at least annually for hepatitis C. HARM REDUCTION (CHAPTER 6) Local P ublic Health Units 6.1 Public health units should ensure access to harm -reduction programs for injection drug users, including distribution of sterile needles/syringes and drug and injection preparation equipment as supplied by the Ontario Harm Reduction Distribution Program: sterile water in single -use vials, sterile cookers, new filters, sterile alcohol swabs, ascorbic acid and new tourniquets. Harm -reduction programs should not place arbitrary limits on numbers of needles or other supplies provided; ins tead, they should provide supplies according to client need. Clients should not be required to return needles to obtain new ones, but they should be encouraged to do so; given sharps disposal containers; and offered counselling on safe disposal of needles, syringes and other injection drug use equipment. Clients should be specifically educated about the risks of sharing needles, syringes and other drug and injection preparation equipment (such as spoons/cookers, filters, water, swabs and tourniquets) at the time these materials are distributed, and they should be educated about the appropriate use of the equipment. 6.2 Public health units should seek to involve people who are currently using or have previously used drugs (frequently referred to as peers ) to participate in the planning, delivery and evaluation of harm - reduction programs to enhance service relevance and credibility for program users and to develop trust in the community that uses drugs. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 5 6.3 Public health units should incorporate harm -reduction measures in their programming (such as distribution of safer inhalation equipment) for smokers of illegal drugs, particularly crack and methamphetamine. 6.4 Clients with a history of illicit drug use and/or imprisonment should be counselled about their risks and offered testing for HCV, hepatitis B and HIV . CASE MANAGEMENT (CHAPTER 7) Local Public Health Units 7.1 Hepatitis C cases should be investigated to determine the reason for the test (whether the case or the physician suggested testing and for what reason); potential sources/risks for infection (see below); and co-infections with HIV, hepatitis B or other sexually transmitted infections. Testing for RN A should be recommended if not already completed. 7.2 Hepatitis C cases should be offered counselling and testing for HIV and hepatitis B virus. They should also be assessed for their risk of bacterial sexually transmitted infections and offered testing as appropriate. All hepatitis C cases qualify for publicly funded hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations and should be offered appropriate vaccination, either by public health units or via their health care provider. 7.3 Among women, pregnancy status shoul d be determined; specific treatment recommendations exist for pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised to notify their health care provider about their infection and discuss treatment options. They should be educated about testing of their infant t o determine infection status. Testing for hepatitis C RNA in infants should take place on two occasions: between the ages of two and six months and again at 18 to 24 months; HCV antibody should be included with the 18 -24-month test. HCV -positive infants sh ould be referred to a pediatrician. 7.4 History of receiving blood, tissue or organs should be determined to define possible eligibility for compensation. History of donating blood, tissue or organs should be assessed to determine possible requirements for follow -up with recipients. Donation history can also be used to establish timing of prior negative hepatitis C screening to help determine approximate time of infection. 7.5 Education/counselling of cases should be ensured. This should include informat ion about the availability and location of harm -reduction services, if appropriate. Individual public health units will determine how much of this counselling they do and how much clinicians will do. Table 9, Appendix H and the Primary Care Management of Chronic Hepatitis C Professional Desk Reference 2009 can be useful for clinicians who may not have experience counselling hepatitis C cases. 7.6 To the extent possible, determine whether reported cases are newly infected (within the preceding two years), and if they are, what their risk factors are and whether they may be associated with other cases (i.e. a cluster or outbreak). 7.7 Current identifiab le contacts considered at increased risk for infection (suc h as known sharing of drug use equipment or higher -risk sexual behaviour involving blood -to-blood contact) should be offered hepatitis C testing. Because of the low risk of sexual transmission in t he absence of blood -to-blood contact, routine public health contact tracing of low -risk sexual partners is not recommended; it is not an effective use of resources. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 6 7.8 Where there is indication of a cluster of cases, public health units should conduct an investigation appropriate to the circumstances and consider outreach to specific contacts to encourage testing and provide counselling and prevention. PUBLIC EDUCATION AND SOCIAL MARKETING (CHAPTER 8) Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care and Local Publ ic Health Units 8.1 The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care and local public health units should partner to identify means of educating the public about harm reduction and drug use, with the goal of increasing acceptance and reducing stigma and discrim ination. 8.2 The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care and local public health units sh ould partner with the Ministry of Education and local school boards to identify and address gaps in education in secondary schools about blood -borne infections, includin g HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, with attention paid to ensuring understanding of the differences and similarities between these viruses, as well as the availability and role of prevention and treatment for each. Local Public Health Units 8.3 Public he alth units should advocate for measures such as improved access to low -cost housing, healthy food and income support as part of improving the health of people living with hepatitis C and increasing their chances of successfully undergoing treatment. SPECI FIC POPULATIONS (CHAPTER 9) Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care 9.1 The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should attempt to collect data on hepatitis C prevalence, incidence, risk factors and sequelae specific to Aboriginal people (including the rat es and causes of morbidity and mortality from chronic liver disease) to assist in the development of appropriate public health programming. 9.2 The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should work to create policies that address the social determinants o f health to better meet the needs of subpopulations at increased risk for hepatitis C. Local Public Health Units 9.3 Corrections authorities have primary responsibility for the health of inmates. Public health units with correctional facilities, jails o r detention centres in their jurisdiction should determine the availability of hepatitis C education, counselling, testing, support and other resources, and help corrections authorities deliver appropriate services where feasible. They should also work wit h local corrections authorities to help them ensure that inmates being paroled or released into the community are provided with information about and referrals to needle -exchange programs, other harm -reduction programs and other available support services. 9.4 Public health units should seek to ensure effective access to harm -reduction and treatment programs, including appropriate coordination and continuity with federal on -reserve care for Aboriginal people with hepatitis C who are living off -reserve in th eir jurisdiction. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 7 9.5 Public health units should assess the need for and availability of services for street -involved youth in their jurisdiction; ensure access to hepatitis C counselling, testing and harm -reduction services; and facilitate access to care and treatment for those infected with hepatitis C. 9.6 Public health units should work with drug -treatment services in their jurisdiction to ensure access to hepatitis C counselling, testing, care, treatment and support for clients in drug treatment, inclu ding methadone maintenance or detoxification facilities. This should include providing information about the availability and location of harm -reduction services and ensuring provision of hepatitis A and B vaccines as indicated. 9.7 Public health units tha t offer clinical services and hepatitis C counselling and testing may offer counselling and testing to newcomers to Canada who are from highly endemic countries if they have not already been tested, and deliver culturally appropriate counselling and follow -up. Public health units should encourage primary care providers to offer hepatitis C counselling and testing to newcomers to Canada. 9.8 Public health units should offer or facilitate hepatitis C counselling and testing to men who have sex with men who ar e HIV -positive. Counselling should include discussing the high rates of co -infection with hepatitis C and HIV, the higher risk of sexual transmission of hepatitis C to contacts of those who are co -infected, safer sex practices and harm -reduction approaches , as indicated. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 8 Methods This document was developed using multiple evidence sources, including the review and evaluation of evidence from both published and grey literature, as well as expert opinion. Expert opinion took the form of information and documentation about methods used by experienced public health practitioners and information obtained from infectious disease experts. Survey: Hepatitis C Information Needs of Ontario Public Health Staff The Hepatitis C Working Group sought to ensure the re levance of this document conducting a brief online survey distributed to all Ontario public health units (PHUs). The survey instrument is provided in Appendix A. Literature Review To determine the nature and scope of the evidence to be sought from the publ ished and unpublished literature, the Hepatitis C Working Group identified a series of key subject areas related to hepatitis C case and contact management for which evidence was needed. Multiple literature search strategies were developed to address these questions (see Appendix B). The searches were run in various databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, EBSCOhost CINAHL Plus, Academic Search Premier, and in some cases SocINDEX. Each database was searched using database -specific controlled voc abulary, but all searches were supplemented by keyword queries to increase the article recall. Searches covered the years 1950 to 2011, although in a few cases literature up to May 2012 was included. Only English -language abstracts were reviewed. For sele cted topics, the working group also undertook searches of grey literature sources: that is, unpublished sources considered to be relevant and reliable were included as part of the literature review. These were limited primarily to government publications f rom the United Kingdom (U.K.), United States, Canada and Australia. Grey literature was retrieved from Google using synonyms for topic categories, including counselling, testing, best practice guidelines, harm reduction, screening, management and education . For the search on street -involved youth and access to health care, the following strategy was applied: \"(street -involved youth OR homeless youth) (public health OR community health)\". Similarly, the grey literature search on hepatitis C testing and couns elling was retrieved using the following search terms: \"Hepatitis C test* counsel*\". Jurisdictional scans were also conducted. Abstracts of identified published studies were reviewed for relevance, and full reviews were conducted for selected articles. Rel evance was based on whether the study addressed the question being considered and whether the sociocultural setting and health care system in relation to the search question was sufficiently similar to Canada's. Resource limitations did not allow the work ing group to conduct full systematic reviews. Whenever possible, published systematic reviews or other high -quality reviews were used, instead of undertaking a full separate review of primary literature. Where a systematic or other high -quality review was identified, it was supplemented as necessary with studies done since its publication or studies addressing gaps or limitations. Where no reviews were available, the most relevant studies were considered, summarized in table form, and assessed for individua l strength. These studies were assessed for methodological rigour using criteria similar to those published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence public health guidance methods used in the U.K.1 Where relevant, the strength of individual studies is presented using the same approach as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence documents for guidance in public health1: ++, +, or - ratings of internal validity according to the degree of potential for the results to be affected by biases (with \"++\" having the lowest potential for bias and \" -\" having the highest potential for bias), and the same ranking Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 9 system for external validity based on the likelihood that the findings can be applie d in other settings \u2014in this case, Ontario to assess generalizability. The evidence was summarized and presented at Hepatitis C Working Group meetings. Discussion and feedback were incorporated into the relevant chapters, and recommendations were determined by consensus. The evidence and other considerations behind the recommendations are discussed in some detail to help readers understand the basis for each recommendation. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 10 1. Control of Hepatitis C : Overview Hepatitis C is of major public health importa nce in Ontario and worldwide. In Ontario, it is associated with the highest burden of any communicable disease.2 It is a flavivirus, and six different genotypes have been identified so far. Genotypes 1 to 3 have been found worldwide, and are the main genot ypes found in Canada, with genotype 1 predominating. Testing to determine genotype is important, since the effectiveness and length of treatment differ for each. With the evolution of new treatments, genotyping may become less necesssary. There is current ly no vaccine available to prevent hepatitis C; instead, preventing infection relies on preventing exposures and behaviours linked to transmission. Hepatitis C can be successfully treated, but because of the high cost, serious side effects and relatively p rolonged duration of interferon and ribavirin therapy, it is often delayed until there is evidence of liver damage and the benefits of treatment are likely to outweigh the harms. Newer treatments are emerging that have fewer side effects, but they are also very costly. The feasibility of cure means that communicability can be ended with treatment, rendering early treatment desirable from a public health perspective. There is also reason to believe that cure rates are higher in those who are treated early (i .e. during acute infection), with sustained virological response rates of 80 to 98 per cent.3-6 Still, these impressive rates must take into consideration the fact that at least 15 per cent or more of newly infected people will clear the virus without trea tment. It is suggested that treatment be delayed for 8 to 12 weeks after acute hepatitis onset to allow for spontaneous clearing of the virus. Those who have not spontaneously cleared the virus by then will not likely do so without treatment.7 In Ontario, the Health Protection and Promotion Act (HPPA) is the legislation under which diseases of public health importance are designated as reportable, investigated and treated.8 Hepatitis C is a reportable and communicable disease under the HPPA. The HPPA requir es the reporting of diagnosed infections of reportable diseases to local medical officers of health. Reporting of hepatitis C infections allows public health agencies to monitor the disease in the community and tailor prevention and intervention programs t o reduce the risk of infection and transmission. The goal of public health communicable disease programs is two -fold: to prevent harm to the infected individual and his/her potentially infected contacts, and to control the spread of communicable disease at the population level. Disease surveillance and individual case management are primary public health functions. However, to achieve population -level control of hepatitis C, local PHUs must develop and deliver diverse programming aimed at the individual, th e population and the health care system. For example, because a high proportion of prevalent and new cases of hepatitis C are related to illicit drug use, related harm -reduction programs have become common. Population -level strategies that may be applicabl e include education, particularly of young people; social marketing campaigns (e.g. to promote voluntary counselling and testing for those at risk); screening programs; and behaviour change programs targeting higher -risk population groups, including outrea ch and support delivered by peers. A majority of those infected with hepatitis C are asymptomatic for many years. Asymptomatic infected people who do not routinely seek medical care and are not named as contacts may be identified if they have access to screening programs. Screening implies that a health care provider recommends testing to a person who does not request it or exhibit symptoms of the disease. This requires that providers be aware of hepatitis C and who is at risk, and be willing and able to di scuss it with their patients and encourage those at risk to be tested. Screening can be carried out in primary care settings, as well as in health service settings that may see a higher -risk clientele, such as needle -exchange programs; methadone maintenanc e and other drug -treatment programs; correctional facilities; and services for street youth. Key issues for screening programs are how to access hard -to-reach people who are at increased risk of being infected; how to assess the balance of risks and Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 11 benefi ts of screening for healthy asymptomatic individuals; how to ensure adequate resources to address the needs of chronically infected people identified through screening ; and how to initiate and maintain participation in effectively managed treatment program s that can successfully eliminate infection so that cases do not pose a risk to others. Detecting cases can also be promoted by educating the public and/or higher -risk groups to encourage testing, combined with ready access to voluntary counselling and tes ting. The effectiveness of voluntary counselling and testing depends on the degree to which cases accurately perceive themselves to be at risk \u2014particularly if they are asymptomatic \u2014and the degree to which they are willing to be diagnosed and treated. Fear of stigma and discrimination, concern about disclosure to others, denial and lack of perceived benefit can all prevent people at risk from seeking testing. For local PHUs to engage effectively in hepatitis C case management and support behaviour change in cases and contacts, staff require training and quality -assurance measures. Particularly important are training in counselling skills; understanding of diversity and cultural norms; training in harm reduction and understanding of drug use and mental health issues; and opportunities for continuing education and upgrading of knowledge and skills. While the focus of this document is primarily on public health practices such as case management, other levels of intervention are necessary and important. Hepatitis C is a difficult disease to control, because the underlying determinants behind most new infections are related to larger social problems such as poverty; stigma; addiction and mental health; the illicit nature of non -prescription drug use; alcoholism; hom elessness; imprisonment; and other related issues. The multifaceted nature and broad scope of the social determinants of hepatitis C infection mean that public health alone cannot control hepatitis C. Current prevention programs tend to be compartmentalize d and may fail to address, in an integrated manner, the needs of people who have multiple risks and whose needs extend beyond health care to include issues such as adequate housing, adequate income and opportunities for social inclusion and support. The range of interventions likely to be needed to control hepatitis C cuts across government departments and levels of government. In this document, we have limited ourselves to recommendations for hepatitis C control by provincial and local public health auth orities, while at the same time recognizing that the problem is too large to be addressed by public health alone. Public health practitioners may need to advocate for policies and programs that are beyond the scope of individual PHUs. It may also be import ant to expand the resources of local PHUs to allow them to provide needed services, such as more extensive harm -reduction and behaviour - change interventions and more effective outreach programs.

Epidemiology of Hepatitis C in Ontario KEY POINTS There were 4,512 new reports of cases of hepatitis C in Ontario in 2010. With a few exceptions, the main temporal trend has been a relatively steady decline in reported cases since a peak in 1996. Males account for approximately 62 per cent of newly reported ca ses. The average age of newly reported cases is increasing. In the mid -1990s, most newly reported cases were aged 30 to 49. In 2010, the most newly reported cases were aged 50 to 59. Newly reported cases are a combination of newly acquired cases and cases that may have been infected decades ago. True incidence and prevalence are not measured at the population level; they must be estimated from epidemiological models. Estimates of true (versus reported) incidence and prevalence based on epidemiological model s suggest that hepatitis C prevalence is decreasing slightly, while incidence is increasing slightly. Current or former unsafe injection drug use practices account for 54 per cent of prevalent cases and 81 per cent of incident cases. The estimated prevalen ce of hepatitis C in Ontario in 2010 was 0.84 per cent, but there is considerable variability across public health units. The public health units with the highest estimated incidence and prevalence based on modelling are Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & District; Timiskaming; Algoma; and Chatham -Kent. The public health units with the lowest estimated incidence and prevalence based on modelling are Huron County; Perth Wellington -Dufferin - Guelph (table 4). The public health units with the greatest relative increases in hepatitis C prevalence since 2007 are Chatham -Kent, Porcupine, Lambton and Hamilton. The public health units with the greatest relative declines are Renfrew, Halton Region, Halibur ton-Kawartha -Pine Ridge, York Region, Niagara Region and Toronto. Incidence and Prevalence Surveillance of hepatitis C is complicated by several factors that make it difficult to accurately determine current incidence and prevalence in Ontario. First, three terms should be defined: incidence, prevalence and reported incidence . Incidence is the a ctual number of new cases that occur in a given time period, usually one year. Prevalence is the number of people living with chronic hepatitis C infection at a given time. Reported annual incidence is the number of people who test positive for hepatitis C antibody and are reported to PHUs in a given year. True incidence and prevalence are unknown, but they differ from reported incidence for several reasons. It is estimated that approximately one -third of those infected with hepatitis C have never been tes ted and are unaware of their infection,9 leading to an underestimation of incidence and prevalence when based on Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 13 reported cases. Cases that are reported may have been infected decades ago but only diagnosed recently; reported incidence may better reflect c urrent testing intensity rather than current transmission patterns. At the same time, there are factors that may inflate reported incidence and prevalence. For example, the current case definition for hepatitis C requires only a positive antibody test, whi ch indicates only that a person has been exposed to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and has mounted an immune response to it. Many individuals who have received positive antibody tests have not had confirmatory nucleic acid testing to detect the ongoing presen ce of HCV. Studies have shown that anywhere from 15 to 50 per cent (averaging approximately 20 per cent) of antibody -positive people will have cleared the virus spontaneously and should not be counted as prevalent cases. While this may lead to an overestim ate of prevalence, it may also lead to an underestimate of incidence, since a person may acquire and clear the virus several times if exposure is ongoing. For the reasons noted above, true incidence and prevalence must be estimated using epidemiological mo dels. There are two main sources of data used in epidemiological modelling of hepatitis C prevalence and incidence in Ontario. The first is reported incidence data from the Ontario public health system (laboratories and PHUs), and the second is data from r esearch studies of groups at increased risk. The latter can provide a source of information about the extent of testing coverage of higher -risk groups, indicating the extent to which they are included in the laboratory testing data, as well as estimates of hepatitis C prevalence. Most research studies have used antibody testing only, and are therefore subject to the same overestimation problem mentioned above. Modelling methods such as those reported by Dr. Robert Remis include an estimate of the rate of spontaneous clearance of the virus, thereby taking this into account when considering the prevalence of chronic infection and sequelae.10 Reported Incidence In 2010, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care was notified of 4,512 cases of hepatitis C , a rate of 34 cases per 100,000 population. Figure 1 provides an examination of the numbers of cases per 100,000 population reported in Ontario since mandatory reporting of hepatitis C testing came into effect in 1991. This shows a pattern of exponentiall y increasing numbers of positive tests in the early years, reflecting the uptake of testing among the many chronic cases that had accumulated in the population over previous decades, including people who had been infected through blood transfusion prior to the availability of blood donor testing in 1990. A number of federal and provincial compensation programs in the 1990s and into the early 2000s also stimulated additional testing to provide proof of infection or confirm tests done in the early 1990s (owin g to the relatively low specificity of early tests). Since a peak in 1996, the rate of newly reported cases has declined. Ongoing reported incidence continues to represent a combination of chronically and newly infected cases identified via a combination of screening of people at increased risk and presentation of chronic cases to health care providers, who are identifying liver abnormalities and testing for hepatitis C as part of the clinical investigation. Some debate exists about the apparent decline in reported cases in Ontario in 2005 and 2006. It is not clear whether this represented a true decline and subsequent rebound in hepatitis C incidence, or whether there were errors in the surveillance data for that period. We know that a major transition occ urred in 2005 and 2006 as Ontario PHUs moved, on a staggered schedule, from the old Reportable Disease Information System (RDIS) to the new Integrated Public Health Information System. At this time, there is no satisfactory explanation; data for those year s should be interpreted with caution.

These data are subject to change due to data cleaning initiatives and removal of duplicates. Figure 2 identifies rates of confirmed hepatitis C cases per 100,000 population by sex since 1994, and Figure 3 provides the same information by age group. The significantly higher rates seen among males may relate at least in part to the general findin g that approximately two -thirds of injection drug users in North America are male. In countries where a significant proportion of hepatitis C appears to arise from infected transfusions and other medical care with contaminated equipment, the prevalence of hepatitis C rises with age. In Ontario, the highest proportion of confirmed cases appears to be fairly consistent in 40 - to 49 -year -olds. The pattern of increasing prevalence in the 20s, 30s and 40s is consistent with duration of unsafe injection drug use (IDU) practices as a major risk factor, but is complicated by the likelihood that many are being tested only in their 40s and 50s after the onset of serious liver disease symptoms. The pattern of lower rates of confirmed cases in people over age 60 is comp atible with unsafe IDU practices as a major risk factor, since both untreated IDU and untreated hepatitis C may contribute to early morbidity and mortality, and relatively few cases will reach their 60s without being identified. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Confirmed cases of hepatitis C per 100,000 population 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 Number of confirmed hepatitis C cases 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Year Count Rate per 100,000 1991 Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 15 Figure 2: Confirmed cases of hepatitis C by sex for Ontario, 1994 -2010 Source: Ontario Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care, integrated Public Health Information System database, extracted by Public Health Ontario (05/12/2011).

The highest rates are in Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington and Thunder Bay District. This variability is likely related to the presence of higher -risk populations in certain PHUs. For example, the Kingston area is the site of nine federal and provincial correctional facilities, and hepatitis C cases identified therein are counted for statistical purposes as part of the Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington PHU. Approximately 50 per cent of cases attributed to Kings ton, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington are identified in the correctional system (personal communication, van Dijk A, 2012). In contrast, Thunder Bay has the second - highest reported incidence in Ontario , and almost all cases are community -based. Thunder Bay is thought to have a disproportionately large IDU population.

Modelled Incidence and Prevalence Epidemiological modelling has been used to estimate true hepatitis C incidence and prevalence by exposure category, sex, age, PHU and stage of disease. Modelling has also estimated hepatitis C -related morbidity, including trends in serious sequelae.10 Tables 2 and 3 provide estimates of true incidence and prevalence of hepatitis C in Ontario for 2007 to 2011 (personal communication, Remis R, 2012). These estimates indicate that in 2011, 54 per cent of cases were attributed to current or former unsafe IDU practices; 5 per cent to transfusi on; 5 per cent to hemophilia; and 36 per cent to other causes, including unsafe tattooing, unsafe non -injection drug use, unreported unsafe IDU practices, and transfusions and other medical exposures outside Canada by people who have immigrated to Ontario. The modelled true incidence of newly infected cases in Ontario in 2011 was estimated at 3,591, with 2,893 (81 per cent) of these cases in people who inject drugs. Overall, these models estimate that the prevalence of hepatitis C may be declining slightly, while incidence may be increasing slightly.

It is important to note that although modelling predicts five or six incident blood product transmitted cases per year based on possible transmission from window period cases who may donate blood or blood products and test negative, in reality there has not been a reported case of blood product transmission of hepatitis C in Canada since 1997. HCV -antibody donor testing was implemented by Canadian Blood Services and Hema Quebec in 1990, with improved second - and third -generation assays in 1992 and 1996. The addition of HCV nucleic acid testing in 1999 has further reduced the window period.

Using these modelled estimates of true incidence and prevalence, we estimated the true incidence and prevalence of hepatitis C in each Ontario PHU for each year for 2007 to 2010 by multiplying the total modelled incidence and prevalence for Ontario by the proportion of reported incidence reported in each PHU. Since annual reported incidence at the PHU level is subject to year -to-year fluctuations, we then fit Poisson regression models to each PHU's reported incidence from 2007 to 2010 to estimate the 2010 t rue incidence rate and prevalence proportion. These modelled annual incident and prevalent cases, as well as the 2010 incidence rates and prevalence proportions by PHU, are given in Tables 4 and 5.

Modes of Transmission and Infection Risks KEY POINTS The vast majority of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmissions involve blood -to-blood contact. Most new HCV infections in Ontario are related to unsafe injection drug use practices. There is biological and epidemiological evidence for transmission of HCV by non -injection drug use. The strongest evidence for sexual transmission of HCV is among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - positive people, especially HIV -positive men who have sex with men. Most studies of sexual transmission in other populations are of only weak or moderate qua lity, and in general suggest that the risk of sexual transmission is low in the absence of blood -to-blood exposures. No studies are currently available that document hepatitis C incidence in Canadian provincial or federal correctional facilities; however, prevalence is known to be elevated compared to the general population, and there is evidence for higher -risk sharing of drug injection equipment in these settings. Unsterile tattooing and traumatic blood exposures are less well researched but are also like ly to result in HCV exposures during incarceration. Transmission of HCV to health care workers may occur as a result of needle -stick exposures to the blood of an infected patient; there is no evidence of transmission via exposure of intact mucous membranes , but available evidence is not considered sufficient to definitively rule out this possibility; bodies responsible for regulating health professions are developing guidelines for hepatitis C -infected health care workers. Outbreaks of hepatitis C among hem odialysis patients and in personal services settings have been linked to inadequate infection control practices, and guidelines to prevent these have been published. Before the availability of screening tests, blood transfusion and organ transplantation w ere the most common sources of HCV transmission. Some individuals may still be unaware that they are infected, but over time this number is diminishing. Current transmission risk from transfusion is reported to be between 1 per 2.3 million and 1 per 13 mil lion units transfused. Perinatal transmission risk is estimated to be 4 to 7 per cent, but is substantially higher with HIV co - infection. Treatment during pregnancy is limited to specific recommendations due to drug toxicity. Breastfeeding is considered sa fe, but mothers are usually advised to avoid breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked and bleeding. HCV testing is not currently part of routine immigration medical testing in Canada. Immigrants and refugees from countries with a high prevalence of hepat itis C due to unsterile medical injections or other practices should be offered education and screening for hepatitis C; this is especially important for those who are positive for HIV or the hepatitis B antigen. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 28 Background Transmission of hepatitis C occ urs via blood -to-blood contact, including use of contaminated syringes and other injecting equipment; sharing of drug inhalation equipment such as straws and pipes; hemodialysis; and accidental needle -stick exposures among health care workers. Modes of transmission for which the level of risk is less well documented include sexual transmission and transmission by sharing personal ite ms. The weight of evidence supports the occurrence of both types of transmission, but studies suggest that they are uncommon. In determining the risk of sexual transmission, it is necessary to distinguish other concomitant risks. For example, sexual partne rs may also share equipment for the injection or inhalation of drugs, or they may share personal items such as razors or toothbrushes. In developing countries, they may have common exposures to unsterile medical injections or other procedures. Evidence rel ated to these modes of transmission is summarized below and reviewed in more detail in later sections that address prevention and management. Evidence Injection Drug Use A recent systematic review of the global epidemiology of hepatitis C in people who use drugs estimates that 10 million people who use drugs worldwide (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 6.0 -15.2 million) are infected with HCV.12 Prevalence data for anti -HCV were identified for 77 countries, of which 25 had prevalence between 60 and 80 per cent, and 12 had prevalence over 80 per cent. Studies of people actively injecting drugs in Canada have identified the prevalence of HCV antibodies to be from 47 per cent to 88 per cent.13,14 As indicated above, the most common mode of new HCV transmissi ons in Ontario in recent years is unsafe IDU practices.10 There is evidence supporting the effectiveness of distributing sterile injecting equipment (needles/syringes and other materials) in preventing transmission of HIV, making harm -reduction programs a high priority for public health action to prevent HIV.15 Although the evidence for hepatitis C prevention is weaker, there is evidence that harm -reduction programs reduce risky injection behaviour, and this, together with the importance of preventing HIV i n the same population, make harm -reduction programs an important part of HCV prevention efforts (see Chapter 6). Non -injection Drug Use Studies have found an association between sharing inhalation equipment for non -injection drug use and hepatitis C infection among drug users who have no history of injecting.16,17 A systematic review by Scheinmann et al in 2007 also concluded that hepatitis C infection is much more common among non -injection drug users than the general population, but that gaps remain in definitively proving that hepatitis C is transmitted via non -injection drug use.18 Since the Scheinmann review, further evidence has accumulated pointing to elevated prevalence of hepatitis C among drug users who have never injecte d and identifying sharing of devices for smoking or inhaling drugs as a risk factor for hepatitis C.19,20 Since randomized trials to define the level of risk will never be feasible or ethical, and because large cohort studies of non -injection drug users ar e also unlikely because of logistical and cost issues, public health action must be based on this accumulating moderate -quality evidence, together with additional studies demonst rating biological plausibility. There is evidence that HCV is present in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid. Experiments have shown that injection of saliva from an HCV -infected chimpanzee into another chimpanzee caused infection,21 and there is a case report of a human bite from a hepatitis C -infected person resulting in pro ductive hepatitis C infection.22 Furthermore, crack smokers report burns and cuts on their lips when using makeshift inhalation equipment.23 Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 29 There is the potential for contamination of inhalation equipment with blood or serum with these injuries if contami nated drug inhalation equipment is shared; the virus could access the bloodstream of those exposed to contaminated inhalation equipment if they also have burns and/or cuts on their lips. The presence of hepatitis C on used inhalation equipment has been con firmed by a recent Canadian study.24 A literature review table summarizing the studies available on hepatitis C and non -injection drug use is included in Appendix C. Sexual Transmission Studies have suggested that sexual transmission is significantly highe r among men who have sex with men (MSM) than among the general heterosexual population, and that this is linked to co -infections with HIV and/or genital ulcer diseases (particularly syphilis), as well as to specific potentially traumatic practices such as unprotected anal intercourse, fisting and rimming.25-28 Studies that have attempted to examine specific sexual practices in heterosexuals have also suggested links between hepatitis C transmission and co -infection with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), exposure to the menstrual blood of an HCV -positive partner, and vaginal trauma resulting in damage to the mucosa.29 Some studies have identified a correlation between the number of sexual partners a person has and hepatitis C infection. Studies th at show higher frequency of specific exposures or behaviours in those with hepatitis C do not in themselves prove causation, however.30 Some virological studies have attempted to strengthen the evidence by comparing the viral strains of partners and ident ifying the degree of likelihood that they are the same. However, if a common viral strain is identified in partners, it is still possible that they did not infect each other but were instead both infected by a common source; reliable behavioural informatio n is still needed to address this possibility .31 In general, studies of the sexual transmission of hepatitis C should ask detailed questions about sexual behaviour (types of sexual activities, presence of blood, presence of other STIs etc.) and about other potential exposures (sharing of drug use equipment; sharing of personal items with the potential for blood contamination, such as toothbrushes and razors; other potential exposures, such as tattooing, piercing or unsterile medical procedures; receipt of b lood or blood products prior to routine hepatitis C testing or in countries that may lack this testing etc.). Many studies have not collected sufficiently detailed information to demonstrate certainty that infection is attributable to sexual transmission. Even in studies where sexual transmission is likely, the questions may not be sufficiently detailed to elicit the specific types of sexual exposures and the degree of risk involved. A recent major review by Tohme and Holmberg (2010) examined 80 qualifying reports about the evidence for or against sexual transmission of HCV.30 They confirmed increased risk among people with multiple sexual partners (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.2 to 2.9 in selected studies), but identified potential confounding due to the inc reased likelihood of IDU with a higher number of sexual partners. Based on the review, the authors found that women infected with HIV or other STIs had an aOR range for HCV infection of 1.9 to 2.7, while HIV - infected MSM had an aOR of 4.1 to 5.7. Risk of t ransmission in the latter was increased by mucosal trauma (e.g. related to fisting or use of sex toys) and by the presence of genital ulcer disease. Table 8 reviews the strengths and weaknesses of study designs used to investigate sexual transmission of hepatitis C. A detailed review of studies investigating the sexual transmission of hepatitis C is included in Appendix D. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 30 Table 8: Strengths an d weaknesses of study methods used to examine sexual transmission of HCV Methods Strengths Weaknesses Case investigations of HCV - positive cases Can focus on cases without an obvious risk factor (for example no known blood - borne exposures) May be less selection bias if all cases are investigated Potential for public health to investigate more cases than in a single clinical setting Misattribution is quite likely in at least some cases Cases may deny unsafe IDU practices due to stigma Cases may fail to recall potential blood exposures Cases may be unaware of some exposures, such as contaminated medical equipment Cohort studies of sexual partners of HCV -positive cases Focus is on those with relevant sexual exposure Sexual partners may also share drug use equipment or personal items, such as razors and toothbrushes Studies may not ask sufficiently detailed questions to be sure that sexual exposure has occurred, and to capture the nature and extent of the sexual behaviours Prevalence studies of hepatitis C in groups thought to be at increased risk for sexual exposure (e.g. sex work ers, STI clinic patients, HIV -positive patients) Could help to identify specific risks for sexual transmission (e.g. infection with STIs or HIV) Groups being studied may have other risk factors (e.g. sharing of drug use equipment) Unclear if findings are g eneralizable to other sexual partners without STIs, HIV etc. Virological studies confirming HCV in semen/spermatozoa of some chronically infected men Supports biological plausibility of sexual transmission Do not prove infectivity of HCV identified; require large epidemiological studies to prove link between HCV in semen/spermatozoa and sexual transmission Do not address the question of whether exposure to bloodstream of partner is required to transmit infection Virological studies confirming similar ity of viruses in HCV -positive sexual partners Confirms likelihood of one partner having infected the other, or both infected from common source Do not prove route of transmission was sexual; do not rule out infection from a common source (e.g. through sha ring drug use equipment, receiving medical injections or other services from a common source etc.) HCV, hepatitis C virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IDU, injection drug use; STI, sexually transmitted infection. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 31 Incarceration People who use illegal drugs are at elevated risk for incarceration due to drug -related activities such as trafficking, convictions related to sex work, or property crimes to acquire money for drug purchase. In Ontario provincial correctional facilities, inmates serve se ntences of less than two years, and frequently their period of incarceration is quite brief, so that they are less likely to inject drugs while in custody than federal inmates, who are generally serving much longer sentences. Two studies examined HIV and h epatitis C among inmates in provincial detention in Ontario and in Quebec. In the Ontario study, 30 per cent of adult inmates self -reported a history of IDU.32 Overall, the prevalence of hepatitis C was 16 per cent among men and 30 per cent among women, bu t it was much higher among those who reported IDU (54.7 per cent). In the Quebec study, 28 per cent of men and 43 per cent of women reported a history of IDU.33 Similar to the Ontario study, the prevalence of hepatitis C was much higher among those who rep orted a history of IDU compared to those who did not. For men, the prevalence of hepatitis C was 16.6 per cent among non -injection drug users and 53.3 per cent among injection drug users. For women, the prevalence of hepatitis C was 29.2 per cent among non -injection drug users and 63.6 per cent among injection drug users. Even those who reported no IDU had markedly higher hepatitis C prevalence than would be expected in a general population sample. Inmates in federal institutions likely have an even higher rate of problematic substance use, estimated at 70 to 80 per cent,34 but this estimate includes alcohol problems, and therefore does not provide an explicit estimate of risk related to the injection or inhalation of illicit drugs. IDU may be more common in federal than provincial facilities because inmates have longer sentences, making the desire to use drugs and opportunities to make the necessary contacts more likely. The same source provides somewhat outdated data from a 1995 -1997 intake survey, indicati ng that 18 per cent of federal inmates self -report IDU prior to incarceration, and a 1995 federal inmate survey reporting that 11 per cent of a sample of male inmates reported injecting during their incarceration. Given that the surveys were conducted by c orrectional authorities, there is a possibility for under -reporting, as a result of selection bias (i.e. who is willing to respond) or concern about providing information that might lead to negative responses from authorities. Despite the limited data from the correctional system, the relatively high prevalence of hepatitis C among injection drug users in the community, together with the data from the Ontario and Quebec studies noted above, makes it reasonable to assume that hepatitis C prevalence in correc tional facilities is much higher than in the general population. No data are currently available on the incidence of hepatitis C in Canadian correctional facilities, but there is evidence of risk behaviours likely to transmit hepatitis C in the context of a relatively high prevalent population. Studies have shown that people who were injecting drugs prior to incarceration inject less frequently in correctional facilities, but when they do inject, there is a high probability of injecting with used equipment, including makeshift equipment with a higher risk of blood contamination.34 Although bleach has been made available in Canadian federal correctional facilities since the mid -1990s, there are currently no needle -exchange programs, despite their proven effic acy in the community and in correctional facilities in Europe and Central Asia.35 Current standards of practice recommend that bleach not be used except where provision of sterile needles is not feasible, since it may not reliably eliminate blood -borne inf ections, especially HCV.36 Furthermore, World Health Organization (WHO) standards for correctional facility health clearly state that inmates must be provided with the same standards of health care that are available in the community,37 which in Canada inc ludes access to sterile injecting equipment as provided by needle -exchange services. Although not extensively researched, tattooing is widespread in correctional facilities and thought to carry risks for hepatitis C transmission in the absence of safe tatt ooing equipment and techniques. A pilot program to provide safe tattooing materials in federal correctional facilities was undertaken in 2005; however, the program was discontinued prior to dissemination of the evaluation, even though it was subsequently r eported that the evaluation supported the effectiveness and even the cost -effectiveness of the program. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 32 Blood -to-blood contact may also occur in correctional facility settings in the context of fights and other forms of violence, but there is very little r esearch on the degree of risk for hepatitis C, that may be associated with this aspect of correctional facility life. Occupational Exposure Studies suggest that health care workers are at risk for hepatitis C when they sustain needle -stick injuries involvi ng blood from hepatitis C carriers.38,39 There is no evidence for transmission via exposure of intact mucous membranes to blood or blood products, but current evidence does not allow a definitive statement that such transmission is not possible. Guidelines for the management of parenteral exposures to HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C have been produced by Health Canada and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).39,40 These guidelines state that immunoglobulin and antiviral agents (e.g. i nterferon with or without ribavirin) are not recommended for post -exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis C. Instead, they recommend that the hepatitis C status of the source and the exposed person be determined, and for health care workers exposed to a hepatiti s C-positive source, that follow -up hepatitis C testing be performed to determine if infection develops. The average interval between occupational exposure and seroconversion is six to seven weeks, but it may vary from two to 26 weeks.41 Should seroconvers ion occur, there is a high success rate in treatment of newly acquired hepatitis C4,6,7; treatment should be considered in this situation. Dialysis A recent review of health care -associated hepatitis B and hepatitis C transmission from 1998 to 2008 reported by the CDC identified six hemodialysis -associated outbreaks of hepatitis C involving 40 incident cases among 490 people potentially at risk.42 Studies have suggested that increased risk for hepatitis C in hemodialysis patients is mainly related to problems with infection control practices, and methods to avoid such infections have been published.43,44 Blood Transfusion and Organ Transplants Before the introduction of effective screening tests for hepatitis C, blood transfusions and organ transplant s carried significant risks of transmitting infection. Some individuals living in Canada may have become infected with hepatitis C via a blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1990 and still remain unaware of their infection, but over time this numbe r has been significantly reduced. Current screening tests have greatly lowered the risk of hepatitis C transmission via blood transfusion or organ transplant in Canada. A recent publication reported that the risk of contracting hepatitis C from a blood tra nsfusion in Canada is between 1 per 2.3 million and 1 per 13 million units transfused.45 Perinatal Transmission Hepatitis C can be transmitted from infected pregnant women to their newborns. Rates of transmission are likely to vary depending on maternal vi ral load, the presence of co -infections such as HIV, and the mode of delivery. Generally, rates of mother -to-child transmission are reported to be 4 to 7 per cent, and it is recommended that all infants born to hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) -positive m others be tested for hepatitis C RNA on two occasions: at two and six months and again at 18 to 24 months; HCV antibody testing should be included with the 18 - to 24 -month test.46 Rates of hepatitis C transmission from mothers co -infected with hepatitis C and HIV may be two to five times higher than from those with hepatitis C alone.46 Elective cesarean delivery is not recommended for women with chronic hepatitis C infection alone, and treatment to prevent transmission is limited due to the fetal toxicity o f some currently available medications for hepatitis C.46-47 Infants found to be infected with HCV should be referred to a pediatrician. There is no evidence that hepatitis C is present in breast milk or transmitted through breastfeeding. Hepatitis C-posit ive mothers who are known to be HIV -negative can be advised to breastfeed their infants, although it might be wise for mothers to abstain from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked and bleeding.47-49 Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 33 Immigration from Countries with High Hepatitis C Pr evalence Worldwide, an estimated 170 million people are infected with hepatitis C; it is among the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Unsafe injections and other medical procedures received in official health care settings, or via r ituals and alternative practitioners are believed to be the most important risk factors for hepatitis C in many countries, particularly where IDU is believed to be uncommon.50 People living in Canada who may have been exposed to hepatitis C may be at incre ased risk for chronic hepatitis C infection and are candidates for screening or case finding. Screening for hepatitis C is not currently required as part of immigration or refugee medical assessments. Other mechanisms are required to inform newcomers about potential risks and provide them with access to hepatitis C counselling, testing and education. Newcomers with HIV or chronic hepatitis B infections must be offered hepatitis C testing and care, since co -infection with hepatitis C and HIV or hepatitis B h as a much worse prognosis and is more difficult to treat than hepatitis C, HIV or hepatitis B alone. Public health can play an important role in facilitating screening for hepatitis C among newcomers to Canada. Ensuring local health practitioners have appr opriate education and are aware of the importance of hepatitis C screening among immigrants is an important component of programming. Outreach programming focused on individuals from highly endemic countries is also an important component of comprehensive care. Cofactors/Risk Factors for Disease Progression Most morbidity and mortality arising from hepatitis C occurs as a result of chronic infection that leads to cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. A number of cofactors incr ease the likelihood of such progression; some, including male sex and older age,51 are non -modifiable, but public health can play a role in reducing risk factors that are modifiable. Co -infection with hepatitis A or hepatit is B can accelerate hepatitis C -related liver disease;51 all hepatitis C cases qualify for publicly funded hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination and should be offered appropriate vaccination. In addition, excessive alcohol consumption has been strongly linked to liver disease in people with hepatitis C. 52 Public education and individual counselling about hepatitis C infection should include information about the need to reduce alcohol consumption; referral for alcohol treatment should be available for those who have problems reducing he avy drinking. The degree of impact of low to moderate alcohol consumption and appropriate interventions are less clear. Research in the U.S. published in 2007 found that physician messages are frequently ambiguous for patients who consume alcohol but who a re not dependent or problem drinkers.53 Current practice in Ontario would suggest that clients be advised to ensure alcohol intake is less than one standard drink per day, but complete abstention may be the safest course for those who are able. Some evidence suggests that daily cannabis use is associated with moderate to severe liver fibrosis, and it has been recommended that people with chronic hepatitis C infection reduce or abstain from marijuana use.54 At the same time, there is also research show ing benefit from the use of oral cannabinoids to reduce hepatitis C treatment -related symptoms that contribute to weight loss.55 Cigarette smoking is considered to increase the risk for progression of chronic hepatitis C infection,56 and the International Agency for Research on Cancer has declared smoking to be a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma.57 A recent review of the risks of alcohol, marijuana and tobacco for the progression of hepatitis C states that patients should be informed of the deleter ious effects of all three and offered appropriate supports towards abstinence.56 There is some relatively weak evidence that coffee may be beneficial in lowering the risk of death from hepatoce llular carcinoma in hepatitis C -positive patients, but not all studies have demonstrated this effect, likely due to confounding factors.58 Another potentially modifiable risk factor for progression of hepatitis C is obesity and non -alcoholic fatty liver. Several reviews have suggested that insulin resistance and the m etabolic syndrome accelerate fibrosis in Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 34 chronic hepatitis C patients and may reduce rates of successful treatment.59 As a result, weight reduction in an effort to improve insulin response may reduce the rate of development of fibrosis and improve treatmen t response, although further evidence of efficacy is needed.59-64 People with hepatitis C who are infected with HIV are also at risk for more rapid development of severe liver disease. Evidence suggests that MSM with HIV are more likely to become infected with hepatitis C via sexual transmission than those who are HIV -negative.26-28,65,66 Users of injection drugs are at increased risk of being infected with hepatitis C and HIV, because sharing of injection equipment is a major risk factor for both.67 People with either of these infections should be tested for the other, as well as for chronic hepatitis B infection (see recommendation 4.9 ). Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 35 4. Surveillance and Testing RECOMMENDATIONS Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care, Public Health Ontario and Local Public Health Units 4.1 Public health units, Public Health Ontario and the Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should use surveillance data to examine the epidemiology of newly acquired hepatitis C infections and human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) co -infections; they should use this information to identify possible clusters that require immediate investigation, as well as to identify the need for further prevention measures tailored to the risk factors bein g reported. Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care and Public Health Ontario 4.2 Public Health Ontario and the Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should work towards making both positive and negative hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) laboratory result s reportable to public health (when these are available after a positive antibody result) for surveillance and, where appropriate, case and contact management. 4.3 Public Health Ontario and the Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should divide the surve illance case definition for hepatitis C into more specific ones for newly acquired and chronic cases. Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care 4.4 The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should use surveillance data to plan and evaluate hepatitis C contr ol in Ontario. Public Health Ontario 4.5 Laboratories undertaking HCV antibody testing should include with each positive test result a recommendation to clinicians to conduct follow -up RNA testing. They should facilitate this by providing a testing form and information. Local Public Health Units 4.6 All hepatitis C cases may benefit from (and should have access to) treatment. Where resources are sufficient, follow -up of all newly reported cases of hepatitis C (with collection of risk -factor information) should be undertaken, whether cases are newly acquired or chronic. Where resources are limited, priority should be given to active follow -up of newly acquired cases (those infected within the preceding two years). 4.7 Positive RNA tests after sustained vi rological response to treatment should be investigated as possible re-infection. 4.8 Public health units and the Public Health Laboratory should work together to improve the identification of newly acquired hepatitis C infections by matching HCV -antibody -positive tests with previous negative tests. 4.9 People infected with HIV or hepatitis B should be strongly encouraged to undergo testing for hepatitis C, and vice versa. If not already immunized for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, people with hepatitis C Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 36 shou ld be encouraged to be appropriately immunized for these, unless contraindicated or unnecessary (i.e. already known to be immune to or infected with hepatitis B). 4.10 People who are severely immunocompromised but are potentially chronically infected based on exposures that put them at risk for hepatitis C should have RNA testing, even if antibody testing is negative. KEY POINTS Technical difficulties and data -sharing barriers must be resolved so that surveillance of co -infections (e.g. with HIV, hepatitis B virus and/or STIs) can allow effective case management of co -infected individuals and evaluation and resource allocation for hepatitis C prevention programs. The identification of cases with HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) is needed to determine chronic infec tion and risk of transmission to others. The ability to distinguish between chronic and newly acquired cases among HCV test reports is important for prevention and control efforts. People with the HCV antibody but confirmed negative for RNA (two negative RNA results within six months), whether through treatment or spontaneous clearing, can be considered resolved cases and are no longer infectious to others, but remain at risk for re -infection if exposed again. Surveillance data should be analyzed effectiv ely at both the local PHU and provincial levels to evaluate hepatitis C programs and direct resources most effectively. Surveillance should include identifying and quantifying the extent of co -infections with HIV and HCV. Co -infections with HIV and HCV are very serious health problems, since each infection complicates the other and makes successful treatment more difficult and serious illness more likely. Co -infections are also likely to be an important marker for higher -risk behaviours in affected populati ons, primarily people who use drugs and some MSM.

Users of this document should check this source regularly for updates. To make hepatitis C surveillance data more specific, meaningful and adaptable for different prevention and control purposes, the Hepatitis C Working Group proposed that the case definition for hepatitis C in Ontario distinguish between newly acquired and chronic infections. This is consistent with hepatitis C case definitions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.68,69,70 It is also consistent with a 1999 Canadian recommendation by the Expert Working Group for Strain and Laboratory Surveillance of HCV.71 The recommended newly acquir ed and chronic hepatitis C case definitions for Ontario, as well as the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), U.S., U.K. and Australian case definitions, can be found in Appendix E. Any change in the hepatitis C case definitions for Ontario should conside r the PHAC definition to ensure compatibility. 72 The recommended new case definitions, separated into newly acquired and chronic or unspecified (above and in Appendix E), are compatible with the PHAC case definition in that the sum of the newly acquired a nd chronic or unspecified cases should be the appropriate cases to report to PHAC under the undifferentiated hepatitis C case definition. Ontario's current use of hepatitis C antibody positivity for surveillance provides a very broad case definition that will include both newly acquired and chronic cases, as well as those who have been infected in the past but have cleared the virus and are not chronically infected. It is vital to encourage those with positive anti -HCV tests to also undergo HCV RNA testing and determine if they are chronically infected. Measurement of the number of people with HCV RNA indicating chronic infection will help define future health care needs and 124 months was chosen because it is more inclusive, more feasible and will ensure that acute cases in Ontario are relatively robust compared to considering a 12 -month time p eriod. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 38 transmission risk in the population. Based on the best available science, those who are positive for the HCV antibody but negative for RNA based on two tests done six months apart (whether through treatment or spontaneous clearing) are considered to no longer have active hepatitis C, although they remain at risk for re - infection. From a prevention and control perspective, it would be valuable to distinguish between newly acquired and chronic infections and to measure the number of newly acquired infections reported each year, since this would allow for investigation of current clusters o f disease and risk of transmission. It would also improve surveillance and evaluation of prevention and case management activities. Furthermore, newly acquired cases have been shown to have a better response to treatment.73 Recent evidence suggests that ne wly acquired asymptomatic cases are unlikely to clear spontaneously and should be considered for treatment without delay, while a higher proportion of acute symptomatic cases (many of whom are injection drug users) may clear the virus spontaneously; 74 it may be reasonable to delay treatment for a few weeks in this group to avoid unnecessary treatment. It should be noted, however, that distinguishing newly infected cases from chronic cases will still not lead to a measure of true incidence, since the major ity of newly infected cases are asymptomatic and may not seek clinical care and testing. Mathematical modelling will still be needed to estimate the true incidence of new hepatitis C cases. Encouraging those with ongoing higher -risk behaviour to be tested at least once per year will increase the likelihood of identifying incident cases. For those who undergo testing and are confirmed to be antibody -positive, the first step at both the provincial and PHU levels should be to look for previous positive tests in the same individual. Individuals with previous positive tests can be considered to not have a newly acquired infection, and if they have been reported in the Integrated Public Health Information System before, they do not require repeat investigation. I t may be appropriate to confirm that they have received previous counselling, however (see Chapter 7). For those with no previous positive tests, the Public Health Laboratory (and ideally all laboratories) should try to match the positive test with the mos t recent negative test if one exists. This gives evidence for when the individual became infected. If this period is less than two years, more intensive efforts should be made to obtain risk - factor information and ensure access to medical care. If an antib ody-positive individual has previously donated blood without being notified of a blood -borne infection, this too can help to define a time when he/she was HCV -negative. People who are antibody -positive should be asked about symptoms compatible with hepatit is C in the preceding two years, including jaundice, dark urine and abdominal pain, which may indicate acute infection; testing for acute hepatitis A and B could help rule out these infections as causes of the symptoms. When no previous negative test or re cent symptoms compatible with hepatitis C can be identified, the presence of recent risk behaviour (see Chapter 3) does not prove that the case represents newly acquired infection, but it does increase concern about possible transmission to and/or from a p ositive case and requires more intensive investigation and case management (see Chapter 7). Appendices F and G provide information about the laboratory testing algorithm and specimen collection for hepatitis C currently used in Ontario (at the time of publ ication). Readers should check regularly for updates from the laboratory. Public Health Data Collection from Cases The highest priority for public health data collection should be cases who are newly infected (within the last 24 months). For surveillance purposes, after determining that the case has not been previously reported, the key data to be collected are demographic characteristics (age, sex and race, including Aboriginal status) and risks for hepatitis C infection. The risks to be assessed have bee n reviewed and draft definitions developed. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 39 The CDC has recently proposed a hepatitis C case reporting form (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/PDFs/vhsp02.pdf ).75 Based on the Ontario context, where a time frame is specified, we recommend that the maximum duration for risk -factor reporting in acute cases be 24 months and the minimum duration be from the last negative result. The CDC proposes the following risk factors, which can also be considered in the Ontario context:75 Contact of a hepatitis C case since the last known negative result or 24 months (sexual contact, household/non -sexual contact, other) Number of sexual partners since last known negative result or 24 months (men and women) Ever havin g a sexually transmitted disease, and year of most recent treatment Injection or non -injection drug use since last known negative result or 24 months Health care exposures and other parenteral exposures since last known negative result or 24 months: hemodi alysis; accidental needle -stick injury or puncture with blood -contaminated object; transfusion; outpatient intravenous infusion or injection; or any other exposures to someone else's blood Employment since last known negative result or 24 months as a health care worker (medical or dental) and contact with human blood Employment since last known negative result or 24 months as a public safety worker (e.g. firefighter, law enforcement or correctional officer) and direct contact with human blood Receipt of a tattoo since last known negative result or 24 months in a commercial facility, a correctional facility or other Body piercing (other than ear) since last known negative result or 24 months in a commercial facility, a correctional facility or other Dental work or oral surgery since last known negative result or 24 months Surgery (other than oral) since last known negative result or 24 months Hospitalization, residence in a long -term care facility or incarceration (correctional facility, jail or juve nile facility) since last known negative result or 24 months Ever having been incarcerated for longer than six months For chronic or resolved cases, the following risk factors are recommended for reporting: Blood transfusion or organ transplant prior to 1990 Receipt of clotting factor concentrates prior to 1987 Ever on long -term hemodialysis Ever injected drugs Approximate number of lifetime sexual partners Ever incarcerated Ever treated for an STI Ever a contact of someone with hepatitis (sexual, househo ld, other) Ever employed in a medical or dental field involving direct contact with human blood For some of the risk factors above \u2014such as number of sexual partners or incarceration \u2014the risk factor may be a marker for other unmeasured sources of increased risk (such as blood exposures during risky sexual practices or during fights in correctional facility settings). Case and contact follow -up based on relevant risk factors is discussed further in Chapter 7. For surveillance of HIV/HCV co -infections to be e ffective, PHUs must have access to the necessary data. No barriers currently exist in data sharing for individual case management (i.e. other diagnoses on a named case can be identified), but it is not possible to do effective surveillance examining all ca ses of co -infections, since Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 40 the data can be accessed only on a case -by-case basis at present. For PHUs to estimate the prevalence of co - infections in their area, the public health information system's reporting sub -system has to allow for querying of multi ple diagnoses across PHU areas. Co -infections are especially an issue for those with long -standing chronic infections, such as HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B. PHUs and Public Health Ontario should work together to remove barriers to data sharing and addr ess technical difficulties in the surveillance of co - infections in current and future public health information systems. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 41 5. Screening RECOMMENDATIONS Public Health Ontario 5.1 Research is recommended to determine whether the recent recommendation from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about birth cohort screening is applicable in Canada. Local Public Health Units 5.2 Public health units should offer or facilitate access to hepatitis C screening for people at increased risk of infection (see Screening in Public Health Settings). 5.3 Public health units should make specific efforts to offer or facilitate hepatitis C screening to all people at increased risk because of current or former sharing of injection drug use equipment o r drug inhalation equipment. Screening may be offered through street outreach and partnership with community agencies or services offering harm -reduction programs. 5.4 Public health units should facilitate access to primary care follow -up for those found t o be infected, either on-site at harm -reduction programs or via referral. 5.5 As an essential part of screening, patients must be provided with pre - and post -test counselling about hepatitis C (see Appendix H) so that they understand the reasons for testing and the implications of the results and can provide informed consent. Those who test positive must be given education, the means to prevent transmission to others, information about the availability of treatment, and referral to follow -up care. 5.6 People with ongoing risk of exposure to the hepatitis C virus should be offered counselling and support services to reduce risk behaviour (see Chapters 6 and 7), advised of methods to prevent transmission to others in the event that they do become infecte d, and should be encouraged to undergo testing at least annually for hepatitis C. KEY POINTS PHUs should offer screening to clients with hepatitis C risk factors, either directly or by referral. Although there are currently no specific recommendations abo ut the frequency of screening for people with ongoing risk exposures (e.g. sharing of drug use equipment), it is reasonable to encourage testing at least annually. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended a single screen ing during routine primary care of all members of the cohort born between 1945 and 1965 as cost - effective, based on elevated prevalence in this age group and the many undiagnosed cases estimated in the United States. Because Canada has a lower estimated pr evalence of undiagnosed hepatitis C infections, it is not clear whether the same recommendation should apply in Canada. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 42 Published Guidelines About Screening Screening refers to the identification of unrecognized disease in those who are asymptomatic and no t actively seeking medical care for symptomatic illness. Canadian clinical practice guidelines recommend testing for hepatitis C as part of the investigations of people with evidence of possible chronic liver disease, such as abnormal alanine aminotransfer ase (ALT) levels,76 but this would be considered case finding, not screening. The same guidelines recommend the testing of people with risk factors, defined as prior IDU, even if remote and only occasional; transfusion of blood products prior to 1990; and immigration from countries with high prevalence rates of hepatitis C. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) conducted a review of hepatitis C screening in 2004 (see below) and recommended against screening of the general population (Grade D), co ncluding that the potential harms of screening adults who were not at elevated risk for hepatitis C infection outweighed the potential benefits.77 This conclusion was drawn using a previous population -based survey estimate that the prevalence of hepatitis C in the general U.S. population was about 2 per cent (1.8 per cent in the general population, 2.3 per cent in adults over 20)78\u2014substantially higher than the reported general population prevalence in Canada of 0.8 per cent.79 The same review concluded tha t there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation one way or the other for screening in higher -risk populations (such as injection drug users), because there was insufficient evidence for the long -term benefit of treatment in preventing severe seq uelae, and about the potential harms from screening. The World Health Organization released guidelines for the screening, care and treatment of people with hepatitis C infection in low - and middle -income countries and recommended screening (based on modera te-quality evidence) in individuals who are a part of a population with high prevalence of HCV or who have a history of high -risk behaviour.80 The USPSTF recommendations differ from those of the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Pa nel, both cited by the USPSTF.77 Both the CDC and the NIH recommend screening of groups at increased risk, but with somewhat different definitions of increased risk.77 Both recommend screening injection drug users, hemodialysis patients and recipients of o rgan transplants or blood transfusions (CDC before 1992, NIH before 1990). In addition, the NIH panel recommends screening of individuals with multiple sexual partners; spouses or household contacts of HCV -infected people; and those who share instruments f or intranasal cocaine use. The CDC recommends screening for children born to mothers infected with hepatitis C; those who received clotting factor concentrates before 1987; those with occupational exposure to HCV - positive blood; and patients with persisten tly abnormal ALT levels, indicative of possible chronic liver disease. The CDC now recommends that individuals in the 1945 to 1965 birth cohort also be screened for HCV once during routine primary care.81 Other groups identified by the CDC for whom routine screening is uncertain include recipients of transplanted tissue, those who use intranasal cocaine and other non -injection illegal drugs, those with a history of tattooing or body piercing, those with a history of multiple sex partners or STIs, and long -term steady partners of people with hepatitis C. A Canadian consensus meeting in 2007 suggested that approximately 35 per cent of HCV -infected people in Canada do not know they are infected, and it recommended that programs be established to identify these people so they can be offered curative therapy and/or lifestyle modification.82 It is a principle of screening programs that if they are to be established, resources must be available to offer counselling and other care or treatment services to those who a re found to be infected. Therefore, public health authorities need to consider what information and resources are available for those who might participate in screening programs, and to balance the financial and human resources required for screening with other potential uses of the resources. For example, offering hepatitis C screening as part of comprehensive harm -reduction and primary care services for injection drug users is likely to be more cost -effective than general population screening. The Public Health Agency of Canada provides a comprehensive Primary Care Management of Chronic Hepatitis C Professional Desk Reference that gives primary care p ractitioners with a detailed overview of those at risk of Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 43 hepatitis C who should be screened, in addition to further information on laboratory results interpretation and counselling.83 Cost -Effectiveness of Screening Appendix I provides a summary of the literature reviewed with respect to the cost -effectiveness of screening for hepatitis C. The major benefit usually ascribed to screening is the opportunity for treatment and cure of hepatitis C, so that significant future morbidity and mo rtality from chronic hepatitis \u2014as well as health care costs such as care for decompensated cirrhosis and liver transplantation \u2014can be averted. However, those who do not want to undergo treatment, do not respond to treatment or are ineligible for treatment may still benefit from screening for hepatocellular carcinoma, vaccination for hepatitis A and/or B, and lifestyle modifications such as reduced or eliminated use of alcohol.84 No published cost -effectiveness studies on hepatitis C population screening in Canadian settings had been identified as of May 2012. Screening of blood or organ donors was not considered relevant for this review, which focused on public health screening programs. Three recent cost -effectiveness studies from the United States,81,85,86 using somewhat different methodologies, all concluded that in the U.S. context \u2014with an estimated population prevalence of 1.8 per cent or more, highest in the cohort born between 1945 and 1965 \u2014screening of the 1945 -1965 birth cohort in primary care settin gs, and possibly all adults aged 20 to 70, would be cost -effective. This is based on an estimate that approximately 50 to 75 per cent of infected adults have not been tested and do not know their infection status.81 One of the key issues in determining the applicability of such cost -effectiveness studies to Canada is the population prevalence of hepatitis C, as well as the proportion of chronically infected adults who are unaware of their infection. A study from Japan found general population screening and higher -risk population screening to be cost -effective, even though the general population prevalence was about 0.36 per cent86,87; however, it is not clear whether medical costs in Japan are equivalent to those in Canada, and the cost -effectiveness analysi s assumed that all those identified with chronic hepatitis C were treated, which may not be realistic in many settings. One of the U.S. studies indicated that general population screening was cost -effective as long as the general population prevalence was greater than 0.53 per cent,85 lower than the estimated prevalence for Canada. Further research and consideration specific to the Canadian context is needed to clarify the cost - effectiveness of general population screening, although the consistency of findi ngs from different jurisdictions about the cost -effectiveness of screening for higher -risk people (such as current and former drug users) supports the conclusion that such screening is very likely to be cost -effective in Canada as well. The recommendations from the three U.S. studies about population screening cost -effectiveness acknowledge that there are few real -world empirical data on this type of screening, and that the benefits of such an approach can only be realized if primary care providers, patient s and specialty treatment services all ensure that screening, referral, appropriate management and follow -up are successfully implemented. Potentially relevant to the issue of primary care involvement is a study by Helsper et al in the Netherlands, which demonstrated that hepatitis C information and promotion of testing aimed at higher -risk people on its own was ineffective, but became cost -effective when accompanied by education and support for primary care providers (although not as cost -effective as an a ctive program to promote testing of drug users).88 In the Netherlands, prevalence in the general adult population is estimated at 0.1 to 0.4 per cent, with only about 25 per cent of chronic cases diagnosed, so screening efforts for the general public in th is study were aimed at those with risk factors \u2014including immigrants from higher -prevalence countries, injection drug users, and former injection drug users \u2014rather than at encouraging testing for all adults. As in Canada, hepatitis C prevalence among inject ion drug users in the Netherlands is very high (estimated at 47 to 79 per cent); in this setting, active education and screening programs introduced into addiction services were cost -effective.88 The impacts of screening and treatment on people who use dru gs are discussed further in Chapter 6. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 44 Screening in Public Health Settings In Ontario, most hepatitis C cases are detected by primary health care providers. Public health providers are most likely to encounter unscreened people who are at increased risk fo r hepatitis C while following up reported cases of hepatitis C, providing harm -reduction services or providing clinical services. Epidemiological evidence from the U.K. suggests that STI clinic patients have an increased risk of hepatitis C infection,89 although it is not clear to what degree this risk is related to higher -risk drug use behaviours rather than higher - risk sexual behaviours. These service situations provide opportunities to screen higher -risk people who may be unlikely to receive regular heal th care services. However, when such screening is offered, it is essential that resources be available to provide education about hepatitis C, infection and transmission risks and reasons for the test, as well as to ensure that those who test positive are counselled and provided with referrals for follow - up care (see Chapter 7). Based on the NIH and CDC reviews noted above and evidence provided in Chapter 3, the Hepatitis C Working Group recommends that the groups below be considered at increased risk. PHUs that offer hepatitis C testing should offer screening to these groups. PHUs that do not offer testing should educate health care providers about the need for screening and facilitate referral of these groups to health care providers who offer it: Current and former injection drug users Those who have shared intranasal or inhalation equipment (especially crack pipes) with others Anyone who has had blood -to-blood contact with a person with hepatitis C Recipients of blood, blood products or organs (in Canada prior to 1990) \u2014may vary in other countries Children born to mothers infected with hepatitis C Those who have engaged in high -risk sexual behaviour with a person with he patitis C or with a current or former injection drug user People who have had a tattoo (including permanent makeup) or piercing in a non -professional setting or who have reason to believe that the equipment used was not sterile Household contacts of hepatitis C cases who have shared personal gro oming items that may have been contaminated wi th blood, such as razors, nail clippers and toothbrushes People infected with HIV or chronic hepatitis B carriers Immigrants and refugees from high -prevalence countries Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 45 6. Harm Reduction RECOMMENDATIONS Local Public Health Units 6.1 Public health units should ensure access to harm -reduction programs for injection drug users, including distribution of sterile needles/syringes and drug and injection preparation equipment as supplied by the Ontario Harm Reduction Distribution Program: sterile water in sing le-use vials, sterile cookers, new filters, sterile alcohol swabs, ascorbic acid and new tourniquets. Harm -reduction programs should not place arbitrary limits on numbers of needles or other supplies provided; instead, they should provide supplies accordin g to client need. Clients should not be required to return needles to obtain new ones, but they should be encouraged to do so; given sharps disposal containers; and offered counselling on safe disposal of needles, syringes and other injection drug use equi pment. Clients should be specifically educated about the risks of sharing needles, syringes and other drug and injection preparation equipment (such as spoons/cookers, filters, water, swabs and tourniquets) at the time these materials are distributed, and they should be educated about the appropriate use of the equipment. 6.2 Public health units should seek to involve people who are currently using or have previously used drugs (frequently referred to as peers ) to participate in the planning, delivery and evaluation of harm - reduction programs to enhance service relevance and credibility for program users to develop trust in the community that uses drugs. 6.3 Public health units should incorporate harm -reduction measures in their programming (such as distrib ution of safer inhalation equipment) for smokers of illegal drugs, particularly crack and methamphetamine. 6.4 Clients with a history of illicit drug use and/or imprisonment should be counselled about their risks and offered testing for hepatitis C, hepat itis B and HIV . KEY POINTS Because of the high prevalence of hepatitis C among people in Canada who use drugs and the increased risk of new HIV and HCV infections related to sharing of drug use equipment, harm reduction is an essential component of public health hepatitis C preventi on policy and programming. Effective harm -reduction programs should include distribution of sterile needles and other injection equipment (cookers, filters, sterile water for injection, ascorbic acid packets, alcohol swabs, tourniquets) and safer smoking supplies (mouthpieces, stems and screens); education and counselling; confidential testing for HIV, HCV and bacterial STIs on -site or by referral; and referrals to other services as required (drug treatment, detoxification, primary care, mental health care , housing etc.). Injection Drug Use Studies of people actively injecting drugs in Canada have identified prevalence of HCV antibodies ranging from 4713 to 88 per cent.14 The most recent published report of I -Track, the behavioural and risk surveillance stu dy Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 46 conducted in several Canadian cities with leadership and funding from PHAC, indicates that 69.1 per cent of recruited injection drug users had antibodies to hepatitis C, ranging from 51.4 per cent in Thunder Bay to 76.7 per cent in Prince George; Kingst on was the Ontario city with the highest prevalence (73.3 per cent).90 Unsafe IDU practices are currently the most important risk factor for new cases of hepatitis C in Canada, accounting for at least 60 per cent of all current hepatitis C transmission.91 Risk for transmission of hepatitis C has been linked to sharing of needles and syringes and to sharing of other injection -related equipment, such as cookers, filters and water.36 The 2014 I -Track report mentioned above also included information on needle -sharing, with 21.9 per cent of participants reporting injection with used needles in the preceding six months (17.9 per cent in Sudbury, 18.5 per cent in Toronto, 19.0 per cent in Thunder Bay and 21.0 per cent in Kingston). 90 Reported borrowing of other us ed injection equipment apart from needles was much higher (33.9 per cent overall, 35.4 per cent in Sudbury, 35.7% in Kingston, 36.7% in Thunder Bay and 46.4 per cent in Toronto). There is extensive evidence from many countries confirming the effectiveness of needle -distribution programs as a way to reduce HIV risk among injection drug users.15 Although less extensively studied, there is also evidence to suggest that such programs can also reduce risk of hepatitis C transmission.36 To ensure effective covera ge levels of syringe provision, needle -exchange programs should not limit the number of needles distributed92 and should include the goal of ensuring a sterile needle for every injection. 93 Detailed discussion of harm -reduction best practices and supporti ng evidence are available in Strike et al. Best Practices for Needle Exchange in Ontario, 2006. 36 In addition to the proven importance of sterile needles and syringes to prevent transmission of blood -borne infections (as well as other bacterial contaminan ts that can cause endocarditis, abscesses etc.), there is evidence that even injectors who are careful to avoid the risks of needle -sharing may share other drug and injection preparation equipment (for example, water, cookers, filters, alcohol swabs, acidi fiers and tourniquets).36 Hagan et al measured hepatitis C seroconversion among a cohort of 317 active Seattle injection drug users who tested negative for HCV antibodies at study entry.94 Among those who did not share syringes, sharing drug cookers and fi ltration cotton also elevated the risk of hepatitis C seroconversion six -fold (adjusted relative risk 5.9; 95 per cent CI: 1.1 -31.7), and 54 per cent of hepatitis C infections in this group were attributable to cooker/cotton sharing. Hahn (2002) also condu cted a prospective cohort study and found that sharing non -sterile drug injection equipment was an independent risk for hepatitis C seroconversion among young injection drug users, in addition to sharing of needles.95 Thorpe (2002) confirmed that sharing o f cookers and filters were independent risk factors for hepatitis C seroconversion in a prospective cohort study of injection drug users under 30 years of age, after controlling for sharing of needles.96 There is specific documentation demonstrating that s ome injection equipment can become contaminated with HIV and HCV, and it can be assumed that the equipment also contributes to transmission. For example, Crofts et al studied used injecting equipment collected in 10 Australian injection settings and found that 25 per cent of spoons/cookers had evidence of HCV RNA, as did 40 per cent of filters.97 Use of needle -exchange programs can reduce the sharing of other (non -needle) injection equipment.98 Comprehensive programs to prevent transmission of hepatitis C and other blood -borne infections through unsafe IDU practices must include provision of safer equipment such as cookers, filters, water for injection etc. With the availability of the Ontario Harm Reduction Distribution Program, all Ontario PHUs have acces s to provincially funded safer injection materials, which they should be providing as part of comprehensive harm - reduction programs for prevention of blood -borne infections transmission among injection drug users. It is a reasonable assumption that use of sterile equipment will also reduce infectious complications for users such as abscesses, septicemia and endocarditis. Thus, it is not necessary that harm -reduction programs demonstrate high levels of effectiveness against hepatitis C to be justifiable from a public health perspective, Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 47 although an impact on hepatitis C has been demonstrated in some harm -reduction studies. A cohort study from Amsterdam has indicated a major decline in hepatitis C incidence from 1985 to 2005, corresponding to a period in which there were significant declines in drug -using risk behaviours at the population level in Amsterdam, in conjunction with active harm -reduction programs.99 A secondary analysis of data from four cross -sectional studies of injection drug users aged 18 to 30 in Seattle over 10 years (1994 -2004) also found a significant decline in HCV antibody prevalence (from 68 per cent in 1994 to 32 per cent in 2004) after controlling for sociodemographic, drug use and sexual behaviour variables; the same study noted an incr ease in needle exchange and condom use. 100 A decline in HCV among young injection drug users is particularly significant because of the evidence for increased risk of HCV acquisition within the first few years of injecting.101 An early systematic review e xploring the effectiveness of primary prevention interventions for hepatitis C among injection drug users found limited evidence and concluded that interventions such as needle -exchange and methadone maintenance programs remained cost -effective because of their significant impact on the prevalence of HIV but showed less effect in reducing hepatitis C incidence.102 The authors also concluded that evaluations of new interventions \u2014including the provision of other injecting paraphernalia along with sterile need le distribution \u2014 needed to be carried out. Palmateer et al (2009) evaluated reviews related to hepatitis C prevention by providing sterile injecting equipment (via harm -reduction programs, pharmacies, vending machines or outreach) and found sufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of needle -exchange programs in reducing self -reported injection risk behaviours; tentative evidence to conclude that needle provision had been effective in preventing HIV; insufficient evidence to conclude effectiveness i n preventing hepatitis C; and little or no evidence about vending machines, outreach or provision of equipment other than needles.103 A more recent systematic review and meta -analysis addressing the primary prevention of hepatitis C in drug users found tha t interventions combining substance -use treatment and support for safer injections reduced HCV seroconversion by 75 per cent, with a pooled relative risk of 0.25 (95 per cent CI 0.07 - 0.83), while single - method interventions had relative risks ranging from 0.6-1.6.104 Multicomponent programs were evaluated in only two studies, one comparing opiate replacement therapy alone and opiate replacement therapy plus enhanced hepatitis C prevention counselling (showing the latter to be more effective), the other com paring a combination of more than 60 mg per day of methadone maintenance and always using a needle -exchange program with less or no harm reduction. Single -method interventions included peer -education training; drug syringe access and syringe disinfection with bleach. Among these, continuous opiate replacement therapy had a pooled relative risk of 0.52 (95 per cent CI 0.34 -0.79), but available studies for other inte rventions tended to be few in number and/or quite heterogeneous, and did not demonstrate lowered relative risk overall. This review did provide support for the potential benefits of multicomponent prevention, but the limited number of studies and the degre e of heterogeneity clearly indicated a need for further research in a variety of settings and populations, with careful attention to what constitutes an adequate dose of intervention and appropriate measures. There is already strong support for multicompon ent interventions for HIV infection,105 and these approaches are likely to also be beneficial for hepatitis C. Non -injection Drug Use A combination of virological and epidemiological evidence supports the likely risk of hepatitis C transmission via sharin g inhalation equipment used for smoking drugs such as crack and methamphetamine, as well as straws and similar implements for snorting drugs \u2014particularly cocaine. Some studies have found an association between sharing inhalation equipment for non -injection drug use and hepatitis C infection among drug users who have no history of injecting.16,17,19,20 A systematic review by Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 48 Scheinmann et al (2007) also concluded that hepatitis C infection is much more common among non -injection drug users than in the genera l population,18 but that gaps remain in proving that hepatitis C is transmitted via non-injection drug use. The authors pointed to two main possible weaknesses in current studies: misclassification of some current or former injection drug users as non -injectors, and transmission occurring via routes other than non -injection drug use, such as sharing of personal -hygiene items or sexual transmission. However, these alternative explanations are not likely to account for all of the increase attributable to non - injection drug use. First, there is no reason to believe that misclassification of injectors as non -injectors in all studies was substantial \u2014only that it was possible. More recent studies, such as the one by Caiaffa et al,19 took extensive measures to avoid misclassification of current or former injection drug users as never injection drug users, including examining for needle -track marks, making significant misclassification very unlikely. Second, sexual transmission and sha ring of personal -hygiene items are both relatively low -risk activities and are unlikely to explain all of the increased hepatitis C risk among non -injection drug users. Scheinmann et al's review was based entirely on epidemiological studies of risk factors and did not take into account the biological and experimental studies showing the presence of hepatitis C at each stage along the route of transmission associated with non -injection drug use.18 For the transmission of hepatitis C by sharing inhalation equ ipment to be biologically plausible, there must be mechanisms by which the equipment becomes contaminated with hepatitis C, and mechanisms by which the virus is introduced into the bloodstream of someone using the contaminated equipment. There is evidence that HCV is present in saliva and in gingival crevicular fluid. Experiments have shown that injection of saliva from an HCV -infected chimpanzee into another chimpanzee caused infection,21 and a case report of a human bite from a hepatitis C -infected person resulting in a productive hepatitis C infection.22 Furthermore, crack smokers report the occurrence of burns and cuts on their lips when using makeshift inhalation equipment,23 suggesting that contamination with blood or serum is also quite likely. The pr esence of hepatitis C on used inhalation equipment has been confirmed by a Canadian study.24 Burns and cuts on the lips, along with damage to the oral cavity associated with persistent cocaine use (such as ischemic mucosal ulceration, rapid gingival recess ion and dental erosions)106 provide plausible mechanisms for the virus to access the bloodstream of people exposed to contaminated inhalation equipment. Although most studies have methodological weaknesses and further research would be valuable, there is sufficient evidence to suggest the biological plausibility of HCV transmission via non -injection drug equipment and to recommend that public health harm -reduction programs provide safer inhalation equipment, including mouthpieces, stems and brass screens \u2014the latter to avoid inhalation of alternative materials such as Brillo, which are otherwise used. Programs frequently include additional materials, such as lip balm to combat the lip damage that can occur with the use of such equipment. An evaluation of a c rack kit distribution program in Ottawa found a significant shift from injecting to smoking after implementation of this intervention,107 suggesting an additional mechanism by which crack kit distribution programs can reduce the risk of blood - borne infecti ons, including hepatitis C. The provision of kits for safer inhalation allows PHUs to make contact with people who do not inject, to provide education about the risks of hepatitis C and other health problems; encourage testing for hepatitis C and other blo od-borne infections and STIs; and provide condoms and counselling about safer sex practices. Establishing trusting relationships with users of crack and methamphetamines can also allow for services and referrals to be provided, addressing other determinant s of health and health care needs, including addiction treatment for those who want to undertake it. There is an urgent need for evaluation research to study the impact of programs providing safer -inhalation kits, with attention to both short -term outcome s (such as accessing and engaging with health and social services) and longer -term health outcomes. A literature review table summarizing the studies available on hepatitis C and non -injection drug use is included in Appendix C. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 49 Counselling and Behavioural Interventions for People at Increased Risk Public health workers may have opportunities to counsel people at increased risk for hepatitis C about testing when they provide harm -reduction services, street outreach services or sexual health services. Given the high prevalence of hepatitis C among injection drug users in Canada (generally over 50 per cent), the importance of a history of imprisonment as a risk factor, and the elevated rates found in drug users who are not injecting but are sharing various typ es of inhalation equipment, there is a clear need to offer education and counselling about hepatitis C and access to testing to clients with a history of illicit drug use and/or imprisonment. This is based on the assumption that there is a public health be nefit to identifying infected people and offering them care and treatment. There is relatively little evidence about the impact of knowing one's hepatitis C status on subsequent drug -related risk behaviour. The literature on other blood -borne infections su pports the value of HIV counselling and testing as a key component of reducing the sexual transmission of HIV.108 There is less evidence about the effect of knowi ng one's HIV status on drug use -related risk behaviours, but some research has shown an impact .109,110 Despite a lack of direct evidence, the Hepatitis C Working Group recommends that since knowledge of hepatitis C status might reduce behaviours that expose others to infection and is a prerequisite for seeking care and treatment for one's own hepat itis C infection, clients with a history of illicit drug use and/or imprisonment should be counselled about their risks and offered hepatitis C testing. A recent systematic review and meta -analysis examined behavioural interventions for hepatitis C preven tion in people who inject drugs.111 Six trials evaluating peer -education training and counselling interventions aimed at reducing individual injection -related risk behaviours without explicitly seeking to change population or community norms (such as reduc ing drug use) were included in the review. There was variation in intervention type (4 counselling, 2 peer -educator training) and duration (30 minutes to 12 hours) across studies. The four counselling interventions all included education about hepatitis C and raised awareness of participants' individual infection risk behaviours; they used motivational interviewing (see chapter 7) to encourage participants to reduce risk behaviours. One of the peer -educator training interventions was among HCV - infected indi viduals and aimed to reduce onward transmission of HCV; the other was among HIV - negative/HCV -negative individuals and aimed at reducing the risk of infection. Only the two peer -educator training studies (418 and 854 subjects) showed significantly greater r eductions in injection risk behaviours in the intervention group compared with the control group. In the studies where HCV incidence was measured, none showed significant differences. Most of the counselling studies had relatively small sample sizes and ma y have been underpowered to show significant differences. The authors recognized considerable variability among the studies reviewed, but concluded that behavioural interventions alone are unlikely to have a considerable effect on HCV transmission, and tha t multicomponent interventions are required. In making this recommendation, they referenced a review by Rhodes and Treloar of qualitative research on hepatitis C risk among injection drug users that identified the need for structural interventions to targe t policing, homelessness and gendered risk.112 Sacks -Davis et al also referred to a 2010 review by Degenhardt et al identifying the need for individual, structural and combination approaches to prevent HIV among people who inject drugs.105 In this context, structural approaches can be taken to include access to opioid substitution therapy, needle and syringe exchange programs, and antiretroviral therapy, as well as access to social supports (e.g. housing). Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 50 7. Case Management RECOMMENDATIONS Local Public Health Units 7.1 Hepatitis C cases should be investigated to determine the reason for the test (whether the case or the physician suggested testing and for what reason); potential sources/risks for infection (see below); and co-infections with HIV, hepati tis B or other sexually transmitted infections. Testing for RNA should be recommended if not already completed. 7.2 Hepatitis C cases should be offered counselling and testing for HIV and hepatitis B virus. They should also be assessed for their risk of ba cterial sexually transmitted infections and offered testing as appropriate. All hepatitis C cases qualify for publicly funded hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations and should be offered appropriate vaccination, either by public health units or via their health care provider. 7.3 Among women, pregnancy status should be determined; specific treatment recommendations exist for pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised to notify their health care provider about their infection and discuss treatment op tions. They should be educated about testing of their infant to determine infection status. Testing for hepatitis C RNA in infants should take place on two occasions: between the ages of two and six months and again at 18 to 24 months; HCV antibody should be included with the 18 - to 24 -month test. HCV -positive infants should be referred to a pediatrician. 7.4 History of receiving blood, tissue or organs should be determined to define possible eligibility for compensation. History of donating blood, tissue or organs should be assessed to determine possible requirements for follow -up with recipients. Donation history can also be used to establish timing of prior negative hepatitis C screening to help determine approximate time of infection. 7.5 Education/counselling of cases should be ensured. This should include information about the availability and location of harm -reduction services, if appropriate. Individual public health units will determine how much of this counselling they do and how muc h clinicians will do. Table 9, Appendix H and the Primary Care Management of Chronic Hepatitis C Professional Desk Reference 2009 can be useful for clinicians who may not have expe rience counselling hepatitis C cases. 7.6 To the extent possible, determine whether reported cases are newly infected (within the preceding two years), and if they are, what their risk factors are and whether they may be associated with other cases (i.e. a cluster or outbreak). 7.7 Current identifiable contacts considered at increased risk for infection (suc h as known sharing of drug use equipment or higher -risk sexual behaviour involving blood -to-blood contact) should be offered hepatitis C testing. Becaus e of the low risk of sexual transmission in the absence of b lood -to-blood contact, routine public health contact tracing of low -risk sexual partners is not recommended , since it is not an effective use of resources. 7.8 Where there is indication of a clust er of cases, public health units should conduct an investigation appropriate to the circumstances and consider outreach to specific contacts to encourage testing and provide counselling and prevention. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 51 KEY POINTS Cases infected within the past two years are highest priority for follow -up because of the greater opportunity to identify sources of infection and prevent transmission to others. Case investigation should include detailed inquiry about risk factors, including sharing of drug use equipment, hig her-risk sexual exposures (see definition below), HIV infection, other STIs within the relevant time frame, or potential blood exposures to people with hepatitis C or to piercing, tattooing or other services t hat could cause blood exposure. Investigation s hould include inquiry about blood or tissue donation, as well as advice about not donating blood in the future. If careful inquiry suggests that donation may have occurred in the eight weeks immediately following infection, then trace -back efforts are warr anted, since screening tests may not be positive during this window period. Canadian Blood Services provides PHUs with a form that can be used to report such cases (see Appendix J). Cases should be asked about sexual and household contacts who may have had exposure to their blood during the period of infection so that these contacts can be informed and offered testing. Cases should be educated about how to avoid transmission to others: not donating blood; not sharing any drug use equipment or h ousehold/hygiene items that may be contaminated with blood; safe disposal of contaminated items; use of bleach to clean blood spills. Cases should be assessed regarding drug and alcohol use and offered counselling, referrals and harm - reduction measures as appropriate. Motivational interviewing is a form of brief counselling intervention that can be learned by professionals without specific mental health training and has shown some success in working with substance -use issues. Cases should be assessed for ot her needs (including housing, social support, mental health concerns etc.) and referred to other services, including support groups, as appropriate. Interventions involving peer support have shown some benefit in improving access to services, particularly for people who use drugs. Cases should be referred to hepatitis C support groups, as well as other resources, such as the CATIE websites (www.hepcinfo.ca, www.catie.ca), the CATIE information line (1 -800-263-1638) and the Canadian Liver Foundation (www.liv er.ca). Public health units and individuals can order CATIE's free print hepatitis C resources from www.catie.ca and 1 -800-263-1638. See Appendix K for additional resources. People who have HCV antibodies but not HCV RNA (shown by two negative RNA tests a t least six months apart) should be informed that they will likely remain antibody -positive for life, but do not have current active infection and are therefore not at risk for transmission to others. However, they are at risk of becoming re -infected and s hould be counselled about reducing any ongoing risk behaviours. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 52 Background As indicated in Chapter 3, the best -documented risks for hepatitis C involve direct blood -to-blood contact as a result of multi -person use (sharing) of injection or other drug use e quipment; receipt of unscreened or inadequately screened blood or blood products; or unsafe medical injections or procedures. Although there is evidence for some degree of sexual transmission (see Chapter 3 and Appendix D for detailed reviews), the extent of the risk is unclear, and is likely to be quite low in the absence of blood exposure during sex, especially in the absence of HIV or other STIs, which appear to increase transmission risk. In investigating single cases or household clusters of hepatitis C, the first step may be to determine who requested the test and why, and whether the case is under a physician's care or was screened in another setting, such as a harm -reduction program. Inquiry should be made about specific risk factors, including the following: injection or non -injection drug use and sharing of drug injection or inhalation equipment; skin - piercing procedures, such as tattooing, body piercing and acupuncture; receipt of blood/tissue/organs at any time in a developing country, or in a dev eloped country prior to 1990; occupational or non -occupational blood exposures; recent dental procedures or invasive medical procedures, such as hemodialysis; and history of incarceration. For patient counselling and prevention of transmission to others, n ewly infected cases and recent exposures (within the past two years) are high -priority. Sexual Exposure Risks For assessing the risk of a case under investigation and the risk of transmission to others, it is appropriate to determine the case's recent sex ual relationships, higher -risk sexual behaviours, and co -infection with STIs or blood -borne infections, especially HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). There is some epidemiological evidence suggesting that sexual transmission of hepatitis C may be more likely to occur in the presence of other STIs, including HIV.27,28 However, it is often difficult to rule out the possibility that HIV and HBV infections may also be related to other risk factors, such as unreported drug use. Definitions of higher -risk sexual b ehaviour used in hepatitis C research studies vary, in some cases simply referring to unprotected sex with multiple partners, in others incorporating sexual practices likely to result in blood -to-blood contact. For the purposes of this document, higher -risk sexual contact refers to sexual practices that may cause bleeding or abrasions, resulting in blood -to-blood contact between participants. Examples of higher -risk sexual contact may include anal intercourse, fisting, the use of sex toys, rough sex, sex be tween participants with open lesions from an STI etc. HIV infection is also known to increase transmission of hepatitis C. Evidence suggests low rates of sexual transmission of hepatitis C for heterosexual long -term monogamous partners.113-115 Rates report ed among long -term monogamous partners have varied, however, and factors such as high viral load in those with liver disease from serious chronic infection, genotype or other factors may have influenced study results. Many studies have not collected specif ic information about sexual contact or practices, and may also lack sufficient information to rule out non -sexual household transmission or common source transmission through medical care or services such as acupuncture. Reported rates of sexual transmissi on and hepatitis C prevalence among non -drug -using, HIV -negative populations of MSM suggest that even those who engage in risk behaviours such as unprotected anal intercourse have a relatively low incidence of hepatitis C. For example, Alary et al studied hepatitis C seroconversions in the OMEGA cohort of MSM in Montreal being followed for HIV risk.116 They identified a hepatitis C prevalence at entry of 2.9 per cent, but prevalence among those with no history of IDU was 0.3 per cent. Sixty -two per cent of the cohort reported a history of unprotected anal intercourse over the course of their lifetime, confirming relatively high levels of risk behaviour. Only one seroconversion was identified in 2,653 person -years of follow -up (incidence rate=0.038 per 100 pe rson -years), and this case was in an active Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 53 injector who had shared needles. However, although the incidence of hepatitis C seroconversion was very low, this study was limited in its ability to provide strong evidence for or against sexual transmission of hepatitis C because the low population prevalence \u2014especially among the non -injection drug users \u2014would likely make exposure to a hepatitis C -positive sexual partner quite infrequent. Recent studies of hepatitis C infection among HIV -positive MSM suggest hig her levels of risk for sexual transmission in this group. This may be related to higher hepatitis C viral loads, immunodeficiency and lower CD4 counts, and in some cases co -infection with other STIs, such as syphilis. Glosn et al reported on the incidence of hepatitis C among 402 people being followed for a median of 36 months in a French cohort with primary HIV infection (the PRIMO cohort).28 The two female seroconverters had risk factors related to IDU and body piercing, but the four male seroconverters ( incidence 3.5 per 1,000 person -years) reported only unsafe sex with other men as risk behaviours for hepatitis C. Studies of sexual transmission among injection drug users and non -injection drug users provide very limited evidence for the sexual component of risk in these populations, because of the higher impact of drug -using behaviours and confounding between factors, such as engagement in the sex trade and drug -related risk behaviours. Based on the available evidence, people diagnosed with hepatitis C sh ould be counselled to avoid unprotected sexual practices that could lead to blood -to-blood contact. Use of condoms in situations that may involve such blood exposure should be recommended, especially since similar behaviours carry risk for HIV, HBV and oth er STIs. Long -standing sexual partners should discuss the risks and make informed decisions about safer sex practices. Tables detailing studies of sexual transmission of HCV and their strengths and weaknesses are provided in Chapter 3 and Appendix D. Pregn ancy Women with newly diagnosed hepatitis C infection should be asked about their pregnancy status and counselled about the implications of hepatitis C infection for pregnancy. There is evidence that 3 to 7 per cent of HCV RNA -positive pregnant women will transmit the infection to their newborn. There are specific hepatitis C treatment recommendations during pregnancy to reduce the risk of harm to the fetus. There is no evidence of hepatitis C transmission through breastfeeding, but women should be advised to refrain from breastfeeding when their nipples are cracked and bleeding. See Chapter 3 for details on infant risk, testing and follow -up. Blood and Tissue Donation People with diagnosed hepatitis C infection should be advised that they must not donate b lood in the future, but they may be eligible to donate tissues and/or organs. For those who have donated blood in the past, information about the timing and location of the donation(s) should be collected. Current testing is highly effective in screening o ut infected donations, but if careful investigation suggests that donation may have occurred soon after infection (within eight weeks), then trace -back efforts are needed, since this represents the period when infection may not be detected in donor screeni ng. Contact Management Public health investigation should include identification of household and other intimate contacts who are likely to have potential blood -to-blood exposure to the infected person. This includes people with whom they have recently s hared needles or other drug -use equipment; people with whom they have recently shared other personal -use items such as razors and toothbrushes; current long -term and short -term sexual partners (with attention to exposures that may involve blood -to-blood co ntact); and other people with an identified Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 54 exposure to their blood. Although sexual and household transmission both appear to be quite uncommon, it is reasonable to offer counselling and testing to recent high -risk sexual partners (i.e. those who may have had blood -to-blood contact with the case), and to family members sharing the same household who might have had relevant blood exposures. Specific contact investigation may be indicated in particular circumstances, including, but not limited to, possible a cquisition from a personal service s setting, possible health care -related transmission, and possible clusters related to recent or ongoing higher -risk behaviours if public health officials believe that transmission can be reduced through public health intervention. Education for the infected person should include informing them about risks of such contacts, advising them about how to prevent transmission to their contacts, and encouraging them to discuss their infection with any contacts who may be at s ignificant risk so that the contact can be encouraged to undergo testing. Public health should be available to support the hepatitis C -positive individual in conducting the contact tracing or if requested by the case, public health should provide contact n otification. Where limited public health resources are overwhelmed by the volume of hepatitis C cases, local health units may choose to prioritize case and contact management based on the following priority factors: Newly acquired infections Cases co-infected with other blood -borne infections, such as HIV and hepatitis B Local epidemiology or other local factors (e.g. clusters, outbreaks) Patient Education As discussed in Chapter 4, people with the antibody to HCV should be strongly encouraged to ha ve RNA testing. Table 9 provides a summary of the key components of patient education and counselling based on the diagnosis of the patient. For a comprehensive checklist for pre - and post -test counselling, see Appendix H. PHUs will determine how much of t his counselling they will deliver and how much is delivered by family doctors or other health care providers. When dealing with clinicians who may not be experienced in counselling patients about hepatitis C, PHUs should provide the information in Chapter 3 and Appendix H to assist in patient counselling and management. Table 9: Summary of education and counselling tailored to hepatitis C -positive patients' needs (Appendix H) Type of Counselling Education and patients' needs Post -test counselling Antibody -negative: There is currently no evidence of exposure to the hepatitis C virus; if there was risk exposure in the preceding six to eight weeks, recommend a repeat antibody test in six months and counsel about how to avoid risks of he patitis C infection Antibody -positive (RNA test not yet done): There is evidence of hepatitis C infection, either current or past; the client requires an RNA test to determine whether he/she is chronically infected (i.e. still has virus present and therefo re still infectious to others via blood exposure) Counsel about modes of transmission and how to avoid transmission to others and/or re -infection if RNA test proves negative; this can be relatively brief if RNA testing and follow -up counselling is assured Counsel about risk factors for disease progression and provide support and referrals as needed; can be deferred until RNA results available if follow -up is assured Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 55 Type of Counselling Education and patients' needs Counselling after RNA - positive test The client is newly or chronically infected, and is infectious to others If history suggests new infection, refer for follow -up and consideration of early treatment (if RNA has not cleared spontaneously within six months of infection) If chronically infected, he/she will remain infectious for life without successful treatment and should be counselled on modes of transmission and how to avoid infecting others, as well as risks for disease progression and how these can be reduced; counsel about the availability of treatment and the importance of regular medic al follow -up, and provide referrals as needed Counselling resolved cases Resolved cases are those with antibody to HCV but confirmed RNA -negative based on two tests done six months apart. Note that there is good evidence that a negative RNA test three mon ths after treatment indicates that a sustained virological response will result (i.e. a cure) .67 Once sustained virologic response is achieved with treatment, relapse has never been reported Inform clients that they are at risk for re -infection; determine the presence of current risks and educate about modes of transmission as needed If there are ongoing risks, refer for further counselling, harm -reduction services or other needs RNA, ribonucleic acid. For those who are HCV -RNA -positive or for whom HCV RNA results are unknown, prevention of transmission to others includes the following: Not donating blood, semen, or breast milk, but they may be eligible to donate body organs or tissue Not sharing toothbrushes, dental floss, razors, earrings or manicure/p edicure equipment (i.e. articles that might have traces of blood) Keeping all open cuts and sores covered until healed Putting articles with blood on them (e.g. tampons, pads, tissue, dental floss and bandages) in a separate plastic bag before disposing of them in household garbage Disposing of bloody sharp items (razor blades, needles etc.) in a sharps container or a glass jar or hard - sided container with a tight -fitting and puncture -proof lid Using bleach to clean up blood spills. Surfaces should be soak ed with one part bleach to nine parts water and left for 10 minutes before wiping off (for a more complete discussion of the clean -up of blood spills, see Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Infection Prevention and Control in All Health Care Set tings , available on the PIDAC website117) Informing health care providers (including dental care providers) of disease status where blood exposure is possible For clients with current high -risk drug use behaviours, assess their readiness to change their b ehaviour, discuss options, inform them about available addiction treatment and support services, and make appropriate referrals (see Counselling and Behavioural Interventions and Peer Programming for Hepatitis C Prevention and Care sections, below). Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 56 For cl ients who use drugs, discuss the risks from reusing or sharing needles/syringes, water and drug -using equipment (pipes/mouthpieces, filters, spoons/cookers, alcohol swabs, acidifiers [e.g. vitamin C], snorting equipment etc.). Counsel clients to use steril e syringes, injection equipment and drug inhalation equipment (stems, mouthpieces, screens etc.) obtained from a reliable source, never share with anyone else and safely dispose after use. Advise them to ensure that they use a new, sterile syringe and need le for each injection \u2014 not just each session. Advise them to use sterile water to prepare drugs or at least use clean water from a reliable source. Advise them to clean bodily injection sites with new alcohol swab before each injection or use soap and water . Advise them to use a new, clean, dry cotton swab after injecting. Provide information and referrals to needle -exchange and other harm -reduction programs that supply needles and other injection equipment. For all infected people \u2014but especially those with drug - or alcohol -use issues \u2014discuss mental health needs and provide information and referrals to available mental health treatment and support. Advise clients how to ensure tattoos are being done in locations inspected by PHUs, with sterile equipment, and not with shared or reused tattoo equipment. Discuss the potential for sexual transmission. In monogamous, long -term relationships without higher -risk sexual practices, the potential for transmission is extremely low; couples should be encouraged to discuss the risks, but use of condoms is a matter of personal choice. In other types of sexual relationships, clients should be strongly encouraged to use latex condoms, partly because of the possibility of sexual transmission of hepatitis C to partners, but also because of the increased risk to their health if they become infected with HIV. Cases should be informed that risk for sexual transmission is higher with multiple partners and with sexual practices that may cause bleeding or abrasions, resulting in blood -to-blood contact. Evidence is sparse regarding the risk of hepatitis C transmission associated with specific sexual practices, including anal intercourse, fisting, the use of sex toys, rough sex, sex between participants with open lesions from an STI etc. Cases should be encouraged to inform all sexual partners about their hepatitis C infection and encourage partners to be tested for hepatitis C. Educate clients about the potential risks of other types of physical contact that may cause blood contact, such as fighting. Inform clients that they need not disclose their infection to casual or workplace contacts, but should disclose to any person with whom there is a risk of blood -to-blood contact. Ensure that clients are aware of factors that can increase their risk for progression to liver disease, including co-infection with hepatitis A virus or HBV (ensure access to counselling, testing for hepatitis B antigen and antibody and appropriate immunization for hepatitis A and B); HIV and other STIs (ensure access to counselling, testing and care); alcohol (provide referrals to treatment as needed); cigarette smoking (offer cessation supports as needed); heavy marijuana use (offer referrals to treatment as needed); and obesity and fatty liver (offer referrals as app ropriate). See Chapter 3 for a discussion of evidence regarding the risk factors for the progression of liver disease. Provide information to pregnant women about mother -to-child transmission of hepatitis C; for those considering hepatitis C treatment, emp hasize the restricted treatment options available in pregnancy because some of the treatment drugs are harmful to the fetus. For women who have had or may have children after becoming infected, discuss testing of infants and children.46 See Chapter 3 for d etails regarding infant risk, testing and follow -up. Cases should be referred to community resources, depending on the region and the individual's needs. Examples of community resources may include STI clinics; integrated hepatitis network centres; liver Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 57 disease/hepatitis clinics or specialists; peer -support groups; needle exchanges; health care providers prescribing methadone or providing other drug -treatment services. People with Internet access can also find many resources online. Where possible, refer people to hepatitis C support groups, as well as to other resources, such as the CATIE website (http://www.hepcinfo.ca/ ; http://www.catie.ca ), the CATIE information line (1 -800-263-1638) and the Canadian Liver Foundation (http://www.liver.ca ) (see Appendix K). Counselling and Behavioural Interventions There are several areas of public health practice in which counselling and behavioural intervent ion with those already infected with hepatitis C are relevant. The purpose of such counselling could be: To reduce the likelihood of transmitting infection to others (particularl y via access to harm -reduction services and changes in drug use -related risk behaviours) To increase the likelihood that the client will access medical care and possibly treatment for their hepatitis C To increase the likelihood that the client will seek supportive services related to their hepatitis C or other health -related needs (for example, self -help groups, housing workers etc.) To increase the likelihood that the client will access addiction care and treatment A form of brief counselling intervention that has been widely used in encouraging behaviour change \u2014 including change among clients with addiction issues \u2014is motivational interviewing . This technique was originally developed for use in the addictions field an d has since been applied to other health -promoting behaviours. Several systematic reviews and meta -analyses of motivational interviewing have been published118; these generally suggest that it can be as effective as other forms of counselling, such as cogn itive behavioural therapy, and significantly more effective than no treatment. Motivational interviewing has important advantages for public health practice, since it does not require a trained mental health practitioner; it has been used in interventions delivered by nurses and other health care practitioners after a relatively short training program. It uses active listening skills \u2014important and broadly applicable components of the repertoire of staff who provide outreach and counselling services. The rev iews of motivational interviewing considered for this document are summarized in Appendix L. Motivational Interviewing and other brief intervention approaches to behaviour change are generally based on the Stages of Change model.119 Determining what stage of the change process people are in enables a counsellor to provide an appropriate type of motivational support. For example, a person at the pre- contemplation stage must have his/her consciousness raised before he/she can consider changing behaviour. Peop le who have reached the contemplation stage are typically feeling some ambivalence about change and need help to resolve it and choose positive change by weighing the risks and benefits. Once people reach the preparation stage, they can be helped to identi fy and choose appropriate change strategies, while people in the action stage may need help and support in carrying out their change strategies. Brief interventions can be used to establish an alliance between client and counsellor and motivate behavioural change at each of these stages. \"Regardless of the stage of readiness, brief interventions can help initiate change, continue it, accelerate it, and prevent the client from regressing to previous behaviours.\"120 A key element of brief intervention with an y substance user is to motivate and assist change, not to shame or blame; a nonjudgmental approach is essential to success. Because change is often difficult and ambivalence is to be expected, a key principle in interventions such as motivational interview ing is that client resistance is a signal for the counsellor to change strategies and defuse the resistance, rather than to push against resistance and lose trust and alliance. This may be an especially useful feature in work with adolescents, where a systematic review and meta -analysis has shown motivational interviewing to be a useful strategy.121 Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 58 The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has published a document on brief interventions and brief therapies for substance abuse outli ning essential knowledge and skills. It states that to provide effective brief interventions, practitioners require knowledge, skills and abilities.120 Studies have shown that when clinicians apply several skills, they produce good outcomes, including gett ing clients to enter treatment, work harder in treatment, stay longer in treatment and have better outcomes after treatment (such as higher participation in aftercare and better sobriety rates).120 These skills include an overall attitude of understanding and acceptance; active listening and helping clients explore and resolve ambivalence; a focus on intermediate (versus long -term) goals; and a working knowledge of the stages -of-change model.\"120 WHO has also published the ASSIST screening tool and guide to brief intervention with substance users: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599399_eng.pdf?ua=1 122 Extensive information about motivational interviewing is available at www.motivationalinterview.org .123 Peer Programming for Hepatitis C Prevention and Care Peer programming is a means of offering more accessible and acceptable services to priority popula tions by reducing the social distance and mistrust that can make relationships between clients and providers difficult. By employing people who have lived experience with illicit drug use and potentially also with HIV and/or hepatitis C, peer programs can bridge the distance with clients who use drugs, establishing credibility and trust more quickly. Well -developed peer programs can also provide training and employment for people who formerly or currently use drugs, and contribute to community development i n communities of people who use drugs. There is a strong human rights argument to be made for involving people who use drugs in the development of policies and services that affect them (e.g. Nothing About Us Without Us: Greater Meaningful Involvement of P eople Who Use Illegal Drugs ).124 At the same time, peer workers may encounter challenges and need additional supports, because their work may expose them to situations that tempt them to use drugs while working or to relapse to drug use if they are not currently using. Such risks should not be seen as reasons to avoid hiring people with lived experience any more than other potential disabilities should block opportunities for employment, but they should alert employers to the need for appropriate supervi sion and support. There is limited literature specifically on peer programming related to hepatitis C, but there have been a number of studies of peer programming related to HIV. A recent systematic review addressed the efficacy of peer interventions for H IV in both developed and developing countries, including with people who use drugs.125 Of the 117 studies reviewed, most were quasi -experimental or cross -sectional, with about one - quarter using randomized controlled designs. Eighteen studies (15 per cent) dealt with substance users as their target population, and 27 studies (23 per cent) reported on substance use as one outcome, including reported behaviours such as needle -sharing, cleaning needles and methamphetamine use. Only 16 studies reported some biol ogical outcome, such as HIV or STI test results, CD4 count or measures of treatment adherence. A descriptive analysis of efficacy was used, with a liberal method of outcome assessment in which studies reporting a positive effect in at least one outcome mea sure were considered a positive outcome. On this basis, 70 per cent of the studies reporting on substance use supported the efficacy of peer interventions; 100 per cent of studies using outreach; and 56 per cent of studies not using outreach (p=0.02). Thes e results are in agreement with a previous meta -analysis of peer interventions in developing countries that reported reductions in equipment sharing among injection drug users.126 The authors concluded that their findings supported the benefits of peer int erventions for HIV prevention, but they also called for more research using the most rigorous study designs and with outcomes less likely to be affected by respondent bias. They acknowledged, however, that there may be situations in which subjective measur es are necessary, because studies are underpowered for biological outcomes or focus instead on obtaining valuable qualitative data. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 59 Although no reviews were found on peer interventions specifically for hepatitis C, there were individual studies related to peer interventions for hepatitis C in a treatment context. These reviews reported primarily on the use of peer workers and/or support groups to assist methadone clients or other drug users in accessing hepatitis C treatment and in maintaining adherence to treatment. The studies were mainly descriptive in nature, but emphasized the benefits of such programs in providing treatment opportunities for clients previously denied treatment because of their drug use or other social determinants.127,128 A summary of research related to peer interventions and hepatitis C is provided in Appendix M. Given the limited scope of reported research on peer interventions for hepatitis C prevention, it is reasonable to consider the relatively consistent and moderately positive findings of peer interventions for HIV prevention among people who use illegal drugs as supportive of such interventions in harm -reduction programs. It is worth noting the much stronger efficacy of peer interventions that included an outreach component .125 Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 60 8. Public Education and Social Marketing RECOMMENDATIONS The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care and Local Public Health Units 8.1 The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care and local public health units should partner to identify means of educating the public about harm reduction and drug use, with the goal of increasing acceptance and reducing stigma and discrimination. 8.2 The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care and local public health units should partner with the Ministry of Education and loca l school boards to identify and address gaps in education in secondary schools about blood -borne infections, including HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, with attention paid to ensuring understanding of the differences and the similarities between these vir uses, as well as the availability and role of prevention and treatment for each. Local Public Health Units 8.3 Public health units should advocate for measures such as improved access to low -cost housing, healthy food and income support as part of improvi ng the health of people living with hepatitis C and increasing their chances of successfully undergoing treatment. KEY POINTS Mass media educational campaigns aimed at the general public to improve knowledge and awareness and reduce stigma related to hepa titis C have been undertaken in Ontario (2006), as well as in Australia (2008) and France (starting in 1999). Evaluations have suggested that impacts were modest. Studies in Australia and France have also suggested low levels of knowledge about hepatitis C and identified a need for better education in secondary schools about hepatitis C, as well as hepatitis A and B, since students may not understand the difference. Many subpopulations at increased risk for hepatitis C in Ontario may also be impacted by th e broader social determinants of health such as poverty, lack of education, lack of affordable housing etc. Prevention and care in these populations requires policy action, both in the Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care and in other provincial and feder al ministries. As front -line agencies charged with prevention of hepatitis C and other blood -borne infections and STIs, PHUs are in a position to help identify the needs of those at risk and newly infected, and promote policies and programs to meet those n eeds. Social marketing is described by Health Canada as a planned process for influencing social and behavioural change, using components of marketing and consumer research, advertising and promotion. With respect to hepatitis C, social marketing may play a role in enabling the general public to better understand hepatitis C, who is at risk, and how risk can be reduced. Such marketing could aim to reduce the stigma and discrimination experienced by priority populations, such as people who use drugs. It can also p romote tolerance and social support for harm -reduction measures that have been shown to be effective for lowering HIV risk and have the potential to reduce hepatitis C as well (e.g. distribution of safe injection equipment, safer inhalation Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 61 equipment, meth adone maintenance treatment and supervised consumption sites). Currently, there are no such campaigns in Canada; use of the media to address issues of drug use is limited, and in some cases is inclined to reinforce stigma and discrimination. The results of an evaluation of a hepatitis C mass media campaign in Australia have been published.129 The campaign, conducted in April 2008, used television, radio and newsprint advertisements, posters and public display boards, public awareness events and media releas es, and included the dissemination of information to health care professionals. Evaluation involved baseline and follow -up interviews in both independent cross - sectional samples and in a cohort providing before -and-after comparisons of the same individuals . The campaign successfully increased public exposure to information about hepatitis C and improved knowledge about means of transmission. In the cohort sample, improved knowledge was associated with reporting exposure to information about hepatitis C foll owing the campaign, postsecondary education and greater knowledge at baseline. Attitudes towards injection drug users and services for them were generally positive (70 per cent or more) at baseline, and although most improved in the cohort at follow -up, th ey did not change in the independent samples, leading the authors to conclude that the changes may have been associated with pre-test sensitization or social desirability bias. The authors concluded that a sizable proportion of people still did not have so me of the basic information after the campaign, and that improvements in knowledge did not directly improve attitudes. They recommended the inclusion of people with hepatitis C in campaigns in an effort to affect attitude changes, as undertaken by campaign s to reduce stigma related to HIV or mental illness.130,131 However, the campaigns referenced did not directly address the issue of compound stigma (e.g. stigma related to being an injection drug user as well as being HCV -positive). France also carried out a campaign starting in 1999 to educate physicians, higher -risk populations and the general public about hepatitis C. Repeated cross -sectional surveys in 1997 and 2003 with convenience samples of French adults suggested that knowledge improved significantl y on 13 of 26 items and declined on 3. However, the authors concluded that improvements were modest overall, and that even multimodal campaigns can expect only gradual impacts.132 A social marketing/public information campaign conducted in Ontario in 2006 was evaluated by a telephone survey company. The outcomes measured included general awareness and familiarity with hepatitis C; knowledge of disease specifics, including awareness of the hepatitis C website being promoted; and response to the recommended a ction of speaking to a doctor about hepatitis C. The evaluation found improvements in these areas, but concluded that the relevance and personal importance of hepatitis C for the general public were still not high, and that therefore public awareness and a ction (such as getting tested for HCV) might never be as high as for other diseases such as influenza or West Nile virus.133 Social marketing campaigns could also aim to encourage those at higher risk for hepatitis C to undergo counselling and testing, par ticularly those with hidden risks, such as a history of unsafe IDU practices. Grow and Christopher conducted a focus group study of the responses of members of hepatitis C support groups to television public service announcements produced by the Texas Depa rtment of Public Health, concluding that the fear of stigma and discrimination from health care providers and social contacts was an important barrier to seeking hepatitis C testing.134 Structural barriers, including lack of information or incorrect inform ation, inadequate access to health care and not having a primary health care provider were barriers to seeking testing and treatment. The study also reported that fear -inducing messages increase stigma and may reduce the likelihood that those in the pre -contemplation stage will take action. The study recommended using celebrity appeals, realistic drug -use portrayals, more extensive use of social networking in tandem with non - traditional media, and messages emphasizing self -efficacy but minimizing fear tacti cs. One concern about the use of social marketing campaigns to encourage testing is the likelihood that they will be least likely to reach those at highest risk, because those populations are less in touch with the mainstream media or less likely to Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 62 relate to messages provided there. For a more complete discussion of screening issues relevant to this use of social marketing, see Chapter 5. Social marketing campaigns could also be considered as a way of preventing non -injection drug users from becoming injec tors. Research suggests that current abstinence -oriented drug education campaigns conducted in schools or in the media are ineffective.135,136 Effective social marketing strategies designed to prevent the initiation of IDU need to be innovative, and need t o pay particular attention to reaching more marginalized youth, such as those not in school and especially those who are street -involved (see Chapter 9 on specific populations). The prevention of illicit drug use by young people is a complex and multifacet ed issue, and those most at risk are often members of families and communities with substance -use issues related to poverty and other social needs.137 An educational campaign aimed at youth has been reported from France.138 This involved information meetings in 52 classes of 11 general and vocational secondary schools, with students aged 14 to 24 (mean age 15.9). The information sessions were accompanied by a comic strip depicting scenarios involving hepatitis C. Before the information session, 1,509 questionnaires were completed, and 1,419 were completed two months later. Baseline questionnaires indicated poor knowledge of hepatitis C. Knowledge scores improved significantly after the session, with significantly greater impr ovement among those who said they also read the comic strip. Knowledge was particularly increased concerning transmission by unsafe IDU practices, severity of the disease and lack of a vaccine. The authors recommended integrated education about blood -borne infections, including HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, underlining their differences; this was to address the finding that some adolescents had difficulty distinguishing between hepatitis A, B and C and different aspects of each, including vaccine availa bility. Although this campaign increased knowledge, no attitudinal measures or behavioural intentions were assessed, so its effectiveness in these areas could not be determined. Although no studies were identified regarding Ontario adolescents' knowledge o f hepatitis C, a study from Australia also found low levels of knowledge about hepatitis C in a survey of a nationally representative sample of secondary school students conducted in 1997, and recommended more education and health promotion related to hepa titis C among students, with care to avoid conflation of hepatitis C with HIV.139 Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 63 9. Specific Populations RECOMMENDATIONS Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care 9.1 The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should attempt to collect data on hepatitis C prevalence, incidence, risk factors and sequelae specific to Aboriginal people (including the rates and causes of morbidity and mortality from chronic liver disease) to assist in the development of appropriate public health programming. 9.2 The Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care should work that create policies to address the social determinants of health to better meet the needs of subpopulations at increased risk for hepatitis C. Local Public Health Units 9.3 Corrections authorities have primary r esponsibility for the health of inmates. Public health units with correctional facilities, jails or detention centres in their jurisdiction should determine the availability of hepatitis C education, counselling, testing, support and other resources, and h elp corrections authorities deliver appropriate services where feasible. They should also work with local corrections authorities to help them ensure that inmates being paroled or released into the community are provided with information about and referral s to needle -exchange programs, other harm -reduction programs and other available support services. 9.4 Public health units should seek to ensure effective access to harm -reduction and treatment programs, including appropriate coordination and continuity wi th federal on -reserve care for Aboriginal people with hepatitis C who are living off -reserve in their jurisdiction. 9.5 Public health units should assess the need for and availability of services for street -involved youth in their jurisdiction; ensure acce ss to hepatitis C counselling, testing and harm -reduction services; and try to facilitate access to care and treatment for those infected with hepatitis C. 9.6 Public health units should work with drug -treatment services in their jurisdiction to ensure acc ess to hepatitis C counselling, testing, care, treatment and support for clients in drug treatment, including methadone maintenance or detoxification facilities. This should include providing information about the availability and location of harm -reductio n services and ensuring provision of hepatitis A and B vaccines as indicated. 9.7 Public health units that offer clinical services and hepatitis C counselling and testing may offer hepatitis C counselling and testing to newcomers to Canada who are from hig hly endemic countries if they have not already been tested, and deliver culturally appropriate counselling and follow -up. Public health units should encourage primary care providers to offer hepatitis C counselling and testing to newcomers to Canada. 9.8 Public health units should offer or facilitate hepatitis C counselling and testing to men who have sex with men who are HIV -positive. Counselling should include discussing the high rates of co -infection with hepatitis C and HIV, the higher risk of sexual tr ansmission of hepatitis C to contacts of those who are co -infected, safer sex practices and harm -reduction approaches, as indicated. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 64 KEY POINTS Correctional facilities are high -risk environments for transmission of HCV because of ongoing risk behaviour (e.g. sharing of injection equipment and unsterile tattooing equipment) and no access to harm -reduction measures comparable to those in the community. More information is needed about the prevalence and causes of chronic liver disease among Aboriginal peop le in Canada. Limited studies suggest that Aboriginal injection drug users may have a higher prevalence of HCV than non -Aboriginal people; there are also some limited data suggesting that Aboriginal people may clear HCV at higher rates than non -Aboriginal people. Available studies show a higher prevalence of HCV in street -involved youth compared to other Canadians of the same age; this is linked to a history of injecting drugs and to a variety of vulnerabilities that need to be addressed in prevention effor ts. Hepatitis C testing, treatment and care should be integrated into methadone maintenance and other drug -treatment programs. PHUs should consider passive screening of immigrants and refugees from developing countries that have elevated prevalence of hepa titis C by offering education and testing when such individuals present for other services. There is preliminary evidence to indicate that people who currently use drugs can be successfully treated for hepatitis C in the context of multidisciplinary care w ith adequate supports; decisions about treatment should be made on a case -by-case basis involving careful assessment of individual strengths and needs. Men who have sex with men who are HIV -positive are at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis C and transm itting hepatitis C to their sexual contacts. Annual testing for hepatitis C and counselling around risk-reduction strategies are important aspects of care for HIV -positive men who have sex with men. Inmates As indicated in Chapter 3, epidemiologic and res earch evidence indicates that inmates have a much higher prevalence of hepatitis C infection than the general population. Studies, mainly in federal correctional facilities with offenders on longer sentences, suggest the presence of risk behaviours such as injection with shared equipment and unsafe tattooing in correctional facilities. The correctional system environment may also involve risks of violence associated with the presence of blood (e.g. fist fights and attacks involving use of weapons). While th ere is a great deal of evidence regarding the prevalence of hepatitis C in correctional facilities, there is little evidence to indicate what role PHUs should play with respect to hepatitis C in the correctional system. PHUs can seek to establish relations hips with local correctional facilities and offer education about hepatitis C (and other infections) to inmates and correctional officers. PHUs should support and encourage corrections to undertake HCV testing. PHUs may also consider offering counselling a nd testing for hepatitis C based on local needs. Needle exchange for incarcerated individuals has been shown to be a successful intervention in the context of HIV prevention in several countries140 but it is not currently available in Canada, owing at leas t in part to concerns that needles could be used as weapons. There is a need for better education of corrections authorities and staff about the potential benefits of correctional needle -exchange programs, including lowered Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 65 risk of accidental needle -stick injury during cell searches and the public health benefits for inmates achieved in some European countries. PHUs may also be able to play a role in helping corrections officials prepare inmates about to be paroled or released into the community. At the tim e of parole or release from a correctional facility, former inmates may not remain in the local area, so in most cases local PHUs would not take primary responsibility for linking inmates with harm -reduction, counselling or other services upon their transi tion from the correctional system to community. However, PHUs in areas that include provincial or federal correctional facilities may be able to work with corrections officials to develop information and referral packages to help ensure that those transiti oning to the community can find appropriate public health services in a timely manner. Aboriginal People A recent structured review reported that North American Aboriginal people are disproportionately affected by chronic liver disease; indeed, it has beco me one of the most common causes of death in the Aboriginal population.141 However, mortality figures are based on studies in the United States, since data are not available on mortality from chronic liver disease among Canadian Aboriginal people. Although the most common cause of chronic liver disease is alcoholic liver disease , hepatitis C is reported to be important and increasing as a cause. 141 The structural review also identified a need for research to monitor the incidence and etiology of chronic liver disease among Aboriginal people, and to study hepatitis C treatment in this population.141 A review by Minuk et al reported anti -HCV positivity prevalence in studies of Canadian Inuit and First Nations ranging from 1 to 18 per cent, but found that Aboriginal people who were anti -HCV -positive had a lower prevalence of HCV RNA than generally found in non -Aboriginal people. This suggests a higher rate of clearance of the virus and a more benign course for Aboriginal people who do not have additional complications (such as HIV co -infection or heavy alcohol use).142 A recent meta -analysis of international studies exploring the distribution of hepatitis C in diverse racial/ethnic drug injector groups found that Canadian and Australian Aboriginal injectors consistently had a higher prevalence of hepatitis C antibody compared to injec tors of other ethnicities.143 Researchers found Canadian and Australian Aboriginal people who inject drugs had a higher relative risk for seroconversion than Caucasians, but this finding was not statistically significant (RR 1.31, 95 per cent CI 0.87 -1.99) .143 A meta - analysis of three studies found an odds ratio (compared to Caucasians) of 2.04 (95 per cent CI 1.48 -2.82). 143 In Vancouver, Aboriginal injection drug users had an incidence of hepatitis C of 58.4 per 100 person -years, compared to 42.9 per 100 person -years for Caucasians.144 This suggests that even within the higher -risk population of injection drug users, Aboriginal people may be at especially increased risk and should receive special attention and culturally relevant interventions. Surveillanc e and treatment and care for Aboriginal people living on Ontario reserves is the responsibility of the federal government through Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch. PHUs in areas where many Aboriginal people live off -reserve need to est ablish good lines of communication and coordination with on - reserve health services to ensure appropriate follow -up and case management of people living with hepatitis C. It is especially important to ensure access to harm -reduction services when needed, a s well as continuity of care for those undergoing hepatitis C treatment. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 66 Street -Involved Youth A multi -site surveillance study of street -involved youth in Canada reported an overall prevalence of hepatitis C for 1999 -2005 of 4.4 per cent, while the rate among the general youth population was reported to be 0.01 per cent.145 IDU and crack cocaine use have both been associated with hepatitis C infection among street youth.146 In the PHAC report cited above, 21 per cent of street youth interviewed reported a history of IDU; of these, 18 per cent were hepatitis C -positive, compared with 0.7 per cent of those who reported no IDU (OR 32.8, 95 per cent CI 21.1 -51.1) . 145 Although this was the strongest association with hepatitis C infection in the study, the findings also highlighted a number of indirect factors associated with hepatitis C among the street youth studied, including ever being in foster care; ever being in a group home; ever being in jail or a detention facility or having a probation officer; having left home because of sexual abuse; engaging in alcohol abuse; and having an illegal primary source of income in the preceding three months. All of these highlight the vulnerability of this population and the need to provide effective services, including s ervices to reduce the risk for acquiring hepatitis C, other blood -borne infections and STIs; address the social determinants of health; provide needed social and personal support; and provide harm reduction for those who are engaged in drug use. Youth in p articular could also be targeted for efforts to reduce transition to more harmful illicit drug use, and for those already using drugs such as opiates and cocaine, to reduce transitions from non -injection to injection routes of administration. Hunt et al re viewed potential interventions to reduce transition from non -injection drug use to IDU,147 as well as methods to encourage injectors to switch to less harmful routes of administration, but there is very little evidence available addressing the effectivenes s of the potential interventions discussed. The same authors evaluated a brief intervention delivered by a drug worker with established injectors who were recruited from drug -treatment services and pharmacy needle exchange; the intervention aimed to reduce inadvertently encouraging non -injectors to start injecting by avoiding injection and talking about injection in front of them, as well as raising injectors' level of disapproval of initiating non - injectors.148 The evaluation showed declines in IDU initiat ion, and in desired attitude and behaviour change in the intervention group compared to a control group. This type of intervention has potential, but it would be important to adapt it to the context involved, and use peers or trusted service providers in d elivering the intervention to ensure a high level of trust. Drug Treatment and Withdrawal Management Facilities Because unsafe practices and behaviours associated with IDU are a leading cause of hepatitis C infection, and because practices and behaviours a ssociated with non -injection drug use are also likely to carry some risk, it is recommended that all people seeking drug treatment (including methadone maintenance) or withdrawal management (detoxification) services be offered screening for hepatitis C if they are not already known to be infected. This can provide an opportunity to link people being tested for hepatitis C or already known to have a chronic infection with needed care and support services. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admini stration in the United States has undertaken initiatives to support the integration of hepatitis C services into substance -abuse treatment settings, including training for methadone treatment providers and a program to support combined vaccination for hepa titis A and B in substance -abuse treatment services.149 Research in Amsterdam supported the feasibility and benefits of hepatitis C management in methadone maintenance patients.150 Immigrants and Refugees Hepatitis C screening is not currently required for immigration to Canada. The epidemiology of hepatitis C worldwide is not precisely known, owing to the difficulty of conducting representative population -based seroprevalence studies, especially in developing countries. A 2005 review suggests that rates of 3 per cent or higher occur in the general populations of many African and Asian countries, including an estimate of 3.2 per cent in China.50 Egypt has the highest reported seroprevalence in the world, at 22 per cent, related to Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 67 contaminated glass syringes used between 1960 and 1987 during a nationwide schistosomiasis treatment campaign.50 In contrast to developed countries, the main risks for hepatitis C acquisition in developing countries are considered to be transfusion of unscreened blood and reuse of needles and other medical equipment by both professionals and non -professionals, as we ll as some cultural practices involving blood exposures. The WHO estimates that 43 per cent of donated blood in the developing world is not adequately screened for hepatitis C.50 Although population -based data are lacking for most developing countries, ser oprevalence studies from the developing world suggest that prevalence among and within developing countries varies greatly depending on local medical and cultural practices. Some subpopulations have very high prevalence, and some appear to have rates simil ar to developed countries. The WHO has prevalence estimates for various countries and for the six WHO regions, but these estimates were published in 1999. 151 A more recent review of hepatitis C epidemiology in Europe highlights that immigration to Europea n countries from endemic areas of Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa is one factor affecting prevalence in Europe.152 Because of uncertainty about the prevalence of hepatitis C in populations from whom newcomers to Canada are drawn, there is not enough evidence t o determine whether organized screening should be offered to immigrants simply on the basis of their country of origin. Further research and pilot projects in Canada would be useful. In spite of substantial uncertainties, there are significant concerns about the state of sterile technique in medical practice and the lack of adequate blood screening in developing countries. It also appears likely that many developing countries have hepa titis C prevalence rates that are considerably higher than Canada's. Furthermore, these rates are not necessarily related to well -known behavioural risk factors, such as unsafe IDU practices, that can be ascertained directly from the client. Indeed, client s from developing countries may not even be aware that they have been exposed to a medical procedure such as an injection if it took place when they were young. Therefore, from a practical perspective, PHUs that offer hepatitis C counselling and testing for clients with hepatitis C risk factors may wish to consider those who have lived in a developing country to be at increased risk for hepatitis C and offer counselling and testing when they come into contact with the PHU's clinical services (i.e. passive s creening). PHUs should educate and encourage primary care providers to offer counselling and testing for these clients as well. People Who Use Drugs As indicated in Chapter 3, a majority of newly infected hepatitis C cases in Ontario will occur because of the practices and behaviours associated with IDU. A smaller but probably not insignificant number of infections may occur as a result of non -injection exposures, such as sharing of inhalation equipment. Harm -reduction as a means of preventing blood -borne infections in this population is supported by research, as discussed in Chapter 6. Drug users are much more likely to be incarcerated than the general public, and the most marginalized groups of drug users also experience a range of other health and social problems, including poverty, unstable housing, malnutrition and a high frequency of mental and physical health problems. There is some limited evidence to suggest that injection drug users can be successfully treated for hepatitis C if provided with adequ ate case management and/or other necessary supports.127,128,153,154 Public health providers can advocate for the provision of holistic health care services for drug users to provide them with opportunities for hepatitis C care and treatment. HIV-Positive Men Who Have Sex with Men Evidence suggests that MSM with HIV are more likely to become infected with hepatitis C and have higher rates of transmission of hepatitis C to contacts through sexual transmission than those who are HIV - negative.26-28,65,66 Acquir ing hepatitis C in HIV -positive men who have sex with men is linked to co -infections Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 68 with HIV and/or genital ulcer diseases (particularly syphilis), as well as to specific potentially traumatic practices such as unprotected anal intercourse, fisting and ri mming.25-28 HIV-positive men who have sex with men are also more likely to transmit hepatitis C to sexual contacts. This may be relate to higher hepatitis C viral loads, immunodeficiency and lower CD4 counts, and in some cases co - infection with other STIs , such as syphilis. Glosn et al reported on the incidence of hepatitis C among 402 people being followed for a median of 36 months in a French cohort with primary HIV infection (the PRIMO cohort). 28 The two female seroconverters had risk factors related t o IDU and body piercing, but the four male seroconverters (incidence 3.5 per 1,000 person -years) reported only unsafe sex with other men as risk behaviours for hepatitis C. PHUs should support and/or facilitate hepatitis C testing for HIV -positive men who have sex with men and support the provision of counselling to ensure they are aware of their increased risk of hepatitis C infection and can access appropriate harm -reduction measures to reduce their risk. Summary: Social Exclusion and Hepatitis C The epi demiology of newly acquired hepatitis C infections in Canada clearly indicates that the majority of cases are associated with vulnerable groups, such as inmates, Aboriginal people and people who use drugs. Newcomers to Canada and HIV -infected individuals a re also more likely to be infected with hepatitis C than the general population. For a variety of reasons, each of these groups is likely to be affected by the social determinants of health. Research involving marginalized users of illicit drugs in Canada confirms that they are likely to have relatively low levels of education and income, live in unstable housing and lack social support. A study published in 2007 found that more than one in five recent (since 1990) immigrants was living in poverty, compared to about one in 10 other Canadians.155 Addressing the needs of subpopulations at increased risk for hepatitis C for services to address to the social determinants of health requires policy action both within the Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care and i n other provincial and federal ministries. As front -line agencies charged with prevention of hepatitis C and other blood -borne infections and STIs, PHUs are in a position to help identify the needs of those at risk for or newly infected with hepatitis C, a nd to promote policies and programs to meet those needs. Although PHUs can and should promote policies that attempt to address the social determinants of health, this topic is complex and beyond the scope of this document. Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 69 Appendices Appendix A: Hepatiti s C Public Health Needs Assessment Survey The purpose of this survey is to determine the needs of public health staff in responding to hepatitis C case management. In 2007, a practice survey was circulated to public health units across Ontario to determine d current hepatitis C case management practices. This survey will help the PIDAC Hepatitis C Working Group formulate evidence -informed guidelines that will best support the public health response to hepatitis C.

The search terms employed are briefly presented in the table below. Titles of all articles identified were scanned, and abstracts of articles considered relevant to the sea rch topic were reviewed. Relevance was based on the relationship to the question being addressed, as well as relevance to the context of Ontario. In general, studies conducted in Europe, North America or Australia were considered most relevant, although fo r certain topics (e.g. the question of HCV transmission via non -injection drug use, for which evidence was somewhat sparse) evidence from any country was considered. Articles considered potentially relevant based on abstract review were retrieved and revie wed. Information considered relevant was extracted and then considered by the Hepatitis C Working Group as part of the review of each chapter and the development of recommendations. The quality of studies reviewed was included in this consideration, althou gh this was not a systematic review. Search for Unindexed (Grey) Literature Grey literature searches and jurisdictional scans were conducted in Google using synonyms for topic categories: counselling, testing, best practice guidelines, harm reduction, scre ening, management and education.

Laboratory definitive evidence OR 2. Laboratory suggestive evidence AND clinical evidence AND exclusion of other causes of acute viral hepatitis: a) IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus (IgM anti -HAV) negative, AND b) IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti -HBc) negative 4.0 Laboratory Evidence 4.1 Laboratory Definitive Evidence a) Detection of anti -HCV antibody from a person who has had a negative anti -hepatitis C antibody test recorded within the past 24 months, OR b) Detection of HCV by RNA testing from a person who has had a negative anti -hepatitis C antibody test result with in the past 24 months, OR c) Detection of anti -hepatitis C antibody from a child aged 18 to 24 months, OR d) Detection of hepatitis C virus by RNA testing in a child aged 1 to 24 months. 4.2 Laboratory Suggestive Evidence Detection of anti -hepatitis C an tibody, or hepatitis C virus by RNA testing. 4.3 Approved/Validated Tests Anti-HCV line immunoblot assays including recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) and line immunoassay (LIA) Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 101 4.4 Indications and Limitations In immunocompromised cases, HCV RNA testing is recommended, as antibodies may be negative in this population. This definition of newly acquired HCV will exclude people with positive anti -HCV and positive anti - HBc IgM, even though it is possible that in rare cases this pattern will be seen in people who have simultaneous acute HBV and HCV. This profile will be much more commonly seen where someone with chronic HCV has newly acquired HBV, and it is considered better to ensure exclusion of this group from reporting as newly acquired HCV. HCV ant ibody testing should not be performed in infants < 18 months of age because of detectable levels of maternal antibody; however, if antibody testing is performed and found to be reactive at 18 months of age, HCV RNA real -time reverse transcription, polymera se chain reaction (RT -PCR) or nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) should be performed to rule out maternal antibody and to confirm viraemia. Cord blood should not be used because of maternal blood contamination. Testing for RNA earlier than 4 -6 weeks of age is not recommended. 5.0 Clinical Evidence Clinically compatible signs and symptoms are characterized by acute illness w ith discrete onset of any sign or symptom consistent with acute viral hepatitis (e.g. anorexia, abdominal d iscomfort, nausea, vomit ing), and any of a) jaundice, b) elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level or c) in urine.

Antibody testing should not be used in infants less than one year of age because of the potential presence of maternal antibody. Optimal time after birth for HCV RNA PCR testing is not fully defined. Testing at 4 -6 weeks and/or at 6 -12 months is recommended. Comparison Surveillance Newly Acquired Case Definitions from Other Jurisdictions As indicated in the above references, other countries have case definitions which aim to distinguish newly acquired from chronic HCV among newly tested cases. United States The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers an acute case of HCV to be confirmed if it meets the following clinical case definition, as well as being laboratory confirmed as indica ted below, and is not known to have chronic hepatitis C.68 Clinical case definition An acute illness with a discrete onset of any sign or symptom consistent with acute viral hepatitis (e.g. anorexia, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting), and either a) jaundice or b) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels >400 IU/L. Laboratory criteria for diagnosis One or more o f the following three criteria: Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 104 Antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti -HCV) screening -test-positive with a signal to cut-off ratio predicti ve of a true positive as determined for the particular assay as defined by CDC (signal to cut -off ratios: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitis/c/sc_ratios.htm )194 OR Hepatitis C virus recombinant immunoblot assay (HCV RIBA) positive, OR Nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA -positive AND , meets the following two criteria: IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus (IgM anti -HAV) negative AND IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti -HBc) negative United Kingdom The U.K. also focuses on defining an acute case of HCV, with a slightly different definition:70 Recent seroconversion OR HCV RNA -positive and antibody -negative or equivocal in an immunocompetent individual O R anti -HCV -positive, anti -HAV IgM negative and anti HBc IgM negative and abnormal liver function tests with a pattern consistent with acute viral hepatitis in someone with recent exposure to HCV (e.g. needle - stick injury, dialys is, recent injecting drug us e). Australia Australia also has a case definition for reporting newly acquired cases of hepatitis C. Newly acquired is defined according to the following laboratory definitive evidence.69 Laboratory definitive evidence Detection of anti -hepatitis C antibo dy from a person who has had a negative anti-hepatitis C antibody test recorded within the past 24 months OR Detection of hepatitis C virus by nucleic acid testing from a person who has had a negative anti - hepatitis C antibody test result within the past 2 4 months OR Detection of anti -hepatitis C antibody from a child aged 18 to 24 months OR Detection of hepatitis C virus by nucleic acid testing in a child aged 1 to 24 months A newly acquired case can also be confirmed by having both laboratory suggestive evidence and clinical evidence, as follows. Laboratory suggestive evidence Detection of anti -hepatitis C antibody, or hepatitis C virus by nucleic acid testing. Clinical evidence Clinical hepatitis within the past 24 months (where other causes of acute he patitis have been excluded) defined as : 1. Jaundice OR 2. Bilirubin in urine OR 3. Alanine transaminase (ALT) seven times the upper limit of normal. Manitoba Some other Canadian provinces have also included efforts to distinguish acute hepatitis C cases in their surveillance. For example Manitoba has the following definition for an acute case of hepatitis C.195 Either a documented seroconversion over a period of under six months, of all of the following: Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 105 Confirmed positive serology for hepatitis C Clinically comp atible illness (e.g. jaundice, nausea, malaise, fatigue, dark urine, loss of appetite) Laboratory evidence of hepatitis (hyperbilirubinemia or aminotransferase levels >2.5 times the upper limit of normal) Negative test for HBsAg or anti -HBc IgM Negative te st for anti -HAV IgM Cases of longer than 6 months duration, or of unknown duration, are considered non -acute.

The linear range of the new Roche Taqman HCV RNA assay is 15 IU/mL to 10 E+8 IU/mL. For comparison, the previously used Roche Cobas Amplicor quantitative HCV RNA assay has a linear range of 600 IU/mL to 10 E+6 IU/mL. For Hepatitis C only assay that provides rapid differentiation of HCV genotypes 1 to 6 based on sequence variation within the HCV 5' non -coding regi on. HCV Genotype assay is 99.9%. 1. Hepatitis C RNA Testing Clinical Utility Quantitation of HCV RNA by PCR is used to measure viremia in anti -HCV -positive individuals who are on treatment or who are being considered for treatment. Detection of HCV RNA can also be used to assess active HCV infection in immunocompromised anti -HCV -negative individuals. Specimen Requirements A minimum of 2.5 mL of frozen serum or plasma is required to perform the Roche Taqman HCV RNA assay. Samples received with less than 2.5 mL will be rejected. All requests for HCV RNA testing must include a comple ted PHOL Test Requisition Form and a Laboratory Information (F -C-HE-036), available at: http://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/Ser vicesAndTools/LaboratoryServices/Pages/Requisitions -and- forms.aspx . Results Interpretation The following table is a guide to aid in the interpretation of HCV RNA results. HCV RNA Result Interpretation Comments Detected Hepatitis C RNA detected, >15 IU/mL Viral load will be provided Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 107 HCV RNA Result Interpretation Comments Detected Hepatitis C RNA detected, <15 IU/mL The result for HCV RNA is below the linear range of the assay, and thus the exact value cannot be calculated Not detected No detectable Hepatitis C RNA Refer to comments on laboratory report if follow -up testing is required 2. Hepatitis C Genotype Clinical Utility Genotyping of HCV is useful in evaluating the likelihood of response to currently available antiviral therapy. Patients with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 generally respond better to therapy and typically require approximately 24 weeks of treatment. Patients with H CV genotypes 1 and 4 to 6 may require up to 48 weeks of treatment. HCV genotypes are sufficient for treatment evaluation; HCV subtypes are not required. Specimen Requirements No additional sample is required. The first pre -treatment (i.e. baseline) sampl e submitted for HCV RNA is automatically used to perform HCV genotyping.

The previous qualitative and quantitative tests have been replaced with a single, more sensitive HCV RNA test. 2. If the patient is immunocompromised (e.g. HIV), submit 2.5 mL of frozen serum or frozen plasma for H CV RNA testing to determine if the patient has an active HCV infection. These patients may not exhibit a positive anti -HCV result. 3. If the patient has been exposed to HCV, they may be within the incubation period (6 -8 weeks) post -exposure and may not yet have detectable antibody. Submit a serum sample for a repeat anti -HCV test 6 -8 weeks post -exposure. 4. If the anti -HCV result is inconclusive and the patient has been exposed, the patient is still susceptible to HCV infection. Patien ts should continue to be tested after any future exposures. Inform patients that they should not donate blood, blood products and/or organs. 5. If an infant has a mother who is anti -HCV reactive, then submit 2.5 mL frozen serum or frozen plasma from the infa nt for a HCV RNA test. Retesting the infant for anti -HCV is recommended between 12 months and 18 months of age, as anti -HCV results are presumed to be maternal antibodies. For information on treatment of HCV, please refer to the 2007 Canadian Consensus Gu idelines for the Management of Chronic Hepatitis C.

Definitions: a) Non -critical specimen \u2014 routine specimens b) Critical specimens difficult or impossible to recollect (i.e. CSF, tissue, autopsy material) Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 111 3. Criteria for determining Acceptance of Non -Critical Specimens: a) Patient identifiers; preferably patient name in full and / or identification number must be on both specimen container and requisition and must match one another. The exception is outbreak specimens, which are received with a numeric outbreak number and no patient name. For smear specimens, the patient identifier (patient initials are acceptable due to space limitations) must be written on the frosted portion of the slide. Patient initials are also acceptable for specimen containers with space limitations e.g. Bordetella specimen containers b) A second identifier is essential to distinguish between individu als with the same name, i.e. date of birth or OHIP number or date of collection (mo / day / yr). This second identifier must be on both requisition and container c) Legally authorized (as specified in Ontario Regulation 682 of the Laboratory and Specimen Collection Centre Licensing Act at http://www.e -laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_900682_e.htm) requester's name. Patient test requisition forms received from a clinic staffed by rotating physicians (e.g. hassle -free clinic) shall include the name of the attending physician. Patient reports may be addressed to the Coordinator of the Clinic d) Test(s) must be reques ted or implied (i.e. specimen in a test specific transport media such as SAF for parasitology) e) The specimen packaging meets the minimum Federal Regulation - Transportation of Dangerous Goods packaging requirements f) The specimen is not leaking 4. Criteria for determining Acceptance of Critical Specimens: a) Any critical specimen that is received without patient identifiers will be processed if tests specified but will not be reported, until a signed waiver has been received from the health care provider. 5. Verbal Requests for Additional Tests: a) No additional test will be added to previously submitted specimens except under exceptional circumstances. If additional tests are required, please submit a new specimen with an appropriately completed Public Health Laboratory (PHL) Test Requisition form as follows: 1.

Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 120 Appendix H : Pre/Post Hepatitis C Testing Counselling Checklist Pre-Test Discussion Determine whether test is for screening or diagnosis because of symptoms; identify risk factors Distinguish hepatitis C from hepatitis A and hepatitis B Discuss what will happen if the test is positive (reporting, follow -up RNA test after antibody test, referral for medical follow -up if RNA -positive) Discuss antibody versus RNA tests and what each means Discuss the implication of a positive test which includes involvement of public health and notification of contacts Post -Test Counselling Antibody -negative Antibody -positive (RNA test not yet done) There is currently no evidence of exposure to the hepatitis C virus If there was risk exposure in the preceding 6 - 8 weeks, recommend a repeat antibody test in 6 months and counsel about how to avoid risks of hepatitis C infection Counselled about reducing exposure risks There is evidence of hepatitis C infection, either current or past The client requires an RNA test to determine whether he/she is chronically infected (i.e. still has virus present and therefore still infectious to others via blood exposure) Counsel about modes of transmission How to avoid transmission to others How to avoid re -infection if RNA test proves negative (this can be relatively brief if RNA testing and follow -up counselling is assured) Counsel about risk factors for disease progression and provide support and referrals as needed (can be deferred until RNA results available if follow -up is assured) Post -RNA Testing Counselling RNA -negative result RNA -positive result Resolved cases are those with antibody to HCV but confirmed RNA -negative based on 2 tests done 6 months apart. Note that there is good evidence that a negative RNA test 3 months after treatment indicates a sustained virological response (i.e. a cure).81 Once sustained virological response is achieved with treatment relapse has never been reported. Inform clients that they have evidence of previous infection now resolved Inquire about risk and treatment history Determine the presence of current risks The client is newly or chronically infected, and is infectious to others If history suggests new infection, refer for follow -up and consideration of early treatment (if RNA has not cleared spontaneously within 6 months of infection) If chronically infected, he/sh e will remain infectious for life without successful treatment Counsel about Appropriate lifestyle measures to reduce the risk of disease progression; Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 121 Counsel about reducing exposure risks If there are ongoing risks, refer for further counselling, harm -reduction services, or other needs Educate about modes of transmission as needed The availability of treatment The importance of regular medical follow -up, and provide referrals as n eeded Should be counselled on modes of transmission How to avoid infecting others Not donating blood, semen, breast milk, body organs or tissues Not sharing toothbrushes, dental floss, razors, earrings or manicure/pedicure equipment (i.e. articles that might have traces of blood) Keeping all open cuts and sores covered until healed Putting articles with blood on them (e.g. tampons, pads, tissue, dental floss and bandages) in a separate plastic bag before disposing of them into household garbage Disposing of bloody sharp items (razor blades, needles etc.) in a sharps container or a glass jar or hard -sided container with a tight - fitting and puncture -proof lid Using bleach to clean up blood spills.

The screening strategies were selected from a qualitative study of screening strategies used in France (9 strategies). Confirmation test determined status by detecting the HCV RNA. If ALT was elevated, a liver biopsy was performed and results expressed in the Knodell's score. A Knodell's score < 5 led to surveillance with ALT. After 3 successive normal ALTs, true positive cases were followed a Markov model. Probabilities derived from analysis of the current literature were used to construct Markov models. Data sources for the model were extracted from previously published studies. The costs of the biological tests were obtained from a previous study carried out in 12 French hospitals. One -way and 2 -way sensitivity Except for high -volume transfusions, the strategy using post -transfusion EIA3 confirmed by HCV RNA detection had the lowest cost - effectiveness ratio. In high - volume transfusion, the EI A3 screening strategy prescribed before and after transfusion and confirmed by HCV RNA detection had the lowest undiscounted cost Focused on clinical screening strategy, not population screening program (birth cohort or higher -risk group) -; not evaluated for strength, since not related to population screening Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 123 First Author Journal Reference Country/Study Population Methods Outcomes Additional Comments Strength of Evidence analyses were performed on the prevalence of HCV, the recovery rate after treatment, the sensitivity of ALT, EIA3 on HCV RN A detection and the cost of testing with ALT EIA3 and HCV RNA detection Stein K, et al197 Journal of Hepatology 2003;39(5):814 -25 Developed (England); this study investigated the cost of screening for HCV in genitourinary medicine clinics; considered (1) all patients at increased risk of HCV carriage, (2) screening of current or former injection drug users and (3) screening in a larger minority of patients Developed a screening program and integrated Markov model of combination therapy. The model calculated the utility cost of screening versus not screening. Three elements of screening program: (1) screening \u2014asymptomatic individuals were offered serological testing, (2) diagnosis \u2014people who were positive were offered liver biopsy and (3) treatment \u2014treatment element follow ed Markov's chain process. Patients in treatment were assumed to be 32 years of age, proportion of males to females was equal, the model ran for 50 years and simulated the natural history of disease. Death rates were estimated from British life tables. Lit erature search and survey of screening practices were conducted to estimate the parameters of the model and costs. One -way and multi -way sensitivity The model was sensitive to the prevalence of HCV in a populatio n likely to present to genitourinary medicine clinics; costs per QALY increased once prevalence decreased below 3%. Acceptance of screening determined utility cost: with 100% acceptance, utility cost remained above \u00a360,000 per QALY. There was little differ ence in utility cost if acceptance of treatment was over 70%, or was 100%. Universal screening would yield benefits of \u00a385,000 per QALY. Study suggested that universal screening in these clinics was probably not cost -effective, and the most cost - effective approach to screening HCV in genitourinary medicine clinics (equivalent to our STI clinics) would be risk-based; restrict screening to those with a history of IV drug use +; model considered a single age cohort \u2014 did not consider how the model would change i f the average age was younger or older than 32; perception of disease, willingness to acceptance screening and treatment may differ among older cohorts; parameter values identified through literature search, and opinions shared by survey and expert opinion may not be truly representative of population. However, sensitivity analysis performed to validate parameters considered in model, which gives strength to results and sensitivity of result to the different conditions hypothesized Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 124 First Author Journal Reference Country/Study Population Methods Outcomes Additional Comments Strength of Evidence analyses were performed to validate results Josset V, et al198 Gastroenterology Clinical Biology 2004;28(4):351 -7 Developed (France); 127 voluntary physicians used a questionnaire to search for risk factors in 10,041 patients aged 18 to 70 years Free HCV screening test recommended to patients who had at least 1 risk factor for HCV and whose HCV serology was unknown. A reference screening strategy was defined in compliance with official recommendations; 5 other screening strategies were defined from the data collected during the survey; for all 6 strategies, number of patients and number of positive serology previously unknown were noted; physician's fees and test costs were considered. Three funding modalities were hypothesized to estimate to cost of screening practices. Cost - effectiveness analysis performed Of the 10, 041 patients, 54% presented with at least 1 risk factor; of the 924 higher -risk patients HCV was known for 15.5%, screening test performed for 3,550 patients with at least 1 risk factor detected 49 positive patients (1.4%). The prevalence of HCV infection was 2.6%. Seroprevalence not related to age or sex. Cost lowest for reference screening strategy and detected 19 of the 49 positive serologies. Two of the extended strategies detected additional positive patients (15, 8). The other 3 detected 5 more positi ve patients than the reference strategy The cost - effectiveness ratio was higher than the mean cost of the reference strategy. Extending HCV screening beyond people with a history of drug abuse or transfusion was not effective +; tests were not recommended to patients aged 70 and over. Voluntary physicians were not representative of general practitioner population, since a greater proportion of patients were illicit drug users Shah B, et al84 Clinics in Liver Disease 2006;10(4):717 -34 Developed (United Stat es and Europe); global burden of HCV included Reviewed global burden of HCV disease and future projections for several European countries + U.S.; reviewed cost -effectiveness of HCV treatment; reviewed early studies of cost-effectiveness of screening and st udies of prevention of HIV which may be relevant to HCV Global burden substantial: 1 of top 10 causes of death from infectious diseases, costs projected to increase over time in all countries reviewed. Review suggested therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin was cost -effective, but treatment coverage was low. Early screening studies in U.S. reviewed; 1 study found screening average -risk 35 -year - olds cost -effective only if half of This was a narrative rather than a systemat ic review, but provided a strong review of global burden data +; not a systematic review; may have been missing some relevant studies; publication date meant that many more recent cost - effectiveness studies were not included and there was no information a bout directly acting antivirals included.

Review of conditions for prevention programs to be cost -effective; no studies directly related to HCV, although some evidence for cost -effectiveness of HIV behavioural interventions, which could be analogous Provided a clear discussion of cost - effectiveness study issues and methods with respect to HCV Tramarin A, et al199 Current Pharmaceutical Design 2008;14(7):1655 -60 Developed (Italy); a mathematical model was applied to estimate the possible reduction of socioeconomic burden of HCV by early treatment of patients with recently acquired hepatitis C. Cost and consequences of the current approach based on treatment of chronic hepatitis C were compared to a hypothet ical screening program to identify and treat asymptomatic seroconverted individuals at risk for progressed HCV disease. Population for analysis was the Veneto region of Italy Developed a Markov model to simulate the disease progression in 2 cohorts, chroni c hepatitis C or recently acquired infection to estimate life expectancy, QALY and lifetime costs associated with the 2 treatment strategies. The recently acquired hepatitis group consisted of 2 subcohorts (1) injection drug users living in the Veneto Regi on in 2007 and (2) people at risk for nosocomial HCV \u2014patients who had minor or major surgery in 2007. The incidence of HCV in the population was considered, as well as rates of drug abuse and the annual probability of surgery in the general population. Cli nical costs were derived from the Italian National Tariff system. Although screening schedules for both groups had a different frequency, (every 6 months for the IDU All injection drug users would contract HCV infection during the time period considered (45 years). Of the 9,460 subjects, 862 would have symptomatic hepatitis and be eligible for treatment, even in the absence of screenin g. Additional values determined for the predicted number that would spontaneously clear HCV or develop end -stage liver disease. Estimates were made for individuals with surgery. The impact of screening in individuals who had surgery was much lower Early t reatment of IDU led to reduction of people with chronic hepatitis C. The cost of screening individuals who have had surgery was high, with a calculated cost - effectiveness ratio of \u20ac500,000 per QALY gained. Screening the non - injection drug use population wa s not cost-effective practice +; this study assessed the possible reduction in socioeconomic burden of HCV infection by screening and early treatment of 2 populations exposed to risk by drug -use practices and in a general population of people who had surge ry. The study of HCV in a specific group at (unknowingly) increased risk was somewhat relevant to the literature review. Also, the conclusion that the risk of disease in the population who have had surgery but no other risk factors (assumed) was too low to make a screening program cost-effective was equally interesting, Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 126 First Author Journal Reference Country/Study Population Methods Outcomes Additional Comments Strength of Evidence group and at 0 and 6 months for the subjects with surgery), the model assumed absolute com pliance to the screening campaign but the article did not adequately address issues of birth cohorts to be further considered Nakamura J, et al87 Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine 2008;215(1):33 -42 Developed (Japan); to evaluate the cost - effectiveness of a systematic strategy for the screening for HCV in the higher -risk and general populations.

Comparisons were made in the general population and higher -risk group. Stratified analysis by age was performed, and death rate was estimated by the Abridged Life Table for Japan in 20 04 99,001 people in the general population were screened, and 42,538 in the higher -risk group were screened; 0.36% (358) patients were positive in the general population and 0.81% (345) patients were positive in the higher -risk population. In both groups, the infection rate was lower in the 40 -49 and 50 - 59 age group. Screening in the general population resulted in a greater overall cost in comparison to a no -screening strategy. However, since a screening strategy in both populations was below $50,000/ life expectancy year gained, a national screening strategy was considered cost - effective compared to a no - screening strategy. The younger age group would benefit more from a national screening program +; the cost conversion should be clarified to determine if t he true cost of test and treatment in Japan can be equated to the true cost of screening and treatment in the U.S. or Canada. Acceptable threshold for incremental cost - effectiveness ratio appeared comparable to the usual threshold in U.S. and Canada. Preva lence based on actual data; assumed all identified through screening and did not address whether any of population previously screened/ diagnosed; assumed all cases identified chronic and all received treatment.

Used published literature to obtain estimates; lifetime, societal perspective for cost - effectiveness diagnoses were considered equivalent; however, general population screening was still cost-effective versus current guidelines. Sensitivity analyses still supported conclusions even when assumptions relatively unfavourable to general population screening were used; general population screening considered cost -effective as long as prevalence >0.53% rates of referral, treatment and cure along with the changes in screening considered and treatment in the initial year, rather than over several years as is more likely; did not consider costs of scaling up clinical services to manage chronic HCV cases Helsper CW, et al88 Epidemiology and Infections 2012;140(1):58 -69 Developed (Netherlands); general population; general population and support program for primary care; drug users Data from pilot campaigns intended to improve HCV awareness and case finding was used to build a mathematical model to estimate incremental cost - effectiveness ratio of 3 different campaign strategies: (1) campaign aimed at people at increased risk within the general public without support for primary care, (2) campaign aimed at general public with support for primary care and (3) campaign aimed at drug users Prevalence in the general population in the Netherlands estimated 0.1 -0.4%; estimated only 25% of chronic HCV carriers have b een diagnosed; estimated prevalence in injection drug users 47 -79%. Pilot study of general population campaign without primary care support did not lead to any new HCV diagnoses, so this strategy determined not cost-effective. The same campaign but with pr imary care supports (courses + 2 facilitators who visited general practitioners by appointment to provide info about HCV, and the campaign was considered cost-effective (QALY \u20ac17,000 per case identified).

Key issue for drug users campaign was age at testing, but influence of 10 different parameters was considered, and this campaign was still cost-effective, even though QALYs were reduced by the assumption of a 15 - year shorter life expectancy for drug users .

This was more cost -effective than the general population and support campaign, and w ould be cost - effective with any reasonable assumptions in sensitivity analysis (QALY - \u20ac6,700 per case identified) higher -risk people might improve outcomes. Recommended consideration of integrating screening for HBV and HIV as well, since same groups at higher risk public in the absence of supports to improve primar y care response are likely to be ineffective McGarry LJ, et al86 Hepatology 2012;55(5):1344 -55 Developed (United States); a Markov model of the natural history of HCV to assess the potential costs and benefits of a birth - cohort screening prog ram by considering screening, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of HCV in the U.S. population. Model population for the primary analysis consisted of individuals born 1946 -1970 eligible for screening. Population born before 1946 or after 1970 assumed to be screened based on risk - based screening protocols Only direct medical care costs was considered for the study. Several estimations were made based on results from published studies. Disease progression and mortality rates from advanced liver disease by sex and age at infection were derived from a published model that synthesized data from primary sources. Mortality rates were estimated from U.S. population averages. Administrative claims analysis was used to estimate the population proportion screened, and the probability of infection among screened individuals under current risk -based screening practice. Treatment eligibility was estimated from studies, and treatment efficacy from clinical trials. Utility values for each health state were derived from publi shed studies and Outcomes evaluated were cases of advanced liver disease avoided and HCV -related deaths averted. Current risk - based screening for all 40 - to 64-year -olds in 2010 was the least costly strategy. Targeted birth cohort screening for all 40- to 64 -year -olds yielded the most benefits in terms of QALYs. Targeted screening of the older subgroups 45 -64 and 50-59 were more costly and less effective and were removed from consideration. A 5-year program of birth coho rt screening led to fewer cases of compensated cirrhosis and advanced liver disease. Mortality associated with HCV was reduced. The cost of cohort screening was $80.4 billion versus $53.7 billion for risk-based screening, although cohort screening provides additional quality -adjusted survival Study estimated that a screening program targeting birth cohort born from 1947 -1970 was likely to be cost-effective at a U.S. and European willingness -to-pay threshold. The birth cohort screening program provided benefits by identifying HCV - infected people who would not otherwise have been screened. Other studies that found cohort screening not cost - effective did not examine specific age groups at elevated but moderate risk of HCV +; several estimates and assumptio ns were made based on results of other studies. Since data were combined from a variety of sources, validity could not be verified. Also cost estimates originated from multiple data sources and may not have reflected the true cost of diagnosis and manageme nt. Use of expert opinion for utility values may not have adequately reflected opinion of the population. Higher population prevalence of HCV and higher estimated proportion of infections undetected versus Canada, so results could not be directly applied t o Canadian setting Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 130 First Author Journal Reference Country/Study Population Methods Outcomes Additional Comments Strength of Evidence applied to age -specific national norms. All costs were expressed in 2010 U.S. dollars or inflated to 2010 U.S. dollars using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index for medical care services. Sensitivity analysis was based on estimates from the literature and expert opinion. Rein DB, et al81 Annals of Internal Medicine, 2012;156(4):263 -70 Developed (United States); adults born 1945 -1965 Cost -effectiveness simulation for 1 -time HCV antibody test screening of all adults having 1 or more visits to a primary care provider annually; took a lifetime, societal health care perspective In the U.S., HCV is most prevalent in adults born from 1945 -1965, and about 50 -75% of infected adults are unaware of their infection. In the base case analysis, birth cohort screeni ng identified 808,580 more cases of chronic HCV than the status quo, at a cost of $2,874 per case; assuming treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, screening would increase QALYs by 348,800 at a cost of $5.5 billion, or $15,700 per QALY gained. If screening was followed by direct -acting antiviral plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment, screening would increase QALYs by 532,200 at a cost of $19 billion, or $35,700 per QALY saved. Concluded that birth -cohort screening for HCV in primary care settings was cost -effective Sensitivity analysis showed incremental cost - effectiveness ratio most sensitive to sustained viral response to antiviral therapy, cost of therapy, discount rate used, and QALY losses assigned to disease states. Study was limited by lack of empirical data on screening and on direct -acting antiviral treatment in ordinary clinical settings Internal validity: ++ External validity for Canada: + Limitations with respect to empirical data noted would not negate the incremental cos t- effectiveness ratio reported with screening and current treatment, which was quite favourable. Main limitation was the lack of information on the feasibility/uptake of such an approach to screening: will providers and patients do this, and will referral and treatment uptake follow? Estimated prevalence of undiagnosed adults in Canada was substantially lower Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 131 First Author Journal Reference Country/Study Population Methods Outcomes Additional Comments Strength of Evidence than the estimates given here, and treatment costs may also differ, so it would be desirable to have this study replicated using Canadian data Recommendations for the Public Health Response to Hepatitis C in Ontario 132 Appendix J : Form for Notification of Canadian Blood Services About Newly Reported Infections EXTERNAL TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASE NOTIFICATION TO CANADIAN BLOOD SERVICES CONFIDENTIAL CLIENT INFORMATION Surname: First Name: Middle Name: All Previous WNV For HBV, Please Indicate Which Marker Was Tested: ___________________________ Copy Of Positive Test Report: Yes No (If available, please attach copy) Test Date (yyyy -mm-dd): Is Client Aware Of His/Her Diagnosis?
