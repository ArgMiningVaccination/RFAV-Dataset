Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the major autoimmune diseases of global prevalence. The use of the anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of RA is associated with severe adverse reactions and toxicity. This limitation has necessitated the search for novel therapeutic products. We report here a traditional Chinese medicine-based herbal formula, Huo luo xiao ling dan (HLXL), which has potent antiarthritic activity as validated in the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) model. HLXL (2.3 g/Kg) was fedto Lewis (RT.1 1) rats daily by gavage beginning at the onset of arthritis and then continued through the observation period. HLXL inhibited the severity of ongoing AA. This suppression of arthritis was associated with signicant alterations in the T cell proliferative and cytokine responses as well as the antibody response against the disease-related antigen, mycobacterial heat-shockprotein 65 (Bhsp65). There was a reduction in the level of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-1 but enhancement of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level. In addition, there was inhibition of both the anti-Bhsp65 antibody response and the serum level of nitric oxide. Thus, HLXL is a promising CAM modality for further testing in RA patients. 1. Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the major human autoimmune diseases a ecting about 1 per cent of the adult population [ 1,2]. The disease is characterized by inflammation of the synovial tissue and damage to thecartilage and bone of the joints, leading to severe deformities[1,3-5]. The precise etiologic agent in RA is not yet dened. The drugs that inhibit inflammatory reactions are a vitalcomponent of the therapeutic arsenal against RA [ 1,6,7]. However, the adverse reactions and toxicity associated withthe use of these drugs have expeditiously promoted theuse of natural plant products or procedures belonging tothe diverse traditional systems of medicine by patients withRA [ 8-14] and other chronic inflammatory disorders [ 15- 23]. This growing trend warrants a continuous search for new natural antiarthritic complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM) products with well-dened mechanisms ofaction. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) o ers a variety of herbal CAM products that have been used in the treatmentof patients with chronic inflammatory disorders for severaldecades [ 8-19]. However, many of these products have not been validated experimentally for their composition and/ormechanism of action. Huo luo xiao ling dan (HLXL), a TCM- based Chinese herbal formula, has been in use in China for the treatment of patients with a variety of disorders,including arthritis [ 24,25]. We have previously reported that2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine HLXL consisting of 11 herbs has anti-inflammatory activity as evident upon testing in an experimental model of pawedema [ 24,25]. In this study, based on the rat adjuvant- induced arthritis (AA) model of human RA [ 26,27], we report the immunological basis of the therapeutic e ect of HLXL against autoimmune arthritis. AA can be induced in Lewis (LEW) rats (RT.1 l)b y immunization with heat-killed M. tuberculosis H37Ra (Mtb) oil [ 26-28]. The mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 (Bhsp65) is one of the major antigenic targets of the T cellresponse of arthritic rats [ 28-31]. Our results show that HLXL suppresses the severity of ongoing inflammatory AA.Furthermore, this antiarthritic activity of HLXL is associatedwith changes in both the T cell and the antibody responsesagainst Bhsp65. Also altered was the level of serum nitricoxide (NO), a biochemical mediator of inflammation. Wesuggest that HLXL be considered for further evaluation of itsecacy as a CAM modality for the treatment of RA patients. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals. Male, 5- to 6-week-old Lewis (LEW/Hsd) (RT.1l) rats purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (HSD) (Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used in this study. This studyprotocol was approved by the University of Maryland Schoolof Medicine, Baltimore (UMB) and Institutional AnimalCare Use Committee (IACUC). The IACUC guidelines fol-low the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Careand Use of Laboratory Animals and the National ResearchCouncil Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.Furthermore, UMB is fully accredited by the Association forAssessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care(AAALAC) International. 2.2. Antigens. Recombinant mycobacterial heat-shock pro- tein 65 (Bhsp65) was prepared as described elsewhere [ 32]. Ovalbumin (Ova) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.Louis, MO), and puried protein derivative (PPD) waspurchased from Mycos Research (Fort Collins, CO). 2.3. Induction and Evaluation of Adjuvant Arthritis (AA). AA was induced in LEW rats by s.c. injection at the base of the tailof 1 mg/rat heat-killed M. tuberculosis H37Ra (Mtb) (Difco, Detroit, MI) in 200 \u00b5L of mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich). The severity of arthritis was graded on the basis of erythema and swelling as previously described [ 32,33]. The highest score for each paw was 4, and the total maximum score foreach rat was 16. The natural course of AA includes 4 phases:incubation (d 0-8), onset (d 9-11), peak (d 17-19), andrecovery (d 21-26). 2.4. Histopathological Evaluation of Hind Paw Joints of Rats. Hind paws of rats were harvested, skinned, and xed for 3-7 days with 10% phosphate-bu ered formalin (Fisher Sci- Lawn, the paws were decalciedin formic acid (Fisher Scientic), embedded in para n, and sectioned longitudinally (820 Microtome, Fisher Scientic).Tissue sections (5- m) were mounted on a glass slide, stainedwith hematoxylin-eosin (Sigma-Aldrich), and assessed for morphological changes and cellular inltrates [ 34]. 2.5. Composition, Characterization, and Toxicity of the CAM Modality, HLXL. The composition of the herbal formula huo luo xiao ling dan (HLXL), the method for its prepa-ration, and the assessment of toxicity of HLXL have beendescribed previously [ 24,25]. The The details of the acquisition, authentication, purity, processing,and extraction of the individual herbs, HPLC ngerprintingof HLXL mixture, information on voucher samples andpharmacopoeia, and toxicity are described elsewhere [ 24, 25]. The toxicity of HLXL was assessed by daily feeding of HLXL to LEW rats for 6 consecutive weeks and thenobserving these rats regularly for unusual behavioral changesand standard signs and symptoms of toxicity [ 25]. Blood biochemistry as well as full necropsy and histopathologicalexamination of tissues was also performed to assess toxicity.The control rats were fed with vehicle instead of HLXL. Taking all these parameters together, no adverse reactions or toxicity of HLXL were observed either at 2.3 or 4.6 g/kg [ 25]. 2.6. Treatment of Rats with HLXL. The rats were randomly divided into three groups following the onset of arthritis onday 11 after Mtb injection. The experimental group of ratswas fed HLXL (2.3 g/kg) daily by gavage beginning on day12 after Mtb injection and then continued throughout thecourse of AA. This dose was selected after a pilot study inwhich 3 doses (g/kg) of HLXL were tested: 1.15, 2.3, and4.6. The control group of rats received the vehicle (water) bygavage on the corresponding days. A third group of arthriticrats was fed methotrexate (MTX) (Sigma) (0.5 mg/kg), anestablished antiarthritic compound, as a positive control. Allthese rats were observed regularly for signs of arthritis. 2.7. Lymph Node Cell (LNC) Proliferation Assay. The drain- ing lymph nodes (inguinal, iliac, and popliteal) of rats were harvested on day 7 after the initiation of HLXL feeding. A single-cell suspension of lymph node cells (LNCs) from ratsof the respective group (experimental versus control) wasprepared separately and then cultured (5 \u00d7105cells/well of a 96-well plate) in serum-free HL-1 medium (BioWhittaker,Walkersville, MD). The cells were plated in replicates ( n =4) and cultured with antigen for 2 days as described in detailelsewhere [ 33,35]. Thereafter, 3[H]-thymidine (1 Ci/well) was added to these LNCs and the cells cultured for another16 h [ 33,35], and then the cells were harvested onto a printed glass ber lter. The incorporation of radioactivityin proliferating cells was measured using a liquid scintillationcounter. The results were expressed either as counts perEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 minute (cpm) or as a stimulation index (the ratio of cpm in the presence of antigen and cpm of cells in mediumalone). Bhsp65 (6.5 g/ml) was used as the test antigen, while PPD (30 g/ml) and Ova (40 g/ml) served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The indicated optimalconcentrations of di erent antigens used were selected after dose titrations in preliminary experiments. 2.8. Isolation of Synovium-Inltrating Cells (SIC) and the Preparation of Cell Lysate. The ankle region of an arthritic rat was nicked in the metatarsal area. After removal of theskin and supercial tendons, the articular cavity was openedup from the lateral side. Thereafter, the synovial tissue wasdissected out into the culture medium placed in a petridish. This dissected tissue was digested for 1 h at 37 Ci n Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing was then ltered through anylon mesh and washed extensively with PBS. The collectedcells were lysed in 250 ll y s i sb u er (Bio-rad), and the supernate was harvested for testing of cytokine levels. 2.9. Testing of the Cytokine Response (A) Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT- PCR). The LNCs were restimulated with antigen for 48 h as in an LNC proliferation assay. The total RNA extracted fromthese LNCs was reverse -transcribed to cDNA and then tested in qRT-PCR using specic for the genes encoding and platinum SYBR Green [36,37]. The levels of cytokine mRNA were normalized to that of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferasegene ( hprt), and the results were presented as the relative gene expression levels. (B) Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The supernates of lysed by ELISA for TNF- and IL-1in the cytokine core facility of UMB. The cytokine levels were normalized tothe total protein content which was measured by Bio-RadProtein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). 2.10. Measurement of the Level and Isotype of Anti-Bhsp65 Antibodies. The sera of the test and control group of rats (n =3 each) were added at a dilution of 1 : 100 each to antigen-coated wells (100 ng/well) of a high-binding ELISAplate (Greiner Bio-One) [ 35,38]. The plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then the wells were washedthoroughly. The plate-bound total Ig or the IgG1/IgG2aisotype was detected by using the appropriate horseradishperoxidase-conjugated goat antirat antibodies (Zymed). Thecolor intensity was read as optical density (O.D.) at 450nm using a Vmax ELISA autoreader (Molecular Devices)[35,38]. 2.11. Determination of the Serum Nitric Oxide (NO) Levels.

Ova served as the control antigen. The results of the proliferation assay were expressed as mean stimulation index (SI) \u00b1SEM. The cpm value for PPD was 9,240 (the control group) and 5,577 (HLXL group). For cytokines, the level of mRNA for IL-17 (b), IFN- (c), and IL-10 (d) was measured by qRT-PCR, normalized to HPRT expression, and compared with that of cells in medium. The results of a representative experiment ( n=3 per group) are shown. The data are expressed as \"fold relative to cells in the medium\" . (,P<. 05;,P<. 01). arthritis appeared about 10 days after Mtb injection of the LEW rats. Accordingly, HLXL, MTX, or water was administered daily to rats from day 12 to day 23 of Mtbinjection. The results ( Figure 1(a) ) show that both the HLXL-fed and the MTX-fed LEW rats had signicantlyreduced arthritic scores compared to that of the water-fedcontrol rats. The reduction in the severity of arthritis wassignicant between day 16 and day 20 ( P<. 01 at day 16 and day 18,P<. 05 at day 20) for the HLXL group (test group),and between day 14 and day 20 ( P<. 01 at day 14, day 16 and 18,P<. 05 at day 20) for the MTX group (positive control group). However, the suppressive e ect of HLXL on arthritis was relatively less marked than that of MTX ( P<. 01 at day 16,P<. 05 at day 16). Histopathological analyses of the hind paws showed that on day 18, the extent of the inflammatorycell inltration as well as bone and cartilage destruction wasmuch less in HLXL-fed rats ( Figure 1(c) ) than that in the c o n t r o lr a t s( Figure 1(b) ).Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 00.511.522.5O.D 450 nm (total Ig) d1 9 Vehicle HLXL (b) Figure 3: HLXL inhibited the antibody response to Bhsp65 of LEW rats with AA.

The results were expressed as optical density (O.D.) Treatment with HLXL suppressed IL-1 production by the synovium-inltrating cells of arthritic rats. The levels of IL-1 (a) and TNF-(b) in SIC harvested from the water-fed and HLXL-treated rats ( n=3 per group) on d 19 after Mtb injection were determined by ELISA. The results were expressed as pg/mg. (P<. 05). 3.2. HLXL Diminished the T Cell Proliferative Response and Deviated the Cytokine Response to Bhsp65 in ArthriticLEW Rats. We next investigated the immunological changes associated with the decreased severity of AA following HLXLtreatment. We tested the Bhsp65-specic proliferative andcytokine responses of the draining LNCs of arthritic LEW rats. The HLXL-fed rats showed a signicantly ( P<. 001) reduced T cell proliferative response to Bhsp65 compared tothat of the control rats ( Figure )6 Complementary nitric oxide (mM) d1 1 d1 9 Vehicle HLXL Figure 5: The influence of HLXL on the level of serum NO in arthritic LEW rats.

We also measured the serum levels of total Ig as well as isotype-specic IgG2a and IgG1 anti-Bhsp65 antibodiesat di erent time points after the onset of arthritis. The levels of both the total immunoglobulins (Ig) and the IgG2aantibodies against Bhsp65 in HLXL-fedats versus the levelsof the respective antibody type in the water-fed controls werecomparable on d 11, but signicantly lower on d 19 ( P<. 01 for total P<. 05 for 3(a) and 3(b) ). The level of IgG1 was barely above the background (data notshown). 3.4. HLXL-Mediated Reduction in the Level of IL-1 in the T arget Organ-Inltrating Cells in Arthritic Rats. T o study the HLXL-induced in vivo modulation of the inflammatoryresponse, the SICs were collected from the joints of HLXL-fed rats and water-fed rats on d 19 after Mtb injectionand then tested for cytokine levels by 42% ( P<. 001), but without any change in the level of TNF- compared to that of the water-fed group ( Figure 4 ). 3.5. Rats Treated with HLXL Revealed Reduced Levels of Serum Nitric Oxide (NO). Sera of HLXL-fed rats showed reduced level of NO at d 19 ( P<. 05) ( Figure 5 ), and this reduction in NO level showed an association with a reduction in theseverity of arthritis.4. Discussion The results of this study, based on the rat AA model,have revealed that HLXL, a traditional Chinese medicine-based herbal formula, can suppress the ongoing disease. Theantiarthritic activity of this CAM modality was associatedwith signicant changes in the T cell proliferative andcytokine prole of the draining lymph node by the synovial tissue-derived cells, Bhsp65, and the level of serum nitricoxide (NO). Arthritic LEW rats raise T cell response to Bhsp65 during the course of AA [ 28-32]. The Mtb-primed pathogenic T cells include subsets of T cells reactive against Bhsp65 [ 27, 39,40]. It is conceivable that an antiarthritic compound might limit the development of arthritis in part by reducingthe activation and expansion of Bhsp65-reactive T cells. Infact, HLXL-fed LEW rats showed reduced T cell proliferativeresponse to Bhsp65 compared to the control water-fed rats.In addition, HLXL feeding induced a signicant alterationin response of Bhsp65-reactive T cells thatfacilitated the inhibitory e ect of the herbal mixture on inflammatory arthritis. The majority of the literature on AAis based on Th1 type of arthritogenic response [ 27,39]. Accordingly, a Th2 type of response would be counter- regulatory for the Th1 type of response [ 41-43]. In addition, in the last decade, the role of IL-17 in the pathogenesisof arthritis is increasingly being realized [ 44-46] through studies in the animal models of arthritis, including AA[37,47-49]a sw e l la sp a t i e n t sw i t hR A[ 50-52]. In view of the above cytokine-mediated events in the pathogenesisof autoimmune arthritis, it is anticipated that a potentialantiarthritic compound might skew the cytokine milieutowards a predominantly anti-inflammatory type [ 41-43, 46]. This can be achieved by enhancing the Th2 response and/or reducing the pathogenic Th1/Th17 response. Ourresults showed that feeding of HLXL to arthritic LEW ratsindeed enhanced the Th2 (IL-10) response and concomi-tantly reduced the Th17 (IL-17) response. However, therealso was an unexpected increase in the Th1 (IFN- ) response. This cytokine balance was unanticipated in the contextof the Th1-Th2 paradigm of cytokine-based regulation[41-43,46], which would have predicted a reduced IFN- coupled with an enhanced IL-10 leading to deviation of the cytokine response to a predominantly Th2 type.Nevertheless, the observed increase in IFN- matched with the concurrent reduction in IL-17. It has been reported byother investigators that IFN- can downregulate the IL-17 response [ 45,49]. Similarly, a study from our laboratory also revealed that tolerization with Bhsp65 reduced IL-17production but enhanced IFN- response [ 37], supporting the idea of IFN- -mediated regulation of IL-17. We suggest that the HLXL-induced increase in IFN- inhibits the IL-17 response, which in turn cooperates with the enhanced IL-10 response to downmodulate the severity of inflammatoryarthritis in LEW rats. At present, we do not know the precisemechanism by which HLXL suppresses the IL-17 response.Nevertheless, the results of our current study combinedwith the recently reported success of a derivative of theEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 Activation and proliferation of antigen (Bhsp65)-reactive eector T cells Pathogenic cytokines Inhibition Induction Figure 6: A schematic representation of the diverse mechanisms involved in HLXL-induced immunomodulation of adjuvant arthritis. HLXL suppressed arthritis via the induction of disease-regulating cytokine s coupled with the inhibition of pathogenic events that facilitated the initiation and propagation of arthritis. (IFN-has a dual role in autoimmunity.) plant alkaloid febrifugine in inhibiting the di erentiation of Th17 cells and suppressing autoimmunity [ 53] highlight the signicance of dening the mechanisms of action of CAMproducts for fully exploiting their therapeutic potential. The above-mentioned HLXL-induced changes involve the cytokines produced primarily by the T cells. We alsoexamined the e ect of HLXL on two of the major arthritis- related cytokines (IL-1 and TNF- ) produced by the synovial tissue from the joints of arthritic mice and rats [ 54- 57]. Macrophage is one of the main cell types producing these two cytokines. Our results showed that HLXL feedingsignicantly reduced the levels of IL-1 but without much eect on TNF- . Although both of these cytokines have been shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis of RA [ 3,57, 58], HLXL feeding induced a di erential e ect on the two cytokines in AA. IL-1 induces a cascade of inflammatory reactions that eventually lead to tissue damage. The blocking of IL-1by immunochemicals (e.g., anticytokine antibody) is being explored as a therapeutic approach for RA [ 3,57,58]. In this regard, the results showing HLXL-induced inhibitionof the IL-1 production are of signicance. Arthritic LEW rats develop not only T cell response to Bhsp65 but also antibodies to the same antigen [ 31,38]. Antibodies play an important role in the development ofarthritis in CIA and K/BXN model of arthritis [ 59-63], but the role of antibodies in the initiation or propagationof AA is not yet clear. Our results show that HLXL-fedrats had a signicant reduction both in the titers of anti-Bhsp65 antibodies and the severity of arthritis on d 19 afterdisease induction. These results using HLXL in a therapeuticregimen in AA are supported by the results of two ofour previous studies based on a preventive regimen forAA, one using green tea [ 64] and the other using HLXL [65]. We suggest that HLXL has an inhibitory e ect on the production of a potentially disease-promoting subsetof antibodies, which might mediate their pathogenic e ect, for example, via activation of the complement pathway[62,63]. However, at present, it is not clear whether a reduced antibody response of HLXL-fed rats contributesdirectly or indirectly to the reduced arthritic severity, or itsimply reflects an epiphenomenon whereby HLXL feedingreduces the production of antibodies but without any e ect on disease severity. HLXL feeding to LEW rats reduced the levels of serum NO which is one of the biochemical mediators of inflamma-tion [ 55,66-68]. NO has been shown to have a pathogenic role in the development of arthritis in animal models aswell as RA patients [ 55,66 -68]. In our study, the timing of maximal inhibition of NO levels directly correlated with that of the signicant reduction in the severity of AA. However, atpresent, it is not clear whether NO is the cause or the e ect of reduced arthritis severity in HLXL-fed rats. Nevertheless, theresults suggest that NO might serve as one of the biomarkersfor monitoring the anti-inflammatory e ects of HLXL in vivo in the AA model. We observed suppression of arthritis in rats treated with HLXL beginning on d 12 after disease induction and thencontinuing daily HLXL feeding throughout the rest of thecourse of arthritis. Typically, in control rats treated withvehicle alone, the severity of arthritis peaked around d16 followed by a gradual, spontaneous decline in diseaseseverity after another 3-4 days. Considering the componentof spontaneous recovery of clinical arthritis in the AA model,additional investigations would be needed to determine the8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine relative e cacy of HLXL in preventing the development of peak arthritic symptoms owing to an early (starting HLXLfeeding on d 12) intervention versus that in suppressingarthritis at the peak phase of the disease following a lateintervention (starting on d 16). Similarly, the comparativeantiarthritic activity of the herbal mixture versus that of its individual component herbs remains to be determined. HLXL consists of 11 component herbs, some of whichhave been used individually or in di erent combinations in TCM for the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatoryconditions [ 24,25]. One notable component among these is represented by Boswellia carterii or a related species and its bioactive chemical constituents, boswellic acids, whichwe have previously shown to possess anti-inflammatory andantiarthritic activity [ 69] and to induce cytokine deviation to the Th2 type [ 70]. It is likely that there are additional chemical constituents besides the boswellic acids withinHLXL that not only contribute to its anti-inflammatory andantiarthritic activity, but also help in limiting the toxicityof the herbal mixture. In TCM, the relative proportion ofdierent components of a herbal mixture is aimed at deriving a formula that has optimal e cacy but minimal side e ects. Moreover, there might be unique combination e ects of the component herbs in a herbal mixture [ 71,72]. In summary, HLXL, a traditional Chinese medicine- based CAM modality, has therapeutic antiarthritic activity astested in the rat AA model. The HLXL-induced inhibitionof ongoing AA involved signicant changes in the cellularas well as humoral immune responses to the disease-relatedantigen, Bhsp65 ( Figure 6 ). Notably, HLXL the proinflammatory with Also, there was attenuation of the anti-Bhsp65 antibody response and reduction in the level of NO,a known mediator of inflammation. On the basis of ourresults in the AA model, we suggest that HLXL is a promisingtherapeutic agent that should be tested further in preclinicaltrials in RA patients.
