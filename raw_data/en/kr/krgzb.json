Body washes that are free from parabens, sulphates, phthalates, artificial fragrances and other harmful ingredients. Most of these body washes are formulated with natural, organic ingredients that are also vegan, cruelty free and good for the planet. Did you know that our skin is our largest organ? And many of the ingredients that we put on our skin get absorbed directly into our bloodstream, meaning that they can then impact every organ in our body. That is why it's so important that the ingredients you are using on your skin be non toxic and safe for health. Unfortunately, the regulations for the personal care industry are rather lacking in many countries (including both Canada and the US), which means that harmful ingredients, toxic chemicals, toxic ingredients, synthetic fragrances, and other skin irritants can end up in the products that are sold to consumers. That is why it's important to always read product labels and only choose personal care products made with safe, non toxic ingredients. When it comes to body washes, luckily there are now many brands that make your health and safety their priority, and formulate their products with safe ingredients. More and more brands are using natural, organic ingredients that are also often vegan, cruelty free, fragrance free and nontoxic. In this post I will share a collection of 20 non toxic body washes that are great for all ages and all skin types.

Frequently asked questions: When reading body wash ingredients, one of the main ingredients to watch out for and avoid is fragrance or parfume. Fragrances are considered to be trade secrets in personal care products, meaning the company doesn't have to disclose what ingredients are in their fragrances, and often the fragrances are where hormone disruptors and other harmful ingredients such as phthalates are found. Dove body wash is sulfate free and paraben free but they do contain artificial fragrances. Therefore, Dove body wash would not be considered non toxic and it would be best to avoid it. Sadly, many body washes on the market contain ingredients that can be dangerous or harmful to our health. They can contain ingredients that can irritate the skin, contribute to hormone imbalances, infertility, and other negative health effects. Luckily, more and more brands are starting to formulate their products with safe and non toxic ingredients, so be sure to choose brands that focus on your safety.
