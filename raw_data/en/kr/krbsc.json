Compensation; Other Important Terms and Conditions Unless otherwise specifically agreed, our fees are based primarily on our hourly billing rates for attorneys, paralegals, and other professionals as applied to the amount of time that we expend in providing services. Our base hourly rates for work performed by our attorneys, absent special engagements or circumstances, currently range from $305 for new associates to $975 for senior partners. Paralegal and legal assistant hourly rates currently range from $240 to $425 per hour. My standard 2022 hourly rate is $630, and the standard 2022 hourly rates for Steven W. Krohne and Mark R.

Sincerely yours, ICE MILLER LLP Kay E. Pashos Acknowledged and Agreed: WATER SERVICE CORPORATION OF KENTUCKY Date: By: Print ed Name and Title Enclosures: Terms and Conditions of Engagements for Legal Services Copy of Engagement Letter cc: Accounting Department NBI@icemiller.com President 04/21/22 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-12 Page 3 of 53Water Service Corporation of Kentucky April 19, 2022 Page 4 4895-7046-4524.3Ice Miller Fee Estimate for 2022 Kentucky Rate Case You requested that we provide an estimate of attorneys' fees relating to representation of Water Service Corporation of Kentucky (\"WSCK\") in its upcoming water/wastewater rate case before the Kentucky Public Service Commission (\"Commission\"). Our fees for legal services are based on our stated hourly rates (which are discounted for WSCK), consequently the amount of the resulting fee for legal services in connection with representing WSCK in a general rate case will vary as a direct result of the amount of time we devote to the representation. While we have not represented WSCK in its prior rate cases, we have represented multiple utilities in numerous rate and other cases before various state commissions and we reviewed the orders and testimony in WSCK's last base rate case. Based on a review of the filings in those proceedings, we derived our estimate assuming the performance of typical legal services in a fully-litigated case before the Commission ( i.e., preparing the case-in-chief and other procedural filings, reviewing and editing drafts of direct and rebuttal testimony, reviewing and drafting responses to discovery requests, preparing for and participating in hearings, communicating with representatives of WSCK and other parties, and preparing a proposed order and related briefs). We have also factored in the availability of and assistance from your local counsel. Our best estimate is that the fee for legal services would be approximately $200,000 in a fully-litigated proceeding, broken down as follows: Prefiling strategy - $20,000 Preparation of case-in-chief - $50,000 Preparation of rebuttal case - $30,000 Discovery - $25,000 Settlement negotiations - $10,000 Hearing prep and hearings - $35,000 Post-hearing filings - $25,000 Misc. motions, pleadings - $5,000 This estimate does not include any expansion of the proceeding, nor services required to represent WSCK in any rehearing before the Commission, or in any appeal of the final order to Kentucky appellate courts. Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-12 Page 4 of 534895-7046-4524.3ICE MILLER LLP Terms and Conditions of Engagements for Legal Services Ice Miller LLP has prepared this statement of the terms and conditions that are generally applicable to its legal services representations of its clients, in the absence of an express agreement specifically to the contrary. These terms and conditions, together with the letter or other document that references them, are the Terms and Conditions applicable to our engagement by you. When used in this document, \"we\" or \"us\" or \"our\" and similar terms refer to Ice Miller LLP, a limited liability partnership, and \"you\" or \"your\" and similar terms refer to the person or persons specifically identified in this statement as the client or clients of Ice Miller LLP. Our Responsibilities We are responsible to provide legal services to you in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and with our express understandings with you concerning the nature and scope of our representation. Your Responsibilities You are responsible for paying our statements for services and expenses. You also are responsible for being candid and cooperative with us and for keeping us informed with complete and accurate information, documents and other communications relevant to the subject matter of our representation or otherwise requested by us. Because it is important that we be able to contact our clients at all times in order to consult with them regarding our representation, we expect that you will inform us, in writing, of any changes in the name, address, telephone number, contact person, e-mail address, state of incorporation or other relevant changes regarding you and your business or affairs. If you affiliate with, acquire or your company is acquired by or merged with another company, you will provide us with sufficient notice to permit us to withdraw as your attorneys if we determine that such an affiliation, acquisition or merger creates a conflict of interest between any of our clients and the other party to such affiliation, acquisition or merger, or if we determine that it is not in the best interests of the Firm with respect to the resulting association with the new entity. Your failure to communicate and cooperate with us in these respects could have an adverse effect on our ability to effectively and efficiently represent your interests in this matter and may require that we suspend the rendition of further services in respect of or entirely withdraw from this engagement. Client(s) Represented The client or clients for this engagement are as specifically identified in the engagement letter. Our client(s) do not include natural persons or entities that are not identified as a client in the engagement letter. For clients that are companies, unless otherwise specified or agreed, this does not include individuals or persons who are shareholders, partners, members or owners of the company, or its officers, directors, managers or other representatives, or family members, nor does it include affiliates of the company. Our representation of you for the matter described in the engagement letter does not give rise to a lawyer-client relationship with any such other individual, person or affiliate. Accordingly our representation of you will not give rise to a conflict of interest in the event other clients of ours are or become adverse to any such other individual, person or affiliate. For clients that are trade associations or other group-type organizations, our clients would not include their members or other constituents. How We Will Work For You We provide services to you through our attorneys and other professionals. We will designate a mutually agreeable partner whom you may contact should you have any questions or concerns at any time about our representation of you or your interests. You will keep us advised of the name(s) and contact information of the person(s) who are authorized to instruct us as to the performance of our legal services for you. Our engagement is for legal services. While from time to time we may share with you as part of our legal advice information and insights based on our experience with respect to certain market, industry or business practices, structures, or the like, it is understood that you will be solely responsible for determining the extent to which other professional services and advice are obtained and for making all decisions concerning business, investment and accounting matters. In addition, it is understood that we will not have any responsibility to investigate the character or credit of any person with whom you may be dealing in connection with any matter directly or indirectly related to our engagement. How We May Communicate With You Unless you instruct otherwise in writing, we may communicate with you using unencrypted e-mail, facsimile transmission and cellular telephone with the understanding that these methods carry an inherent risk of interception. About Our Fees We will charge you fees based upon the time expended and other factors applicable to legal fees that are specified by applicable professional rules and standards. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, our fees are based on our hourly rates as applied to the amount of time that we expend in providing services. Our base hourly rates for work Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-12 Page 5 of 534895-7046-4524.3performed by our attorneys, absent special engagements or circumstances, are established effective January 1 of each calendar year. Hourly rates may change periodically without prior notice to clients, typically after the end of each calendar year, but a current schedule for anyone working on your engagement is available at any time upon request. Payment of our fees and other charges is in no way contingent on the outcome of any matter, unless and to the extent that there is a mutual written agreement to the contrary. Other Charges and Expenses Our charges for ancillary services and expenses, such as photocopying, computer research, electronic data discovery services, mileage, travel expenses and other similar charges are pursuant to a schedule of charges and expenses, as the same is revised from time to time, a copy of which is available to you upon request. Estimates The total amount of fees and costs relating to this matter are difficult to predict. Accordingly, we have made no commitment to you concerning the maximum fees and costs that will be necessary to resolve or complete this matter. If requested to provide an estimate of our fees for a given matter, we will endeavor in good faith to provide our best estimate, but unless there is a mutual written agreement to a fixed fee, the actual fees incurred on any project will likely differ from the estimate. Billing Procedures Unless we agree to an alternative billing arrangement, you will receive a statement on a monthly basis for services rendered, and for costs and other charges posted to your account, in the prior month. Payment is due upon receipt of our billing statement or within 30 days thereafter. If your account becomes more than 30 days past due, our Billing and Collection Committee will decide whether additional legal work will be performed while the account remains past due, taking into account obligations we owe to you under applicable professional conduct rules. While we typically do not charge interest on past due amounts, we reserve the right to charge interest on any amount invoiced that remains unpaid after 30 days at the rate of 1% per month until paid in full, plus all costs of collection (including reasonable attorneys' fees). Any questions or disagreements should be brought to our attention in writing within 60 days of the billing date. Retainers As a matter of standard practice for new clients and/or new matters, we typically request a retainer deposit before we begin work, and we may request retainers or additional retainers from time to time with respect to existing clients and existing matters. Unless there is a mutual written agreement to the contrary, we will hold any such retainers in our firm's agency account until disbursed in accordance with these terms and conditions or other mutual written agreement. We may apply funds held as retainers to any past due account balance of your account. We will return any unapplied excess of your retainers to you within a reasonable period of time following the conclusion of the related engagement. Unless we determine in our discretion to apply all or a portion of the retainers sooner, we will apply the retainers to the final invoice for the related engagement. If we determine for any client or matter to initially waive the required retainer deposit, we nonetheless reserve the right at a later date to require a retainer deposit if conditions concerning either the extent or nature of the matter in our discretion so warrant, or should our statements not be timely paid as expected. Your Consent to Future Conflicts of Interest You are aware that the Firm has grown geographically and represents many other entities and individuals. Thus, during the time that we are representing you, some of our present or future clients may have disputes or transactions with you or other interests that may be adverse to yours. As part of this engagement, you agree that we may undertake in the future to represent existing or new clients in any matter that is not substantially related to any matter as to which we have represented or advised you, even if the interests of such clients in those other matters are directly or indirectly adverse to yours, and you agree not to disqualify our Firm for those conflicting representations. Of course, we agree that we will keep confidential any information of a nonpublic nature provided to us as a result of our representation of you. You acknowledge that we may obtain confidential information as a result of our representation of other clients that might be of interest to you but for the same reasons cannot be shared with you. Document Retention Unless you indicate otherwise to us in writing, we will assume that all papers and property that you provide to us are duplicates and that you retain all originals, so that we do not need to return them to you. When the representation concludes, we will (if you request) return any papers and property that you have provided to us (or that we have obtained for you and that belong to you) if we have them in our possession. Our drafts and work product that we create in relation to our work for you, however, belong to us. We reserve the right, subject to any applicable laws or rules of professional responsibility to the contrary, to apply records retention policies and procedures to these items and also to destroy within a reasonable time any items described in this paragraph that are retained by us.

As used herein, \"personal data\" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, to the extent that such personal data are associated with individuals in the European Economic Area or are otherwise within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Response to Audit Inquiries If you ask that we do so, we will respond to your auditors concerning certain \"loss contingencies\" as defined by accounting standards by preparing a letter to your auditors. To assist us in responding timely to your auditors, please direct all audit inquiries to: Audit Letter Coordinator Ice Miller LLP One American Square, Suite 2900 Indianapolis, Indiana 46282-0200. If there are any questions presented by your audit inquiry letter, our Audit Letter Coordinator will contact you. Absent special circumstances, our current fee structure for the preparation of these letters is a minimum of $300 and a maximum of $700, depending on the extent and number of any matters reported. However, the fee may exceed $700 if there are many matters to be reported upon, or if the letter requires extensive substantive attention to disclosure or other related issues. This charge will appear on your statement as a line item for \"Services rendered in connection with preparation of response to audit inquiry.\" Termination or Withdrawal Both you and we have the right to terminate any engagement at any time after providing reasonable advance written notice, and our withdrawal or termination is further subject to applicable rules of professional responsibility.

Lubertozzi Senior Vice President, North Region Corix Company 500 W. Monroe Street, Suite 3600 Chicago, IL 60661- 3779 RE: Wat er Service of Kentucky Dear Mr. Lubertozzi : ScottMadden, Inc. (\"ScottMadden\") is pleased to provide this engagement letter to Corix Company (\"Corix\" or the \"Company\") in response to your request for a proposal for a wage and benefit study and supporting testimony for Co rix's operating subsidiary, Water Service Kentucky (\"WSK \"). We understand Corix expects to file a rate case on behalf of WSK before the Kentucky Public Service Commission (\" KY PSC\") in Spring 2022. The remainder of this letter describes ScottMadden's proposed approach to this engagement and summarizes our proposed commercial terms. SCOPE OF WORK It is our expectation that the requested consulting services encompass the following: Evaluat e the pay range competitiveness for 19 benchmark positions, including 13 positions within WSK's organization and six positions within the Corix organization that are salaried. These positions are allocated, in part , to WSK ; Determine the competitiveness of WSK's pay practices, health, and retirement benefit offerings ; and Provide WSK with a wage and benefit report supported by a direct testimony and exhibit . It is also our understanding that the following consulting services may be required: Responding to data requests from opposing parties; Reviewing and analyzing the direct, rebuttal, and surrebuttal testimonies of other parties to the case (if required); Preparing rebuttal and rejoinder testimony (if required); Testifying before the KY PSC on issues related to the wage and benefit study and associated filed testimonies (if required); Assisting in the preparation of testimony in support of settlement, should the case be negotiated and settled by stipulation; and Assisting in the preparation of legal briefs (if required). Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-12 Page 22 of 53Methodology ScottMadden will conduct a wage and benefit analysis by comparing WSK's wages and benefits for the 19 positions detailed in the Scope of Work to study and compare to comparable positions from a combination of public and private data sets : Public data sets will include information from the Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics ; salary informati on represents all payroll tax reporting entities located in the same or similar regional areas where WSK has operations . Private data sets will include salary and benefit information from Economic Research Institute's (\"ERI\") Salary Assessor tool, and Salary.com's CompAnalyst tool (formerly owned by IBM) . ERI's Salary Assessor tool compiles pay data from hundreds of published data sources for thousands of job titles . Salary.com's CompAnalyst tool includes Human Resources -reported executive and general staff compensation data from more than 2,600 organizations across industries. CompAnalyst also includes detailed pay practices and benefits . ScottMadden may also supplement these data sources with a custom survey of relevant local peer companies , particularly to supplement information about benefits not included in the public or private data source ci ted above. These data sources and methodologies are similar to those commonly utilized in other utility rate cases filed in Kentucky and many other jurisdictions across the U.S. Once the in- scope positions have been mapped to comparable positions in each of the proposed data sets, WSK's salary and benefit information will be evaluated against the benchmarks to determine how they compare to market averages, minimums , midpoints, and maximums for each position at the local, state and national levels . Data adjustments may also be made to the benchmark data to account for changes in pay structures over time ( i.e., between the effective dates for the data sources and the date of WSK's rate case filing ), cost- of-labor differentials among different regions, and other adjustments. Finally, our findings will be summarized for each position by base pay, total compensation, supplemental pay, paid leave, health benefits, and retirement . Findings and conclusions will be provided for the organization as a whole for all in -scope positions. Work Product The results of the wage and benefit study will be summarized in a report format and provided to the Company. All associated work product related to the wage and benefit study , i.e., draft testimonies and accompany ing exhibits, draft data request responses, etc. will be provided in accordance with the schedule set by the Company. Data Requirements and Schedule An initial data request will be distributed upon acceptance of this proposal. Any additional data required to complete the study will be requested in a timely fashion so the wage and benefit report , accompanying direct testimony , and exhibit will be completed before the filing date. PROJECT TEAM Dylan W. D'Ascendis, Partner, will serve as engagement lead, and Quentin Watkins, Benchmarking Manager, will serve as the expert witness in this proceeding. Mr. Watkins will be supported by Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-12 Page 23 of 53ScottMadden's team of highly qualified consultants and analysts, as needed. Mr. D'Ascendis' and Mr. Watkins' detailed resumes are included as Attachment A to this engagement letter. PROPOSED COMMERCI AL TERMS For the purpose of a wage and benefit study and accompany ing ready -to-file direct testimony and exhibit, ScottMadden proposes a fixed fee of $37,000. With respect to the preparation of rebuttal testimony, responding to discovery, hearing preparation and attendance, and post -hearing assistance for the filing, we would bill for services on a time and materials basis at the rates provided in Table 1, below. Please note that ScottMadden's normal practice is to invoice monthly for professional fees and travel expenses (w ith no mark -up), as well as for reasonable direct expenses, as incurred, with no additional mark -up.

Whitney President Water Service Corporation of Kentucky, Inc. 1921 Hamilton Avenue Cleveland, Ohio 44114 Dear Seth: This is my proposal to provide direct testimony for Water Service Corporation of Kentucky 's (\"WSCK \") upcoming rate. The projected test year for this case is 2023. My testimony will incorporate the results of my 2021 evaluation of the necessity of services and reasonableness of charges from Corix Corporate Services to Corix Regulated Utilities (US), of which WSCK is a part. That study answered the following questions relative to necessity and reasonableness of those services: Necessity of Corporate Support Services 1. Are Corporate Support Services provided to CRU US comparable to services provided by other utility service companies? 2. Are Corporate Support Services beneficial to CRU US utilities and their customers? 3. Are Corporate Support Services provided duplicative or overlapping with work performed by CRU US regulated utilities themselves? 4. Do governance structure and processes exist to ensure Corporate Support Services are necessary to CRU US regulated utilities? Reaso nableness of Corporate Support Services 5. Are charges for Corporate Support Services provided to CRU US in line with charges of other utility service companies to their regulated utility affiliates ? 6. Are Corporate Support Services provided to CRU US priced at the lower of cost or market? 7. Are CRU US utilities' total customer accounts expenses, including charges directly from the Corporate Support Services organization, comparable to the costs of other utilities? 8. Are Corporate Support Services comparably priced to all CRU US regulated utilities? Regarding question 5, for the WSCK case, I will calculate and present its cost per customer for Corporate Support Services in 2021 (actual ), 2022 (budget ) and 2023 (projected) and compare them to the projected 2023 cost per customer for the comparison group of utility service companies. The comparison group escalation will be based on expected inflation rates through 2023. Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-12 Page 33 of 53Mr. Seth A. Whitney April 15 , 2022 Page 2 of 4 Baryenbruch & Company , LLC ____________________________________________________ I will also develop a comparison of total administrative and general (A&G) and customer services expenses per customer for WSCK and other Kentucky water utilities. My cost com parison for the last WSCK case is show in the table below. Data for comparison group water will be from 2020 annual reports to the Kentucky Public Service Commission (2020 is the latest data available at the time of this study ). I will present the cost for WSCK for 2020 (actual), 2021 (actual), 2022 (budget) and 2023 (projected). Also, I will present the projected 2023 cost for comparison group water companies based on expected inflation rates between 2020 and 2023. Completion Date and Cost Estimate I will produce testimony in draft form by Monday , May 16, 202 2. I estimate it will take between 80 and 90 hours to perform the cost comparison and complete my direct testimony, as shown in the table below. I am willing to undertake this study on a not-to-exceed total of $28,350. If the study does not take as much time as estimated to complete, you will only be billed for the actual costs incurred. This estimate does not include the potential work associated with rebuttal testimony, answering rate case interrogatories or cross -examination. Should that be necessary, I will perform that work at an hourly rate of $315 for 2022 and $325 for 2023. If travel is required, that will be charged at actual cost.

Witness : James Kilbane Case No. 202 2-00147 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Commission Staff's First Request for Information Commission Staff 1 -26: Describe in detail how the base period capitalization rate was determined. If different rates were used for specific expenses (i.e., payroll, clearing accounts, depreciation, etc.), indicate the rate and how it was determined. Indicate all proposed changes to the capitalization rate and how the changes were determined. Response : There are two capitalization rates used : AFUDC and capitalized time . For forecast purposes , capitalized time uses a $41.65 per labor hour rate , which is the current blended rate f or WSCK employees at the time of filing . For an explanation of capitalized time, please see the attached document referenced as \"PSC DR 1 -26 - Capitalized Time Guidelines .\" For AFUDC, please see Excel file \"PSC DR 1 -27 - 2021 AFUDC .\" Witness : James Kilbane Capitalized Time Guidelines Updated: May 2013 1 | P a g eThe purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that all employees are fully aware of the overall concept of capitalized time and to assist employees on the proper recording of capitalized time. Please contact Steve Lubertozzi, Jim Andrejko or Nicole Osbou rne with any questions or for assistance with items not specifically covered in this guide. Capitalized time refers to i nternal labor costs directly related to a capital expenditure or a capital project . The \"cost\" of your salary and benefits associated with the time you worked on a capital item is allocated to that item and becomes part of its overall cost basis. For example, if an operator earns $40,000 in salary and benefits and records 50 hours of capitalized time related to a cap ital item, the amount of capitalized time would be $961 calculated as follows: Using the above example, by capturing 50 hours of capitalized time the operator reduced our salary and benefits expense by $961 and increased our asset base by $961. These hours are typically project specific, charged to a specific capital project or asset and tracked for each employee. Capital expenditures refer to costs incurred to acquire physical assets which have a useful life that extends beyond one year. All costs incurred to bring an asset to the condition and location necessary for its intended use are capitalized. Also, costs incurred to upgrade an existing asset which extends its original estimated useful life are capitalized . Costs include contracted labor, internal direct labor (in the form of capitalized time) , materials and indirect costs. Operating expenses refer to ongoing costs incurred in the day -to-day operations of the business. Typical operating expenses are for items such as chemicals, office supplies, permits and maintenance. In addition, costs incurred to keep a capital asset in its normal operati ng condition that do not extend the useful life of the asset or increase the assets future service potential or functionality are expensed as incurred. Annual salaries and benefits $ 40,000 Total hours worked in one year \u00f7 2,080 Hourly cap time rate 19.58 Capitalized time recorded \u00d7 50 Capitalized time $ 961 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-26 - Capitalized Time Guidelines Page 1 of 6Capitalized Time Guidelines Updated: May 2013 2 | P a g e Regulatory assets primarily consist of costs related to the rate filing process, including capitalized t ime, for which we have received or expect to receive prospective rate recovery. These costs are deferred and amortized over the period of rate recovery. Deferred expenses primarily consist of repair and maintenance costs incurred in jurisdictions where these expenditures may be deferred and amortized over the period of rate recovery . Following are Frequently Asked Questions and Answers Regarding Capitalized Time Q: Can travel time be capitalized if you are working on a capital item ( e.g.: to attend a new construction meeting)? A: Yes, but only if it is directly related to the project. Professional judgment must be used when recording travel time that may be considered excessive by a regulator. Q: Do I capitalize the time spent in transit to a meeting with someone to discuss a development in addition to the time in the meeting? A: If it is to discus s general development plans with no specific build out in mind (not yet considered to be a capital project) , then no. However, if we a working with a developer who is preparing or currently working on a development or contiguous extension (considered to be a capital project) and you are working in connection with that development then, yes it should be capitalized. Q: If I replace a control panel or motor starter only, does that qualify as cap time? A: Yes. Q: Is changing out an existing meter or meter pit considered cap time? A: Yes. Q: Is the time spent designing automated answering trees and voicemail architecture for a new phone system considered cap time? A: No. Q: How many feet of replacement pipe are required before time can be capitalized? A: The cost of replacing pipe, regardless of length, is generally capitalized (including Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-26 - Capitalized Time Guidelines Page 2 of 6Capitalized Time Guidelines Updated: May 2013 3 | P a g e the cost of surface repair such as paving and landscaping) and therefore, time related to this effort can be capital ized. When pipe is replaced, it typically requires two clamps, one at each of end of the new pipe. A repair, on the other hand, would require only a single clamp. The costs of repairs are expensed as incurred and cap time would not be recorded. Q: If you spend several hours doing paperwork (POs) for a cap (such as a major main break or where you replaced a section of main), is this time also capped? A: General paperwork would not qualify as cap time, unless you are engaged in construction related activ ities (i.e., engineering, supervision, or construction) then yes. Q: Spending an hour procuring a pump for a well (whether a replacement for one that burned out, or new) - is that time capped? A: Yes. Q: Time spent purchasing tools that are considered capi tal assets (which could be a specialty pump ) - is that time capped? A: Yes. Q: Cross Connection personnel: If they spend time in the field inspecting facilities or to confirm proper equipment has been installed in order to protect our facilities from possible contamination or backflow, etc., is this time capped? A: Inspection of pre viously installed assets should not be capitalized . Q: Should time be capitalized w hen installing or replacing water meters at a service point? A: Yes. Q: Should time be capitalized when r eplacing a chemical feed mixer motor (from time purchasing, removing and replacing with a new one)? A: Yes. Q: Should time be capitalized when installing an e lder valve? A: Yes. Q: Should time be capitalized when t aking video of a sewer main to locate a tap in order to install an elder valve? Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-26 - Capitalized Time Guidelines Page 3 of 6Capitalized Time Guidelines Updated: May 2013 4 | P a g e A: Yes. Q: At a new house under construction it is necessary to video the line in order to locate the sewer tap. Can we cap this time spent, and the contractor's expense? A: Yes. Q: Taking video of a sewer line (as a follow -up from a previous sewer blockage): A: If no problems are found no time is capitalized. If w e do find a problem and have it fixed then yes. Q: An operator exchanges a meter. Is the time to input the meter exchange data into CC&B capped ? A: Yes, regardless of who inputs the data . Q: Should time related to rate cases be capitalized? A: Yes. Q: Can I capitalize time related to divestments and acquisitions? A: No. Q: Can I capitalize time spent associated while a vendor is on -site performing work related to a capital project? A: It depends. If you are supervising or inspecting the work, then yes. If the vendor is working independent, then no. Q: Should time be capitalized if I paint a tank? A: Only if it is related to a capital project. Q: Can I capitalize time related to developer agreements? A: Yes because it would be related to a construction project. Q: What if I work on a capital project but a project code hasn't been set up in JDE? A: Record this capitalized time in JDE using Pay Type 5 - Capital Suspense . Include the project name or other relevant information in the \"Member Description\" field. Q: What types of items are not capitalized? Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-26 - Capitalized Time Guidelines Page 4 of 6Capitalized Time Guidelines Updated: May 2013 5 | P a g e A: Services performed that are incidental to your work, such as general overhead costs that would have been incurred without the capital. Work not directly related to the development or construction of the project, and time related to non-capital repairs and maintenance. Examples of items that qualify for capitalization include the following, which is not an exhaustive list: Installing or replacing: 1. Water supply / wells - Actual drilling of new well, testing new wells, install new or replace drop pipe, well casing, clearing land for new well, acidizing or shocking well, fracking well and capping an abandoned well. 2.

Explain each component entering into the calculation of the rate(s). Response : Please see Excel file \"PSC DR 1 -27 - 2020 and 2019 AFUDC; \" which is the same rate for both years. For 2021 , please see Excel file \"PSC DR 1 -27 - 2021 AFUDC .\" Witness : James Kilbane Case No. 202 2-00147 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Commission Staff's First Request for Information Commission Staff 1 -28: State whether any changes have been made to the utility's i nternal accounting manuals, directives, and policies and procedures since the utility's most recent rate case. If so, provide each item that was changed and identify the changes. Response : Please see Excel file \"PSC DR 1 -27 - 2021 AFUDC \" for rocedure s in 2021 . Witness : James Kilbane ACCOUNTING POLICY - UPDATED 9/30/2021 Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) Description: The cost of debt and equity funds used to finance construction are capitalized as a cost element of property, with an offset ting credit to other income. Consistent with ASC 980-835, the inclusion of AFUDC in plant enables the fair return on, and the recovery of, capitalized costs by inclusion in rate base and depreciation, respectively. Process: AFUDC is calculated at t he end of each reporting period (e.g. monthly) based on cumulative costs accrued on capital projects that are 1) active, and 2) where all project phases occur across more than 30 days. AFUDC will be recorded for the first active period where costs are a ccrued through the resulting asset's in- service date. If invoices are paid afte r the in-service date, AFUDC is charged until the period the last invoices are paid. When a capital project is in-service and tr ansferred to Utility Pl ant In-Service, the accumulated AFUDC is included in the asset's total depreciable base and depreciated with the other c apitalized asset costs for the authorized depreciable life of the asset category. Projects that are classified as regulatory assets or deferred debits will not accrue AFUDC. If disallowance of capitalized plant by the regulator is probable, accumulated AFUDC should be written off. AFUDC Rate: The AFUDC rate used for a reporting perio d generally will reflect the authorized rate of return for the entity as set in it s most recent base rate case proceeding. There are exceptions where: 1) The regulator does not allow the accrual of AFUDC. In these cases, a 0% rate is used. 2) The rate is not authorized in a base rate case for the entity but through a separate proceeding. In these cases, t he rate authorized in the separate proceeding is used as of the effectiv e date of the authorization by the regulator. 3) For unregulated jurisdictions, consis tent with ASC 835, the AFUDC rate should only include a debt component and should not include an equity component. In these cases, the weighted cost of d ebt for Corix Regulated US (\"CRU\", formerly Utilities Inc.) as of the most recent June 30th financial Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-28 - AFUDC Policy Page 1 of 2statements is used. T he weighted cost of debt includes all long-term debt issuances and notes as well as revolving loans. 4) The regulator allows for AFUDC accrual but does not have an authorized rate of return identifie d in the entity's most recent base rate proceeding (e.g., black box settlements and operating margin-based returns). In these cases, the average of the regulat ed CRU affiliate entities that have established rates of return will be used. The affiliate average rate of return is calculated and updated every June 30th based on the most current effective affiliate rate orders.

Response : WSCK's process for construction planning is embedded in its budgeting process.

The focus of the planning is : - Public & system safety - System integrity & reliability - Cost impact to rate payers - Growth - Technology advancements & best practices After the operations team has identified projects, WSCK then begins preliminary planning and creates proposed budgets . This planning information is then built into the actual budget , and the budget review and approval process refines the planning goals and budget allocations. After the budget has been approved, the following steps occur: - Develop engineering cost estimate and schedule - Create business case and obtain approval from the internal capital project review team - Obtain final engineering & design - Project bidding phase Case No. 202 2-00147 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Commission Staff's First Request for Information - Construction phase These processes are ongoing so that WSCK can identify changing needs or priorities and incorporate them into the forecasting plan in a timely manner .

Response : EE Cost for US Medical P lans - The total premiums (EE+ER) are a function of the Per Employee Per Month (PEPM) cost of the utility's medical plan. The PEPM is based on admin istrative costs and expected claims costs, which are BCBS forecasts based on weighted claims activity from r ecent plan years. Once the PEPM is set, the employee and employer portions are determined. The percentage of the employee's share of the total premium is a management decision made with consultation from the utility's broker and plan advisor. For recruitin g and retention purposes, the utility has set the employee's percentage share of medical premiums at a rate that is competitive within the market. The employee's premium costs are also benchmarked annually against both employers in the utility industry and private sector employers within WSCK's geographic footprint to ensure that the utility's employee premiums remain competitive year over year. EE Cost for Canadian Medical Plans - The amount of Flex Credits provided to employees in each tier level is a fun ction of claims activity and administrative costs within the plan. While each employee is provided with flex credits based on their family (single, couple , or family), how they spend those credits will vary based on the medical plan they choose. The rates for each plan are established by SunLife. The employee portion of any premiums will vary based on each individual employee's elections. For example, an Case No. 202 2-00147 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Commission Staff's First Request for Information employee with a spouse (couple) who enrolls in the Elite plan (Option 4) will have a higher premium cost than a similarly situated employee enrolling in the Cost Management plan (Option 2).

Refer to the provider contracts, policies, descriptions and other materials that constitute the plan's summary plan description (SPD) for more detailed information about the benefits.

Significant costs are assumed by the Corix Group of Companies as our continuing commitment to provide a comprehensive benefits program for you. This guide provides a broad and brief overview of the various programs being offered to you and your eligible dependents. Eligibility in any given benefit plan is subject to the terms and conditions of that benefit plan. For a complete description of each benefit plan, see the applicable summary plan description (SPD) or certificate of coverage (COC). 4 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-40 - 2022 Benefits Guide Page 4 of 52ELIGIBILITY \\ You are eligible to participate in the Corix Group of Companies Benefit Programs if you are a full -time employee scheduled to work a minimum of 30 hours per week. Temporary, seasonal and agency employees are noteligible to participate. If you are eligible to participate in the Corix Group of Companies Benefit Programs, you may also enroll your legal spouse, domestic partner* (same and opposite sex) and dependent child(ren) for coverage. Please ensure you are making your elections carefully when enrolling dependents. A \"dependent child\" is the subscriber's or spouse's natural child, stepchild, foster child or legally adopted child. Children are generally considered dependents until: Age 26 Any age, if they are mentally or physically disabled, chiefly dependent on the employee for support, and not capable of self -sustaining employment Age 30 if enlisted in the military A summary of the benefits offered to you by the company are outlined in this guide. If you do not elect to enroll in coverage during the open enrollment period or when you are first eligible for benefits, you will not be allowed to enroll until the next open enrollment period unless you have a special enrollment event as defined by HIPPA (see \"Qualifying Life Events\" on the following page). *If you are enrolling a domestic partner, please contact HR as there may be additional tax implications. When Coverage Begins: If you are a new hire, you must enroll in benefits within 31 days of your initial eligibility date. Benefits begin on the first of the month following your hire date. If you fail to elect coverage under one or more of the optional plans within this time will be deemed to have voluntarily waived eligibility for coverage for the entire plan year. Once made, elections are irrevocable and remain in effect for the entire plan year unless a QLE change occurs. Enrollment in the employer paid benefits is automatic. The 401(k) Retirement Plan is effective the first of the month following one month of employment. 5 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-40 - 2022 Benefits Guide Page 5 of 52ENROLLMENT Pre-Tax vs. Post -Tax Benefit Contributions: Generally, the cost to participate in the Company's Health plans and/or reimbursement accounts is taken from your paycheck on a pre-taxbasis. This means, you do not pay Federal Income Tax, Social Security Tax, and in most cases state/local taxes on those contributions. Preventive Incentive/Routine Physical & Blood Draw: To promote a healthy lifestyle, we encourage you to receive a routine annual physical with blood draw at initial eligibility and every 3 years. Having a routine preventive physical is a step toward taking control of your health. If you choose to enroll in our medical plan and complete a routine annual physical, you will be incentivized with lower premium rates. Both medical plans cover your physical and blood draw at 100% with no copay, if you receive this service through an in -network provider. To qualify for this incentive, you and your spouse (if you choose to cover), must have a routine physical with a blood draw documented with a date of service within 60 days of your insurance becoming effective. A Routine Physical Verification Form must be completed for both you and your spouse by the physician and returned to HR within the given time frame. If the form is not returned, your premiums will increase to the non -preventive rates on the 61stday from the effective date. What is your requirement for the 2022 Plan year? If enrolled in our coverage, you and your spouse (if you choose to cover), must have a routine physical with a blood draw documented within the first 180 days of your insurance becoming effective. A Routine Physical Verification Form must be completed for both you and your spouse by the physician and returned to HR within the given time frame. Beyond 2022, you'll be asked to complete this routine physical and blood draw every 3 years.Qualifying Life Events: Your initial new hire eligibility period allows you 30 days from your date of hire to submit enrollment forms for the benefits you wish to enroll in. You can change your enrollment during the plan year only when you have a qualifying life event that significantly affects your benefit needs. Life events can include: Marriage or Divorce Birth or adoption of a child or placement of a child for adoption Death of a child or spouse Loss of or obtainment of other coverage Exhausting the maximum period of COBRA coverage An employee wanting to change elections due to a qualifying life event should contact Human Resources as soon as possible following the event, but no later than 30 days following the event. Appropriate documentation will be required to substantiate a change and must be received within 30 days of the event. Effective date for changes will be the actual date of the event. Any change reported or supporting documentation received after 30 days of the qualifying life event will not be accepted. In such an instance, the next opportunity to make a change will be during the next open enrollment period. 6 6 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-40 - 2022 Benefits Guide Page 6 of 52The Corix Group of Companies offers you the option to choose between two medical plans, administered by BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois.

COBRA continuation coverage isacontinuation ofPlan coverage when coverage would otherwise endbecause ofalife event known asa\"qualifying event\" .Specific qualifying events arelisted later inthisNotice .After aqualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must beoffered toeach person who isa\"qualified beneficiary\" .You, your spouse and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries ifcoverage under thePlan islostbecause ofthequalifying event .Under thePlan, qualified beneficiaries coverage must payforthiscoverage .Ifyou areanemployee, youwillbecome aqualified beneficiary ifyoulose your coverage under thePlan because oneofthe following qualifying events happens : Your hours ofemployment arereduced, or Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct Ifyouarethespouse ofanemployee, youwillbecome aqualified beneficiary ifyoulose your coverage under thePlan because anyofthefollowing qualifying events happen : Your spouse dies; Your spouse's hours ofemployment arereduced ; Your spouse's employment ends foranyreason other than hisorhergross misconduct ; Your spouse becomes entitled toMedicare benefits (under Part A,Part Borboth) ;or, Youbecome divorced orlegally separated from your spouse . Your dependent children willbecome qualified beneficiaries ifthey lose coverage under thePlan because anyofthe following qualifying events : Theparent/employee hours arereduced ; than hisorhergross misconduct ; Theparent/employee becomes entitled toMedicare benefits (under continuation coverage toqualified beneficiaries only after thePlan Administrator becoming toMedicare theemployer must notify the Plan Administrator ofthequalifying event . You Must Give Notice ofSome Qualifying Events Fortheother qualifying events, such asdivorce orlegal separation orthedependent child losing eligibility under the Plan, youmust notify thePlan Administrator within 60days ofthequalifying event occurring .You must provide this notice, along withanyrequested documentation toHuman Resources 36IMPORTANT NOTICES 36 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-40 - 2022 Benefits Guide Page 36 of 52How is COBRA Coverage Provided? Once the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualifying beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage. When the qualifying event is the death of the employee, the employee becoming entitled to Medicare benefits, divorce or legal separation, or a dependent child losing eligibility under the Plan, COBRA continuation coverage lasts for up to a total of 36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction in the employee's hours of employment andthe employee became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage for qualified beneficiaries other than the employee lasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. For example, if a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare 8 months before the date on which his or her employment terminates, COBRA continuation coverage for his spouse and dependent children can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement, which is equal to 28 months after the date of the qualifying event. Otherwise, when the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the employee's hours of employment, COBRA continuation coverage generally lasts for only up to a total of 18 months. There are two ways in which this 18 -month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended. Disability extension of 18 -month period of continuation coverage If you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by the Social Security Administration to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and any family members covered under the Plan may be entitled to receive up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a total maximum of 29 months. The disability must have started at some time before the 60thday of COBRA continuation coverage and must last until the end of the 18 -month period of coverage. You must provide this notice of disability, along with any requested documentation to Corix Infrastructure. Second qualifying event extension of 18 -month period of continuation coverage If your family experiences another qualifying event while receiving 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children can receive up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, provided notice of the second qualifying event is properly given to the Plan. This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children receiving continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies, becomes entitled to Medicare benefits, becomes divorced or legally separated or if the dependent child is no longer eligible as a dependent child under the Plan, but only if this second event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. Questions Questions concerning your Plan or your COBRA coverage continuation rights should be addressed to the Plan contact. For more information about your rights under ERISA, including COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and any other laws or regulations affecting group health plans, contact the nearest regional or district office of th e U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) or visit the EBSA website at www.dol.gov/ebsa . Keep the Plan Informed of Any Address Changes In order to protect your rights and the rights of your family, you should keep the Plan Administrator informed of any changes in the addresses of covered family members. You should also keep a copy for your records of any notices you send to the Plan Administrator.IMPORTANT NOTICES 37 37 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-40 - 2022 Benefits Guide Page 37 of 525Loss of Other Coverage If you are declining coverage for yourself or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance or group health plan coverage, you may be able to enroll yourself and your dependents in this plan if you or your dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stops contributing toward your or your dependents' other coverage). However, you must request enrollment within 30 days after you or your dependents' other coverage ends (or after the employer stops contributing toward the other coverage). Example: You waived coverage because you were covered under a plan offered by your spouse's employer. Your spouse terminates his/her employment. If you notify Corix Infrastructure within 30 days of the date coverage ends, you and your eligible dependents may apply for coverage under our health plan. Medicare Part D Notice of Creditable Coverage Please read this notice carefully and keep it where you can find it. This notice has information about your current prescription drug coverage with Corix Infrastructure and about your options under Medicare's prescription drug coverage. This information can help you decide whether or not you want to join a Medicare drug plan. If you are considering joining, you should compare your current coverage, including which drugs are covered at what cost, with the coverage and costs of the plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage in your area. Information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug coverage is at the end of this notice. There are two important things you need to know about your current coverage and Medicare's prescription drug coverage: Medicare prescription drug coverage became available in 2006 to everyone with Medicare. You can get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) that offers prescription drug coverage. All Medicare drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans may also offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium. Corix Infrastructure has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by the Corix Infrastructure Health and Welfare Plan is, on average for all plan participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage pays and is therefore considered Creditable Coverage. Because your existing coverage is Creditable Coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a penalty) if you later decide to join a Medicare drug plan. When Can You Join A Medicare Drug Plan? You can join a Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible for Medicare and each year from October 15th to December 7th. However, if you lose your current creditable prescription drug coverage, through no fault of your own, you will also be eligible for a two (2) month Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to join a Medicare drug plan. What Happens To Your Current Coverage If You Decide to Join A Medicare Drug Plan? If you decide to join a Medicare drug plan, your current Corix Infrastructure coverage will not be affected. For most persons covered under the Plan, the Plan will pay prescription drug benefits first, and Medicare will determine its payments second. For more information about this issue of what program pays first and what program pays second, see the Plan's summary plan description or contact Medicare at the telephone number or web address listed herein. If you do decide to join a Medicare drug plan and drop your current Corix Infrastructure coverage, be aware that you and your dependents will not be able to get this coverage back (except during certain open enrollment periods). When Will You Pay A Higher Premium (Penalty) To Join A Medicare Drug Plan? You should also know that if you drop or lose your current coverage with Corix Infrastructure and don't join a Medicare drug plan within 63 continuous days after your current coverage ends, you may pay a higher premium (a penalty) to join a Medicare drug plan later. If you go 63 continuous days or longer without creditable prescription drug coverage, your monthly premium may go up by at least 1% of the Medicare base beneficiary premium per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go nineteen months without creditable coverage, your premium may consistently be at least 19% higher than the Medicare base beneficiary premium. You may have to pay this higher premium (a penalty) as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the following November to join. For More Information About This Notice Or Your Current Prescription Drug Coverage... Contact the person listed below for further information. Note that you will receive this notice each year. You will also get it before the next period you can join a Medicare drug plan, and if this coverage through Corix Infrastructure changes. You also may request a copy of this notice at any time.IMPORTANT NOTICES 3838 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-40 - 2022 Benefits Guide Page 38 of 52For More Information About Your Options Under Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage... More detailed information about Medicare plans that offer prescription drug coverage is in the \"Medicare & You\" handbook. You'll get a copy of the handbook in the mail every year from Medicare. You may also be contacted directly by Medicare drug plans. For more information about Medicare prescription drug coverage: Visit www.medicare.gov Call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (see the inside back cover of your copy of the \"Medicare & You\" handbook for their telephone number) for personalized help Call 1 -800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1 -877-486-2048. If you have limited income and resources, extra help paying for Medicare prescription drug coverage is available. For information about this extra help, visit Social Security on the web at www.socialsecurity.gov, or call them at 1 -800-772- 1213 (TTY 1 -800-325-0778). Remember: Keep this Creditable Coverage notice. If you decide to join one of the Medicare drug plans, you may be required to provide a copy of this notice when you join to show whether or not you have maintained creditable coverage and, therefore, whether or not you are required to pay a higher premium (a penalty). Premium Assistance Under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) If you or your children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and you're eligible for health coverage from your employer, your state may have a premium assistance program that can help pay for coverage, using funds from their Medicaid or CHIP programs. If you or your children aren't eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, you won't be eligible for these premium assistance programs but you may be able to buy individual insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. For more information, visit www.healthcare.gov . If you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and you live in a State listed below, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance is available. If you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents might be eligible for either of these programs, contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office or dial 1-877-KIDS NOW or www.insurekidsnow.gov to find out how to apply. If you qualify, ask your state if it has a program that might help you pay the premiums for an employer -sponsored plan. If you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, as well as eligible under your employer plan, your employer must allow you to enroll in your employer plan if you aren't already enrolled. This is called a \"special enrollment\" opportunity, and you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined eligible for premium assistance . If you have questions about enrolling in your employer plan, contact the Department of Labor at www.askebsa.dol.gov or call 1-866-444-EBSA (3272) . If you live in one of the following states, you may be eligible for assistance paying your employer health plan premiums. The following list of states is current as of July 31,2021.

However, the attending provider (who may be a physician or nurse midwife) may decide, after consulting with the mother, to discharge the mother or newborn child earlier. The Newborns' Act, and its regulations, prohibit incentives (either positive or negative) that could encourage less than the minimum protections under the Act as described above. A mother cannot be encouraged to accept less than the minimum protections available to her under the Newborns' Act and an attending provider cannot be induced to discharge a mother or newborn earlier than 48 or 96 hours after delivery. In any case, plans and issuers may not, under Federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from the plan or the issuer for prescribing the length of stay not in excess of 48 hours or 96 hours, as the case may be.

USERRA prohibits discrimination against individuals on the basis of membership in the uniformed services with regard to any aspect of employment. Since its enactment, USERRA h as been modified and expanded by additional federal laws, such as the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2008. Maintenance of Benefits During Leave A person who is reemployed upon returning from completion of uniformed service is entitled to the rights and benefits that he or she would have attained if he or she had remained continuously employed. Health Benefits An employer must allow individuals absent due to uniformed services to elect to continue health insurance coverage for themselves and their dependents. Health insurance coverage must be continued until the earlier of: 24 months beginning on the date when the absence began; or The day after the date the employee fails to apply for return to work following completion of their service. Individuals who are absent from work for less than 31 days may not be required to pay more for coverage than the employee share charged to employees that are actively at work. Employers may charge all other individuals no more than 102 percent of the full premium under the plan. If benefits are cancelled because the employee did not elect to continue coverage or failed to pay premiums, the employer must restore to the employee benefits equivalent to those the employee would have had if leave had not been taken, including family or dependent coverage. The employee cannot be required to serve a new pre -existing condition waiting period, wait for open enrollment or pass a medical examination to obtain reinstatement of coverage.IMPORTANT NOTICES 42 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-40 - 2022 Benefits Guide Page 42 of 52Exchange Notice Beginning in 2014, there is a new way to buy health insurance: The Health Insurance Marketplace. To assist you as you evaluate options for you and your family, this notice provides some basic information about the new Marketplace. What is the Health Insurance Marketplace? The Marketplace is designed to help you find health insurance that meets your needs and fits your budget. The Marketplace offers \"one -stop shopping\" to find and compare private health insurance options. You may also be eligible for a new kind of tax credit that lowers your monthly premium right away. The 2022 open enrollment period for health insurance coverage through the Marketplace begins on Nov. 1, 2021 and will end on Dec. 15, 2021. Individuals must have enrolled or changed plans prior to Dec. 15, 2021, for coverage starting as early as Jan. 1, 2022. After Dec. 15, 2021, you can get coverage through the Marketplace for 2022 if you qualify for a special enrollment period or are applying for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Can I Save Money on my Health Insurance Premiums in the Marketplace? You may qualify to save money and lower your monthly premium, but only if your employer does not offer coverage, or offers coverage that doesn't meet certain standards. The savings on your premium that you're eligible for depends on your household income. Does Employer Health Coverage Affect Eligibility for Premium Savings through the Marketplace? Yes. If you have an offer of health coverage from your employer that meets certain standards, you will not be eligible for a tax credit through the Marketplace and may wish to enroll in your employer's health plan. However, you may be eligible for a tax credit that lowers your monthly premium or a reduction in certain cost -sharing if your employer does not offer coverage to you at all or does not offer coverage that meets certain standards. If the cost of a plan from your employer that would cover you (and not any other members of your family) is more than 9.61% of your household income for the year (9.83% for 2021), or if the coverage your employer provides does not meet the \"minimum value\" standard set by the Affordable Care Act, you may be eligible for a tax credit. (An employer - sponsored health plan meets the \"minimum value standard\" if the plan's share of the total allowed benefit costs covered by the plan is no less than 60 percent of such costs.) Note: If you purchase a health plan through the Marketplace instead of accepting health coverage offered by your employer, then you may lose the employer contribution (if any) to the employer -offered coverage. Also, this employer contribution \u2014as well as your employee contribution to employer -offered coverage \u2014is often excluded from income for federal and state income tax purposes. Your payments for coverage through the Marketplace are made on an after -tax basis. How Can I Get More Information? For more information about your coverage offered by your employer, please check your summary plan description or contact or contact your HR department. The Marketplace can help you evaluate your coverage options, including your eligibility for coverage through the Marketplace and its cost. Please visit HealthCare.gov for more information, as well as an online application for health insurance coverage and contact information for a Health Insurance Marketplace in your area. Patient Protection Notice and Selection Corix Infrastructure allows the designation of a primary care provider. You have the right to designate any primary care provider who participates in our network and who is available to accept you or your family members. For information on how to select a primary care provider, and for a list of the participating primary care providers, contact Human Resources. For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider.IMPORTANT NOTICES 43 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-40 - 2022 Benefits Guide Page 43 of 52IMPORTANT NOTICES The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) requires group health plans to apply the same treatment limits on mental health or substance -related disorder benefits as they do for medical and surgical benefits. The MHPAEA also extends this parity requirement to inpatient and outpatient services, whether in -network or out -of-network, and to emergency care services and prescription drugs. MHPAEA revised the definition of \"mental health benefits\" to include substance use disorder benefits. The MHPAEA also requires group health plans to apply the same beneficiary financial requirements to mental health or substance use disorder benefits as they apply for medical and surgical benefits, including limits on deductibles, co - payments and out -of-pocket expenses. Plan administrators are also required to make the criteria for \"medical necessity\" determinations with respect to mental health and substance use disorder benefits available to plan participants, beneficiaries or providers upon request. Marriage, Birth, or Adoption If you have a new dependent as a result of a marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, you may be able to enroll yourself and your dependents. However, you must request enrollment within 30 days after the marriage, birth, or placement for adoption. Example: When you were hired by us, you were single and chose not to elect health insurance benefits. One year later, you marry. You and your eligible dependents are entitled to enroll in this group health plan. However, you must apply within 31 days from the date of your marriage. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 -Privacy The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires health plans to maintain the privacy of your health information and to provide you with a notice of the plan's legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your health information. The notice describes how the plan may use or disclose your health information, under what circumstances it may share your health information without your authorization (generally to carry out treatment, payment, or health care operations), and your rights with respect to your health information. As required by HIPAA, Corix Infrastructure maintains the confidentiality of your health information and has policies and procedures in place to help protect it from improper use and disclosure. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) This notice is being provided to insure that you understand your right to apply for group health insurance coverage. You should read this notice even if you plan to waive coverage at this time. 44 Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-40 - 2022 Benefits Guide Page 44 of 525 45 45CONTACT INFORMATION Carrier Group Number Phone Number 800-877-7195 Aflac Accident/Critical (FSA) Assistance Program LifeWorks EAP 5954815 Benefits Health Savings Account (HSA) HSA N/A 866-472-5352 www.flexiblebenefit.com Benefits Value Advisor (BVA) Benefits Advisor N/A Sound Consulting Services Sound Consulting Services N/A Retirement and Financial Support Management Hypertension ManagementN/A 800-945-4355join.livongo.com/BCBSIL/hi hello.livongo.com/HTN Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-40 - 2022 Benefits Guide Page 45 of 52GLOSSARY OF TERMS 46Copayment The amount you pay to the provider each time you receive a service Deductible The amount of eligible expenses you must pay each year before the plan begins to pay benefits Coinsurance The portion of eligible medical expenses for which you have financial responsibility in excess of the plan's deductible.

For general definitions of common te rms, such as allowed amount , balance billing , coinsurance , copayment , deductible , or other underlined terms, see the Glossary. You can view the Glossary at www.healthcare.gov/sbc -glossary/ or call 1 -855-756-4448 to request a copy. Important Questions Answers Why This Matters: What is the overall deductible ? For In-Network : $1,500 Individual/$ 3,000 Family For Out-of-Network : $4,500 Individual/$ 12,000 Family Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the policy, the overall family deductible must be met before the plan begins to pay. Are there services covered before you meet your deductible ? Yes. Certain preventive care is covered before you meet your deductible . This plan covers some items and services even if you haven't yet met th e deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost sharing and before you meet your deductible . See a list of covered preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive -care-benefits/ . Are the re other deductibles for specific services? No. You don't have to meet deductibles for specific services . What is the out-of-pocket limit for this plan? For In-Network : $6,000 Individual/$ 12,000 Family For Out-of-Network : $12,000 Individual/$ 24,000 Family The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you have other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of- pocket limits until the overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met. What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit ? Premiums , balance -billing charg es, and health care this plan doesn't cover. Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out-of-pocket limit . Will you pay less if you use a network provider ? Yes. See www.bcbsil.com or Call 1-800-828-3116 for a list of network providers . This plan uses a provider network . You will pay less if you use a provider in the plan's network . You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network provider , and you might receive a bill from a provider for the d ifference between the provider's charge and what your plan pays ( balance billing ). Be aware, your network provider might use an out-of- network provider for some services (such as lab work). Check with your provider before you get services. Do you need a referral to see a specialist ? No. You can see the specialist you choose without a referral .

Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-41 - SunLife e-Booklet Page 56 of 110Contract No. 100125 Health Spending Account Effective January 1, 2021 (A) 51 Health Spending Account General description of the coverage The contract holder has the sole legal and financial liability for this benefit. Sun Life only acts as administrator on behalf of the contract holder. Your Health Spending Account coverage pays for services or supplies described in this section under Eligible expenses . An expense is incurred on the date the services are received or the supplies are purchased or rented. Eligible expenses incurred by a dependent are also covered. Coverage applies only to expenses incurred after the employee becomes covered under the Health Spending Account and before the date the Health Spending Account en ds. A dependent is any person for whom you may claim a medical expense tax credit on your federal tax return in the taxation year. For example, this could include members of your extended family, such as your parents, grandparents or grandchildren. Benefit year The benefit year is indicated in the Benefit Details section. How your Health Spending Account works Your Health Spending Account works like an expense account. Your employer will allocate plan credits to your account in the manner described under Plan credits . Each time you submit a Health Spending Account claim, either for yourself or for a dependent , you will be reimbursed for eligible expenses, up to the balance of your account. Expenses incurred in one benefit year cannot be covered by credits received in the following benefit year. Credits can only be used to provide reimbursement for eligible expenses. Under the Income Tax Act, the definition of eligible expenses is quite wide. These expenses are shown below. Credits cannot be cashed out and will be lost unless used. You can avoid the loss of credits by using them before the end of the benefit year following the benefit year in which they have been allocated to your Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-41 - SunLife e-Booklet Page 57 of 110Contract No. 100125 Health Spending Account Effective January 1, 2021 (A) 52 account, and before any earlier termination of this benefit or your coverage. There are a number of reasons why the Health Spending Account is tax-effective for you. Eligible expe nses are specifically limited to expenses not covered under another plan or under another benefit of this plan. If you paid for these expenses on your own, you would have to use expensive \"after -tax\" dollars. On the other hand, your Health Spending Account is sheltered from federal and provincial (except Qu\u00e9bec) income tax. In most circumstances, this means that when you use plan credits to pay for expenses, you are using less expensive \"pre - tax\" dollars. The result is extra savings for you. Continuation of coverage for dependents No plan credits will be allocated to the Health Spending Account after the employee's death. However, the remaining credits in the account on the date of the employee's death can be used to pay for expenses incurred by the depend ents during the 12 months following the employee's death. Credits Your credits are indicated in the Benefit Details section. Eligible expenses Coverage includes the following items provided they qualify as tax deductible medical expenses under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and are not payable under any other private or government plan. If the list of items qualifying as tax deductible medical expen ses under the Income Tax Act (Canada) is changed, this plan is automatically updated to reflect the changes. Drugs drugs, medications or other preparations or substances prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner or dentist. Eyeglasses eyeglasses or other devices for the treatment or correction of a patient's vision defect, as prescribed by a medical practitioner or an optometrist.

You qualify for this benefit if you provide proof of claim acceptable to Sun Life that: you became totally disabled while covered, and you have been following appropriate treatment for the disability since its onset. For your Long -Term Disability coverage, during the elimination period and the following 24 months (this period is known as the own occupation period ), you will be considered totally disabled while you are continuously unable due to an illness to do the essential duties of your own occupation, and afterwards, you will be considered totally disabled if you are continuously unable due to an illness to do any occupation for which you are or may become reasonably qualified by education, training or experience. If you must hold a government permit or licence to perform your own occupation and your permit or licence is withdrawn or not renewed solely for medical reasons, we will consider you totally disabled for up to 12 months after the end of the elimination period. You ca nnot be working other than in a Sun Life approved partial disability or rehabilitation program. Benefits are paid at the end of each month and are based on your coverage on the date you became totally disabled. If you are totally disabled for part of any month, we will pay 1/30 of the monthly benefit for each day you are totally disabled. Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-41 - SunLife e-Booklet Page 65 of 110Contract No. 101525 Long -Term Disability Effective January 1, 2021 (A) 60 When disability payments begin Your Long -Term Disability payments begin after you have been totally disabled for an uninterrupted period of 119 days or after the last day benefits are payable under any short -term disability, loss of income or other salary continuation plan, whichever is later. This period, which must be completed before disability benefits become payable, is the elimination period . If you bec ome totally disabled during a lay -off or approved leave and your coverage continues during this time, you will be eligible for benefit payments following your recall or scheduled return to full -time work with your employer. You must have been totally disab led for an uninterrupted period of 119 days and still be totally disabled on the date you are recalled or scheduled to return to full -time work with your employer. What we will pay Here is how we calculate your Long -Term Disability payments. All referenc es to income in this disability provision are to the gross amounts before any deductions. Step 1: We take the percentage of your monthly basic earnings as indicated in the Benefit Details section. The maximum is also indicated in the Benefit Details section. Step 2: We subtract any income provided to you: for the same or a subsequent disability under any government - sponsored plan, excluding dependent benefits, employment insurance benefits and automatic cost -of-living increases under any governm ent-sponsored plan that occur after benefits begin. for the same or a subsequent disability under any Workers' Compensation Act or similar law, excluding automatic cost -of- living increases that occur after benefits begin. under a motor vehicle insura nce plan which provides disability benefits to the extent that the law does not prohibit such a deduction. Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-41 - SunLife e-Booklet Page 66 of 110Contract No. 101525 Long -Term Disability Effective January 1, 2021 (A) 61 under a group plan, including any coverage resulting from your membership in an association of any kind. under a retirement or pension plan funded in whole or in part by the employer, as a result of your disability or a medical condition. under the Qu\u00e9bec Parental Insurance Plan. The result from Step 2 is the amount you will normally receive. If this amount plus the above sources of income and all the additional sources of income listed below exceeds 85% of your pre -disability basic earnings, we will reduce your Long -Term Disability payment by the excess. If your benefit is non -taxable, the maximum will be 85% of your pre -disability b asic earnings after income tax. Additional sources of income provided to you: under any Workers' Compensation Act or similar law for another disability, excluding any automatic cost -of-living increases that occur after benefits begin. under any Cr iminal Injuries Compensation Act or similar law, where allowed by law. If you are eligible for any of the income amounts above and do not apply for them, we will still consider them part of your income. We can estimate those benefits and use those amoun ts when we calculate your payments. If you receive any of the income amounts above in a lump sum, we will determine the equivalent compensation this represents on a monthly basis using generally accepted accounting principles. We will not take into account any benefits that began before your disability began. However, increases in those benefits as a result of your disability will be taken into account. We have the right to adjust your benefit payments when necessary. Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-41 - SunLife e-Booklet Page 67 of 110Contract No. 101525 Long -Term Disability Effective January 1, 2021 (A) 62 Maternity / parental leave of absence Maternity leave agreed to with your employer will begin on the date you and your employer have agreed will be the start of your leave or the date the child is born, whichever is earlier. The leave will end on the date you and your employer have agreed that you will return to active, full -time work or the actual date you return to active, full -time work, whichever is earlier. Parental leave is the period of time that you and your employer have agreed on. Sun Life will determine any portions of a maternity or parental leave which are voluntary and any portions which are health -related. The health -related portion of the leave is the period in which a woman can establish, through appropriate medical documentation, that she is unable to work for health reasons related to childbirth or recovery from childbirth. Long -Term Disability benefits will only be payable for health -related portions of the leave where necessary in order to comply with requirements such as employment standards, human rights and employment insurance, after you have been disabled for an uninterrupted period of 119 days, provided your coverage has been continued. However, if your employer has a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) plan as defined in the Employment Insuran ce regulations covering the health -related portion of the maternity or parental leave, Sun Life will not pay any benefits under this plan during any period benefits are payable to you under your employer's SUB plan. Partial disability program You may be required to participate in a partial disability program approved by Sun Life in writing. After you are eligible for Long -Term Disability payments, you may be considered for a partial disability program in which you return to your own occupation for a reduced number of hours per week. During your partial disability program, you can receive a salary from your employer for the hours worked. However, your Long -Term Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-41 - SunLife e-Booklet Page 68 of 110Contract No. 101525 Long -Term Disability Effective January 1, 2021 (A) 63 Disability payments will be reduced by the percentage of your normal work week that you a re now working for your employer. During your partial disability program your total income from all sources cannot exceed 100% of your pre -disability basic earnings, indexed for inflation (less provincial and federal income taxes if your benefit is non -taxable). If this is the case, your Long -Term Disability payments will be further reduced by the excess. Your participation in a partial disability program will be limited to the own occupation period. Rehabilitation program You may be required to participate in a rehabilitation program approved by Sun Life in writing. It may include the involvement of our rehabilitation specialist, part - time work, working in another occupation or vocational training to help you become capable of full -time employ ment. Sun Life is under no obligation to approve or continue a rehabilitation program for an employee. We will consider such factors as financial considerations and our opinion on the merits of rehabilitation. During your rehabilitation program, you may receive your Long -Term Disability payments plus income from other sources. However, if during any month your total income is more than 100% of your pre - disability basic earnings, indexed for inflation (less provincial and federal income taxes if your b enefit is non -taxable), your Long -Term Disability payments will be reduced by the excess. You should consider participating in a rehabilitation program as soon as possible after becoming totally disabled. If you enter a rehabilitation program during the elimination period, it will not be considered an interruption of the elimination period. Interrupted periods of disability during elimination period Interrupted periods of total disability due to the same or related causes occurring before the eliminati on period has been completed are treated as one period of disability and are accumulated to complete the elimination period as long as this benefit is in force and all of the following conditions are met: Case No. 2022-00160 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Staff 1-41 - SunLife e-Booklet Page 69 of 110Contract No. 101525 Long -Term Disability Effective January 1, 2021 (A) 64 the initial period of total disability lasts for at least 30 days without interruption. afterwards, there is no interruption of more than 30 days. each period of total disability is completed within 12 months after the start of the elimination period, or as approved by Sun Life in advance in cases where the elimination period is 365 days or more. The difference between your normal number of scheduled hours and the number of hours actually worked is credited towards the elimination period. If the Long -Term Disability benefit terminates, any ba lance of the elimination period must subsequently be completed by uninterrupted total disability. Interrupted periods of disability after payments begin If you had a total disability for which we paid Long -Term Disability benefits and total disability occurs again due to the same or related causes, we will consider it a continuation of your previous disability if it occurs within 6 months of the end of your previous disability. You must be covered when total disability reoccurs. These benefits will b e based on your coverage as it existed on the original date of total disability. If you recover damages from another person We have the right to part of any money you recover through legal action or settlement from another person, organization or company who caused your disability. If you decide to take legal action, you must comply with the applicable terms of the group contract concerning legal action.

Provide comparative cost information for the 12 months preceding the base period and the base period. Explain any changes in fringe benefits occurring over this 24 -month period. Response : a. The utility does not offer fringe benefits to an entire group of employees, manager s, or other category of personnel. Only one employee within the allocation receives a negotiated vehicle allowance on an individual basis : Steve Lubertozzi, who receives $5,800 (USD) per annum. While not a fringe benefit, for transparency and disc losure, Corporate Officers (members of the ELT) receive two additional types of cash compensation, as outlined in their employment agreements for use at their discretion. Those are Perquisite Pay and Supplemental Retirement: Perquisite Pay: $17,500 per a nnum to cover all other benefits and perquisites including , without limitation : car allowance, club memberships, executive health plans, RRSP contributions, financial counseling, fuel, mileage, parking, etc. Such amounts are payable over the course of the year in each pay period in equal amounts and shall be subject to any required deductions or withholdings. The employee shall be responsible for the full tax liability on this benefit, including the tax liability on the reimbursed expenses and fuel and park ing expense, and for all other liabilities arising therefrom , including the use of any car.

State whethe r any adjustments to wages, salaries, benefits, and other compensation in the rate application are consistent with the results of such comparisons. b. If comparisons were not performed, explain why such comparisons were not performed. Response : a. Please see exhibit 9.6 testimony of Quentin Watkins for a wage and benefits study, submitted confidentially with the application . See exhibit 9.1 testimony of Seth Whitney submitted with the application for a discussion of the consideration of wage and be nefit study in forecast period for salaries and wages b. WSCK performed comparisons and, therefore, this is not applicable . Witness : Quentin Watkins and Seth Whitney Case No. 202 2-00147 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Commission Staff's First Request for Information Commission Staff 1 -46: Regarding the utility's employee compensation policy: a. Provide the utility's written compensation policy as approved by the board of directors. b. Provide a narrative description of the compensation policy, including the reasons for establishing the policy and the utility's objectives for the policy. c. Explain whether the compensation policy was developed with the assistance of an outside consultant. If the compensation policy was developed or reviewed by a consultant, provide any study or report provided by the consultant. d. Explain when the utility's compensation policy was last reviewed or given consideration by the board of directors. e. Explain whether the utility's expenses for wages, salaries, benefits, and other compensation included in the base period and any adjustments to the base period, are compliant with the board o f director's compensation policy. Response : a. The utility does not have a written policy regarding compensation. The utility's consistent compensation practice/philosophy, which is executed at the board of directors' direction, is to employ a P50 or market -midpoint -based compensation strategy. b. To attract and retain top talent, Corix , and its subsidiaries and affiliates , including WSCK , must be competitive in the national, regional, and local markets. The company 's total compensation structure f or employees includes some or all the following : base pay ; variable pay ; Case No. 202 2-00147 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Commission Staff's First Request for Information and benefits including health insurance, leave, retirement, and other compensation. To remain competitive in the employment market, Corix identifies and targets the market midpoint o r median (as applicable for each position) for total compensation. Corix's variable pay programs include the Employee Incentive Plan (EIP) and the Long -Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Directors, Vice Presidents, Presidents, and Senior Vice Presidents (collec tively, \"Senior Management Employees\") are eligible for EIP. Members of the Executive Leadership Team (\"ELT\") are eligible for EIP and LTIP. Senior Management Employees of a Business Unit are eligible to earn variable pay depending on a combination of Corix's performance, their Business Unit's performance, and their personal performance. Senior Management Employees and ELT who are part of the Corpora te and Support Services functions do not have a Business Unit score. Employees are eligible to earn variable pay up to a set percentage of their base compensation. ELT employees are eligible to earn LTIP variable pay depending on Corix's performance, ove r a rolling three - year period. The LTIP averages the same Company Performance scores described above to determine a long -term score. This multi -year average score is multiplied by a target percentage of salary for the position. Variable pay is a commo n component of compensation packages because it incentivizes good performance and ties a portion of compensation to an employee's ability to achieve positive results that benefit the company's stakeholders in the near and long -term, including its customers . Variable pay is part of most companies' compensation packages in the U.S .1 1https://worldatwork.org/media/CDN/resources/surveys/2021_Incentive%20Pay%20Practices - Privately%20Held.pdf Case No. 202 2-00147 Water Service Corporation of Kentucky Response to Commission Staff's First Request for Information Specifically, long -term incentive plans such as that offered by Corix are an expected and necessary component of modern compensation plans. c. The utility's compensation strategy was not developed by an outside consultant; the compensation strategy has been reviewed and applied by consultants performing executive compensation studies as directed by the board of directors. For non -executive roles , the same compensation philosophy applies, but relies on research rather than consultant work. The utility purchases access to compensation survey data that various credible sources compile and analyze. These sources include but are not limited to: the Am erican Water Works Association (AWWA), Mercer, Willis Towers Watson, PayScale, and the Economic Research Institute. These sources are used to match the utility's positions to the market equivalents and inform the appropriate Company midpoint to which they are aligned based on the utility's market -midpoint compensation philosophy. d.
