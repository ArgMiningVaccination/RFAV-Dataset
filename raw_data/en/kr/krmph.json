Spiritual PhytoEssencing is a synthesis of certain aspects of: aromatherapy, doctrine of signatures, classical homeopathy, modern physiology, Kabbalah, philosophy, anthroposophical science, Chinese medicine, herbal medicine and folklore, depth psychology, gemstone healing and color therapy. [Dr. Berkowsky](https://www.naturalhealthscience.com/about.php) has used this synthesis to develop individualized portraits of the inner soul nature of each of the oils used in Spiritual PhytoEssencing blending. Thus far he has elaborated highly detailed portraits of 110 different oils. Since each soul is characterized by an array of archetypal patterns, soul-level healing work is best approached with a customized blend of essential oils rather than a single oil. In Spiritual PhytoEssencing, the construction of a custom essential oil blend is similar to painting a portrait. Accordingly, the custom blend development process can be characterized as \"painting a portrait in oils.\" The relative effectiveness of a custom oil blend will depend upon the degree of congruence there is between a person's inner soul image and the soul image constructed by the combination of plant souls within the blend. It is this congruence that will encourage the person's soul to absorb the soul-force generated by the plant soul combination and use it to reorient toward its divine source. Given the wherewithal, the soul's first priority is to overcome the estrangement between the self-conscious personal self and the higher self. When these aspects of soul existence are reintegrated, the latter reassumes its natural hierarchical superiority and once again contextualizes and guides the operations of daily existence. Clearly, this wholeness of being is a crucial component of mind/body wellness. Currently available SPE resources include the Synthesis Materia Medica/Spiritualis of Essential Oils and Repertory Of Essential Oils which are the required material to practice SPE. Individual Chapters from Synthesis Materia Medica / Spiritualis of Essential Oils are also available.
